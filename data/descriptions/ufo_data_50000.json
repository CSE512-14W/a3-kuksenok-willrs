It was a tiny dot of light. Any airplane I&apos;ve seen, even at the highest of elevations, never appears as a dot this small. And again, it moved way too fast to be an airplane.It appeared to the eye about the size of the satellites you can sometimes spot in the night sky out in the country. But whereas satellites make a slow track through the sky, this shot across it.It&apos;s occurred to me that it could be a shooting star, except there was no downward trajectory to it whatsoever. It was moving laterally.", "Orlando, Pine Hills DiskAs a child in the early 70&apos;s (date in report is approximate), I was playing kickball with my friends in the street in the Pine Hills area near what is now Meadowbrook Middle School.  All of a sudden, the girls started screaming and pointing at the sky.  Looking up, I observed a disk shaped UFO with two rows of blinking light panels located on the bottom and around the perimeter of the disk.  I distinctly remember that as an inner panel glowed an outer panel was illuminated and vice versa.  The panels turned on and off in a checkerboard pattern continuously and almost appeared flourescent.  I say &quot;almost&quot; because no &quot;bulb&quot; was observed, either directly or as if hidden behind an opaque or transparent cover--the entire panel glowed evenly with no observable concentration of light.  The craft traveled from south to north no more than 50-60 feet above our heads.  It moved very slowly, in complete silence, and then disappeared behind dense trees (what is now the area immediately south of North Lane in Pine Hills).  The Orlando International Airport was a SAC strategic bomber base at the time and, as an adult, I now believe that the craft was somehow connected with the base.  I have no evidence to back that supposition.  I find it interesting to note that a 1966 report and a 1976 report on this site also note glowing light panels.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I saw a dark triangle-shaped craft flying from east to west.  It was isosceles in shape, with a very acute front angle.  The craft was dark, unlit, and silent.  I saw no propulsion flames and only a slight thermal glow to its leading edge.  Still it crossed my visible horizon in under 10 seconds.  The craft appeared not overly large, on par with a small commercial jet and was flying at a relatively low altitude,  maybe 15,000 feet.  At about 2/3 of the way across my horizon, it slid over rapidly to its port side, maybe twice the width of the craft, but continued on its same course.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I am an amateur astronomer so I looked up all the time and I didn&apos;t ever remember seeing a star formation like this one over the woods across the way.  I lived on a dead end street that only had three houses on it.  The woods were the 4 acre wild backyard of a catholic high school. The objects looked like stars but were brighter than polaris, they were colored white. I thought it was strange but didn&apos;t really notice anything odd until I looked out again an hour later and they had moved.  At that time the triangle was rotated to point left. Originally the triangle pointed down, then an hour later it pointed left then an hour after that it pointed up. At first I thought they might be helicopters, but they were bright enough that I should have been able to make out the other lights on the aircraft if they were aircraft, and they had been flying too long in the same place. The star-like objects were each at least a degree apart, I&apos;m an amatuer astonomer so I can judge distance in a night sky. After two hours I noticed that the objects began to rotate faster and faster then after 15-20 seconds of fast rotation they shot off in different directions so fast that I could not follow them. This has to have been the most amazing thing I have ever seen.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

We didn&apos;t see the ISS, but my wife saw a green fireball, which was trailing red-orange sparks, and a long white tail, with green and red mixed in. She said &quot;Look&quot;. My son and granddaughter looked up in time to see the object. It was traveling from east to west. It appeared about 60-70 degrees above the southern horizon. It lasted about 3 seconds. What was interesting, was that it was long enough, for my son and granddaughter to react, and observe it.Unfortunately, I had gone inside to check on the internet, regarding the time of the ISS passage, and missed it. It was the first time the three had ever seen a fireball. The object looked like the size of a tennis ball, held at arms length, and the tail was as wide as the fireball was thick. The object eventually disappeared over our roof, as our deck is on the east side of our house. Therefore, we don&apos;t know if it continued to be  visible. However, my wife is sure it was visible for about 3 seconds, at least.

What we saw was a blinking object.  It was, by our line of site, just above the tree line, and looked much like the heavy air traffic in our area except for the fact that it did not appear to be moving.  At first, we thought it was aircraft, because your perception can be &ldquo;off&rdquo; if the aircraft are heading towards you, but our object stayed put, moving slightly to our left only once, before moving back to its original spot.  The direction, from our observation point on our porch, would be in the south west direction.I went in and got our binoculars (we don&rsquo;t have a telescope) and my daughter, and we all continued to observe the object for approximately 20 minutes.  Thru the binoculars, we saw it flashing red, blue, and clear or golden colored lights.  We all agreed that the object appeared to be round.We went inside and when we looked at the sky again, around 10 pm, it was gone.As I said, the location we live has heavy air traffic at all hours of the day and night.

The rear seemed to undulate or flow energy like a jellyfish or chinese kite flapping in the back, almost like it was a wispy celestial body and semi-transparent but still with very defined edges overall. For some reason I want to say it looked spirit like or partially organic. It was very wide from the back view as it cruised off into the distance and from the rear seemed like a long white or pearly line gliding along off into the sky heading southward towards delray beach.

I was on the phone with my girlfriend as I watched what I originally thought was a plane &ldquo;pulsate&rdquo; its front lights as it flew in the direction of the ocean. As I got closer I realized that the object was not in fact moving but hovering just over the path of the freeway. Immediately I realized that I was not looking an airplane (due to the absence of the blue and red lights normally seen on the wings of the plane) and as the objects came into view I was able to make out three distinct lights forming a perfect triangle. The entire time I was just saying, &ldquo;Oh my God, oh my God, what am I looking at?!&rdquo;  This continued for about 3 minutes until the freeway began to bend in another direction of the lights, and at this point the other two lights began to pulsate in unison. I watched this go on as I made the left bend on the freeway, and the last I could see of the lights is that they began to change colors to a deep blue.  I did not stop because I was honestly too afraid to and still am shaken up by the whole experience. Other then myself I do not know the other observers because we were all on the freeway, I do know that others did notice the lights because traffic was beginning to slow down and people next to me were pointing.

I notice a fast paced west/east light unlike my normal star gazing. As it caught my attention, it reminded me of another obeject in the sky that I had seen around 1998 or 1999. Not quite fast or brief enough to be a shooting star, the obect moved steadily at a very rapid pace. I say rapid based on judging against jumbo jets or either lower aircraft that a person usually hears to have that seemingly rate of movement. Even if it would have been low, it still would have been very fast. As I watched it from the east, observing long enough to chain of thought the above mentioned, it stopped abruptly, and stood as though it was a very bright star. From my vantage point, it looked as though it added itself to the big dipper. No more than I thought to myself, What in the hell is that, it turned bright red and appeared to go straight up into the unknown at a very rapid pace.

Yesterday&apos;s &quot;Venus,&quot; however, was unusually large, round and bright, and &quot;Mercury&quot; moved quickly in an up-and-to-the-left motion, right before I aimed my Sony DSC-F828 camera towards my &quot;planets&quot; and took several pictures, e-mailing separately:  DSC00066: At 7:39 pm &quot;Venus&quot; is bright and clear above a cloud formation that has two horn-like extensions on top.  &quot;Mercury&quot; is no longer white, it is now a yellow moving element as it moves away quickly in an up-and-to-the-left motion from its previous position above &quot;Venus.&quot;  Neither &quot;Venus&quot; nor &quot;Mercury&quot; have strobe red and bluish-white lights which would identify them as commercial aircraft, approaching FLL&apos;s international airport.

Greenwood is in Central Nova Scotia in the center of the Annapolis Valley.I had just got home from work when I saw an orange object moving in a SE direction. The object was not very high up and not travelling particularly fast---about the speed of a small plane.I was so concerned that I called CFB Greenwood to report the object thinking it may be something on fire --first time I&apos;ve ever done such a thing in my life of over 50 years. Shortly after talking with the base operator I witnessed the same object at exactly the same location making a second pass. Both times I watched the object as it disappeared into the night sky toward the ENE which took approximately 20 seconds.  Shortly thereafter my neighbor and her son, in his 20s, pulled into their driveway. I asked them if they&apos;d seen anything as they had come in the direction that the objects were travelling toward. As I was trying to explain what I&apos;d just seen, I looked upward and the same object went across the sky in the exact location a third time. (In retrospect--I think I saw three of the same object on the same path). CFB Greenwood called back and ask some questions and sent the RCMP to my house (for whatever reason??).  The three objects were seen in a span of about 12-15 minutes.The object was firey orange and seemed to shimmer a red/orange. There were no flashing lights and no sound despite the fact this was a 100% clear night with no wind. The objects seemed to be about the elevation of planes which pass over our town to land at CFB Greenwood which is about 10km away to the SW--not very high up--approx. 1000-1500feet. The objects were not lttle points of light but a significant size in the night sky.I am university educated and a former school teacher of 17 years. The object(s) I saw seemed to have a bit of a shimmering effect which at times gave the impression of a burning object yet by the third time I witnessed the object (or objects) I realized it was not flames.Just to add, I spoke with the young man (early 20&apos;s) who, with his mother, witnessed the craft on its third pass (or the third one), He has a very good friend who is a MP (member of military police) at the Greenwood air base. He informed my neighbor that the base received at least 15 calls over a forty mile path that evening. The base person I spoke with told me he had received only one call initially. In my last conversation with them that evening I was told me they had fifteen calls going on but they were not related to a UFO.What I saw was not any conventional aircraft or flying object I have ever seen.

I was on Collette Rd when I noticed the car in front of me pull to the side, get out and stare across the road. I looked to the left and saw a very large silhouette shape directly above a small lumber yard.I stopped about 100 feet behind the other car and got out as well. It was dark and the craft had no lights on it but with ambient light the silhouette was clearly visible. It was about 50 ft above the lumber yard building. Id guess it was at least 100 yards long and 30 yards high. It clearly was larger then the building and was about 250 ft. from where we stood. I watched it for about 4 to 5 minutes and it slowly started drifting silently at an angle away from us. There were a lot of stars that night and its shape clearly covered stars as it moved. We both got in our cars and drove off. The lead car went straight and I was turning left just about  300 ft ahead. I kept the thing in sight as I drove until I made the turn when I lost sight of it in the dark.I drove the 7 miles or so to get my step daughter and her friend who were the last kids at the town hall waiting at the front door to be picked up. They both ran up , got in the car excited and told me about the same craft  I had seen , that had passed directly above them.  I then realized it was drifting off in that general direction across farm lands while I ran parallel east bound.We compared stories as I had seen it from the side and she saw it from below. She described it as two large separate fuselages connected by  a wing type assembly. It made no sound  at all and had no lights.

It is important to note that the second instance was a more pronounced experience as myself and the passenger of the truck had just witnessed the first incident and were, by then, in a state of high sensory alertness but also completely dumbfounded and confused.  After the second instance, I immediately stopped and got out of the car to look into the field were the lights went and could find no trace of either object.  Please note that the color of the lights were off-white and seemed to be set farther apart then normal head lights.  As the lights passed in front of the truck they also seemed to have a tail&hellip;like a comet. Also important to note is that if these &ldquo;head lights&rdquo; had just gone by us I would have thought nothing of it and would have assumed they were normal cars despite the headlights being set slightly farther apart. It was agreed by myself and the passenger that evening and over many, many recounts of the event at later times (these recounts continuing to the present) that neither of us had ever seen anything maneuver like these lights.  We also both agree that if there would have just been one event then we would have probably discounted it&hellip;but both events happened in succession&hellip;one after the other.

At first, I thought that it was just an ordinary aircraft, but I soon took note that the flashes were *NOT* consistent with any strobe light I&apos;ve ever seen on an aircraft.The light, colored predominantly white, blinked at a rate of ~1Hz (one blink per second). The light was illuminated for ~500ms and was off for another ~500ms. The flashes were evenly spaced; never erratic.It also hung stationary in the air for approximately 35 seconds, then suddenly began to slowly move off until it was obscured by nearby trees approximately ten seconds later. While in the process of moving off, it also appeared to dim somewhat as it (apparently) receded.There was no engine noise evident - at the apparent distance it was, I would have probably heard engine noise if it had (a) conventional engine(s).Because of its flashing and movement patterns, I can safely discount astronomical bodies like planets, stars, or meteors.", "A silver shiny cigar shaped object hovering 300 ft above the ground in Paso Robles.I was driving on CA-46 when I was blinded by something in the sky.

While standing in the parking lot next to my car I looked up into the sky to see if there were any storms approaching because while I was in the store, I heard a lot of low flying airplanes. (typical being that O&apos;Hare is close by, but still out of the ordinary on a clear night). To my surprise I noticed a fire in the sky. I almost called 911 because it looked like one of the floors in the Zurich buildings were on-fire. From the distance it resembled a flickering orange fire (no other colors present). There were airplanes in the sky coming and going, and this orange flickering looked like sparks from a random flame burning in the wind. My Wife was standing right next to me also in amazement. She was rushing me to get in the car but I insisted on watching. Then in an instant the 2 lights turned about face and flew upwards and diagonal and nearly disappeared. At 22:45 I got in the car, and drove west down Golf road towards home, watching the sky as I could (being that I was the driver). As we passed Woodfield Mall, I saw the red blinking light atop the Z&uuml;rich Towers, and verified that the second tower wasn&apos;t taller. I googled the Z&uuml;rich Towers height and discovered both towers are 270ft tall. This means that what ever those lights were, they were definitely not one of the floors on fire. As I continued home and at approx. 22:50, I noticed a fast moving military jet (had a different shape than a helicopter, nearly silent, and a distinct trail behind it). This jet was flying faster than any commercial planes would appear at its height in the sky. It had a distinct shape that reminded me of a fighter plane, however it too was silent. The Jet was capable of making quick rounded  arc turns. It appeared as if the Jet was scanning the sky (in the way it was traveling). The Jet headed in a direction south of Golf Road and appeared to be in the vicinity of where the fire lights would have been. Unfortunately we turned off and continued home and lost sight of it. I do know that Scott Air force base has a Peoria branch and it&apos;s about 50 miles south of Schaumburg. If a plane were to be dispatched, it would take approximately 5 minutes at 600mph to reach This area. My Wife, had reminded me that there have been a lot of recent sightings in the area, so the first thing I thought to do was check the internet then report it here. This is the first time I have seen something like this in the sky. I&apos;ll admit I was a bit skeptic of UFOs because I have seen my share of military aircraft as a civilian.

It stood out because of how slow it was moving and very level.  The shape was sort of tear dropped but flat on the bottom. I would say it was about the size of a helicopter without a tail. The color was a mat black and I could not tell if it had any windows. It seemed to be about 100 feet above the tallest of the buildings on that block which is about 20 stories.

Aside from the strobe I could not see a craft. The strobe was regular (I saw at least 5 strobes) which allowed me to connect the dots so to speak enough so that I would gauge the craft separated from the other craft on a vector of approx. 5deg.A strobe might be used to help locate an aircraft flying at night and at high altitude for collision avoidance.I find it interesting that a satellite would be tracking due north. What makes more sense to me is that I witnessed a spy craft.

Looking up at a clear sky I notice what I initially thought was a Blinking STAR.  After a couple of seconds, it started moving.  I immediately assume it was a jet.  It had white lights, with a blinking red light in the middle.  It was at a height that you would normally see a passenger plane that was so high, all you could see was the lights at night.I was about ready to dismiss it as a plane, when it seemed to change direction. Initially it was heading in a somewhat Western direction, then it sort of headed left, but not really a left turn, simply sort of veered left. The best example I can think of is like when you were a kid playing with one of those old &quot; Etch a sketch&quot; toys. Until you got good at it, it was difficult to make turns or curves.It continues to go in different directions, left, right, then it seemed to stop for 5 seconds or so.

Every once in a while, one of the white lights seem to blink bright enough to get your attention.  Then it disappears over the trees.Possible thoughts was a satellite.  It was way too high for any helicopter or smaller Cessna type plane.  Heading in too many weird directions for a large jet plane.

This is a road I take very often, countless times at night and during the day. Out of nowhere we noticed lights above and in front of our car, I am unsure as to the width or elevation, that appeared to be two sets of lights set very far apart.  At first I thought it to be some sort of tower I had somehow never noticed before, but there no other lights present.  I turned to my friend and asked her if she saw it too, and she seemed to be just as puzzled as me.  By this point, since we were alone on a country road, I began to slow my car down considerably... since I couldn&apos;t take my eyes off it. At first we asked, is it two planes next to each other in the distance? If so, then the two planes were flying completely parallel to each other, as well as taking turns to blink.The pattern of the blinking was fantastic. There were two sets of bright blue-white lights that would alternate in a sort of pattern. The left would blink several times rapidly, then the right would do the same.There were no tail lights or anything besides these two sets. I thought perhaps, since I am a UFO believer but still skeptical of my sightings, that it was just a plane flying low. We do have an airport in Warrensburg, and we often see stealth fighters from the base nearby. Our music was playing loudly still (we were too stunned to do anything but stare) and so I turned it off completely to listen for an engine. All we could hear were crickets, not even a hum.The strangest things about the behavior of this craft, or set of lights, was that it stayed in the same position, but seemed to be gliding slowly above hwy 13. If a plane were flying that low, the distance between the lights would have changed as it flew away or towards us. It did NOT change. If it were a helicopter, we would have most certainly heard something.Stranger still, as we watched the lights blink in succession, it seemed to suddenly rotate for a split second and blinked vertically over the road. As if, if it were a plane, the plane had turned completely sideways and the wingspan became vertical. And after the quick blinking it was back to normal. It seriously happened so rapidly that I wouldn&apos;t have seen it if I had blinked at the same time.After about a minute of driving toward the UFO, we came around a bend of trees to our left. The angle of the craft was so low, but still so large, that we lost it behind the trees. I kept my eyes on it through the treeline, saw a couple of blinks, and then it disappeared. We looked for towers, planes in the distance that were blinking similarly, anything. We could not find anything after driving around the bend of trees, nothing even to use as an excuse to ease how disturbed we were.", "June 1980I spent 9 years in Lake Forest Ill and had just been re-located to California.

It was fairly low flying, maybe 100 feet in the air although it was difficult to tell because I don&apos;t know how big it was. It cleared the trees, but not by much and some of those poplars are 60 or 70 feet tall. I could see definition in the object, a kind of hood and a grill on the underside. It seemed fairly flat although it was pitching to its left so I couldn&apos;t see much of its side. The object made absolutely no sound whatsoever. I instinctively crouched down on the roof the second I saw it but I go the terrible feeling that it saw me and knew that I saw it.

It was flying at the same altitude as a small plane. It did not make any noise and was reflecting the sun, so it was a golden color. It did not resemble a plane, a balloon or a bird.

The first thing we noticed was a really bright light moving at a distance. It soon became clear ,as the light became brighter and more clearly defined that it was coming towards us. There seemed to be what appeared to be several &quot;headlights&quot; on it, from a distance. As the craft neared us we saw that what we were seeing were very bright lights placed at each corner of a triangle. There was also a red flashing light on the middle underneath side. It was flying as low as most helicopters I have seen and going at a great speed. We could clearly see the underneath side of it, there were no markings or numbers and it was silver in color. The craft was quite large and made absolutely NO noise. It was flying with the &quot;base&quot; of the triangle going forward. The craft flew directly over us and was witnessed by four adults.

I was the car behind him and I also  pulled off the road to watch the craft. I was coming home from Yuma , driving North on HWY 85. I had been watching a large light that was above the Palo Verde Nuclear plant. It was very large and very bright white.  A color white that is hard to describe.  It was over a no fly zone for at least two hours.  (I had seen this object before when I was 10 years old in Mesa Az.) I was very excited and started calling everyone I knew to ask them to take a look. Then as I got closer to town  I pulled off the road to take some pictures,not long after a semi truck had also pulled off. I was stopped  right in front of Lewis prison and started to take photos.  Just then the object started moving towards my car.  The light actually turned off, I could still see the image and my camera caught it on film.  It was a bar bell shaped ship. Then about 12-16 f-16s came from all different directions  and went straight for it. I caught this on film to.Then I saw a bright , I wanna say explosion, it was like the ship sucked in one of the planes or  crashed into it or something.  The ship got extreamly bright, and in my photos you can see what looks like smoke. Then all of the planes went off in different directions and the ship got dim then  very bright once again. Then it swayed back and forth about three times , as if to get momentum, and took off very fast directly over my car.  It made only very quite , warm sounding vibration - if that makes sense? I was on the phone with my dad at the time and my cell phone went dead. After a few seconds I got service back and just then a cop pulled up and ordered me to leave. I asked him if hed seen what happened , he replied &quot;A lot of strange things happen out here , now get lost!!&quot;.The next day on the news they reported an f-16 had crashed while doing test maneuvers  and the pilot had died. The crash  was in the same area where I had witnessed the bazaar  event.  I sent the pictures and story to a gentleman at Shadow Research . They had the pictures analyzed and declared it a ufo and declared them as authentic. I have been trying for years to get some response from the air force, police, anyone to get some answers. Of course no one had any comments and or said I was crazy. I had photos to prove what I had seen. Since then all the pictures I had have been erased or lost. My lap top was stolen shortly after this and it had all the images stored  on it. I am now going to contact the guy at Shadow Research to see if he has them saved and ask for copies. I am sure he would have saved them, I know he did a lot of research on the story.  At the time this happened I was told by the air force they knew nothing about it.  How could they say that when one of there planes crashed and a pilot died?   I was also told to LET IT GO!  So I did.", "Daylight sighting of squashed football shaped, silver object  just above tree tops in heavily traveled area.I&rsquo;d like to first say that I&rsquo;m 62 years old, and not at all prone to either lying, or confabulation. I&rsquo;ve not embellished this account in any way. This event took place at approximately 1:30 pm in the afternoon. Approximately 4 years ago I was driving  west along El Camino in Burlingame, CA. when I happened to glance off to my left, and noticed what appeared to be a large water tower perched on top of the bluff line. There&rsquo;s a long row of hills that parallels El Camino&hellip;where all the rich folks live. My curiosity was peaked. It seemed odd to me that I&rsquo;d never seen it before, and also odd that it was even there. I hadn&rsquo;t seen such a water tower since leaving the Midwest many years ago. Since I was driving, while trying to explain this to myself, I couldn&rsquo;t see it clearly. I was on my way to Albertson&rsquo;s to cash in a bunch of loose change in their coin machine. I pulled into the lot, and maneuvered myself so I could see the object/tower more closely. It was then that I realized that this &lsquo;thing&rsquo; was NOT a water tower. It was hovering just above the trees, and appeared to have just come out of a very dark, stormy, cloud front that was hanging along the ridge crest. These cloud banks are very common here as this was the last storm of the season. I was able to get a very good idea of its size/shape because it was so close to the top of the trees, and only a few blocks away. I&rsquo;d say it was anywhere between 50 feet to 75 feet in diameter. It had a dull, but reflective surface. It sort of looked like old metal. There were absolutely NO protrusions, windows, lights, or any other markings on it that I could see. It was perfectly smooth and shaped like a giant, somewhat flattened football, but with the ends distinctly rounded off. As I watched, it began moving&hellip;VERY slowly. It hugged the tree tops as it came forward, and down. It moved closer until it was only about two blocks away. It was extremely clear! There was absolutely NO fuzziness about it. There was no noise that I could hear. It continued to move down the hillside towards me, and then stopped briefly&hellip;still only a few feet above the houses. Then, it began to move to my left. Again, it was moving ever so slowly. I watched it until it went across a well traveled main road, and then disappeared behind a large business building. Now, all that being said, the most interesting thing about my sighting was that NO ONE else seem to be seeing it! NO ONE stopped to look, and it appeared that no one was even seeing it except for me!?!?  I watched the papers for days afterward to see if it had been reported by anyone else. It never showed up in the papers. Another odd aspect to my sighting is this: I&rsquo;m an avid UFO inquirer, and have been since I was a teenager, and some friends of mine once had an experience that freaked them out. This was  in McPherson, Kansas, circa 1961. So&hellip;  &hellip;why didn&rsquo;t I jump in my truck and pursue it? Here&rsquo;s what I was subjectively thinking/feeling&hellip;  That it was trying to lure me, and I felt quite apprehensive/vulnerable. I felt as though maybe this was some kind of test. I felt that I was the only one that was supposed to see it. Yes, I know this sounds odd, but it&rsquo;s the truth. Instead of chasing it, I went into the store to do my business. For the record, I&rsquo;ve only had one other close-up, interactive sighting in my life. That&rsquo;s another story!", "Very large oval shaped object ,brilliant neon white w/one red light, slowly descending quite close to my home.one very large oval shaped one red light. was a &quot;neon whitish&quot; color. Observed it slowly descending. I was walking my dog out of my garage for his last time out for the night. Stood transfixed in my driveway. Called out for my daughter in disbelief, but by the time she joined me it was out of sight. This object was extremely bright, couldn&apos;t miss  it.  I called my local police to ask if anyone else had seen this, was advised no one else saw it.  They suggested I call State Police, which I did, and the dispatcher advised me of same.  I find it hard to believe I was the only one who saw this.  I am certain there must be a very logical explanation for  this; I would actuallly welcome one.

There were some fast moving clouds overhead, but I could see stars clearly.  I looked directly overhead and noticed a light as bright and the same scale as Jupiter that was moving very slowly toward the south.  After about a minute, the object dimmed and changed direction to the east, then quickly got bright again.  It continued on toward the south and again dimmed and changed direction to the east.  I thought I saw an outline, a hard black edge, cover the stars, but just for a moment.  Then it got bright again and continued to about 2 degrees above the horizon where it faded out.At first I thought it was a meteor, but it was moving too slowly, and there was no trail.  There is an aiport nearby, but there was no sound and no flashing lights on the object.  Except for the dimming, it was a constant light.

We were traveling west on a heavily traveled, two lane highway when about four cars in front of us began to brake like and accident had occured.  When we approached the scene and slowed we noticed to the left of the highway only about 200 feet above a vacant field we saw a very long, possibly 300ft long craft, with a width of 80+ft and a height of 40-50ft. The botom of the craft had no super bright lights, however, it was illuminated.  Having lights that resembled looking at a city scape from above.  You could literlly see all of the botoom side of the craft as it maintained a staionary posistion above the field.  I could not beleive what we were seeing. There are two strange things about this sighting that I still struggle to understand today and I feel almost tormented from not knowing and the need to know.  #1 Everyone could see that this was not ordinary, yet the traffic only slowed to a crawl while people looked out their respective windows... no one stopped to investigate more intensly. #2 Although I wanted to talk about this with my mother, who was driving the vehicle, I couldn&apos;t.  Not because I didn&apos;t want to, but because I would think to myself &quot;I need to see what she thinks about this&quot;  and then when I would get near her to talk it was like it just was&apos;nt in my mind to ask.  Hard to explain how that feels.  We didn&apos;t talk openly about what we saw for almost 7yrs.  Then one day we watched a program about UFO&apos;s with my father around 2000 and my mother says, &quot;Do you remember when we saw that ufo years ago?&quot;  I did and have always.  I just don&apos;t understand why we couldn&apos;t talk about it, like a block, for years.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I was facing east north east, I have light pollution in the sky to the south east and trees to the west that determine where I watch. At 2:15 I was getting up to refresh my coffee, standing and turning south my attention was caught by a bright light through the trees at about 30* off the horizon. I knew immediately what it was, my wife and I had seen something similar in early June in the southeast, only at a much greater distance. This time I could plainly see a three lighted object that looked like a standing triangle. The lights were blinking/trading places, and were amber/white and red. It was swinging like a pendulum and played hide and seek behind the trees. I ran in to get a witness, my 13 year old was my choice for his good eyes. After sufficiently freaking him out he went back to bed and I jumped in the car to go get a better look. It seems as if it knew I was watching,  as I was driving down CR 124 it was moving away from me at a great speed. When I stopped at the top of a large hill it was of to the west and much farther away. Continuing to watch all I could think was &ldquo;what are they doing, surveying, taking inventory?&rdquo; One minute it would swing north and south the next it would shoot straight up only to settle down to where it was. By 3:00 it was very far away to the west or much dimmer. I wrote it off in June thinking it was a star and temperature  inversion, but now I have no doubt what it was, and my jaw is still on the floor.", "Lights forming a unknown shape with four beamsThe lights were forming a unknown figure. We have followed the light to see what it was but when we kept following it, it just kept moving. Also when we were going back home it followed us, but at first we thought it was just light until it started following us all the way home. It has been here all night it seems like it wants something. It is hard to see though because the clouds are moving from our sight making it hard to see it.", "Amber light over BWCA makes 45+ degree turnWe were stargazing while camping in Superior National Forest in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area, calling out the shooting stars we could spot and the probable satellites crossing the magnificently clear, star-infested sky (we live in the light-polluted city), when we both spotted what seemed to be a very high-altitude and fast-moving amber light traveling north-to-south.  It was likely just somewhere over the border in Canada when we first spotted it.  After four or five seconds of tracking it and confirming with each other that we both saw the same thing, the amber light, to our utter shock, turned 45 to 50 degrees to the west and disappeared.  The arc its turn made was solid and geometrically clean.  Its luminosity lay somewhere between that of the brightest stars in the sky and the dimmest.To tell the truth, I&apos;m still trying to process what we saw.", "daylight sighting disk was metal and moved away in a different direction very fast2 I was sitting outside on deck getting some sun as I looked up I SAW a saucer metallic disk below cloud level I rushed into the house and got my 27 year old son he came out and we both watched it as it moved across the sky in a straight line  suddenly it stopped  then took off  in another direction very fast and was gone", "Spherical black UFO over StocktonWell I was outside of work, outside the security gate, when I saw what I thought was a blackish purple mylar spinning balloon. I would say it was perhaps 500-1000 feet off the ground, but its hard to say, because, well I know this sounds weird, but its shape was hard to make out the closer it got. It looked spherical, and was scintillating, and curiously, the air around it seemed to shimmer - it was hard to see its edge, that&apos;s the only way I can describe it. It moved silently from my left, and I was thinking to myself that if it stopped it would have be a UFO. And then, as if it heard my thought, it stopped directly in front of me! I just stared at it, and I had the most curious feeling of being watched, hard to describe, just felt as if it realized I was looking - so I waved at it.  It then started to slowly go up into the sky. As it was going up, its color seemed to change to a whitish metallic, almost like sodium. And then, it began to flash. A bright, neon green, then pink, and yellow. It also - sounds weird again - seemed to phase in and out of the air. It would seem to disappear, then I would see one of the flashes, and it would appear again at some distance and disappear. This continued until it was a tiny speck in the sky and then I couldn&apos;t see it anymore.Interesting day.If you can help me identify what I saw, or let me know if other people have seen similar craft, I would be very appreciative.Thank you for your time.", "Strange object seen in Saylorsburg, PA skies.When I arrived home from work today, my eleven year old daughter said that she saw a satellite in the sky at about 5pm.

She looked out and saw what she described as a satellite looking object slowly moving from south to north.  She said the object was black and white and traveled just above the tree line.  She did not notice any lights.She drew me a picture of what she saw.  It was a round orb in the center with two rectangular panels connected to each side.

What I saw was 2 lights that had the appearance of satellites in the sky, in a second or two after seeing them we noticed the third light appear forming a large triangle. These lights were moving in unison with each other and were moving slowly to the southeast, I ran inside and woke up my girlfriend and had her come out to see them as well. When we came out the object was still in the sky, but started moving more in a southern direction. Within a minute or two the object did another series of slow turns, first east and then again in a southbound trajectory, flying away from us. Then the lights went out, first the front, then rear left, and finally rear right.The object itself could not have been made out without the lights. It made no sound. It seemed to be flying very high, and the lights appeared as satellites do in the night sky. One could have even mistaken them for stars at a glance. The three light seemed to be fixed in that pattern the single light forward and the others in back relative to the direction it was traveling. There was only deviation in the pattern when the object changed direction, giving the appearance of &quot;banking&quot;.The distance between the front and back lights was around 4 inches at arms length, and the rear lights were spaced approximately 2 inches at arms length.We live on a flight path where C-130&apos;s do their final approach for landing.

The time was between 9pm and 10pm. I saw three round white lights in the sky.  They were spaced evenly apart in the shape of an equilateral triangle.  They were not moving.  They were not very high above the treeline.  If they were connected to a craft, I could not see that craft.  All I saw were the round white lights.  They were not pulsating, just a steady bright glow. After about a minute, those lights just disappeared.

No directional lights (green and red lights) or any blinking lights, which all plans have. There would be no reason for a plane to have landing lights on that high. Then halfway through the sighting we witnessed another smaller craft, less brighter, also no blinking lights traveling in near proximity of the first craft, then traveling faster and began to accend higher than the first craft. First we thought an air force fighter and an arieal refueling tanker, but fighters usually travel in pairs and after refueling, the fighter would decend, not accend higher than the tanker. Also one of those friends saw the same thing, the next day, around same time, this time traveling north to south, also with three other witnesses.", "Sequential bright lights w/ yellow tint and red outline, prior to them a tiny blinking single red light.

We stayed out following the flashing light, moving slowly for about 10 minutes then the bright lights appeared again.  Could not tell if what shape of object they were on, it would appear to be round because of the way they flowed.  The following description is what was seen two (2) times, was there about 10 second duration done and happened again in about 10 minutes.

I  ran to see what he was talking about and sure enough there was some unknown craft above us. It was up pretty high up and dark outside so we couldn&apos;t tell what shape it was but, it was glowing orange as if it was on fire. The glow was almost as if it was pulsing but not going completely out. When I saw it, it was hovering in one location and appeared to not be moving at all. About 30 seconds after I first saw it it started to accelerate fairly quickly to the east. It traveled not to far and just disappeared. I went to my neighbors house as they saw it much longer. They said it was coming from the north and was glowing a bluish color and as it got closer they saw what looked like sparks coming off of it. My neighbor said she was sure a plane was gone drop out of the sky. As it got closer the glow changed from blueish to a fiery orange. And then the craft stopped above them. That&apos;s when I got the call and rushed outside. I have no idea what it was but the orange glow could not have been a normal aircraft. Possibly a military jet with afterburners on flying straight up could explain why it was stationary at first and appeared to accelerate so fast.

This is when things got odd.  This second object slowed down almost to a crawl (still moving smoothly like a shooting star).  Never coming to a complete stop, it turned hard right, accelerated, and made a circle, spiraling inside the circle towards its center before disappearing.Do &apos;shooting stars&apos; do loops??  Seconds afterwards, as I was attempting to begin to describe what I saw to my wife, two USAF fighter jets flew in a path that took them directly over my neighborhood, and  at a much lower flight level than I&apos;ve ever seen out here.FYI I am on the far northern end of the valley.  To my East is Nellis AFB.  To my NW is the bombing range.  However these planes sure must have been in a hurry to have been flying so low.Afterwards, there was one more green colored &quot;normal&quot; shooting star which my wife did see, and a strange plane which was also flying fairly low but without sound.

My parents were vacationing in St. Pete, Florida on Sept. 28th, 2008, and were driving on US-19 at around 9 P.M. when they noticed the clear outline of a large, dark, diamond-shaped object that seemed to be hovering three-fourths of a mile to the side of the roadway. The diamond-shaped outline could be observed as it blotted out the stars and all other light from behind it, and even more noticeable: a row of brightly-lit windows stretched down the length of the object. They described the object as large as a house, but probably even larger, due to its distance from them.My parents had slowed down considerably to observe the object, and they described the object as &ldquo;hovering&rdquo;, because not only did it appear to be totally motionless in relation to their speed, but it also appeared totally motionless in relation to other low-altitude planes and aircraft, which were moving normally even while the object receded behind them as they drove on. They also described the object as being well above the horizon and high in the sky, not apart of or constituting any kind of ground structure, such as a building or power lines.My parents actually turned around at the next available opportunity, some five or ten minutes later, and drove past the area where they had seen the object, but could not find any trace of it; instead, they did observe three helicopters flying in unison and passing in the direction they had seen the object.Traffic was somewhat heavy at this time, and my parents were wondering if anyone else had observed this object and had reported in.

The entire shape was colored bright orange.  We saw this for perhaps five to ten seconds, at which it appeared to turn right, and in so doing, it revealed a circular view, which glowed a bright whitish-yellow, perhaps magnesium flare type disc, and quickly went out of vision.  This was an awesome experience and is as clear in my mind today as it was then.This occurrence was widely reported in Eastern Washington, all the way to Montana.  The approach of this vehicle was so close, that the occupants of the airport control tower, located at Geiger Field at that time, were concerned for their safety.  The object was, to my recollection, clocked in Montana at 18,000 MPH.  I cannot recall hearing any substantiative follow ups on this event, though I am sure that the U.S. Air Force had nothing that could clock 18,000 MPH.  I was 19 years old at the time of the sighting, and 77 years old at this writing.To follow up, I had The Spokesman-Review, our local newspaper, search their archives from July 1950 to 1952.  Several reports were found, but one, dated July 3, 1950, was right on with my experience, except that this sighting was at night and ours was in the early afternoon.  I cannot tell you if our sighting was before or after the reported evening sighting.  It appears, by virtue of the 12-hour lapse, to have been two separate events.  Incidentally, the distance fro Spokane to Missoula, Montana is such that &quot;only a few seconds later,&quot; (the viewing lag between spotting the UFO in Spokane and Missoula) would be about 14.5 seconds at 20,000 MPH, which is not far off from my recollection of 18,000 MPH.I am submitting via email the supporting article from The Spokesman-Review.", "One night I saw a triangular craft with three lights.My name is ((deleted)) I&rsquo;m nine years old.

At about 1:30 a.m i was looking out my window in the north east direction, and I noticed a really bright star in the sky.  It was white and red , flashing , and there seemed to be like a spotlight coming down from it.  The sky around it also seemed to be illuminated.   I thought maybe its a planet but it was moving way too fast.  It would move left to right, up and down and it would get brighter and dimmer at times.  A commercial plane went by at one point and the light just faded into the sky.  It blended in with the other stars, that&apos;s how far away it appeared.   Then about 2 minutes later it was back, and this time there was another light in the distance.  For the next 3.5 hours these 2 lights moved around the sky in speeds that were out of this world.

For the most part I have kept this information to myself.I was home on leave from the Navy in February 1966.  I had just left my girlfriends house at about 0100 hours in the morning.Driving east on state route 224  where I connected to state route 44  going northbound through the small town of Randolph, Ohio.  This is a rural area and I was the only vehicle on the road at that time of the morning.  There was snow on the roadway and ground which my headlights lit up in front of my vehicle.All of a sudden in the black night sky I observed this egg shaped object through my windshield.  It came out of the night sky from the east.  It was the most amazing thing I have ever witnessed.  This UFO came into view with the speed that nothing on earth could match.  As it came into view it stopped just as fast in mid air right over the road I was traveling on.  Seemed as if it had spotted me and stopped to take a look.  It was only stationary for what seem like five/ten seconds.  Then, with the same blazing speed from a standing stop it took off toward the west and was gone in a split second.This egg shaped object was out in front of me and was just above the tree top level.  I would estimate it was down range from me about a mile.I observed the UFO was the color of a red hot poker with the yellow, almost white hot color, being in the center.  The blue color being on the outer areas with the red and green colors being closer to the center.  Now here is the odd thing.  This UFO had two other smaller ROUND objects following it and they were the same color.  It appeared as if the smaller objects might have been attached. The smaller objects were approximately at a 45 degree angle to the rear of the larger UFO.  The smaller narrower part of the egg shape was the rear of this UFO which, of course pointed east.I was not drinking nor do I drink.  I finished my enlistment in the Navy.  Upon returning home I went to college obtaining my Masters Degree in Education an I&apos;m a retired police officer after twenty plus years of service.I know what I saw that night many years ago was REAL.

It wasn&apos;t anything scary that would spook anyone looking up at the night sky, but it was definatly not normal.  As I was studying for my ccna exam early this morning (my test was today btw.. and I failed in case you want to know...)I decided to take a break and smoke a cigarette outside.  I work nights so I do this all the time.When I go outside, I usually love to look up at the night sky.  Especially during this time of the year when the nights are cool and the skys are clear.  It allows for very clear viewing of the night sky and all it&apos;s glory.  Sometimes I can make out clusters of millions of stars if the night is clear enough.  Needless to say I enjoy looking up at the wonders of the universe.While smoking a cigarette last night, I observed an object shoot across the sky from left to right.  I was facing North as it moved across the sky. I&apos;ve witnessed shooting stars as they attempt to enter the atmosphere and burn up.  I&apos;ve also witnessed comets and what they look like before (not in person, but I&apos;ve watched enough National Geographic to know what it should look like).  The thing that got me eerie about this experience was the way this light traveled across the sky.  If it was a piece of rock burning up in our atmosphere, it would have traveled much faster across the sky and been in a straight line.This light that I saw was VERY VERY distant.  In fact, if it were standing still, I would have said it was probably a star or a planet.  As it was traveling across the night sky last night, it did something that from everything I know about physics, should be impossible.  This light traveled across and made a sharp and immediate change in course perpendicular to the initial line that it was traveling when I first spotted it.  Then it made another perpendicular turn to keep going in the direction it was headed when I first spotted it.  What scared me the most was the way it shifted the direction of travel.  I&apos;m pretty sure this light that I saw was not anything in our atmosphere, and because of the faintness of the light, I think this was out in space. I have drawn a quick diagram using just hyphens and pipes to show the trajectory of the object.  Again.. what scared me the most was how this light went from going in one direction to a perpendicular direction IMMEDIATELY. This object did NOT leave a trail This object did not have any aura around it The object did not emit any other colored lights, didn&apos;t change color In fact, like I said earlier.. had it been still, I probably would have thought it was just another star or planet.------| | | |--------((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

The object looked similar to the body of a 747 without the tail or wings. However, it was the size of the object that caught my attention.Living near the Burbank Airport, I see many planes from varying distances. For the distance this object seemed to be, it was much larger than a 747, about 80% longer and 40% wider, again with no wings or tail. The object was very shiny &amp; metallic in comparison to typical aircraft. It appeared to be cylindrical due to the shadow and shading that implied a curvature of a cigar-shape.I watched it fly horizontally into light clouds. At this time, I had slowed down to watch the object pass and waited for it to exit through the clouds, which were sparse. I did not see it emerge. Given the time I saw it traveling, the object would have appeared relatively quickly from the cloud.As I was driving northbound and the object was ahead of me at about 1 o&apos;clock, I had time to check the cloud as I approached and passed it.

Every once in a while it would brighten and dim, then flash red. We watched this &ldquo;star&rdquo; for about 45 minutes to an hour. Most of the time it would stay still, but about every couple of minutes it would move in different ways. Sometimes it would slowly move up in the sky. Sometimes it would slowly move down.

Not one white cloud but seemingly the whole area of sky seemed covered in one white cloud, perhaps with some slight spaces in it but it was like one big cloud.

But immediately after thinking that, and before I left the window, a bright white, round light caught my eye.  At first I thought it was a firefly, but the light was too large, bright and distinct.  It was just slightly above my eye level, and being that I was on the second floor the light was up near the top of the maple tree that grows in front of the house next door to me (on the east side).

In actuality I have shared my experiences with family members and friends for years, but not until recently did I think that anything that I had to share would be relevant or of any importance or interest to an official UFO investigative or reporting agency.In recent months there have been several televised reports: UFO Hunters, UFO Files, etc. on television that I have watched that have convinced me to pass on some information that may help.  I am not writing for any recognition or monetary gain.  However, I am willing to take any type of lie detector test, medical test that you or someone else may want me to submit to, in order to verify any information I am sharing with you now or in the future.1.) I have been in the medical laboratory field just short of 20 years, so you will be able to appreciate my confusion while I was watching a report on cattle mutilations when a prominent doctor (omitted name per your instruction) said, &quot;I am not aware of that many similarities between bovine blood and human blood.&quot;  Either this is a doctor I would never want to go to or he was telling a boldfaced lie.In the laboratory there are several types of automated pieces of equipment to analyze everything from thyroid function to bacterial infections and STD&rsquo;s.  All of these machines need to be calibrated with positive and negative controls, nearly ALL of which are made out of bovine blood, BECAUSE IT IS SO SIMILAR TO HUMAN BLOOD.While working for one of the top DNA and GENETICS companies in the US, nearly all of our research incorporated the use of bovine blood, because of the similarities.2.)  During one of my dad&rsquo;s encounters with, for lack of better words, the aliens, he asked them why they were here.  The answer he received was that they are here to harvest our planet&rsquo;s abundant resource of bdellium and its anti-gravitional properties.  Do I know anything about bdellium?  I haven&rsquo;t got a clue!  But that is the answer my dad got.He was also convinced that their being here was not a good thing for mankind.  He said they had cloaking abilities and that they could be standing right next to you, and you would never know.I had a first hand experience when I was in the backyard playing catch with a friend of mine.  We both saw a bird in mid flight hit what seemed like an invisible wall, make a loud thumping sound, and then it fell dead to the ground.3.)  From watching one of the episodes of UFO Hunter, they had two men who tested with unusually high ck levels.  If you have any more information on that, I would appreciate receiving it.  I am currently on full disability.  I have had cancer four times and am now struggling with a rare endocrine disease, similar to Addison&rsquo;s, but I am not responding well to treatment.At some point in my youth I received a straight incision on my backside that I have memories of receiving while surrounded by many &ldquo;beings&rdquo;.  My dad was there.  My mother was not and when I have asked her questions regarding what it is and why I have it, she has no recollection of me ever having an injury there.At the very least, my body seems unusually prone to sickness.I have had several encounters over the years, starting with seeing something in the park on my 8th birthday.  My brothers and I saw a glowing ball of light hovering in front of the screen door while my parents were in Pittsburgh. My older brother was watching us and we were terrified.  All clocks in the house stopped.We moved from Pa. to Ohio, and things continued.  My mom and I were out taking a summer drive and just talking when we saw something flying over us.  It went very fast and kept making abrupt changes in direction.  We looked for a road to turn around on and when we turned into a drive to do that we were stopped by what looked like military guards that ordered us to stop and get out of there.  My mom explained that was exactly what she had intended to do anyway.As recently as this year I watched a very large whatever go over the house here in Tx.  It wasn&apos;t like you could see it.  It blocked out things as it went overhead.  It was totally dark and totally quiet.There are many more encounters that I could share, but it is not these little incidents that matter.  What I felt I needed to share was the info on the bdellium and the bovine blood.  If it helps, I am glad.  Do I believe we are being visited? Yes.  Do I believe we should trust them?

When I merged onto the 60 highway west the lights became visible again. At this point I could tell the lights were not connected to one object because the shape changed into a wide &ldquo;V&rdquo;. At this time I heard and saw two helicopters approaching. The lights were directly in front of me, one helicopter was headed from the south and stayed south of the lights. Another helicopter stayed north of the lights, so the lights were almost in the middle of two helicopters. I arrived at my destination on Power rd just north of the 60 and exited my car at this point only three bright lights remained and were not in any formation.

Thanks", "At approximately 15:15 on Saturday September 27th 2008, I was wading on the shore of Jacksonville Beach in about 5 feet of water observing a peculiar object in the Eastern sky.  This object seemed to maintain its position due East and was flashing.  This rate of flash seemed to follow an erratic pattern in terms of time.  I observed this object for about 10 minutes and it seemed to vanish behind the lowest layer of clouds and reappeared during this 10 min. duration and then again vanished with no return.The remarkable aspects of this object were that it seemed to maintain its position and the major characteristic was that it was mostly made up of light which was visible in the afternoon sunlight.  In other words, this object hovered too long for it to be an airplane and too high to be a helicopter and noticed its light emissions in the bright sunlight.  When I turned away 180 degrees for a brief moment (for about 45 seconds after 5 minutes into my observation) and then turned back 180 degrees and looked back at the approximate direction of this object, it was visible in the exact spot of my last view.I am unsure of the altitude of this object because I do not know the size. My opinion is that this object was quite large and that it was much higher in altitude than say an airplane flying at about 15,000 skipping in and out of the view against the lower layer of clouds.  I am unsure of the color and shape of this object but I can describe it by stating that it resembled a drop of mercury.There were other bathers present; however, I am unaware if these bathers noticed this anomaly.  There was a seagull flying in the distance and I did not remember seeing any planes in the air.

The lights were still there except they were now almost directly over our heads. I pointed up at them but he still said he couldn&apos;t see them. At this point the silence, speed and odd lighting really had my attention. If it ended here I could have dismissed it as an airplane, or whatever and not have given it another thought. As I watched it fly rapidly, relative to the stars in the background, almost directly overhead, it rotated. Rotated quickly so the two previously trailing lights were now leading. That sent chills through my spine. No airplane does that.

Part of the island was used for fighter jet target practice, a firing range for aircrafts. Roosevelt base in the town of Ceiba was one of the largest navy installations of the US. This was the place where the government decided to continue their most important and top secret projects from area 51. Here at Ceiba is where the largest and most secretive aircraft carriers and submarines were based.  Know in order for the government, to continue working these projects and kept secret.These would be conducted from one of the aircraft carriers, at about 10 to 15 miles out to sea. This is how they would keep all the information from top secret UFO and other highly secret projects away from the press and anyone interested on the government activities.  This lasted for about 10 years before the citizens of Puerto Rico and Vieques realized that something was really going on, other than the actual military training that the government was allowed to conduct according to the agreement for using the island of Vieques for training.  A large number of fishermen began reporting sighting out at sea and around an aircraft carrier.  When more of the press began to look into the matter, the government also began to cover most of what was going on, specially the sightings or anything that was related to the UFO phenomenon.Many reports where made at the base in Ceiba but nothing was ever mention or little was done to investigate. After a while a conflict between the local residents of Vieques and the military began to escalate.  No one really understand how this all began.  Some say the government posing as local residents started instigating in order to create a situation where the public would be held responsible for misinforming the press about what ever the government was actually doing on the island of Vieques and out at sea.

Myself and a friend named Jimmy were hiking in the mountains around Big Sur all day and were tired and wanting a place to stay for the night. We stopped at one of the only motels along the road called Lucia in an area which was otherwise quite wild, and asked for a room but for various reasons were not able to stay there so began hiking south on highway 1 to the nearest campground. It was dark and we were very tired but there were no cars and we were walking so we had no choice but to continue. We left the motel (there was a gas station there too) and when we got far enough away from there that there were no more lights visible from the road we had the ocean to our right and the mountains coming right off the road to the left. We noted that any plane or ship passing the area could be heard more clearly as it echoed off the mountains. As we walked we looked out over the ocean and noted a silent triangular amber glowing craft hoovering above the ocean and casting a very large circle of light that appeared like a search light of some sort. We immediately realized that it was not from Earth. As we watched it began a lateral ascent, parallel with the shore and it dropped something amber glowing into the ocean. At that point it began leaving a phosphorescent trail of light resembling a jet stream behind it and then a few seconds later it dropped another glowing object into the ocean and continued to move slowly upward in a linear rise while still trailing the phosphorescent light. It was moving slowly and appeared to be about 1/2-1 mile out on the ocean.  Abruptly, it turned left and shot into space. My friend through up his arms and yelled &ldquo;Wait! Take me with you!&rdquo; at which point from a tiny yellow star in the night sky it sent back two phosphorescent beams of light that started out as superimposed triangles which came straight at us where we were standing and eventually stop! ped as a formation hoovering over the water near shore and reflecting in the ocean below us. We both agreed that the formation resembled a vertebrae if you were looking down a spinal cord. It had a black hole in the middle of it and 3 spines coming off of it like a vertebrae. That light stayed in the air for about 10 min. before disappating. The jetstreams were there even longer. We were entirely energized by the experience which has forever changed my view of the world. I had reported the incident to the local paper in Santa Cruz, California the day after it happened to see if anyone else had reported such a siting and it was published in the paper which I didn&apos;t realize until I was sitting several days later on the beach covered with poison oak from the hike we did there and I was approached by a guy on the beach who asked me where I got the  poison oak. I told him Big Sur and he told me about the article. He said he had lived at he campground where we slept that night and that there were all sorts of strange lights coming from behind the mountains there but when they would try to approach them, they would meet with force fields that would make it impossible for them to get closer. He felt certain also that there were very strange things going on there and wasn&apos;t surprised to hear our story. I have this incident documented in a journal which is why the dates are so clear but the memory is as clear as though I saw it a minute ago. I have never heard of another encounter like this one. It definitely felt as though they knew we were there and that the light show at the end was for us. It was utterly spectacular. With all recent crop circles coming around the world, I have become very interested in becoming a part of the movement to understand and/or communicate with whatever is doing this. I feel that they are studying us like we study animal life on our own planet. We are primitive to them and they are being careful not to come on too strong, just giving us beautiful crop art and occasional sitings of their otherwise invisible craft. I heard recently that we have learned how to make things invisible and that this was learned through alien technology. I want to know more about this. How involved are you with the crop circle phenomena as it relates to the UFO sitings? Is there any way I can help with this? Please contact me.

It was late and I was supposed to be asleep but I was kind of playing around in the dark. My little sister was in the bed with me but she was sleep.Well, I heard a sound outside that sounded like humming machinery. Even thought it was like a gentle hum it was very loud. This is why I noticed it. At first I thought it was a car waiting for someone outside. Especially because it seemed to sound pull a little like a running engine. But it suddenly occured to me that a car doesn&apos;t sound like that because its too loud. But what was wierd was that it was quiet but loud at the same time. QUIET AND LOUD. Get it?????  I looked out the window and it was a flying saucer floating in the air outside and to the right of my grandmothers house, over the street and partially the sidewalk, but lower than my second floor window. It may have been the same height or a little higher but because it was a lil maybe abiout twenty feet away and I was seven years old, my proportion of height is slightly distorted.Here&apos;s the Gods Honest truth: This thing was a silver, disc shaped, center was slightly raised and rounded, red, blue and yellow lights around it that seemed to throb with the throbbing hum. I immediately ran into my aunt who was on the phone in the room next to me with the light on. She told me to get outta here and go to bed.I went back to the window and the thing was crazy because it looked just like first encounters of the third kind, but it was very small to fit on my street. Something telepathically asked me if I was alone, and I telepathically answered NO, I began to look around because I was really astounded that no one was looking out of their windows. Remember the saucer was making an extremely loud throbbing hum sound that sort of radiated from it......BUT THE SOUND WAS QUIET! Does that make sense? I know it doesn&apos;t, but I have no way else to describe it. I remember trying to telepathically ask it why it was little and if there was others around,and why couldn&apos;t any one here it? I was only seven, and I had no idea about telepathy- When I say I was telepathically asking it - I mean these were the questions that came into my head at once but I knew somehow that it could hear me- Especially since IT ACTUALLY ASKED ME IF I WAS ALONE...I will never forget that as long as I live. I maybe told one or two people in my life . I know how ridiculous it sounds but it was very real.

Myself and 3 others continued to watch this star-like object move for as long as we could lay out there. I believe it&rsquo;s still there, and it is now 12:35 AM. I doesn&rsquo;t really change its quadrant of the sky, it just moves rapidly, in hooks, and side to side motions, gradually, then faster, then slower again as it ends its maneuver. It appears to just look like a star, but due to its obvious, rapid, in-human like movements, it is clearly not. I also saw a very dim star move towards it, then dissapear as it came next to it.

It appeared to fly under the plane at approximately two to three hundred feet. The skin of the object had a shiny brushed aluminum appearance, almost like a new un-painted airplane except it had no wings or port holes of any kind.

If you have ever seen the movie Deep Impact, it looked similar to the comet that entered the atmosphere but much smaller. No sound could be heard associated with the fireball. The fireball traveled north towards Cincinnati at a fairly slow speed above the river. I thought a plane might be on fire. As the fireball got fairly close to Cincinnati, it stopped and turned into a horizontal line of 5 lights. Another light appeared below. (I am using stars to show the positions.) *   *   *   *   * * After a minute or so, the lights blinked out. Had it not been for the fireball that preceeded the lights, I would have thought the lights were fireworks. A single light appeared several times again around the Cincinnati area. Those lights may have been planes, I don&apos;t know.", "Red and Blue flickering objectThe sighting that took placed looked almost like a star.  Every time this &quot;star&quot; would flicker, you could see colors of red and blue.  The red color flickered at the top and towards the left, with the blue doing the exact same but on the lower right side.  I didn&apos;t give it much notice at first, being close to an airport and all, I thought it was just an aircraft.  I started staring at this object in the sky, and it didn&apos;t move. Sometimes, the flickering and the colors weren&apos;t as bright as when I first saw it, but I figured the clouds and it being an overcast night had something to do with it.", "Star like light that flew off into space then became no longer visibleIt was above the moon a small light that flew into space.

It glowed orange with a slight flicker.  Then it went out and another one appeared to the left of it. Then another one appeared so there were two.  Both of them went out and one more appeared to the left of those. That one went out and another one appeared. Each of them only lasted maybe five to seven seconds before going out.

The two lights were at such an altitude that no shape of the UFO&apos;s could be determined by our naked eyes (they were about the size of the stars visible in the sky). What made these crafts unusual was the speed at which they were traveling and that, from what we could tell, the crafts were seperate, but traveling &quot;together&quot; (side-by-side). We only saw the lights for a quick 15 seconds or so and then they were out of sight. There was no noise from the crafts from what we could tell, but note that we were on the beach with waves crashing right at our shoes. Cocoa Beach is very close to Titusville which holds NASA&apos;s Kennedy Space Center which only adds to the story.

They started with one in the middle, then one to the right came on, then to the left and when all were on they stayed on for 10 seconds then all went off at the same time. This happened 3 or four times. The lights were always in a straight line, they didn&rsquo;t move and were the color of street lights. I say that they were 2 or 3 miles high and looked to be 200 to 300 yards from outside light to out side light. Every time they came on they were in a different spots, they were in random spots not in a pattern like they were moving.

My first thoughts were that the object must be a type of weather balloon as it was so high and bright and apparently very large (although I had never observed a weather balloon before).  However, a bit later, when the highway goes through a low mountain range with many turns, I noticed that this object maintained its position practically from whichever angle I was looking from, meaning that it must have been very high, many miles high, and therefore be enormous. Over 2 hours after the first sighting it was becoming dusk and I was approaching Albuquerque and as soon as I arrived home I got the binoculars but I could not see it any longer.

I then saw another one following it which looked identical. We both decided it wasn&apos;t a plane since an acutal plane passed it and it didn&apos;t have the same color, and plus it was at least 2 or 3 times smaller than the 2 redish orange lights. Once the plane passed a third red light came out from behind the trees and there these &quot;fireball looking&quot; shapes were following each other in a triangular formation.I later exclaimed how they almost looked like fire over a piece of paper flying through the sky. They appeared to move out of the South, and out Northwest.My girlfriend had told me it was even more strange when she saw the 3rd one because she was watching a thing on dateline that day about UFO&apos;s and how there was one case in Tinley Park, and those also formed a triangle pattern, and were pretty much an identical case.When I went home that night, and looked it up, I found the video: http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24695796/?pg=14#DTL_10UFO The video on dateline about the Tinley Park triangle, and I have to say it&apos;s creepy to see the IDENTICAL image of these 3 orange balls of light flying through.

As they were sitting there they saw a V shaped cluster of approximately 50 or more very bright lights move some what low across the sky at a very rapid speed. It moved like a school of fish, curving in unison, but then splitting apart at times. It  was coming from the north west and moving south east. Various other configurations of these groupings passed every few minutes. At times the lights would flare so brightly it was startling! She called me on the phone and told me to look outside to see if I could see anything, but we have a street lamp in front of our home and we couldn&apos;t. They came and picked us up and we went back to the park. I expected to see that it was a search light or something but then one large grouping flew overhead and it was undeniably something unlike anything I had ever seen or could explain. It was like a boomerang shape cluster of up to 50 objects all flying in formation very close together and they just kept coming every few minutes. They were not single file like airplanes would fly, but  grouped  densely together. We had brought our binoculars and  my 17 year old son was able to track one very brightly lit group. He saw individual crafts all clustered together, circular with dark violet lights circling around the outer edge. They were not all identical in shape and at one point they suddenly shot straight up in a deep purple blast. Most of the groupings were in a chevron pattern, but some were just small clusters. When the lights would flare it was stunning! Then they would fade to a dimness that made them unnoticeable unless you were looking at them already. They moved across the sky at an inhuman speed. We also watched multiple airplanes flying overhead and it made the speed of these objects even more stunning. I am a retired nurse and current business owner in partnership with my daughter.

I started losing feeling from my arms and legs so I hurried out of the house onto the porch. The paralyses faded after leaving the house. I saw an alien figure about 5 foot tall .It had a large head and large dark eyes. I pointed the phone at it as it charged me and took a photo. It then stopped and backed away. I noticed a large object moving over my roof towards me. Again, vapor like substance started to fall making me lose feeling in my legs and arms. I went into the house and locked the door. I saw an ugly looking face peeking into my kitchen window. I walked over while making eye contact and took a photo. It shook its head violently as if irritated.

One thing you should know is that our house is located about 20 min from the Wilkes-Barre Scranton airport.  I have seen the flight paths of many aircrafts and know what airports planes are coming from just by knowing the direction they are flying from.  I also notice that with all aircraft there are blinking lights on the ends of the wing tips.  Now with this said I noticed an orange orb of light coming from a completely different way altogether.  At first I heard a low rumble and was anticipating this aircraft maybe to be military. I was actually excited as military aircraft is rare over this area.  As the object grew closer i knew that it was not military what so ever.  It travelled for 25 seconds slowly in my direction and this is where it got weird. The orb reversed in the direction it came and literally darted out of site in a split second towards the stars!!!!!!!  The disturbing thing to me was the speed it reversed as it was coming so slowly towards my direction in the beginning.  I have been baffled by what I have seen and also about the United Kingdoms tabloids today, as the UK has reported a spectacular 150 sitings this year alone!  There have been more in PA recently too.There were no blinking lights on this object, it was if it was just a ball of light.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It was whitish in color but not bright. I seen it first and said to my brother in law look,look,look,( thinking it was a shooting star of sorts) he said he sees it and we followed it until it vanished. ( About 6 secs)  I never saw anything like this before.  It kind of looked like a wavy sheet without the corners, more oval in shape.  It was not a bird, plane, light beam or shooting star, and it was traveling fast and silent.  It was a clear night with a couple of noticeable clouds.  I also witnessed ( but did not report) the April 22nd. 2007 event that someone reported over Lewisville, TX  ( a triangular object that had 3 whitish lights moving at a very fast rate of speed and silent, no flashers and definitely not a plane )", "Cheveron shaped object seen above the skies of SouthBay area near LAX.I was looking up in the evening sky, when I saw a faint looking star moving southwards.  I thought it could be a satellite, as I was watching this move, a flash came from the southeastern direction.  It was a quick white flash as if someone was trying to say &quot;hey I&apos;m over here&quot;.  My sister happen to be looking up at the time as well, and said &quot;was that a falling star or what&quot;.  I said &quot;no&quot;, I was watching that other star looking object, which was just north west of this flash, when this flash turned on and slowly turned off.  It wasn&apos;t like a falling star at all,it was if someone turned on a bright white light, then slowly it turned off.About 3 mins later I happen to look up, and as I did, I noticed object fly just above me heading north, it appeared to have a whispy orange glow which seemed to have two bright lights at the front of it, almost shaped like a triangle with rounded edges. I mentioned it to my sister who was sitting next to me.  I thought did I just imagine it, or was I just really tired.I was curious to know what this might have been, so I grabbed my binoculars Nikon 10x50, I aimed towards the area where I saw the flash originally, as I was searching the skies, this object flew within my view, it was huge.  It seemed to have two sets of lights in a row in what seemed to appear as a &quot;v&quot; shaped object. xx     xx xx   xx xx xx xx  Not sure exactly how many lights were at on the object itself, however, I do know for sure it had two sets of lights in each row which outlined this object.  I watched it as it flew almost gliding throught the sky heading northest.  I was telling my sister to look up where I was pointing, I did not want to loose sight of this object within the binoculars view, she said she saw nothing.I am assuming this object must have been up pretty high for my sister not to see it, however, when I saw it looking through the binoculars it appeared to be large.  I would say it was twice the size of a jetliner.The best way I can describe this object is by comparison.Example:  Looking up approx. 1000ft at a 747 jetliner, through my 10x50 binoculars, the plane would appear to be the size of a nickle, and the bottom of the airliner would be difficult to see clearly as it is dark, and generally there are no lights at the bottom of the craft, perhaps a blue and red light at the wings and a white/yellowish light at the front of the plane.Now looking a this &quot;v&quot; shaped object it seemed like the lights were a whitish color, yet not blinding, and the object looked to be the size of a 50cent piece, quite large.  I couldn&apos;t tell you what altitude this object was at, as it could not been seen with the naked eye.Note: During this 15 minutes duration, my sister and I noticed the dogs next door were barking like crazy.  We thought &quot;those dogs are sure non-stop tonight&quot;. It was getting annoying listening to those dogs.While viewing this object through my binoculars, my sister made a comment about the dogs, she said &quot;did you notice the dogs stopped barking&quot;.  I listened and realized yeah, they did stop.  I am assuming that this could be because this object decided to fly away (heading south east).  Perhaps, it was lingering around the area above the skies unnoticable, then decided to leave.  I must say, the dogs were quiet after this thing departed.I wanted to know if anyone else had seen this object in the skies: September 1, 2008  approx: 9:51 - 10:15pm ish, Near Torrance, Gardena &amp; Lawndale area of Los Angeles, CA.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))", "Our family witnessed three circles of white light that appeard to go off and come back on again then  changed formation from stright across to two lights lateraly in the sky.  This repeated itself several times.  Flashs of light in the clouds appeared on the horizon with in 10 minutes of sighting.", "Bright glowing lights flying in the clouds in TucsonI saw two large bright glowing lights flying either in the clouds or just above the clouds.  Kind of off white color, maybe slightly yellowish.  Shape of both lights was mostly circular, but slightly oval.  They flew in an absolutely straight line, very fast for their size, no sound, and maintained an exact distance from each other.  I couldn&apos;t tell if it was two aircraft or one aircraft with two lights, but in either case, it had to be absolutely HUGE.  Each light was about the size of a dime if I put my arm out straight and held a dime in my fingers.  They came from the south and were heading in a north or slightly northwest direction.  Took less than 10 seconds for them to streak across the sky and out of sight.The date is approximate but definitely during the week of November 6.  I remember the time exactly because I was sitting in my car drinking coffee, parked just outside the flightline at Davis-Monthan AFB waiting for my shift to start.  I was participating in an exercise and normally wasn&apos;t there that early.  When I saw the lights go by, I froze, didn&apos;t want to blink or even breath.  The lights flew either right above the runway or were slightly outside the perimeter of the base, but they were going in the same direction as the runway.  I had been in the Air Force for over 11 years at that point, worked the flightline day and night, seen all kinds of aircraft come and go and I NEVER saw anything like this.  After the lights went by, I looked around the parking lot to see if anyone else saw it, but no one was around.  That in itself was odd.  There should have been several people in the parking lot by that time.When lunchtime came, I went back to my unit to report it to the SOC desk.  I asked them to call the tower or base ops to see if they saw it or got any similar reports.  The guy at the SOC desk just laughed and made a joke of it, like &quot;ha ha, Sgt E saw a UFO, what were you drinking, what were you smoking, can I have some of that too?&quot;  I kind of expected that since he was an assclown so I let him joke around for a minute and then I asked him, ok can we get serious now?  Just call the tower and ask them if they saw it.  Next he just ignored me so I pressed him a little harder.  Then one of the ADOs came out of his office and told me to just drop it, asked me if I have somewhere I need to be and told me to get going.I&apos;ve never seen anything like it since but if I ever do, I&apos;ll certainly never report it through Air Force channels since no one wants to hear about it anyway.  There&apos;s simply no one who takes such reports.  Report it through your chain of command and they won&apos;t give a crap.  Report it to any other Air Force agency and it will never make it past the nearest shredder or trash can.  The &quot;that&apos;s not my job&quot; philosophy definitely applies here.Since I just found this site and a couple others like it, I figured I&apos;d check to see if anyone else ever saw what I saw, but I don&apos;t see any that match this particular sighting.  So for what it&apos;s worth, here&apos;s my one and only sighting.  If I see any more, I&apos;ll let you know.", "Saucer shaped craft seen flying over downtown Denver from about 1-2 minutes.I know this may sound somewhat ridiculous with most of the media attention surrounding the city of Denver with the DNC and all, but I had to report this. This is my second confirmed UFO sighting of an uknown object here in Denver. These are also my first 2 UFO sightings I have ever encountered.I was watching CNN coverage of the political candidates. I had just finished dinner as I had gotten off at work around 6pm. I walk to and from my office, so I always am on the lookout for anything flying by in the sky, as there always is something to look at.I live on the 3rd floor in my apartment, so I have a pretty good view of the nearby republic plaza, capital building, etc. The skies were clear, the sun was shining through my windows, so I had closed a few blinds, but left 2 open.  I had just finished my dinner while watching CNN news, with a Bill Richardson interview.  I noticed something start to pass by in my left window facing the capital. I see helicopters planes, balloons,and birds pass by all the time, but this looked very strange. What caught my attention quickly was that there was no sound. When something that close flies by, I always hear it coming.  I quickly glanced at the dark object and noticed immediately that it wasn&apos;t a plane, helicopter, or balloon. At first I couldn&apos;t pinpoint the exact shape, but it seemed to be wobbling, and tipping up and down in that motion.  It was hard to glance at with the sun shinning directly on my view, but I could make out the elliptical, disc shape as it appeared to continue its path of flight across the downtown area.The Object&apos;s distance from the ground couldn&apos;t have been more than 1,000 ft, possibly even less. It continued to fly North, at a steady speed in the same wobbly, tilting motion. It had given the impression as if it was spinning, and I knew immediately it was a saucer shaped craft when the bottom portion came it to view as it flew further away from the capital hill viewing area.  I cannot determine the speed, but it seemed to be flying at a steady pace, similar to a police / black hawk helicopter.  However, the object seemed to speed up and quickly went out of site in the distance.The only image capturing device I have is a cell phone camera, and that yielded no results, however it does provide a concept of where the object was when the picture was taken, and the time of day.I am not sure if anyone else had seen this, or noticed it going by.  There had to be individuals that had seen this from the ground. Anyone going to and from the 16th Mall downtown had to have a view. I am eager to know if anyone else seen this strange object.  Not sure if the military is flying drones of some sort around the city, or if this was some weird kind of civilian aircraft, but this was definitely not an object being controlled by wind.Weather.com had the winds at 10mph from S,SE during the time of sighting.  This object was traveling way to fast, and at varied elevation increments throughout its path; to be mistaken for any kind of balloon or bag.I&apos;m not saying its an alien spacecraft, but this was definitely something out of the norm. There has to be some explanation of what the object was.", "Fire Ball object with comet like tail changing directions and dropping flares over Baton RougeWhile traveling in my automobile west bound on Interstate I-12 just before the I-12 ,I-10 split in Downtown Baton Rouge at 8:30 PM I noticed a bright object in the night sky. The object at first appeared stationary at an altitude of approximately 4000 feet. Then the object began dropping flare like objects that were falling directly towards the ground. It appeared as if it were an object that was on fire and breaking apart. Similar to an aircraft and/or a spacecraft re-entering the Earth&apos;s atmosphere. However, the object began changing directions moving at a slow speed. Then object then developed a comet like tail but much shorter in length than a normal comet. The object resembled a fireball but it never appeared to lose altitude. It remained at the same height and speed. The object flew directly towards the West approaching the Mississippi River and then turned to a Southerly direction. It would make very sharp turns, in fact, the turning radius was such that the object appeared to almost cross paths with it&apos;s on fiery tail. The object would drop flare like objects intermittently similar to a military aircraft dispersing flares. Again having the appearance of an object on fire and breaking apart but the object continued flying at the apparent same speed and altitude. It made several complete circles and then reversed it&apos;s original course of due west and began traveling back toward my direction at an Easterly heading. The object had no visible navigation lights. No blinking lights or anything indicating that it were any form of a known aircraft. The fireball object continued in the Easterly direction directly over the city of Baton Rouge and then slowly headed South until it disappeared over the horizon. The object was clearly visible to anyone in Baton Rouge looking up. I noticed that other vehicles traveling on I-12 were reducing their speed as I was perhaps because they were gazing at the object. I had my cell phone with me and attempted to take a picture but was afraid of being involved in an accident. For the record: This is my fourth experience at witnessing something very unusual in the night sky. The other incidents were the typical bright objects traveling at a huge rate of speed and then sharply changing directions. However, this recent incident is different. I&apos;m very skeptical of it being any &quot;U.F.O.&quot; because of the flare like objects dropping from it. But it confuses me as the how the object appeared to remain intact, never losing altitude or speed and flying off into the horizon. One final note: here is a link to a &quot;UFO Map&quot; where you can other testimonials of people who have witnessed the same object over Baton Rouge.   http://www.ufomaps.com/city/Baton+Rouge   Peter Duffield", "Last night heading home from work my wife and the three kids picked me up and on our way home over Settlers Green there was an object in the sky coming at us lights that started as two light as it got closer it became several lights across, then it disappeared.

I would estimate they were about one or two mile off shore and about 750 to 1000 feet above sea level. They could have been higher. They stopped briefly only about 5 seconds and backed into the cloud cover, then some moved forward again out of the clouds, then I tried to take a picture but could not see them as they moved back into the clouds. Then about 5 lights moved forward outside the clouds and returned into the clouds. I tried to take a picture but they returned into the clouds. I waited with camera ready, not to miss the next oppertunity but they did not return. A man and a female stopped and he asked if I saw the lights and what did I think they were? I told them alien space crafts. He replied strange, and continued on. I waited for a while but the lights never came out of the heavy cloud cover. We continued to enjoy our evening walking on the boardwalk and later lost at the casino and then went home.", "small, fast moving sphere travelling in straight line high up on a cloudy day in LondonI was filming some slow motion shots for a video I want to make for a friend&apos;s music video using my LG Viewty mobile phone.  Only last night looking back at my footage did I see the object move across the screen.   When I sped up the 128fps to something closer to normal speed, I noticed it was moving at a very fast rate across the shot.  I added contrast and concluded it was spherical in shape.  It was shot in b/w, so no distinguishable colours.  The image is not brilliant as it is a camera phone.", "Unidentified Flying object  spotted in the sky in massachussettsas i was in my backyard i had observed a cigar shaped object with no blinking lights or sounds or wings.

The object hovers silently over Caesar&apos;s mountain which is located close to our home. Caesar Mountain is 3,323 feet above sea level, and the glowing object is suspended well above the summit the majority of the time it is visible.  At times the object will dip below the tree-line, then reappear minutes later high up over the mountain and in a completely different location from where it disappeared!  We&apos;ve tried to use binoculars to get a closer look, but can&apos;t distinguish a shape. The binoculars do, however, sharply bring the intensity of the lights into focus.The lights on the object will glow a brilliant white, then dim.  It also has a brilliant blue haze within the white light. We were alarmed this morning when the light &quot;winked out&quot; and suddenly disppeared after hovering high over the mountain for almost 30 minutes, then abruptly became visible miles away over a ridge.  It briefly shined intensely, and discharged what looked like a beam of light from underneath the object.  It actually (briefly)illuminated the trees beneath! It then shot off with a remarkable acceleration of speed and disappeared from our view. We&apos;ve tried to find a rational explanation for this object.  It&apos;s most definitely not a star, and we&apos;ve also ruled out headlights from vehicles on Lobelia road as the binoculars proved that the object is far above the treeline most of the time.  The object is silent and there is no audible aircraft noise from rotor blades or engines, so we&apos;re positively sure that it&apos;s not a plane or helicopter. There is a small airport in Lewisburg, WV which is located about 30 miles away in Greenbrier County.  The aircraft traffic that utilizes that particular field consists of small jets and prop aircraft.  The noise they make is audible when they fly over our area.  Caesars Mountain is quite close to our home, less than three miles away, so it stands to reason that we would be able to hear any noise the object emitted-if it were a conventional aircraft. In addition, the conventional aircraft traffic flying over our area has visible flashing red and green running lights.  The object we witnessed does not.((NUFORC Note:  Probably a star or planet, we suspect.  PD))", "Large oval object hovering over major Texas cityI was sitting at my desk talking on the phone, and I looked up out the window.  I saw a grayish oval object hovering above the trees.  I watched it go down behind the tree line and then rise again several times.  I took pictures of it with my cell phone, but the object was too far away.  I tried to enlarge them, but the object is just blurred out. I am in a 3 story building and the object was about the same height, maybe a bit higher.  I could also swear that it seemed to be changing shape.  Started out pretty big, appeared to decrease in size, flatten out, and even looked to change into a diamond shape sort of.  If I had to guess, I would say it was about 20 miles away.  I am at work, so I had to do an xray.  When I came back it was gone and has not returned since.  I had one of my skeptical work mates look at it, and all she could say was that it had to be tethered to something.  It was raining here this morning with a slight breeze.  If it was a balloon, it was pretty big and grayish, not your typical bright balloon that you would associate with a promotion of some sort.  I really don&apos;t know what this was, but I felt compelled to report it.

I walked outside and noticed a red, green, blue and white strobe like flash a few hundred feet off the ground to my left as soon as i walked into his driveway.  I stood still afraid I was going to miss something as it flew in front of the moon where i saw what looked like an egg or almond shape with a solid thin line of exhaust that disappeared a couple hundred feet behind it.  The top half of the craft appeared to be a light grid that flashed a spectrum of colors like I had never seen before.  After it passed I ran and grabbed my friend, he saw it but it was too far away to tell what it was.  I went home and saw 2 dim yellowish lights in the distance at about 4:15 A.M.  I ran inside and grabbed my mother out of bed and over the course of about 15 mins 5 crafts flew over us.  First 2, then 2 more, then 1 about 5 minutes apart from each other.  The last one that passed over our driveway made a sound like I had never heard before, like a call or a signal.  I believe it acknowledged that we were seeing it.  It did the same call twice which sounded like a hawk&apos;s call mixed with a whistling bottle rocket, but it sounded digital.  Like eeeyyyeeerrr  eeeee. My mother and I still don&apos;t know what we saw but it would prove to be the first in a series of sightings that still continues.

She saw a light in the which was bigger then a star moving around in a up and down, side way movement.  She knew it wasn&apos;t an airplane, since one had just past.  Her window faces south.  She called to her bother in the next room to come and look.  He witness the lite and it&apos;s movements, She got her camera, zoomed in as close as possible and captured the lite for a minute or so. The power came back on and the object was gone. The lite was white, looked like a star, so the shape looks to us like a circle.

The object came from the southeast to northwest over george bush airport. It was black sort of v shape. At first i thought it was an ultralite but it appeared to be over 1500 ft in air and i think ultra lites are allowed to fly 500 ft and below and definitely not allowed to fly over airspace like the bush airport. It was hard to see clearly due to clouds and the distance but it slowed down and seem to turn back to the southeast. the speed was not very fast.

I know it was dark outside. I saw heard the sound of a jet plane passing far overhead and looked to see if I could find the plane. What I saw was three large red flashing lights arranged in an equilateral triangle, traveling much closer to the ground than most flying vehicles normally fly. The object came from behind some trees to the SW and flew, in a straight line and at a steady rate, to the NE, where it disappeared again behind trees. I could not see a form or a reflection because the sky was so dark, but I could not see other objects in the area between the lights. I cannot approximate how low the object was flying because it was so dark, but it is significantly lower than I have hitherto ever seen an object flying. I did not see the trees respond to its passing, so I assume it was well above them. I though the jet-sound was coming from this vehicle until I noticed a jet flying over the object when it was directly overhead. The jet-plane was very obviously a plane - an elongated triangle with colored lights on the short end and a white light at the peak &ndash; and was traveling ESE to WNW, which is the direction planes usually go over this area in, we being located very close to an airport.I am inclined to believe that the object was a plane of some sort, perhaps at an odd angle, but don&rsquo;t know why it would be flying so low or in a direction so different from the norm. I did watch it cross the sky in the hopes of seeing the shape of the vehicle, thereby allowing me to have a better chance of identifying the vehicle, until it left the sky.I am a teacher with some training in psychology; I am trained to take a skeptic&rsquo;s approach to everything. I grew up living just about next-door to an airport, and have always liked sky-gazing (very difficult near an airport) so am very familiar with what various plane-lights look like. My first action upon returning home was to type a description into a search engine to see if I could find what plane-signal would require lighting as described above.  I then looked for other man-made flying vehicles which would have 3 lights arranged in a triangle along its belly. All I found were two pictures online of similar lights (I did not have a camera), but both were called UFOs. One was photographed in in Texas February 9, 2005, the other in Alabama in April 26, 2004.", "white glowing craft travels overhead and changes directionI was just starting to walk with my dog for the evening.  I looked up to scan the night sky and saw an object coming from the western sky that did not appear to be an airplane.   It was coming directly from the west and I was hoping it would be a satellite reflecting the light from the sun that had set an hour earlier.  I did not see flashing lights, or colored lights; just a steady glow.  As the object drew closer, it appeared it was about as high as some of the jet airliners that often pass overhead to other cities.   I was just outside of my house, so I ran back in to get binoculars (7x35) to see the object better.  It appeared to be traveling as fast as military jets at high altitude, but it did not look like a plane. Using the binoculars, I was then able to tell that the quality of light was much brighter than reflected sunlight and that the object appeared to be creating the light.  It was a round shape; glowing a very bright white with a slight hint of blue at the edges.  Again, I could not see any standard aircraft lighting.  Based on the altitude of normal aircraft, the diameter of the object appeared to be as big as the length of an airliner.   It was now about overhead, and I was thinking it could still be a satellite, when it then began changing its eastern course and then began heading in a northeastern direction.

I had just merged onto SR429 from the Florida Turnpike, heading north toward Apopka, Florida.  The weather was partly cloudy, but it was not raining, and visibility was good.  Looking out my driver&rsquo;s side window (toward the west), something in the sky caught my attention.An incredibly bright, white object appeared to be hovering stationary in the sky at what I would estimate to be 700ft to 800ft in altitude.  My initial reaction was that the object was probably an airplane reflecting sunlight while banking, but after continuing to observe it, I quickly realized that was not the case.The object appeared to be perfectly square in shape, not a cube, but a flat, square shape.  It was smooth, with very clearly defined perimeter lines and corners, and was a very brilliant color of white;  incredibly bright, but in a different manner than the brightness of the sun (very comfortable to look at, no glare associated with it, and its brightness did not obscure its shape at all; there was no &quot;halo&quot; or other glow surrounding it in spite of its brightness).  It seemed to be illuminated from inside of the object, even though the object was so flat that it appeared to be almost two dimensional.  The object was located well below the cloud cover, and stuck out like a sore thumb against the overcast, grey sky.I would estimate my distance from the object to be at least one mile.  I&rsquo;m not sure I can accurately estimate the size of the object, but my impression was that it was fairly large given that I could clearly see the outline of its shape at that distance.  The best description I can give regarding its size is that if you held your thumb up at arm&rsquo;s length, the object would appear to be slightly smaller than your thumbnail.The object was absolutely stationary in the sky; no movement whatsoever for the entire period that I observed it (at least 5 minutes).  While observing the object, I noticed a small, round flashing light that appeared to be further west of the object, but moving toward it.  When the flashing light had almost reached the bright, square object, they both disappeared.  I spent several minutes trying to spot them again, but they never reappeared.", "&quot;V&quot; shaped craft moving north to south with seven round lights.On Friday evening at approximately 23:25 hrs, my twelve-year old son and I were getting ready to have a sleep-out on the back porch of our home.  All lights were out and we were scanning the sky for satellites and falling stars when an object appeared over our heads moving north to south. The object appeared to be very high and very large.  It was either one craft in a triangle form with three dim lights up each side and one at the point (seven total), or it was seven separate craft flying in a &quot;V&quot; formation. The latter may be more plausible because I am pretty sure that I could see &quot;through&quot; the craft. There was no sound associated with this craft and no sonic boom even though it appeared to be moving very fast. The craft was dim and disappeared quickly.", "Ufo shooting smaller crafts from bigger UfoWent outside to smoke a cigerette when I looked up at the sky.

I had just left the town of Perrysburg heading east on Rte. 795 when I happened to glance up at the sky, as it was a full moon out and a storm had just passed. I was checking to see if there were any more dark clouds when all of a sudden, off in the direction of the northeast, I saw what I originally thought was a cluster of three stars, placed close together in a straight line. This had piqued my curiosity because I had never seen anything like that before. I continued to drive, periodically glancing up at the sky and noticing that the object did not move. It remained in my field of vision for about 6 miles until I turned off the highway onto an exit ramp. I continued to look at the object through the rearview mirror as I was now heading south down a country road. As I pulled into the subdivision that I lived in, I happened to look back to the northeast- but instead of the three star-like objects, there appeared a large object, shaped almost like a blimp, with five or six white lights making the outline of the object and three red lights in the center of the white ones. I followed the object as it moved east to west at what I would guess to say would be about 50 miles per hour had it been traveling on the ground.

It was approximately 2:20am on Tuesday morning, Sep 23, 2008.  I woke up to go to the bathroom.  After I got back into bed, I closed my eyes and I saw these distorted images reflected in my eyes (my eyes were closed).  These images were red, blue, yellow, green and in the shape of random lines vibrating.  All of a sudden I hear a very distorted sound, like someone playing a strange instrument with only 5 notes playing one at a time.  This continued for about 2 minutes until I heard a very loud , deep rumbling noise, like an engine, above my house. I got up to look out the balcony window but could not see anything in the sky.  All I could sense was absolute silence, no other sounds could be heard, no wind, no cars, no birds, not even an airplane which I thought could be the reason for the noise.  But there was absolutely nothing.  It was as if time had stopped.  This rumbling noise was very low, like nothing I&rsquo;d ever heard, but I couldn&rsquo;t see anything. There were no lights.  This lasted maybe 1 minute and then I heard those notes again.  I looked around the backyard and then all of a sudden, to the left of me, I see this greenish shaped image projected on the wall of the apartment complex to the left of my house. It was the shape of a circle with a point at the top and a flat bottom with a line running through it. It was on the wall for a few seconds then it vanished.  It must have been at least 10 feet wide and 10 feet long on the wall.I then proceeded to the front of the house thinking maybe the noises were coming from there but did not see or hear anything. I went back to my bedroom, sat there for a few seconds and then heard those notes again! I looked out the balcony door I saw it again. The image projected onto the apartment complex.  It lasted about 1 minute and then vanished.You must think this all sounds very crazy and unreal, but I saw it and heard those noises.  This is the first time I&rsquo;ve had an experience like this in my life.All this lasted about 5 minutes.  I couldn&rsquo;t go back to sleep for at least an hour after that.

I was looking at the stars and suddenly noticed a yellowish light which appeared to be heading down toward earth because as it moved it grew slightly larger.  My first thought was that it was a shooting star. It had no flashing beacon or tail.   As soon as the thought occurred about the shooting star, the light seemed to hesitate for a split second and wobble slightly.  It suddenly and I mean SUDDENLY changed course about 30 degrees and headed due west toward Los Angeles at an astonishing high rate of speed. I tried to follow it and dropped my soda can in the process but it I lost it behind a palm tree. It was just going too fast to follow.  Of course I do not know what it was, but I do know that it wasn&apos;t a shooting star because it changed direction. It wasn&apos;t an airplane or helicopter because there was no flashing beacon. It was not a satellite because it was going too fast and changed direction.  Commercial airlines fly over my house on a regular basis.  They fly over at about 10,000 feet altitude.

We were standing in a small empty lot between two houses.  This picture was taken in between two other pictures taken at 4:08 pm and 4:16 pm.  The UFO image in this photo is not in the other two photos taken before and after.

After attempting to recreate an image with a UFO in it by putting a small fleck of paper on the lens, and also throwing rocks in the air to try to catch a snapshot of one of them to see if a similar image could be created, we couldn&rsquo;t do it.  It didn&rsquo;t work.  I don&rsquo;t know what this UFO in my picture is, but I&rsquo;m becoming more and more convinced it&rsquo;s not a fleck of dust or a rock being thrown.

I figured it may have been a satellite but then we saw another moving in the same direction. and another.  Then the forth one faded in from a different direction and then changed course.  When it changed course i knew right then and there it was not a satellite or the space station or space junk.  The fifth object seen we thought it was simply two of the lights moving together at the same speed and then we realized it was one HUGE object!  How we came to that conclusion is when both the lights came to pass a star the star vanished for about a second. then it came back.  this object was moving slowly as well. It simply looks like 2 stars moving from the west to the east.  Then all of the sudden it abruptly changed course to go north.  This is the most active night i have ever seen besides the lights over Phoenix Arizona incident a few years back that the government said was flares.Something that large should have made a lot of noise for how close it appeared.  But then i guessed it must be so far away.  The rest of our time we viewed a few more single star like objects move across the sky and some of them changed course.  One of them was red in color.  The last object observed was very large and at first i thought it might be a huge b-1 bomber or something flying low. the only problem with that is the speed it was moving (Fast) and no noise as well as strange lights.  one white light left one white light right and one red light in the center with an occasional bright red burst emitted from the back red light. (Blinking (Bursts) but not like a plane in succession). The object seemed to show a double image of itself on top like a mirror. WEIRD! For me to see what we saw tonight makes me so angry that the government would cover up something so huge! It is so obvious if people would simply get out from in front of there t.v&apos;s and watch the sky for them selves. I just can&apos;t understand why i couldn&apos;t see any additional detail.

She drove forward, and it looked much closer than I&apos;d thought, and we could literally see it moving across the sky, 50-70 above the houses.

I witnessed two similar phenomena occur twice within a half-hour or less of each other.  Not being too familiar with the area I don&rsquo;t know exactly where I was located, but for the first event, I&rsquo;d say I was between 25-50 miles northwest of Indianapolis, and for the second, maybe 50-75 miles northwest of Indianapolis.  For the second sighting, I&rsquo;m reasonably sure that I was located no more than halfway between Indianapolis and Gary &ndash; most likely closer to Indianapolis.  Giving a generous estimation, I&rsquo;d say both events occurred between 7:30 and 9:00 p.m. EST.  It&rsquo;s more likely that they occurred between 7:30 and 8:30, but I wasn&rsquo;t paying close attention to the time.I saw each time a single streak of yellow light occur in the northern sky heading north/northwest.  Each event lasted about 1 second each, moved extremely fast, and seemed to travel a great distance, assuming they were as far away as they appeared.  They looked to be pretty far away, but I could not accurately guess the number of miles.  The streaks were not directly overhead, but they were closer to being overhead than they were to the horizon.  They appeared to be as long as a pencil when it&rsquo;s held at arm&rsquo;s length away when they completed their streak.  There was a definite movement of the light.  That is, they did not appear immediately as a solid line.  They began as a point and streaked across a portion of the night sky, as if someone had drawn a line with a yellow marker.  As soon as the lights reached a certain distance, they faded immediately.There were no stars in the sky, and that coupled with the fact that I saw it twice led me to believe that they were not shooting stars.  It was not raining, nor was there thunder, so I&rsquo;m sure they were not lightning streaks.  They appeared out of and returned to nothing, it seemed.  They were both very unnatural-looking phenomena.This is my first report of a sighting.  I thought these events were strange enough to deserve reporting.

As there are several airports nearby, I usually ignore aircraft passing overhead.

I saw a irregular outline of this object as the cloud level reflected city lights around the object, subtending about 1 degree in diameter. At this altitude and lighting conditions, I can normally see wings and tail on aircraft. That said, I would completely dismiss this &quot;sighting,&quot; except for one odd detail. As I tracked the movement of this object, the cluster of strobes would sometimes appear clearly outside the previous location of this object, giving the impression the object was quickly darting from one position to another. I thought this was a perceptual illusion until this odd behavior repeated 6 times, but I&apos;m still baffled.  The nature of these strobes appeared as a very quick, erratic sequence, no geometric arrangement appearing to change color almost too quickly to register.

There were about eight, two foot wide bulbs around the round object.My friend and I walked under it at an angle and tried to make out the shape with the stars since it was the only light above, there was no moon and the stars were almost not visible. We first thought it was a hot air balloon with lights on the bottom but with the little stars that were out, we couldn&rsquo;t see how high it exactly was, but we knew it wasn&rsquo;t high like a balloon.I need to say this, over the years I&rsquo;ve read a lot about of what other people have written about what they saw, and what&rsquo;s different about mine, is that I think my friend and I are the only dumb asses that threw rocks and tar from the road at it for about a good half an hour. And we didn&rsquo;t even hear the rocks fall back on the ground and we didn&rsquo;t hear it hit the object.After about half an hour of throwing rocks at it we watched it slowly rise up then whoosh, it went up fast, in like a couple of seconds it shot up, we saw the lights get closer together, get smaller, and dim, in a matter of two to three seconds.My take on why it left so abruptly, is that I think they were going to abduct us until they found out they&rsquo;d have serious problems with the two dumb asses that were throwing rocks at them. Just kidding.One more thing, there is one more witness, this was a little strange, it was my ride which happened to be my mom. She didn&rsquo;t see it there, but at her job which happens to be on the other side of the hill / small mountain, at the Davis and Geck parking lot. We talked about it a few days after it happened, because we ended up walking home. She said she was afraid of it and went back inside to get someone to walk her back to he car. It happened at night, and that is all I know.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))", "The UFO was a saucer shaped, silver object.It was nine in the morning.  My cousin and I were taking a walk.  I happened to look up at the clouds and that&rsquo;s when I saw it.  There was a metallic silver saucer moving slowly through the air.I quickly told my cousin to look up.  And sure as heck, I wasn&rsquo;t imaging it. He saw it too.  I quickly took out my phone to try and get a picture, but right when I pushed &ldquo;TAKE&rdquo; the UFO disappeared into a cloud bank.  It looked as if it sped up to get away or something.  Later that morning, I was doing something in the living room and looked out the window.  There moving slowly across the sky was the same looking UFO that my cousin and I had seen a couple hours earlier.I figure it was probably the same UFO craft we&rsquo;d seen two nights earlier. We had been watching a movie and glanced out the window.  Slowly moving over our yard was a torpedo shaped figure with glowing lights.  The lights were red, yellow, and green.

I joked around about him seeing things &quot;up there&quot;, to which he calmly replied, &quot;yeah there is one up there right now&quot;. I took the binoculars and aimed it in the direction he pointed. At first I saw nothing but a high altitude plane, at about 35,000 ft. but then to my surprise I saw something else too. Beyond the plane, higher up, maybe at 60,000 ft. I saw something strange. I put down the lens and looked again with the naked eye, nothing. Again, I looked through the binocs and once again saw the &quot;thing&quot; in the bright day sky. It looked like a gold cylinder with reddish top and bottom. My brain could not quite place the object, I was searching for a connection to something else I may have seen before but could not quite understand what it was that I was looking at.The only connection I could fathom was that I looked kind of like a plane rising up into the sky at first, then, it also had characteristics of a kite, but it was tumbling, head over head, in one place. I was confused and amazed, I really could not place this thing...I could not understand in my mind what this was....strange.My friend then told of how he had been seeing these things all week and followed them with the binocs as they moved, often randomly, his girlfriend also witnessed them from time to time yet she never spoke of it and even joked around about her &quot;crazy&quot; boyfriend always looking up.I am not saying there where little green men in these objects but to this day I can not explain or identify this object with any one thing I have ever seen before.I am a skeptic person by my nature, an atheist.

As it moved, the object had a sort of twinkling effect.  I observed this object over the course of 2 hours.  It would remain stationary for several minutes then it would move in the erratic circular pattern.  The objects motion over time was in a westerly direction but its progress was more rapid than the other stars.  I phoned a friend who verified what I was seeing.  He lives about 12 miles west of me and saw the object in the same relative position in the sky as me so I would say the object was at a high altitude.  My friend tried to look through his telescope at the object but could only resolve the object as a point source of light.

It was brilliant white, brighter and larger than Venus which was also visible in the southern sky. The light&rsquo;s speed was similar to a high altitude commercial aircraft, and it changed it course slightly several times while I watched, finally arcing towards the southeast.

There was no vapor trail visible but there seemed to be some very faint black smoke behind it. The object looked like a round ball that was pure white, with a streamlined fuselage of some kind projecting from the ball in the direction of travel. This structure was dark in colour and about 1/8 the diameter of the ball. I thought the object was several miles up and about twice the diameter of a jet airplane. The object did not change course or appearance while visible. The children also saw it. I am unaware of any aircraft like this. The location was a farm near Hamiota, Manitoba.

According to their testimony the object was 75-100 feet in diameter and directly overhead at a height of 50-75 feet.  The object was disk shaped and its colouring was silver/white metallic.  The length of the sighting was approximately 45 seconds.He writes, &quot;It was one warm summer Friday around 10:00 p.m. in the evening in California&apos;s Santa Clarita Valley. I was brushing the swimming pool with a long pole and attached brush so that the kids could swim the following day. The pole requires you reach up to push down. I was standing on a high platform next to and overlooking the pool and about 4 feet over the rest of the pool area. As I reached to the upper end of pole, I saw a craft approaching the house from about 1-2 blocks away and from the West and heading South East.&quot;  &quot;I knew right away that it was not a helicopter or plane. It seemed flatter and wider and with lights in a circumference of the main leading edege area. I ran towards the house, some 60 feet, and called my family to see it. Only my wife came out. By that time it was stationary directly over our house and pool. It was approximately 75-100 feet above us. We stood along side of the pool deck. It made no sound whatsoever, and it was at a complete stop over us for about 40 seconds. The only motion was a slight wobble and when it moved and tilted downwards at an angle. I was then able to determine that light was emanating from it&apos;s skin and not pool lights reflection. I took the downward tilting as some form of acknowledgment. It remained tilted downwards at a 30-40 degree angle for about 10 seconds. During the entire time, we were frozen in disbelief. It is a strange sensation knowing that what you are seeing is not supposed (to exist) and very foreign. It was (like) seeing a Greyhound Bus floating over your house!&quot;  Witness claims that it had a small portholes and lights around the upper dome section, He describes the object as solid, metallic and shiny. It had a dome on the upper section of the craft and seemed as if created from a single mold with no visible seams. The lower underneath section of the object was concave towards the center and had two rectangular shapes along side each other and the length of the concave under-section. The rectangular shapes were about 7-10 feet in width and ran along the craft&apos;s concave underside center.&quot;I also noticed 2 ski like devices on the front and on each side of the front underside. What caught my attention was that the devices were not in the center or the &quot;center of gravity&quot; for the craft&apos;s diameter and design but very forward. The skis were S shaped with the top of the S facing forward but a design I could not replicate even though I scored very high on isometric drawings and IQ tests that included realting drawing sequences.Upon the craft leaning in a downward motion we could see a window or cockpit like glass that was situated in the underside, it was on the front lower edge of the round craft. The rectangular window was approximately 4 feet in height and possibly 8-10 feet in length. There was a glow of soft orange and blue lights from the inside but we could not see anyone or any controls&quot;.It remained at a forward and downward angle for about 10 seconds. We both had the sensation of being watched. As it was angled, I noticed that light was emanating from the upper section that was not facing the swimming pool lights. Thus, it seemed to generate light through skin of the craft as the lights that first attracted me faced forward and was much lower than the upper section of the craft.&quot;My wife and I did not say anything to each other during the experience but she kept saying &quot;oh my God&quot; over and over again. The craft then left slowly at 30-40 MPH. I jumped on a wall around our property to continue seeing for at least 7-miles. I instructed my wife not to discuss it, to draw what she saw and then we would compare drawings. They matched, although mine had more detail and accuracy&quot;.I have a background that includes working with Group Propulsion Systems, studied aeronautical engineering followed by busines and later as an executive with several major computer companies. &quot;What we saw was close, real, solid, and a beautiful designed craft.

I was filming in video mode and trying to follow the movement of the aircraft and zoom in with the climb. In the footage there is a circular distortion on the right. This distortion is stationary in the sky and not a smudge or particle on the lens of the camera. As the camera moved slightly under my attempt to control the zoom and keep the fighter in frame, the object remains stationary, at the same time dust/smudges move with the camera to the left. (The dust/smudges are not in the photo captures.) The fighter does remain blurred considerably on the lower left during zoom.

The object was glowing reddish orange and stopped approx 150 ft from the ground, it had misty trails and an aura/grey haze around it. The craft stopped completely and then changed course moving in a &quot;Z&quot; motion with extreme speed, again it stopped abruptly and shuddered/vibrated, at this time the craft was at a 45 degree angle to the ground, then the craft changed angle leveling out. The craft made almost no sound but a low humming vibration and was approx 50-60ft long. The craft never changed color or shape and seemed like it was spinning very,very fast.The craft disappeared in an instant leaving a ring of light the shape of the object.

The object was bright enough to illuminate the tops of the Ponderosa&apos;s along my driveway. The object was seen through the trees. I was looking south out the window. Of course, I jumped up, ran to the window just to see it disappear behind a clump of trees and the mountains beyond my ranch.The object was oval shaped, and was first seen about 45 degrees off the horizon at 160 degrees on the compass in the south, and  it came in from the east and was heading west, at a 45 degree slope. Lost sighting at about 200 degrees compass heading. My ranch is 6 miles out of Sprague River North, and 18 miles out of Chiloquin, Or. south. The object emmitted a bright white light, no tail, and actually illuminated the treetops on my place. Duration of sighting about 3-4 seconds, this was enough time to make out shape. Time was about 5:35 pm. Size, if I was to hold a nickel coin at arms length, that was the size of this object. I ran to the end of my drive which is over 1000 feet long with binoculars, and no other obects or aircraft were seen. Clear skies, temp about 48 degrees. Estimated distance of object, undetermined at this time.The area we live is very remote and rural, horse and cattle ranches. Little or no commercial aircraft traffic flies in this area. Only an occasional helicopter during fire season. What this object was &quot;NOT&quot;. It was not a helicopter or private or commercial aircraft, as I did run out on my deck within a split second of seeing the object... no sound, or any collision lights red or green, or flashing lights. Could this had been space debris? Possibly. Could it have been the space station? No. Could it have been the Space Shuttle? No. Could it have been a meteor or fireball? NO, it had no tail, was a solid white very bright oval shaped object with a aura/halo around it. I have witnessed hundreds of not thousands of falling stars, meteors, watched comets, ect. It did not meet the characteristics of a meteor or falling star. Could it have been space junk? Yes, possibly. My background is the USAF, and I am familiar with many aircraft. It is undetermined at this time what this may have been.Summery; Reason for posting this report is to see if there were any other witnesses from this Southern Oregon location. Someone may have had a better viewing of the object from a better location and can fill in some more details on this.", "Bight light seen northwest of downtown Seattle.On Nov. 9th, 2008, Seattle Police came to our place of work and said a UFO was reported over Elliott Bay and they were checking out the report.  None of our security officers had seen anything, but when we checked out our security video at 10:03:45pm we saw a large bright red light appear out of nowhere in the sky and slowly drift from west to east across the sky before we lost sight of it behind a building.

The stars or lights would swirl slightly chaning from 4-7 stars.  The positions would change of each individual light, as well as a together as a whole.

It was as though it were trying to hide in the stars above us. When it past over our heads, you could see through the center of it. You could put three large full moons easily inside it and still have room left over. It was Huge! There were three points to its shape. There was some kind of illumination on each of the points. There were no lights coming from it and it made no noise. It took about 8 sec from when first saw it to past over us. It was traveling very fast. It was very high in the atmosphere. It looked like it was up with the &quot;stars.&quot;", "a light over the mountainWhat I saw was a bright small light over the mountain close to where I live it happens  all the time, sometime there are days or weeks in between or a month or two but it always comes back.

She has a 3.6 GPA and is a very bright, mature girl.  She has no prior experience with UFO&apos;s and has been a bit skeptical of them. She is not one to make up story. Tonight, she left class at approximately 19:35 p.m EST.  I called her cell phone as I often do to determine her time of arrival for dinner. When she answered my call, she was extremely upset and crying.  She stated that when she pulled onto North Abbe Road (heading North) in Elyria, OH there was a very large oblong object in the sky that was gray in color and had red and white flashing lights.  The object appeared to be sitting still and was not very high in the sky.  She was nearly hysterical.  I talked to her from my cell phone to her cell phone her entire drive home.  When she arrived home she was still very upset and crying.  I asked why she was so scared.  She couldn&apos;t explain why, she just kept saying I couldn&apos;t understand.  She almost immediately went to sleep which is highly unusual.  To type this report, I checked her cell phone log of recent calls for the time of the incident; however, the call is not logged in her cell phone.  Finding this more than a bit odd, I then went to my cell phone and the call to her cell phone is clearly logged.  The call lasted 10 minutes and 35 seconds.

At 12:40 we heard a noise like rustling leaves that got louder and louder. We looked to the southwest and in the sky was an sphere-like object that was descending at about 25 M.P.H. onto a pasture. An orb of flourescent purple light was rotating around the object inside what seemed to be a kind of tube. As the object slowed down, so did the speed at which the purple orb revolved around the craft.After it had sat there for a couple minutes, another sphere shaped craft came down and landed next to the other. The second craft made the same noise as the first. They seemed to be docking with one another.At about 5 minutes they both made the rustling noise again. They did that for about 45 seconds, and then they flew off into the air much faster than they had landed.We checked out the spots where they had landed the next morning.

I wished I could have seen more, and there were no reports the next day.The reason I post this is because a similar event was posted by a witness in Dekalb that same night.", "I was driving to work on November 06 2008. I stopped for Sonic to eat before work. I live very close to the back side of the locale air port and 4 surrounding Military bases. I say this because I see lots of aircraft in the air at all times. I was in the drive up and I saw a strange pattern of lights on a plane or what looked to be a plane banking to the left to turn, but the object never turned and the light pattern never changed. I then saw a state police helicopter go in the same direction. I thought nothing of it at the time. I paid for my meal at the window and started driving to the base I currently work at as a Computer Systems administrator. I&apos;m maybe a mile up the road still in town and I see the same object, flying very close to a residential area well under 300 feet in the air. I thought for a plane that&rsquo;s close I sure don&rsquo;t here any noise coming from it, so I rolled down my window and sure thing it did not make one sound. It soon dropped off of my vision and I keep driving. The road I&rsquo;m on comes to a 4 way stop and is just off the back side of a locale air port and I see the same object coming from the direction of the air port and thought for sure this pilot must be trying to land or is having problems. I make my left hand turn at the 4 way stop and then a right on to the highway. The object at that time has stop in mid air just of the right of the highway I&apos;m driving on. I&apos;m coming up to the object and I see a row of well yellow lit windows so bright you can&rsquo;t make out the inside compartment. But not a blinding eliminating light just well lit and yellow in color. I&rsquo;m driving at about 30mph now and the object is to my right and I can see the underbelly it had green strips of lights all over the undercarriage of the craft and the body of the craft was black and blended in with the night sky so well I really could not make out the shape or even the hole size of the craft. It was very well triangle shape from the way the green lights were lade out on the bottom of the craft and! I rolle d down my window again and heard not one sound. At this time a second car had pulled over to the side of the road and started flashing its light and the object with out banking in any direction to the left or right to turn seemed to go back in the direction it came from towards the airport. I speed to the nearest cross section to make a u-turn and race to the airport with the object still in sight. I have to stop at a stop light and lose the object behind a set of buildings that a recently gone up in the last two or so years. Its very bright over buy the buildings as if the craft was hiding but the buildings are on a gated road I don&rsquo;t have access to and I can&apos; see the craft anymore. I&apos;m leaving back towards work and I&apos;m looking at the new buildings that I have never seen before and it seems there is a private run way and some indicator lights lighting up a run way path I&apos;ve never seen before. And there seem to be an airplane hanger right behind this new building that&rsquo;s just off the main run way to the locale airport, where I think this object my have landed and possibly if it was not a true UFO may have been stored away. Any way I tried to Google maps the location of the building and it seems they are brushed out of the picture or were not built when the photo was taken. I saw this craft up-close and for a very long time, I&apos;m more then sure I&apos;m not the only one in the area as it was flying very close to the ground and very slowly no aircraft other then a helicopter could have pulled off the speeds but not the maneuvers. I wish I would have had my camera to take photos. It was not any aircraft I have ever seen nor was it your typical UFO sighting as the object did not glow did not have over powering bright lights or laser beams. On the ride out to the baseI work at I saw what seemed to be more aircraft all NONUFO and very identifiable in the sky then I&apos;ve seen in a long time it was as if they were looking for some thing.

I was driving west towards downtown Azle on Highway 199 A.K.A Jacksboro Highway. I was looking to the left out of my driver-side window. About 2 Miles away, there was a giant gold glowing object. I could tell it wasn&apos;t a oil rig, nor gas rig. The object never moved. It wasn&apos;t on the ground or supported by any other object. The object was all one piece. At the top it appeared to be an elaborate antenna of some kind. Below the antenna, was a saucer/square shape. Below the saucer/square portion of the object was about 3 to 5 more antenna-like objects. I estimated the object to be anywhere from 250 feet to 300 foot tall. Let I remind you that it was one whole piece. I didn&apos;t stop to get a closer look, nor had a camera of any kind. I drive on that part of the highway at least once everyday, and at least once every night. My car radio&apos;s frequency was fuzzy at the time. I looked at my cell phone at that time as well, and had no service. In the same area, their are 2 cell phone service Antenna&apos;s about 3 to 5 miles apart from each other.

My friend and I were talking when I saw this object.  I looked away to continue the conversation, and when I looked back there was another object of the same size and color right next to the first object.  They were both a hazy red color and circular in shape.  The first object was stationary the whole thirty minutes I was watching, while the second object was clearly moving to the right away from the stationary object.  From the distance I was at it looked like the second object was about 6 inches to the right, when it reached that distance it started to move farther from me.  In about 6 seconds the moving object was out of sight.  The first object was in the same position that it was in when I first noticed it.  As soon as the second object was out of sight I continued my conversation and stopped looking for about 2 to 3 minutes at which time I checked to see if it was still there.  It was no where to be seen.  Neither object left any sort of trail that I could see.", "Possible UFO sighting in JamaicaWell this happened about four (4) years ago when I was walk home from church. I believe there was some form of Christmas Celebration being held and I attend.  Well I remember that I was walking home on a particular street where I could straight down into the town, as that was direction in which I was heading.  I remember seeing the very huge thing (well this is only word I can use to describe it) with a lot of what seem to be Christmas lights covering it, I was stunned at sighting this object.  First I thought it was a ship.......... but then I realized that it couldn&apos;t be because it was in the sky and the Sea was way too far away for to it be reflecting clearly.  It moved real slow and I was beginning to get even scared, as I could not figured out what it is,  I looked behind me to see if anyone else was on the street and witnessing what I&apos;m seeing but there was no one.  I then kept looking at it....... I know this may sound silly but at one point I though it was Santa Clause as it was the Christmas season and the object was covered with colourful lights.  One thing I can tell you for sure is that whatever it was it was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen in my entire life. As I walked closer to the town area I notice that it was disappearing and it was then time I realized that It really could not be any normal transportation.  I even started walking very fast amazed at what I&apos;ve seen, with a bit of smile and fear on my face.  When I reached home I told my family, but we just ignored it cause it is not sometime we believe in, especially in Jamaica.  However deep inside I always knew I witness something abnormal.  The reason I decided to share this is because I was just idling online and I found myself after four (4) years of this event reading up on Aliens and UFO&apos;s.  Then I came across this case where the man who saw the UFO and even touch it was badly burned.  Well what stroked me was when he described the colourful lights in the space ship, just like or similar to what I saw.  I&apos;m just here ! wondering how can they be so high tech as UFO sightings go way back to the 1940&rsquo;s or 1960&rsquo;s I believe, and if they are really visiting what do they want.......... do they live in those big ships and stuff like that.........(NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

The object appeared to have a saucer rim, which surrounded a sphere on the top and bottom of the object. This object performed several different aerobatic maneuvers that are impossible for any type of fixed wing aircraft. It hovered for periods of time, some ten to fifteen seconds. It moved on all three axes. It would move to the left and to the right, as well as up and down and backwards and forwards. I am a student with a passion for aviation, so I know that this could not have been anything civil or commercial. This object also emmited lights. It would be white for most of the time, but it did change several times, most notably in the spherical portions of the craft. IT would turn to like a purplish-pink color, and then back to white.I first observed this object when driving my car to the gas station, but never made it there. When there was a break between houses, and there was n a clear line of sight, I noticed a lighted object hovering near the South Point casino.  After a few moments, I realized that it was stationary. I pulled my car over and began to observe it for several minutes. It then started to move slowly to the left, then to the right. It began to fade, but then its color intensified. At which case I drove home.From there, my mother and my two cousins were outside, startled by the fact that there was an Unidentified Flying Object in our presence. It continued to change colors, and then fade as if it were shrinking. We continued to observe the object for ten minutes before it moved out o view.I am a nineteen year old college student attending UNLV. I also have a knowledge of aviation and astronomical phenomena.

I heard over a CB radio that a ball of fire was coming across the sky.  I had time to pull off at the top of the mountain at a brake test area.  At which time I climbed to the highest area I could climb to.  Upon my observation platform (rock) I was able to watch the ball of fire approach me.  As it grew near I could see that it was a structure that was a saucer shaped.  Fire was shooting from the portholes outside of the rim of the craft.  It looked like a wheel spinning around the outside of the craft. I got the feeling that the craft was in trouble it made no noise and I felt no heat.  It was moving approx. 20-30-MPH  Just putting.  It traveled over the top of my head just putting going very slow.  I was able to see the portholes where fire was emerging.  I watched the vehicle travel 20-30MPH creeping along the mountains. After I lost sight of the vehicle I returned to my truck and continued my journey.  When I reached Barstow, CA, the next morning, I listened to a local radio station.  The radio said people from California- New Mexico had seen the object.  The US Air Force said it was a Russian booster rocket had re-entered the atmosphere and burnt up.  I witnessed this object in controlled flight.  It slowly made its way NE along the mountains.  I was able to make out details of the bottom and sides of the vehicle because it was only 100-150 feet above me.  I heard no sound and there was no heat. The next morning the Barstow radio station announced that it was a Russian booster rocket that had blown up.  I know that it was not a Russian booster rocket.  I had a feeing that it was in trouble.  I am not an artist but I can describe what it looked like.  Had it not been so close I would not be able to give a description of it. I know there were other people that saw it but I was so awe struck that I didn&apos;t know if anyone  else was around.  I have never seen this kind of technology since.

That&apos;s when I noticed a green solid light, about the size and brightness of Jupiter.  I noticed it was moving towards ENE.I watched it for about a minute, then ran in the house to tell my wife.  Unfortunately, she was in the shower and could not come out and see it.  I then ran into the backyard and I could still see it, moving in the same direction.  I watched it moving ENE until I could not see it anymore.I then looked around, not expecting to see anything else, when I saw two more green lights, fairly close to each other, moving in the same direction.  I couldn&apos;t believe it. I watched them move in the same direction, until I could not see them anymore.I was trying to come up with a reasonable explaination for myself.  There were no other lights, like a red one, or a strobe, like on a small airplane, which fly aroung the area frequently.  Since it was Halloween, I had a strong feeling that maybe a kid tied one of those green glowing light sticks to a helium ballon, and it was just floating in the wind, since there was absolutely no sound coming from the objects.I later checked the NOAA website (weather.gov) to check the wind direction that night.

I&apos;ll be glad to talk to someone, primarily as I said my reason for posting this information is to find if anyone in that area in that general time frame (or later, I suppose) had seen similar things.It is easiest to reach me by email.((COPY OF TEXT FOUND ON WEBSITE INDICATED ABOVE))My UFO storyBefore I myself saw UFOs, I had no strong opinion whether they existed - I assumed they could exist, but then we&rsquo;re used to hard and incontrovertible evidence, and the lack of that - as experience available to other people, people who hadn&rsquo;t already seen such evidence - makes it &ldquo;hard to swallow&rdquo; in many cases. So, if some group of people in some metropolitan area reported the same phenomenon and the &ldquo;reason for the illusion&rdquo; was not convincing, those people have seen UFOs, but that&rsquo;s about as far as it goes. There&rsquo;s nothing to do with the information but spread it to people willing to believe it. You wish you, the original observer, could replay the event for an audience and then they would agree.I don&rsquo;t remember any specific events I&rsquo;ve seen on TV, but I remember the number of them and their variation. It struck me that what seemed likely was that we do have ET visitors, and not just a few. What rules they follow to stay so relatively unobserved, I have no idea. Perhaps they have a Visitor&rsquo;s Association, some compact as to how to deal with Terra of Sol. Ground rules. I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m teasing. But maybe they do have a Prime Directive of non-interference. Perhaps our over-steroided secret military is playing gags on us and having fun inventing variations on the &ldquo;craft&rdquo; theme for chuckles. In what I observed, I don&rsquo;t think the human race, in any secret laboratory, has yet produced any technology that could make an object move as I observed a particular UFO move. I only saw actual UFOs once (a total of nine craft), but may have had an earlier sighting at Crane Beach, which I&rsquo;ll describe.I tell you flatly that what I saw was no illusion and no trick of nature. It was in Cambridge, Massachusetts, at roughly 3:30 AM, 12 January 1988*. I lived at the end of Dudley Street at the time, near the Arlington border and an eight-block hike from the end of the Red Line. It was the dead of night in Winter, absolutely, perfectly still and silent, with a thick covering of snow over everything. The sky was clear and dark as it could be being near Boston, the streetlights did little to interfere. The stars were out.I was unemployed at the time so being up at 3:30 AM was usual. Even by January 12th I had not shut the storm windows and didn&rsquo;t want the extra cold draft anymore, so I opened the inner window - I have to guess and am probably wrong but I think the window faced away from Boston, so a map should show the direction of my view. I couldn&rsquo;t get the storm window to close from the inside, so I leaned out of the (third floor) window so that I could rotate to face the window to start closing it from the outside. I managed to face the window, but not at the angle I wanted to so I tried to &ldquo;unrotate&rdquo; and try again, and in that moment something caught my attention, and I turned my head to see what it was.I saw &ldquo;phosphorescent orange&rdquo; things for a moment but had some impression of sparks to one side of my view, so I quickly looked for them to my left (remember I am looking upward at about a 45-degree angle - looking left was looking up at about 60-degrees.) By the time my gaze had shifted, the sky there was black, so I looked back for the orange impression and now I saw eight craft. It took me about 150 milliseconds to quit worrying that I was seeing UFOs and just look at them, because of course I had never seen them before and I wanted to see everything I could.The eight craft were in a perfect formation, a sort of octagonal oval. Imagine a square, the four points of the square are four craft, and then at equal distances fore and aft the lead and tail pairs of craft are inset somewhat, making an &ldquo;oval&rdquo;. They were, I&rsquo;m guessing, roughly 150 feet off the ground and at first sight about one or two city blocks away. They were gliding absolutely smoothly and noiselessly - no sound reached me. I would estimate their air speed as about 20 mph - not fast. At first sight I was able to see them in some relief (their sides as well as their bottoms.) I&rsquo;m sorry to disappoint you, but they in fact looked like a classical Hollywood flying saucer**, more or less. I recall a dome shape atop; I don&rsquo;t recall whether there were or weren&rsquo;t seams between the dome portion and the rest. Dome-to-side came down curving, and it seemed there was the classical &ldquo;skirt&rdquo; flange along the bottom edge of the craft, that &ldquo;foil&rdquo; at the bottom edge familiar from movies. The craft themselves (their undersides) were of a similar oval shape (the phrase &ldquo;horseshoe crab&rdquo; wishes I would use it.) They appeared to have flat bottoms with a particular lighting; the spectacular thing about these craft was their color and light; they &lsquo;glowed&rsquo; softly, as if luminescent/phosphorescent, a particular color which I describe as &ldquo;salmon orange&rdquo;. The light came from every part of the craft, but there was no apparent &ldquo;reason&rdquo; they should seem bathed in the light that I could see. The bottom sides of the craft had a thick annulus of a darker orange color meeting the outer edge, and spaced at intervals within the annulus all around were dark squares. For some reason I assumed those had to do with levitation and propulsion. In the center of the bottom, enclosed by the annulus, the color was again as bright as on the outside.In the time it took to observe these details, the craft had closed the distance to my house by half and I could only observe the undersides of the craft. Then something again caught my attention &ldquo;out of the corner of my eye&rdquo; to my left, and I turned quickly to see what it was. This time it took a moment to see what was happening, and my jaw dropped. An object - smaller than the other craft, more spherically symmetrical, almost cubic but impossible to tell, lit more strongly than the others with the same color light, was making short excursions in free space that appeared to violate the laws of conservation of momentum. It zipped. I could follow its movements but it was exceedingly fast. It appeared to be even closer to me at one point, perhaps 80 feet above, but it zipped off - always in straight lines - at crazy and acute angles from its previous direction - instantaneously. And it did this at a rate of two to three times per second. I&rsquo;ll estimate that the straight-line paths were 50 to 100 feet in length. This thing moved as if it were a bullet ricocheting inside a steel-walled chamber, but it was doing this in free space, in three dimensions. I had the chance to observe about 7-10 such cycles before it passed out of view over my house, and still astonished I wheeled back to catch the others but they passed overhead and out of view in a few more seconds. I wasted several seconds fussing with the window to get it closed, and then I raced to the front of the house to the veranda but there was no sign of them on what I thought might be their path. Chickenshit that I was (how many people get to see UFOs?), and living on the third floor with no shoes or socks on in the dead of Winter, I regret that I did not just run downstairs and outdoors, snow be damned and look for them. I think I rationalized at the time that I had seen them in any case, so not seeing more of them was not going to erase that I had now seen them.I think the &ldquo;sparks&rdquo; I first thought I saw was this ninth craft, that when I tried to see the &ldquo;sparks&rdquo; the craft had simply been blocked from view by the house. I remember the sense of confusion in my visual cortex as to what to look at, and I think this craft was what actually drew my attention to begin with, even though it initially passed out of view almost immediately. I got the impression that this ninth craft was some sort of scout for the other craft, a lookout. I wondered that they came at all, coming when they did means everyone&rsquo;s asleep - and not a soul was stirring that night (in that neighborhood) but me. I wondered if they detected my presence or observation - if it mattered to them, whether they had taken notice and made any changes to escape observation. It seemed to me they deviated their course because they did not emerge on the other side of the house where I thought they should (see Figure 1.) They would have to have changed course 15 or more degrees, based on where I didn&rsquo;t see them.Oh well, that one time. Except for Crane Beach. A few weeks before this sighting, in my Noir mood being depressed and unemployed, I went to Crane Beach - I&rsquo;d gone once before. I always took binoculars, I had a spectacular 7&times;50 that I could see the moons of Jupiter with (try that! It&rsquo;ll rock your world.) Again it was the dead, dead of night (probably in the same time frame, between 0315 and 0400), nobody around, nice and spooky, at the water&rsquo;s edge, the Atlantic. I was there for a while looking at stars. The sky was very clear. Finally I got a little restless to get going, watched a few jets, and then saw another &ldquo;jet&rdquo; - but this one was interesting. It was brighter than the other planes but it was colored, whereas the other jets all used white lights, this one was - slightly reddish orange. The same color as the later UFOs. I thought that was curious and I followed it, and then another thing struck me: this thing appeared to be miles and miles out to sea, yet it was traveling really fast across the horizon proceeding South, which meant that its objective speed had to be even faster. It was much faster than the lazy jets nearing Boston. There is a spit of land (Rockport) &rsquo;south&rsquo; of Crane Beach (Figure 2.) Against the 2D backdrop of the coastline with the spit in the &ldquo;upper right&rdquo; (Figure 3), the object seemed to near the spit and then made a change of path - which astonished me because it was almost exactly orthogonal to its original path. It didn&rsquo;t bat an eyelash or change its speed in any way but it executed a 90-degree turn instantaneously (like the cars hitting corners in &ldquo;Tron&rdquo;) and proceeded in a direction that now took it away from the spit and out to sea. I remember thinking about it at the time, if I had really seen that object do what it had seemed to do. I gave up, and chalked it to memory. That memory was awakened shortly after the direct UFO sighting; if these UFOs could do it, so could that thing, whatever it was. Whatever it was at Crane Beach was much larger than what I saw in Cambridge.I would like to see them again.* I made certain to memorize the date. The time may be off a bit.** There are &ldquo;two kinds&rdquo; of hollywood flying saucer. One has a hemispherical dome atop in the center of a wide circular disk, whose surface is mostly parallel to the ground - a plate. This is probably the more &ldquo;modern&rdquo; idea once designers got into it. The other kind has more superstructure or &ldquo;cabin&rdquo; above, whose sides are more upright. My kind was the second kind. I am reminded of the CSS Virginia (aka the Merrimack), with the beveled sides.Figure 1: location of direct sighting. I walked home from Alewife station. The red line shows their path, however once they crossed the black dot representing my house, I lost sight of them. You can see why I thought I should be able to see them from the front side of the house. The number &ldquo;one&rdquo; or what looks like an exclamation point on the red line is where the craft were when I first saw them.Figure 2. Crane Beach, the location of the first sighting.Figure 3. My attempt to depict the view from Crane Beach as seen by an observer on the shore. Bad job, but you see the &ldquo;spit&rdquo; at the &ldquo;upper right&rdquo;. The orange line shows the path of the craft, including the 90-degree turn, but I&rsquo;m too poor with The Gimp to give a correct impression how far out to sea the &ldquo;orange path&rdquo; is or how much distance on the horizon the craft covered.((END TEXT))", "Myself and my sister-in-law where heading back home after being out for the night, on Highway 99 heading towards Elk Grove.  I saw an enormous bounging (light) heading towards us. (It stayed on the freeway) bouncing up and down and shot straight into the sky and disappeared.  I then looked over to my sister-in-law and she was staring back at me and I asked her if she just saw what I had seen.  She said yes; a big bouncing light. (as big as the width of the freeway). A little bigger and huge. I dont really believe in UFO but this I can not explain and wanted to take it off my chest.  Thankx((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))", "Stationary object just above NE horizon with flashing red, green and white lights.Watched stationary object just above NE horizon that had red, green and white flashing lights.  It nevered moved.  Kept checking on it until approx. 22:00.Watched thru binoculars and could clearly see flashing lights.  There was a street light below the flashing light so we could easily see that the object was not moving.", "strange lights in skyFather went out to smoke and called me out.  We saw two shapes to the west that at first looked liked stars.  Then we slowly witnessed them move.  One moved very very slowly.  One did not seem to move until a plane came near it. Then almost as soon as the plane was a little bit away it dipped down very low then slowly dissapeared. We watched the other slower moving one for a few more minutes.  It just seemed to hover. Not sure what happened to it.  Had to come in.((NUFORC Note:  Stars or planets??  PD))", "2 Large Boomerang Shapes seen in night sky in Encino, CA.At approximately 19:15 hours on October 20th 2008 I went out on my second story apartment balcony which faces north/northwest to have a cigarette.  Gazing east/northeast I observed a string of dark red lights in a boomerang formation travelling southeast to northwest.  The lights never changed formation leading me to speculate they were not individual objects but that they belonged to a singular object.  The light appeared to blink in a tip-to-tip sequence, alternating starting points.The object was occluded from my view after about 30 seconds due to a very large tree in my building courtyard, so I moved to the other side of the porch hoping that the object&apos;s path would allow it to be visible on the other side of the tree.  It unfortunately was not.I did however continue to gaze into the sky hoping maybe it would appear.  About 5 or 10 minutes after the initial sighting, I happened to look back in the direction I originally saw the object only to see it AGAIN or an identical object traveling in the same exact  path as the first object.  I would estimate this sighting was the same duration, my view being once again occluded by the large tree. This second object as it passed seemed to me to be followed by one or two aircraft.  Whether these were  jet or helicopter I am not certain.As far as judging the size of these two objects, I was asked by the gentleman manning your hotline to approximate using the full moon as my measure.  Based on this I can say that the objects tip to tip could have touched the top and bottom of a late evening full moon, if not complete wrap around it.I am no aviation expert but having lived in this area for over two years I am quite accustomed to hearing and seeing commercial jets and private headed for LAX or Burbank pass over my building.  Had this object been one of these judging from its size, it would have been extremely low and emitting very loud engine noise.  There was no discernible noise coming from these objects.My wife who would have normally been here is away on business so I was the sole witness to this event unfortunately.", "I was driving on I-81 heading south. I could see stars. Clear and cold. I first Spotted the craft at about 1 o&apos;clock and it seemed to lift upward and began to head north over the interstate. I pulled my rig to the shoulder and got out. I looked up and the craft was shaped like a triangle. Red blinking and orange blinking lites. Seemed to be about 300 or so above me. It was just hovering. No noise. It kind of looked as though it had two tubes the length of the craft. Then it began to move north slowly. Then it moved behind a mountain. I began to drive again and came into a dense fog bank. Only fog I encountered.", "Large Triangle sighted over L.AAt approx 8:30 pm on Sat, Oct 11 2008, Noticed what I assumed to be an airliner with landing lights on and travelling east to west. (from direction of South Pasadena and toward Hollywood/Los Feliz area of Los Angeles).As it passed just south of my position, I realized it was not a plane but an equilateral triangle with a bright white light at each of the three points. Each light was facing downward rather than forward along the line of flight. Each light was very bright but easily seen to be circular in shape with no glare.Most notable was that the lights were just as visible as the craft was moving away from my position. This is when I realized fully that this was not a plane as there was no tail- no navigation lights and the three lights were obviously not illuminating the way ahead! There was no sound.", "Triangular craft with white glowing lightsMy friend and i were driving, heading westbound on a near by dirt road, when a glowing light caught my eye. This wouldn&apos;t be the first time a glowing light has grabbed my attention before because i&apos;ve spotted this same craft three times already. It was dark outside, but you could definately see the distinct shape of the ship- a triangle. It had two white larger lights glowing on each side of it, and four white smaller lights in the direct center.  I watched it for a good 30 seconds and it shot up right, paused- hovering, floated a little more to the right, then shot straight up into the air and disappeared.", "Ball of light at high speed  I was taking some friends out for a harbor cruise and while I had to boat in reverse backing out of the dock I saw what I thought was a shooting star as I said &quot;Oh look a shooting star&quot; then I thought about it and was like shooting stars have tails and this didn&apos;t.  It was a ball of white light moving at a high speed from moving from South-East to North-West.  I only saw it for a couple seconds then it was gone.((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor, we suspect.  We spoke with the witness via telephone, and none of the other people present witnessed the event, which occurred on October 30, not 31.  PD))", "Orange Lights in Dallas.Just wondered if any one else saw three orange lights that moved to the west in a pattern then went into a circle as they moved.  I just happen to be walking outside to the garden and looked up and saw three light, smaller than the moon and bigger than stars or planets.  Bigger than lights from a plane.  It was such a quick sighting due to the tree getting in the way.  I live near an airport and if it was a plane or some other aircraft i think i would have heard it easily. They had no sound.  If it were the way the moved  the speed and the formation they could not have been balloons with flairs.It was such a quick sighting on my part, I just wondered if anyone else got more than I got from my sighting.  I thought it so strange that i was hoping someone else saw it.Thanks for posting.", "Strange Pulsating Red Light Vanishes Without A Trace,As a U.F.O. enthusiast, I almost never expect to see anything out of the ordinary, flying in the night skies, especially where I&apos;m from. I work a part-time job, in a small city. It&apos;s sort of a one in a million chance that anybody will ever see something that they might think was a U.F.O. in their lifetime. I have been extremely lucky enough to have had more than two strange sightings of lights in the sky in my lifetime, so far, and had never given thought to reporting any of them, until now.Tonight, my girlfriend and I were leaving a friend&apos;s house, and we both happened to catch a glimpse of something just above the roof tops across the street. In the distance, if not just within the city limits, just outside the border, there was a glowing red light flying not too high in the sky. It was pulsating at a slow, random pace. The red light would slowly fade from bright red, to orange, to yellow, and white, then then start all over again. We do have a local airport a few miles outside of town, so usually I dismiss lights in the sky right away, thinking they belong to a small plane on it&apos;s way to the little airport. But we waited to see if the object would reveal any blinking lights that would give away the fact that it was only a small airplane, which it did not. Instead, after about two and a half minutes of observing the pulsating object in the sky, it disappeared just before it would have vanished behind some massive trees in our sight. It went from red, to orange, to yellow, and then it was gone, as if the light itself just turned off. We waited a minute longer to see if it would pop up again on the other side of the trees, but it never did. After that, my girlfriend and I got in my car and drove out to the edge of town, which wasn&apos;t that far, to see if we could spot it leaving, but there was nothing. Not even airplanes from the local airport, or commercial airliners. It was just stars in the night sky. About ten minutes later, I called my friend, where we had just left, and told him about the sighting. He then walked outside, and witnessed at least three &ldquo;shooting stars&rdquo; toward the same area the object was headed, within a couple of minutes time.Unfortunately I had no means to record this sighting. I do have my own camcorder, but it was at home, and I had my phone on me, which has a video recording device built into it, but it wouldn&apos;t pick up anything that faint and distant at night time. Normally I would only share a story like this with friends, but this sighting was just too bizarre to keep to myself. I thought maybe if I sent this story to you tonight, someone else who could&apos;ve possibly seen the object might write to you, or someone else about it. I do not expect a response from this report. Either way, I know what we saw, and it wasn&apos;t an airplane. Maybe now I will learn to always keep my camcorder on me, so that one day, I may contribute a good piece of evidence to the ever growing library of U.F.O. videos. It&apos;s just being in the right place, at the right time.", "cluster of white lights that changed shapesI and my two daughters were coming out of a restaurant when I looked up into the sky as I was stretching and I saw a bright light which I thought was the north star, but it was in the southern hemisphere. We got in the car and drove home all the time watching it. Before we reached our home, I pulled over and got out my binoculars to look at this light. It was not an aircraft because it had not green or red obstruction lighting. It just hung there. Through my binoculars it looked like a rectangle with piece broken off at the end. Then a red light appeared on the end. It then turned into a cluster of round white lights. Then a red light appeared in it. The red light went away and a wide line appeared through the center of it. The line faded away and it remained a cluster of white lights. My daughters looked and it and said it looked like it was turning. When I looked at it again the lights went from bright white to a purple, then went out and we never saw it again. I have seen a lot of things in the sky and have dismissed all of what appeared to be out of the ordinary as some type of aviation craft that I am not familiar with. However this is just something I cannot explain.", "Two sightings in one night and within 5 minutes of each other.I&rsquo;m guessing at the date, even the exact year, since this happened so long ago but it was either 1976 or 77, in the summer and the time was around 2AM. My wife and I had been visiting friends in Sunrise and were heading south on University Drive toward our apartment on 70th Ave, just south of NW 5th St. in Plantation, Fl.About a mile or so after we turned south onto University Drive from Oakland Park Blvd, I noticed a single red light off to the east. I didn&rsquo;t think anything of it as I thought that there was a radio tower in that direction. We continued south on University and after we left the light at Sunrise Drive I noticed that the red light was still off to the east. I remember thinking, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s weird, that light should be behind us by now.&rdquo; As we dove further south, maybe around Cleary Blvd, both my wife and I noticed that the light was moving SW and furthermore it looked like it was on an intersect path with University Drive. As we approached the traffic light at NW 5th St. and University Drive we both commented that the &ldquo;light&rdquo; was coming directly in our direction and was very close, within a few hundred yards. I stopped the car at the traffic light and we both looked out our windows and watched this &lsquo;thing&rsquo; fly directly over us at a very slow speed...maybe 25 MPH, if that fast. The craft was also at a very low altitude, maybe 500-750 feet. The strange thing was that neither of us heard any engine sound at all. Not a prop engine, jet engine or chopper engine was to be heard. There was no sound at all that either of us could make out. After sitting there for what seemed several minutes, probably in shock, I made the turn east onto NW 5th St. heading toward 70th Ave where I had to go south one block to the entrance to our apartment building. As I made the turn I asked my wife something to the effect of &ldquo;You saw that right?&rdquo;  Yes was the answer and started to talk about what we had just seen. Although neither of us could clearly make out a distinct shape, we knew that we had seen &ldquo;something&rdquo; and whatever it was it was strange to say the least. This discussion continued for another minute or so when we both went quiet. There, dead ahead of us, out in the eastern sky, was another red light. This was probably around the 73rd Ave block of NW 5th St., just west of the new city hall. As we approached the intersection of NW 70 Ave this red light suddenly erupted into a display of different colored lights. There were red, green and yellow lights flashing on and off in no distinct pattern for maybe 10 seconds and, again it returned to just the single red light. I pulled over onto a swale area where there was a mailbox on the right side of the road. I told my wife to get out of the car as I wanted us both to make sure that we were seeing the same thing. The red light seemed to be stationary for a minute or two as we stood there watching. Again I asked my wife if she had just seen the light display that I had seen. She answered yes and then we both observed that the light seemed to be moving toward our position. We stood there on the side of the road watching as this craft passed almost directly overhead. It was, like the first craft, about 500-700 feet altitude. The night was still, not a car in sight and I had cut the engine of the car. This time we both could make out a distinct, but faint, low toned hum as the &lsquo;thing&rsquo; passed over. We both could also make out, against the night sky, that the red light was on the bottom of the craft and that it was circular in shape, almost a perfect circle it seemed. The craft again was moving very slowly, 20 M! PH or so , and heading south by southwest. When we noticed this we both said, almost simultaneously, that it looked like it was heading to meet up with the first craft that we had seen just a few minutes earlier at University and NW 5th St. We watched as long as we could see the light, got into the car and drove the block south on 70th Ave to our apartment. I immediately went to the kitchen phone and called the Plantation police department to ask if anyone had reported a unidentified craft at either of the intersections where we had witnessed these things. The officer kind of laughed and said no. I then called the Ft. Lauderdale airport and asked if they had anything on radar out in our area. Again the answer was no. Neither my wife or I ever made an official report of any kind during our time together. We separated in 1989 and divorced in 1992 and lost contact so I don&rsquo;t know if she has ever reported it. I have only told a handful of people about this until now and am only reporting it now because my current wife found this web page.

I run a small business here in Fayetteville N.C.  I have never been a real UFO enthusiast or anything but have always been a very open minded thinker. So the other day I got a phone call from my mom telling me to contact my sister ASAP.  My sister lives in Marshalltown Iowa 1,100 miles away.  She also has to pay for outgoing long distance calls so normally we talk when I call her.  As soon as I dialed and said hello she says, very enthusiastically, &ldquo;brother you&rsquo;re not going to believe what I saw today!&rdquo;   What was it?  I asked.  She proceeded to tell me how she was driving downtown towards the post office when she noticed an extremely bright object in the sky that appeared to be a floating star.  She described the object as being at least two stories high and definitely within the city limits.   She told me that she had no idea what it was but that she stopped and got out of her vehicle to get a better look.  When she got out looking towards the sky, she said the object was gone.  I thought about this for a moment and asked her what she thought she saw.  She said she had no idea but that it didn&rsquo;t make sense the object had vanished so quickly.  I tried to offer her a reasonable explanation by telling her that it&rsquo;s possible for sunlight to reflect off an aircraft very brightly and seemingly disappear when the aircraft changes direction slightly in the sky.   She was not totally satisfied with this and responded by telling me that the aircraft would have been flying too low.  When the conversation was over she seemed calmed down some.  I should mention that to her credit my sister is a very intelligent and grounded person.  Not one to make up such stories.  I believed she saw something. The next day I had pretty much forgotten all about the phone call with my sister.  My business associate and I had just finished services at one of our customer&rsquo;s property.  This was on Vista dr.  We both got into the truck and as I was starting the ignition I looked up.  Immediately I was struck by what I saw.The aircraft was big.  I&rsquo;m estimating it to be about the size of a Boeing 747 passenger jet.  It was shaped almost like a blimp, &ldquo;and this was the first thought that came to my mind&rdquo;, but longer giving it an even more aerodynamic look.  It was very luminescent.  I could not make out any distinguishable shapes like you would expect to see on an aircraft besides the color.  The color had the appearance of mercury and I could also see some red towards the front upper portion. No tail, no undercarriage, no wings.   My mind was racing like lightning.  After about 3 seconds I yelled to my partner, &ldquo;LOOK!&rdquo;  And I pointed skyward.  She looked up, but not quick enough.  The craft, which was traveling at about 60 mph, had entered into the tree line overhead.  She looked back at me and I was still looking upward.  I saw it for about 2 more seconds through the trees and then disappeared back over the tree line.  I was AMPED!  I hit the gas and we began speeding through the neighborhood.  I was definitely getting another look at this thing!  I turned a sharp right at the corner and tore down the road.  We went about 7 blocks.  All the while I was looking madly up at the sky trying to see around the trees and get a better look.  It took me about 30 seconds to get to a better area.  I pulled into a parking lot and got out of the truck.  From this position I had a good 360 degree view.  It was a mostly clear sky and I could see for miles in the direction that the aircraft should have been headed.  Even then I expected to see something that made sense.  It must have been some kind of blimp or something.  There was nothing.  I was completely astounded.  Why didn&rsquo;t I see something in the sky?  What the hell did I see?  It shouldn&rsquo;t have been possible at the speed it was traveling to elude my range of vision when I could now easily see for miles.  This all happened at about 1: pm Oct, 21, 2008.At this point my partner was looking at me like I had gone bat shit.  So I gave her the phone and made her call the airport.  At this time I spoke to Trisha in the radar tower.  I asked her if any aircraft were currently flying above the downtown area.  She asked me what I had seen and I said that I wasn&rsquo;t sure maybe a blimp.  She told me to hold on and then came back on the phone.  She told me that I had probably seen one of the many military aircraft that fly over Fayetteville.  I told her, &ldquo;No Trisha, I want to know if you have any communication right now with any aircraft over the downtown area and if so, what specifically?&rdquo;  She said that a C-130 had been flying over the downtown area.  I told her that,&rdquo; no it was not a C-130.&rdquo;  I used to jump out of this type of aircraft when I served in the military.  It is very easy for me to identify.  I should also note that I have lived in Fayetteville for 7 years now.  Being local for so long, and near Pope air force base, I am very used to looking up in the sky and seeing military aircraft.  You see everything from warthogs and C-130s to Chinook helicopters, to name a few.  Also, I live less than I mile from the air force base and have seen many different types of military aircraft, in the sky, on routine training flights. After I spoke with Trisha in the radar tower I was both very excited and very confused.  I thought for sure that they would have some sort of explanation that made sense.  No, they had nothing.  Later that afternoon I called the police station and spoke with a dispatcher.  She had no other reports of anomalous objects in the sky.  I&rsquo;m not sure if she made a report of my story or not but I told her everything.  I also called the airport back and spoke to Trisha again.  No one else had called in at all.  She gave me a number to Pope AFB.  I called and left a message to call me back please.  No one has called.  That was 48 hrs ago. I have no easy explanation for what I experienced.  The events surrounding this seem just extraordinary, for example; my sister calling the day before.  Interestingly enough the presidential nominee Barrack Obama was here last weekend.  McCain is coming this weekend.  Do these things relate?  I can only speculate about that as I try to make some sense of things.  Another wild coincidence is that Great Britain just released a 1,500-page batch of top secret documents that were UFO related.http://news.aol.com/article/britain-releases-more-ufo-sighting-files/217434?icid=200100397x1211165486x1200734593  Although I&rsquo;m not sure exactly what I saw I can tell you this.  Visibly it seemed immediate that it was anomalous.  It should have been in the sky longer.  The radar tower should have known what it was.  Many other people should have seen this as it was almost directly above downtown Fayetteville.  My sister believes she also saw something anomalous in the sky 24 hours prior to my experience.  Somehow this is all absolutely PHENOMENAL.", "I saw three orange lights hovering above the horizen that slowly changed colors then vanished.My friend and I were driving in my &apos;96 dodge ram sport southeast towards Miami, TX on farm to market road 283.  About three hand spaces above the horizon I noticed three iridescent orange lights in a triangle shape.  They were very slowly changing from orange to green.  They hovered where they were for approximately two minutes when my friend asked if I was seeing what he was seeing. I said yes, and then we started trying to see if they were reflections from some lights in the pickup cab.  I hung my head out the window and the lights were still in the same position.  They seemed to be rotating clockwise very slowly, almost imperceptibly.  We both watched them for another minute or so when they disappeared.  My friend thought they just blinked out, but I thought I saw them zoom away to the northeast at a speed that made them seem like they disappeared.  The lights never really did change colors completely to green but seemed to shimmer and have a green tinge.", "Unknown , roughly shaped object spotted over North LondonI spotted it by chance outside my window after I woke up.  At first I thought it was a set of balloons, but when I looked more closely, part of it was swaying sideways(perpendicular to its direction of motion).  It was difficult for me to make out because it was a bit far, but it looked like a banner with embedded balloons or something of sort. It wasn&apos;t very long. Its Length was twice its height. It was floating silently to the west, too fast for a balloon. To my estimate, it was about the speed slightly less than a helicopter at normal cruise. Later it changed direction to northwest and started ascending slowly as it became less visible, until it was too far to be seen. This all lasted less than 5 minutes. It had various colours, mainly purple and a yellow, roughly spherical part that was swaying. The background was cloudy. Almost immediately before I spotted the object I heard the sound of a helicopter which is common in my area, but the sound came from somewhere else and it stopped after a few seconds.", "small yellow-white light seen in De Soto , MOIt was the 24th of October and my friend and I just got done playing a video game. As we were getting ready to head to bed I noticed a small light slightly above the horizon. I pointed it out to my friend to make sure I was not seeing things, as I had seen this light before but a different color and slightly more to the right.  He saw it too; we both stopped and watched it for several minutes.  We turned out all the lights and TV to make sure it wasn&rsquo;t a reflection, and since I live 13+ miles from town and 2 miles from the nearest person, I knew it wasn&rsquo;t that. About 4 minutes in we saw the light slowly move back and forth in a half circle motion. We both realized that we were seeing what we were seeing and freaked out and went into another room to see if our buddy who was sleeping would see it. We woke him up and took him in to the room to see if he could see it but the light was gone.This was not the first time this object was seen. I (the one writing this) have seen it outside my house in a field across from my window.  The only thing different is it looked like it was a yellow-blue light when my friend saw it,  but white-yellow when I saw it (about 4 days earlier and 13-14 days before that one). This may sound like a lot of BS but its not and my friend and I would like to know if anyone has seen anything like it in my area (De Soto, Missouri). This is the my first time my friend and I have seen that we cannot explain in any way", "VERY bright red-orangish light seen over silver lake---Lake Michigan AreaThe object was very bright..then it would dim a little bit..not by much, It would get very bright and turn an orangish-red color..it was kinda hazy looking because of the distance it was from us. It seemed to stay in position for quite some time,the direction of the craft was out by silver lake over the lake michigan area. There was one object seen where me, my bf, and my mom were at. It did not move fast, but after about 15 minutes it moved a couple inches over where trees were in view, but i could still see the object through the trees from the distance i was at, i know for a fact that it was a ufo.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

She say the same thing occured at just about the same time. She saw the same Orange ball but moving south and alone. I think it is interesting that a few days later a similar sighting was seen in Mexico. If trends continue, Brazil should get some new sightings very soon. Please, check it out. I think there is a pattern to these things. I could be wrong but maybe now there is a pattern to them as far as they are watching. Maybe you can have a rough estimate as to where they show up next.Please understand that I am a multiple college degree person and I do know the difference between objects. I was once on highway 395 and in a second I knew a plane was a steath bomber. While I can&apos;t explain what I saw at times, it was not from here. I am one more testimony and for the doubtful, I can only say keep watching the skies. You may, if lucky, experience something you cannot explain. I consider it a gift.Good luck,  Me.", "The three bright objects seemed to be fading from dim to very bright for about fifteen minutes, just as we have seen before many times.My fiance and I saw a bright light in the southern sky, about 10:00 high, while driving south on U.S. 31 heading home. It appeared to be about 5 or 6 miles away from us. As we came up to the intersection of U.S.26 and 31, a second object appeared to the left of the first. They were fading from bright to dim. As we turned the corner and pulled into our drive, we observed the the first object get very bright, then vanish. Then a third object appeared just left of the second one. They were about 2 miles from us at this point. They seem to have red and blue (or greenish) lights flashing when they became very bright. I watched them for about 10 minutes longer, fading in and out, then, they both vanished. There were clouds moving behind the ojects, so we know they were not stars. We have witnessed these kind of events many times from our back yard. We know they are not Air Force jet flares, because, the night after, when we have reported these events, the jets are in the same area as we report, shooting off flares. There is no comparison to the events we have seen to the flares.The following night, at approximately the same time, but closer to us, we witnessed the same event, except there were only two this time. The first showed up, fading in and out for about ten minutes, then the second showed up. I called my daughter, who said that one was over the top of her house. Then she said it dissapeared. About the same time, the first light seemed to have moved to the west close to the horizon, then shot off to the north. After about ten minutes longer, the second object, just seemed to fade out, and was gone.", "East Tennessee, 3 orb mass in the skyMy girlfriend and I were driving down a hill and saw a triangle shaped lights. One large in the middle and 2 smaller balls on the sides, the lights was orange. I couldn&rsquo;t tell if the lights were jointed together or if they were separate. The object was large with about 1 mile away over a cliff and water. When we saw the orbs in the sky my girlfriend saw the three orbs but I think and not certain but I saw a small white light above the three orbs. Well we were going down the hill and I saw these orbs, and within 3 seconds they had vanished. This was out in a barren field with no street lights and no city lights. The first thing I said was &ldquo;Look it&rsquo;s the lights from Preston&rsquo;s drive way. Oddly enough about 2 years ago I saw a large orange orb in the sky that glowed in the exact same way but when I saw them back then it seemed as if their light was bleeding across the sky.  Well that&rsquo;s It.", "Bright light hovering in the fog.1 light hovering in the fog with no noise at all. It lasted about 30 seconds and was very bright.

Then the light in the middle seemed to have been shaped as a can like shape really although stubby it had a flat top at one point but it seemed that the light was off for a few minutes and then kind of flickered almost as if their were problems with it but as a few minutes passed the middle bright light was back on and remained on as I was video taping a segment that was 15 min long. As this was taking place the object in the middle was moving quite rapidly and then had seemed to at one point stand still as if it was looking at me as well. (a little creepy to say the least!) the colors were mostly a orange hue or red hue but not much more than that as the 3 white lights were really what stood out and that&apos;s what got me to look up and wonder what the heck... I was outside in the front of my house at 4 am EXACTLY as I couldn&apos;t sleep for some reason so I stepped out to have a cigarette and as I was lighting it I just glanced up and noticed these 3 bright lights that seemed to be either attached to eachother or following eachother in perfect formation.

At the beach on Halloween smoking cigarettes.  I went back to the house to get a sweatshirt and when I came back my brother was yelling at me telling me to hurry up.  When I meet up with him, he and my other friend were watching these two objects in the sky.  They were pretty far away, looked like they were above Los Angeles.  They did not move like planes, or helicopters.  The two objects were dancing in the sky, like kites, or Devil Rays in the ocean.  It was too spectacular so I ran to the strand to get another witness.  A Hispanic man wearing a cowboy hat walking with his son of about 8 years old, an Asian man, black woman and a group of people walking down the strand all saw it.  The man and his child, watched with me for what seemed to be about 5-8 minutes.Shortly after we began watching, we saw a stream of light stretch across the sky.  It looked like a shooting star, but we figured it was too much of a coincidence and it probably was another UFO entering into the atmosphere.  We never saw it join up with the other two objects.  We watched the two dancing, lighted objects for about 10 minutes, until they were gone.When it all was happening, they were shaped like kites.  Not really sure of how many lights there were, but they changed from bright white, and the occasional single red light.  From our view, they looked like they would dive down to the ground and float back up above the clouds.  They never traveled in straight lines,  more random directions, again they looked like they were dancing or playing with each other.  This is my story and this morning I have looked on the net to see if they were other witnesses of the event.  Have yet to find any report of it.  This is surprising to be because it was over Los Angeles which has one of the busiest air traffic area in the country.  It did not appear that any helicopters were following the lighted objects.", "5-6 red globes hovering, then just disappearedMe and my cousin were driving back to school, when all of a sudden I looked out the window and saw about 5-6 red globes in the sky. We were heading North, so we would have seen the objects in a easterly direction from where we were. We were on a long, dark road, and there were no other cars around. I immediately told my cousin to pull the car over, and we watched the objects for about 2 minutes before they disappeared. It didn&rsquo;t seem like they flew away, they just vanished. While we were watching the objects, they seemed to stay in an ellipse formation, but one of the globes tended to move around. While we were on the road, we pulled over in front of a house and observed these globes at about a 45 degree angle. Although upstate NY is very hilly, the area we were at was surrounded by fields, and we could see forever. There is no doubt in my mind that this/these objects were in the sky and not on the ground. The objects in the sky were red, or giving off a red glow, were it was the most red on the outer part, and it seemed to get lighter in the middle of each little ball. Besides the red globes, we couldn&rsquo;t make out a defined shape of object, just this little cluster of these 5-6 red balls. I don&rsquo;t know if it was a coincidence or not, but as soon as we saw the objects, I tried to make a phone call, and my phone wouldn&rsquo;t work. The area always has service, so it wasn&rsquo;t a dead spot, but my phone wouldn&rsquo;t connect. The sky was very clear that night, and the moon seemed to light up everything. Central NY seems to be a high traffic area for airplanes, as they are seen flying over all the time, and at the time we saw this, there were a few planes in the air. There is no possibility that what we saw was an airplane.  These red balls were much bigger that any plane lights could have been, and based on the distance we approximated, there is no way a plane could be that big or move like they did.

The craft then moved much like a hummingbird or bee.  The color of the craft looked to me like the burnished side of alumium foil (shiny yet somewhat dulled.)The craft manuevered for one or two minutes and rolled out and upward. This movement looked like a jet whose pilot pulled back and to the right causing the craft to turn on its edge while accelarating away to the northeast.

My mother came outside and I pointed the two &quot;stars&quot; out to her and she noticed them too which reassured me that I wasn&apos;t trippin. We both deduced that it was too high to be a plane, i suggested that it might&apos;ve been satellites but reasoned that they wouldn&apos;t probably be so bright that high up and two of them probably wouldn&apos;t be so close together moving in the same direction.

He pointed it out to me as he thought it was a large aircraft coming into landing at the local airport.  We then realized it was nowhere near the airport and the lights were not bright enough to be landing lights and we came to the conclusion it was moving to slow to be a commercial jet. We continued to watch it as it went in-behind buildings, at which point we lost sight.  Minutes after we saw it emerge and change to the opposite direction it was moving originally.  The configuration of lights changed from about six scattered lights to 3 in the shape of a triangle with 1 trailing light in behind, all of which were moving at the same speed.  We continued to watch it move left to right for about ten minutes.During the time we witnessed the lights they had changed direction once, originally right to left and then left to right.  The formation, color and quantity of lights also changed. If I had to guess the distance of the formation I would say it was 10-50 miles away, if that is true then the formation would have been 1-2 miles wide.

Once I got out in the driveway of my house I saw one of the jets at about 9,000 ft altitude just shredding across the sky.  He made a couple really crazy maneuvers and then headed north of where I was located.  I was looking south. As soon as the jet made it approximately 4 or 5 miles north of my home, my attention was caught by two other jets following the previous jet.  (I believe they were either F-16&rsquo;s or F-18&rsquo;s).  As soon as they all were north of my location, as I was still looking up I saw a tremendously bright purple rectangular shaped light moving straight southbound at a speed that no human made aircraft (that we know about)  could travel at.

The ball was estimated to be approx 1,000 or more feet in elevation, glowing a bright orange then changing to a smaller object.  It kept doing this for a duration of at least ten minutes till it disappeared into a cloud bank east of the city. It was very dark out at the time and it was the bright orange that caught my attention.  As the object moved it appeared to get smaller and almost disappear but it would then appear at it&apos;s full size and color intensity.

We simultaneously asked each other what the heck they were?  At first I thought they were well-lit hot air balloons, but hot air ballons don&apos;t maneuver like these objects did.  I parked my car about 50 yards from the house, asked her to go get someone to see this--she went next door, two other women joined us-also wondering what was happening.  The objects were moving in a kind of &quot;chase me&quot; pattern (in a circle) pretty much above our heads (hard to tell how high), there was absolutely no sound.  The objects seemed to occasionally give off a thin beam, first one, then another--no pattern to it at all.  They moved slowly, then sped up, turning effortlessly.  They appeared to be roundish, somewhat &quot;glowing&quot;, and sometimes stood perfectly still,  sometimes gliding for a short distance, then coming back around to where the four of us stood.  After about 12 minutes, one of the objects went south, very very slowly...the other two went in a northwesterly direction, sometimes stopping and dropping what appeared to be large sparks from either the top or bottom.   The object that was headed south, kind of pulsated for about 7 minutes, then was simply gone.  The two headed NW would stop, start, ascend, descend, appear to come back, then go NW again.  The way they maneuvered was not like anything I had seen before.  After they &quot;dropped&quot; the sparks, they moved farther away at a very slow rate, then one blinked completely out, and about a minute later, so did the last one.  I had not ever experienced any sighting this close, this clear in my life.  I enjoy watching tv shows about UFO&apos;s but never really saw something I could not explain.  My sister, who is very down to earth (excuse the pun) and rational,! was als o mystified.  I was a bit scared, most likely due to the unknown nature of whatever it was.

I was 10.  My mother ran outside and waved her arms hoping they would see her signal.  They did.  We lived on Clough Rd, a cul-de-sac of town houses inhabited by several FBI families, a priest who lived next door to us, Gov. Volpe&rsquo;s brother and the rest mostly made up of professional type families.  At the end of the road was the Clough&rsquo;s big white farm house with stately trees dotting the land.  On the first evening, the UFO hovered above one of these trees approximately 100-500 feet above us. It shot straight up about 1:00 am.  It was a brightly illuminated oval with colored lights circling beneath. We think we saw what appeared to be windows, as well.  The second evening scenario was a repeat.  My mother called the Blue Hills Observatory in Canton, MA.  About 11:30 pm on the second evening, two Navy jets flew one above and one below the UFO (it had shot up a little upon their approach).  They flew off and repeated the maneuver flying by in the opposite direction.  On their third approach back, the UFO shot straight up and we watched until it disappeared from sight. The Navy would not respond to my mother&rsquo;s follow-up calls and asked her to stop calling. The event was witnessed by over 30 people the first night and many more the second night.

It was night time and our attention was drawn to lights moving around in the clouds overhead.  There were three lights, all of circular shape, having a blueish-white color and being somewhat brighter in the center.  At first we only noticed two lights and thought they must be search lights because the lights appeared to be going in circles.  But then as the clouds, which were closely bunched together and overlapping each other, started to seperate, the pattern of the lights movements changed and that&apos;s when we noticed a third light.  We then realized the lights didn&apos;t have a particular pattern. Their movement went according to the shape of the cloud it was in.  If the cloud had a tail the light moved out to the tip, then retraced it&apos;s path, then moved along the outside parimeter of the cloud.  All three lights were doing the same thing with the cloud it was in.  They were following the outside parimeter of the clouds no matter what shape the cloud changed into.  Then the lights started to jump from cloud to cloud.  Two lights didn&apos;t remain in the same cloud at the same time though.  One would immediately jump to another cloud when another light came into it&apos;s cloud.  It was so awesome to watch this.  My daughter and I couldn&apos;t believe what we were seeing.  It was like each light was a ball of electricity moving around in the cloud.  But there was no lightening, no thunder, no dark clouds, no storm at all.  The clouds started to loose their density and their individual shapes.  The clouds were thinning out and started to join together into one ball of mist when we noticed the lights were starting to run into each but would bounce off in opposite directions as soon as they touched.  It was like they were magnets with the polarities repelling each other.  We have no idea what we were watching but we were both very disappointed when the lights stopped.

Initially, I presumed they were military jets, but I could only hear the noise of one aircraft engine. When they reached the spot where they bisected the flight path of the commercial aircraft, both smaller craft immediately turned at a 90-degree angle and began following the commercial jet. These smaller craft did not bank, as airplanes would do - they simply changed directions in an instant. Once they changed direction, they also changed color.  Instead of blinking red and white, they were blinking red only. Further, the location of the lights changed as well. Instead of appearing to be on either side of the craft, a series of red lights blinked in sequence as if along the side of a circular craft.

The morning of the 30th of October at 5:15am as I am walking toward my car and looking up at the big dipper which was located in the North Eastern sky, what I thought was a satellite moving up the handle of the Big Dipper in a straight line was NOT a satellite at all. Satellites move in a straight line, THIS light (as bright as the stars in the Big Dipper) suddenly made a very fast right angle turn on the dime at an incredible speed so fast it made a white streak about a half an inch long if you were to hold up your thumb and index finger and measure it that way.  It was gone after that. The whole incident took about 7 seconds.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

She started freaking out and said what is that over there. I looked over and saw three huge and bright lights that lit up one after the other and were all horizontal and next to each other. They were not your normal lights and the object was definitely in the shape of a saucer. The lights were very bright and very large however they were not blinding to the eye.  The moon was full and it was very bright so you could see the object very clear. The lights disappeared and then reappeared about .25 mile to the right. I would estimate that this object was a half a mile in the air and about 1-2 miles away from us. After it lit up two times it jus disappeared. There was no streak or anything as it went away. It simply vanished. There was also no noise. This happened in a very rural area and was definitely not anything military. I think the object was about 100 yards or larger across. This was definitely a UFO and nothing else. I am positive. My girlfriend is a non believer in UFOs and is now a believer. She was so nervous and scared that she started puking on the side of the road. I am still blown away with what we saw and hope someone else spotted this the same night and will place a report. We are not alone.", "last Saturday night, around 7pm or just after, i saw a fiery orange ball, call it a sphere, call it what you will, basically idling in the cloudy sky, obviously not too high up as it was in the forefront of the clouds in the sky. my guess would be anywhere from 5 to 15 thousand feet high.i looked up after getting off my cell phone as i was also finishing a cigarette. i saw this fiery orange ball or sphere to my left up above, i stared at it as it was strange to see an orange object in front of a cloudy gray white backdrop...well, no sooner than looking at it for a second or two, it just zipped to the right moving faster than anything &quot;normal&quot; i have ever known to move.oddly enough, there was the sound of an airplane flying over too, but the airplane was clearly out of sight as it was higher than the crowded clouds. beyond the clouds so to speak.of course this orange, fiery sphere or ball exited my vision by way of Todt Hill houses and tall trees on the hill etc, from where i was standing, but it was just gone in seconds flat. very odd.it left no trail like a shooting star would and believe me i have seen those back in my college days up in Vermont, so i am not sure what the hell this orange sphere was. it moved in a straight line though and as fast as it moved or &quot;zipped&quot; streaking across the sky, why was i able to watch it go until it was out of sight or my vision plane, that i still don&apos;t know why but that is the truth to the story.i want to say it moved faster than the speed of sound, but just how fast is the speed of the human eye anyhow?", "Lighted disk stops overheadLighted disk flew from west to east above high broken cirrostratus, stopped directly overhead, then accelerated quickly eastbound.

At first I thought a plane, but I was startled enough to call my friend outside to see and he told me what I feared , that it was a ufo. The craft was hovering and slowly moving south , toward the airport. From my point of view I could see the red lights of a water tower stand still as this object moved in the background, from one side of it to the other, like it was moving further and further away the whole time strobing the length of the craft sort of giving it a shape it happened this way until about 8:08p.m. when it moved out of sight.About 25 min. later I saw two planes flying in formation which is weird because I never see that sort of thing, except for at an air  show, or on T.V. and the thing about those planes that caught my eye was that they strobed at the same time and stayed at the same altitude, flying the same length apart for what looked like the whole city .Later that night about 9:15 p.m. I was returning home from dropping off my friend, driving east on N.W. 30th street crossing N.

I remember that it was a very clear night and you could see a lot of the stars in the distance. As I was driving I noticed a very bright light simply flash off to the right of me, in the distance. At first I though it was the light on a cell phone tower, however the bright flash diminished into a small object that began to move. The object looked like a bright star that would appear and disappear several times. I kept watching the object while still driving. Suddenly it disappeared for a few seconds and then reemerged as a bright light that split into three other moving lights. The three objects moved across the sky in different directions and then simply stopped and moved back in the direction they came from. At that point I began to lose track of them because I was driving into a well-lit town, so it was hard to see anything in the sky.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

As I gazed out over Long Island sound, looking southeast toward Port Jefferson, NY, I noticed 6 bright lights hovering over the Port Jefferson area. The lights resembled glowing orbs, and appeared to be about 500 feet above the horizon. These orbs were fading and then glowing, moving up and down, and from side to side. I watched for over 1 hour as the orbs lined up to change position to set up different formations. After about 1+1/2 hours, 3 of the orbs faded and disappeared from view. The remaining 3 orbs formed a straight line, and then 1 more also faded from view.

Harbor/San Pedro area.I was on my return trip home from a night-school class, and was most certainly sober and of sound mind.My first thought was, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a shooting star&rdquo;&hellip;I&rsquo;ve seen many of those.But this was only about 200-300 hundred feet above the ground&hellip;certainly less than 1,000 feet&hellip;and it went parallel to the ground; not downward.My second thought was, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a meteor&rdquo;, due to its incredible speed.It appeared to have traveled a distance of several miles in less than a second.here was a very light, low, pre-frog haze at that time, which made the light look fuzzy; and again, due to its speed, left a tremendously long light tail.  No discernable shape other than a lightbulb.It all took less than one second, to my best estimation; too fast to have been the light of any normal aircraft.I do not suspect that it was any sort of &ldquo;craft&rdquo;; but it was something very out of the ordinary, and I would like to know what it was; or what caused it; or if anyone else may have seen &amp; reported it.", "I was driving to a liqour store, but we were all 100% sober at the time, with a friend and her son, in my car.

It was obviously at a very high altitude. None of the lights were flashing, and the object was not moving. We ended up going to 2 liqour stores, we saw it before we got to the first one, at the first one, and at the second one, and after we got home.

Between my home and Powhite Parkway I saw 2 &quot;shooting stars&quot;.  I was the only vehicle at that time of morning approaching the 75 cent Powhite Parkway toll plaza headed north bound (there was only 1 or 2 cars headed southbound).  As I was slowing down to drive through the Smart Tag lane at the toll plaza, I glanced in my rear view mirror and saw a glowing oval shaped orange light right smack dab in the middle of the back glass of my minivan (on the outside).  As soon as I noticed it, it zipped off to the right (passenger side) out of sight.  My first thought was that I had almost been rear ended and in just a split second I was thinking &quot;But HOW?  I&apos;m the only vehicle out here.&quot;  I even drove slowly through the toll plaza looking to my right for the vehicle that I thought had almost hit me and saw nothing.  I was the only vehicle.  As I continued on down the road, I was wondering what the heck I&apos;d just seen and was arguing logic in my mind.  The orange light had the shape almost of a vehicles parking light, but for a vehicle to have it&apos;s parking light that high up at my back glass, the other vehicle would have had to have been higher than me (and I think I would have seen that).  I also started noticing the parking lights on other vehicles and all car lights (other than headlights) have that black grid pattern thing within the light, so you do not see just pure orange or pure red, you also can detect the black grid within too.  THe light that I saw was not light that.  I may have only seen it for a few seconds, but I remember it clearly.  It was a pure orange/red light and when it &quot;zipped&quot; to the right, it seemed to have a light trail.  I was talking about the &quot;weird&quot; thing that I saw when I got into work and someone pointed out that we were supposed to have had a meteor shower yesterday moring before dawn.  Yes, that can account for the 2 &quot;falling stars&quot; I saw on my way to the tool booth, but I don&apos;! t think a falling meteor would &quot;hover&quot; at the middle of the back glass of a minivan and then zoom off to the right (in a straight horizontal line, I might add).  I am just baffled by what I saw.  I drove through there again this morning paying close attention to the possibility of any orangish lights around the toll plaza that may have caused a reflection of some sort.  There are NO orange lights that close to the toll plaza.  Well, at least my husband and my parents DON&apos;T think I&apos;m crazy because they agree that it just does not make sense.  I only wish that my 7 1/2 month old son could talk and tell me what he saw.  He was in his carseat facing toward the back glass.", "Shiny Silver Oval Object Over Chester, ArkansasWell I guess its your basic &quot; I was driving down the road story&quot;. I was coming back from mountainburg and was already in chester. I was heading &quot;west&quot; on old crossroads when I noticed a flash in the sky. My first thought was &quot;wow, that plane is flying low&quot;. Then when I looked back up I seen it was making a sharp curve just above the trees. I realized then that no plane can fly that way. So I did a u-turn and went to a spot close by where I knew I could pull off the road. I got out of the car and stood in the road watching this object. It was flying and making curves that a plane could never make. It would then straighten up and fly normal. Then it would slow down and wiggle from side to side. It did both the curving maneuvers and wiggling a few times. It seemed to move more of my way so I was able to get a good look. There is really nothing to explain cause it was very plain looking. It was oval shaped. Toward the edges of this object it got thin. Meaning it was alot thicker in the middle then the edges. There was no markings or windows. It didnt make a sound. But what I consider the most fascinating was the color. It was the most shiny silver color I have ever seen. It was amazing how the sun reflected from this object. I want to say it looked like a piece of polished sterling silver, but it was more shiny then silver. I can honestly say I have never seen such a brilliant piece of metal before. I literally had to shield my eyes from the glare. After it did its funny flying and wiggling a few times it slowed down again. I figured it was going to wiggle like it already had several times. But instead it took off like a bullet. It was so fast I cant even explain how fast it was! It took off in a northwest direction over the top of a mountain. It was still just above the tree line when it took off. It wasnt a large object. As a matter of fact it was rather small. I&apos;m making a guess here, but would say it wasnt over 30 feet long.", "two very bright bluish lights moving very slowly and oddlyI was riding my bike and came to the top of a hill.  I saw two very bright lights adjacent to each other that had a light bluish tint to them a few miles away to the south.  It didn&rsquo;t make any sound at all that I could hear I watched them lower from the sky straight down at a very slow, steady rate until they went behind a hill.  I rode my bike down the road and down a backroad where I thought it might have landed.  I went a few miles until it rose back up at the same steady, slow pace about &frac12; of a mile away.  I could still not hear any noise.  It started moving steadily to the northwest, and so I turned around and chased it some more.  I followed it for a while, with little luck catching it.  It went over the hill and out of sight, in the direction of Lexington, Kentucky.  I tried to get a picture with my phone, but it showed up as only a light that is indistinguishable.

As it came closer to our position, it was moving west to east, I realized that the lights were all part of one craft which was triangular in shape and a fourth light underneath became visible as well.When it was nearly overhead I pulled my van over and got out, much to the dismay of my children and a friend who was following behind, she kept screaming to get back in my car but I couldn&rsquo;t I just could not believe my eyes.

It was just after dusk so to be able to distinguish whether it was dark blue, grey or what, I only know it was a dark color with three lights around the perimeter at its triangular points and one underneath.The whole incident took nearly 4 minutes and I got the feeling we were also being scrutinized by the craft&rsquo;s occupants as we were doing the same to them.  Then the head lights of a third vehicle flashed behind me my gaze went to the oncoming car then quickly back to the craft.  Then without any sound which was audible the craft rapidly accelerated until it was a mere flash, in a split second it was gone moving eastbound at a rate of acceleration impossible for any known craft to do going from a stopped hover to a speed at which the lights began to blur as the craft raced off to the east.I have not reported this incident until now as I know people will think I am nuts but I am a Licensed Practical Nurse by profession and trained to observe and report, though this incident is permanently etched into my memory.

It almost looked kind of transperent, to a mirror chrome like object. It looked like it could have been man made, but it would be very hard,, the edges were so clean. Also the there was no sound and it moved so effortlessly. Im not a liar and i have no reason to lie. I saw what I saw, and yes it was a litgtle strange. I still think about it everyday. If i seen it again or a picture of it, I could easily identify it.Thank You, ((nme deleted))((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))", "Object was appearing in different places of the sky, changing magnitudes, and other bizzare behaviors.My Mother and I were just about to lay down on our pool deck for a cigarette and star gaze as we usually do after dinner.  As I lay down on my lawn chair (which are facing west) and looked up I saw an &ldquo;unusual&rdquo; object moving in the sky. The reason it caught my eye was because it was very bright but seemed to be very far away. The first thing I did was yell to my mom, &ldquo;What the hell is that?&rdquo; She looked up just before the object moved behind a small cloud. As it came out on the other side of the cloud it was no longer as bright as it appeared. It kept moving North (so as we lay there it look like it was moving left to right) just a little bit above Vega. After traveling for about 7 more seconds it slowly disappeared. At this point we thought that we were just looking at a satellite that, for some reason, appeared to very bright (a magnitude grater than -1) for those few seconds above us. To describe the type of light that it was giving off I used this analogy. When you are driving at night and cars are coming toward you, you notice that the head lights are sometimes a yellowish and on newer cars are more of a &ldquo;neon white&rdquo; if you will. The object in the sky looked more like the &ldquo;neon white&rdquo; headlights and the typical star and satellite look more like the yellowish headlights.Approximately two minuets later at 19:02 the same bright &ldquo;neon white&rdquo; object appeared right above us again, but his time was going the opposite direction so more towards the south west. It then looked to change its course again so now it was heading almost directly South. At this time my mom and I started to really question what we were seeing because satellites do not change their direction from heading north to heading south. As we watched the object  move &ldquo;down&rdquo; we kept saying to each other &ldquo;what the hell is that?&rdquo; it finally went out of sight. My mom told me that she was going to go get her binoculars, but I said, &ldquo;screw that we needed a video camera, my phone (to know the time), and my journal (so I could write down what I was seeing while it was still fresh in my head), and a blanket. She was gone for about 5 minuets.As she was walking up the pool deck stairs, at about 19:08 now, she asked me if I had seen it again and just as she asked me that I was looking off into the western sky below Vega but above Hercules and saw a much dimmer object that looked more like a satellite but it would appear then disappear and it did this about 5 times before it did not reappear again. What was strange was the time intervals in-between the appearing and disappearing was not constant and the light was more of a reddish light not the same &ldquo;neon white&rdquo; as before.After watching this object and its many different behaviors, I can not say that it even remotely resembled anything that I have ever seen in our night sky before. It was not an airplane because airplanes stay on one direct path, it was not a satellite because however satellites do sometimes seem to be going in and out of vision, they do not change there apparent magnitudes as drastically as this object did. I think that it is also notable that from the time my mom and I were on our pool deck (19:00 to 21:00) we saw 4 big meteors and 1 huge meteor in which we could see smoke and debris on its tail.I am a college student here in Austin and spend a lot of time studying the sky and weather I believe this was an &ldquo;alien space craft&rdquo; or just an object that I myself could not identify, is in my opinion, irrelevant. But if there is a rational explanation for what my mom and I were seeing I would love to know.", "4 Lights moving in unison then diappeared after a sudden bright flash of light over Mora county, NMOn early Tuesday morning September 30, 2008, a very dark, clear, and cool night I was driving west on NM state road 120.  Near mile marker 31 I stopped and parked facing west next to a white gate on the south side of the road.  Immediately after putting the vehicle in park I looked out my front passenger side window facing north and watched 4 lights in a diamond shape configuration moving south in unison then change direction traveling east.  I noticed the time was 1:25am.  They were solid white amber lights facing down toward the ground. The lights did not blink or flash or change color. I stepped outside of my vehicle and watched the lights with a pair of binoculars and did not notice anything different as for changing colors or flashing lights.  I kept watching with and without binoculars as it traveled in an easterly direction.  Then as I looked again for it with my binoculars I noticed a bright flash of white light thru the binoculars.  I did not see the source of the flash or where it emanated from but it did appear to come from the direction the lights were traveling in.  I was unable to keep track of these lights because they flew behind the horizon of a hill about a &frac12; mile just to the north of where I stood.   My friend on the passenger seat observed the lights in motion and the sudden bright flash of white light.   I have been a outdoorsman my whole life and know this region very well.  I am very familiar with aircraft because aircraft is a hobby and so is the night sky.   There was not a cloud anywhere in the sky that night.  And I don&rsquo;t know what the heck caused that bright flash of light to occur.  It was just like a flash of lighting at night going off in the distance is what the flash of light resembled.   Even with binoculars I never got the impression or suggestion that &ldquo;ahh&hellip;its an airplane or a jet&hellip;&rdquo;.   It was different and certainly something I had never witnessed before.   This great little experience lasted no more than 2 minutes.  After this occurred I got back insi! de the v ehicle and turned around to travel east to look for these lights about a &frac12; mile to a mile from where I was parked to get away from the hill that blocked our view and was unable to find these lights again.  Below is a simple sketch of the light configuration I saw.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It seemed stationary at first, then it started moving very slowly side to side...as I kept looking, I could see what first appeared to be an airplane coming in from the left, but when I looked at it closer there were a series of white and red lights that were flashing side to side - it was small from my angle, but I could still tell it wasn&apos;t a plane. It came in fairly near to the first bright light and stopped in mid air, then started getting brighter and brighter like someone was turning on a light switch. They both stayed stationary, and alternated between dimming and getting stronger. Then, out of nowhere, a light just flickered out of the darkness and appeared, creating a triangle - one that started moving slowly in formation, all of the lights together. Then it changed shape a bit as each light moved, and a couple of them flickered out...weirdly, though, the one bright light was still there (it never went away until the very end). For the next hour or so, more and more ships or whatever they were would come in...at one point, there were five of them, all really bright and at all different levels of the sky. These ships, again, looked like airplanes at first - but they would change direction, go directly vertical in the air, and also stop completely and become stationary. Many times, the lights would also descend below the trees so that I couldn&apos;t see them, making them too close to the earth to be a plane. Occasionally they would all go away and I would think that it was over...only to look back out a minute later and see another triangle. About an hour and a half into this, I went out to the hallway of my dorm and called 5 more people in, all of whom saw the same thing. So with me and my roommate, that makes 7 witnesses that I now know of, and I think they were going to! tell mo re people as well. The climax was near the end, when there were actually five lights that made a large V-formation, two on either arm near the top and one in the center. It very slowly rotated, and then the lights went out. This just stopped happening about five minutes ago...actually, wait - I just looked back out again and there are two more lights back in the sky, with the same pattern as before.

I looked up at the sky and saw what I at first thought was the planet Venus.  Then I noticed that Venus was a bright white light in the southwestern sky.  I saw a yellowish white round light, that seemed to hover, more to the northern than Venus.  It brightened a couple of times to bright white light, then dulled down again.  It floated one way a little then another.  I realized it was not a plane, as it hovered.  It was not a helicopter as it made no noise.  It moved very smoothly.  I went in the house to get binoculars and looked at it.  It had a red light that strobed and moved up and down the orb.  I watched it float around until it moved off into the western horizon, behind trees and out of sight.  Slowly and without noise.  My husband saw it also.  He is a pilot and knew it was not a plane.", "I observed a fireball with long tail that what I would normally consider to be a shooting star, except for color(distinctly green),size,and it was below the cloud cover.

I find astronomy very interesting and have been observing and studying the constellations in the night sky for about the past year. I even subscribe to an astronomy magazine so I am familiar with things in the night sky, but had never seen something like what I saw in the early morning of October 26.I was with my husband and we had just parked out in the country to look at the constellations. We were facing east when I saw a red light, not blinking or leaving a tail, come up from the southern sky and head north. It looked like it was going in a straight line. I could not tell if it was in the sky where plains fly or in outer space. It basically looked like a red star but moved across the sky like a plane. It took about 30 seconds for it to go across the sky. There were actual planes flying around that night and this did not look like any plane I have seen.I know this was not a meteor because it did not have a tail and stayed in the sky longer than a meteor would. It did not have any other lights on it and I couldn&rsquo;t tell what it was, I just know it was a red light that flew across the sky.", "Shape changing plasma type thing along a large jet stream in night skyOn Oct. 12 2008 approx. 21:00 toward the eastern sky my husband and I saw a large jet stream.I took several photos of it with a Sony camera.There is an object to it&apos;s upper right.

The light closer and to the east (will be further reffered to as light 1) seemed to be shone in our direction because of the way the rays came off the light and how bright it was.  Light two did not seem either as bright or to be shone in our direction.Light one seemed to be floating and not really moving in any direction until it slowly turned the light toward the south and began to move across the sky.  The light didn&apos;t seem to move in any massive speed, but it did not go slowly either. (i am a terrible judge of speed and distance)  Light #3 was in the south east and was slowly moving south.  Lights 2 and 3 were not nearly as bright as one and thus i seemed to really only watch 1.  It was also the closer light so it caught my attention more.  My stepfather was mostly watching the one from the passenger side which was in the south on his side of the car.I know what an airplane looks like as i live under the flight path for Sky Harbor and these lights did not blink and had no red to them at all.

NOT A PLANE.My family was outside on our deck. The sun had gone down about 45 minutes earlier.It was a beautiful cool autumn evening. We had been looking at the stars. We  saw a strange large and very bright light to the southwest of our town. At first it was one light that got brighter as seconds passed. From the first ball of light came a second ball of light, equally as bright. From the second ball of light came a third ball of light equal distance from the other two, equal brightness. From the third ball of light came a fourth, same exact distance and brightness. The brightness became brighter kind of like a filament in a lightbulb. Then they shut off in the same order that they appeared. This happened a few times and then it was dark. They reappeared as groups of two in a distance of atleast 40 miles from the first sighting within 20 to 30 seconds.  When the lights went out, the lights reapeared at the first location in a group if two. The lighting group became brighter until it reached the full brightness, then shut off. The location switched back and forth for aporximatley 25 to 30 minutes. What we saw, if it was all connected groupings was atleast one mile long. I am not a good judge of height at night.

PD))I recently stumbled upon your website and decided it time to report one of dozens of sightings in my life. I have witnessed dozens of flying objects as a keen sky observer and budding amateur astrologist.. but can&apos;t verify any of them as i always seem to be isolated and alone when it happens and many are most likely space junk causing &quot;shooting star&quot; like objects to fly across the night sky. I&apos;ve seen dozens of those now.I once reported to the Australian police a sighting of a perfectly round object hovering above my top floor apartment which appeared to be at least 5 miles wide.. this was ignored.. and I myself quickly wrote it off as just light refractions.My report here however is not of a UFO but of a being. I had walked out of my home late at night as i was studying.. it was approximately 1999.. so i cannot recall the exact date. The night was still and silent with no wind.I walked outside my back yard.. and spotted a white figure.. i estimate it to have been 4 feet tall.. and was all white with a subtle glow. I stood in frozen shock as we faced each other off for approximately 3 minutes. We stood only 5 meters apart so I could make out the shape but could not discern a face nor shoes.. it was completely white. In that time the object sat on top of my fence at the rear of my backyard which fell into parkland behind it, and made no effort to run away.. It did not move for the whole time, even as i approached- i got spooked when i was 5 meters away though and stopped purely because this figure did not seem worried by me approaching it.. we faced off for the next 3 long minutes.. and then eventually it slipped over the fence and disappeared. As it slipped away.. it did not make a single sound.. and nor did it make a sound as it left..The object did not move and as i stood frozen i simply stared at it, thinking it was a burgular. strangely though.. the figure simply disappeared after a few minutes. it did not make a single sound as it did. A burgular hopping off a fence would have made some noise.. and in the dead of night i would have at least heard leaves crunching underfoot.. but in this case there was not a single sound. it simply vanished. the fact it was all white left me to this day with the eery feeling that what i experienced that day was not a burgular but a potential visitor from another world.I could not see any discernable features other than it was a human type shape.. i did not see arms or legs though.. roughly 4 feet tall.. it seemed to be shaped like a round blob sitting on my fence.. and then like a jelly blob.. it flopped over the fence and disappeared.. it did not make a single noise in doing so and i did not hear a single noise thereafter.This story is not provable and more for your information than for public publishing.. the area where this happened could even be tested as the fence upon which the figure appeared has not been changed since..it could have been a potential burgular that night.. but if it was, then it was one highly skilled dude.. because not only was it terribly out of shape and unatheltic looking (it was shaped like Jabba the hut from Star Wars fame) but it managed to completely disappear without making a single sound in the dead of night.. and it seemed to just roll off the back fence..which is 8 feet tall..  also.. if it was a burgular why would it be wearing only white clothing.. they usually wear black..to this day.. the thought of that night sends a chill up my spine.. so i thought i would report it for documentation on your database.. this happened in a suburb called Ashbury in Sydney&apos;s inner city area ( the park is called Wagner Oval) .. a highly populated area but my home backs onto a large park which is where the figure disappeared into. it was also approximately 3am and no one else was on the streets at the time and the park was silent.my study is at the rear of my house overlooking my yard.. and my lights were always left on throughout the night as i studied for many years.. perhaps that attracted this figure.. a burgular again would have been deterred given that i was active till late all night.. this figure seemed to be sitting there just watching me.. until i noticed it, stared it off from a distance of only 5 meters.. it did not flinch nor seem worried either. it sat there the entire time before disappearing.", "Big Metal Ball. Glowing.It was about midnight on a dark starry night in late 2006.  A friend and I had been having long talks outside beside the trees of the surrounding forest.  We were just chatting when I noticed a star that was especially bright and seemed to almost bob up and down.  It was a little windy that night so I can see its movement.  It would move across the sky in strange patterns and sometimes would just stop and observe.  I felt watched.  Deeply.  My friend started to cry and after the event neither of us could describe it without getting tongue tied.  I still remember it.  It was so bright and looked like a big metal ball.  It almost seemed to have a character about it.  As if itself were a being.  It was the most mind altering experience and really brought out the truth in me...

It&rsquo;s been 15 years since it occurred so I don&rsquo;t remember the exact date, but, it was during the spring. I am from Pharr, Texas which is a border town in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas.When I was in high school I played in a rock-n-roll band. On occasion we would take trips up to Austin and San Antonio to watch rock bands or just sight-see. Our typical route took Highway 281 up north.  On this day we had completed about two-thirds of the trip. We had passed the town of Three Rivers and were about one-third the way from Three Rivers to San Antonio. Back then this tract of road was mostly woods with some ranches and other buildings sparsely populating the land.I turned to look outside my window for no reason; I being on the passenger end of the car. I looked out above the tree line and there, clear as day, was the UFO.The UFO was a perfect sphere, its surface appeared something liked polished aluminum and its diameter was approximately between 7-8 ft. At first I thought it might be a smudge or glare on the window because it appeared to be tracking our car perfectly, absolutely matching our speed perfectly. I adjusted my view several times to see if the image was on the window or whether it really was outside. The UFO was indeed real and flying above the tree line, apparently, tracking us. At this point, I have to admit, the realization that this thing was tracking us frightened me a bit. It&rsquo;s very difficult to explain the emotions aroused by this kind of occurrence. It was quite alarming. I continued to watch this UFO for many minutes (at least 10 minutes) and then it suddenly occurred to me to tell my friend driving the car. I had been so caught up in the event I had completely ignored him.When I turned to tell him I realized he was already looking at it. He later told me that, after noticing my behavior, he had placed the car in cruise control and was switching between watching the road and watching the UFO. As I turned to once again look at the UFO it had disappeared.Amazingly we were quiet for quite a few minutes before we began talking about. My friend, in particular was quite distressed about the event.We never spoke about it again and I have only told a handful of people about it since.Incidentally, a few years later, another UFO, this one a very large cigar shaped UFO was spotted, not very high in the sky, above my house by some relatives who are also neighbors. They ran to my house to tell me, they were almost to hysterics, but by the time we went outside the UFO had disappeared. Many UFOs were seen throughout the Rio Grande Valley that year. The local news referred to it as a UFO flap. That was the first time I heard that term.I have always wondered if the fact that two UFOs were seen around me was just coincidence or not. I have not been abducted or anything of the sort, in fact I don&rsquo;t believe alien abductions actually occur, but I have to admit, a bit embarrassingly, that, ever so often , I look up to the sky, a little afraid, wondering if anything up there is watching me.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

It was not a balloon anymore yet retained the same color and underneath the hull of this silent and now motionless craft was a rectangular shaped protrusion of sorts that was obviously a part of the craft&apos;s geometry.In the right corner of this short protruding box-like bottom was a brilliant, almost like DIGITAL/LED square light.  The light blinked on and off with no apparent pattern and the object was the size of 3 or 4 mini-vans worth of mass in the sky from the distance I saw it.  It slowly moved horizontally over to be closer to me standing there and remained still nearly over head for a near full minute.  Then it began accelerating in a northwesterly direction at a calm speed remaining at its altitude consistently eversince ceasing to rise upward during its time as a &quot;balloon of helium&quot;.In shock I documented the event within minutes and then before leaving after only a few minutes past the event an appartent police helicopter, &quot;ghetto bird&quot; swept low over that spot of the neighborhood doing a typical orbit around the house I was at with its spotlight on, but not pointing down at me or anything and after one full circle it flew around me there, in a diameter of about 300 yards and height near the same as the craft, the helicopter then sped off in the exact direction that what I had seen left from there traveling in.", "There were red dot in the distance and the would blink and they had nonoise and my father told me that they might of been stelth bombers but they are not base anywhere in or near new hampshire(NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

While on the playground during recess, a student spotted a white object hovering approximately 1000-1500 feet in the air.  The object appeared to be white with two large spheres on one side and what appeared to be an elongated cylinder on the other side.  It was almost triangular, but it was two spheres and a flat, cylindrical shape.  We thought it was possibly a weather balloon at first, but it was rotating at a constant speed and height as it moved slowly across the sky.  It seemed to be almost scanning the ground.  I also thought it could be some type of flying camera taking pictures of the area after Hurricane Ike or for some type of internet &quot;earth map&quot; because it maintained the same speed and altitude. The object was near the descent pattern for Houston Intercontinental Airport, but it was too slow and was obviously not an airplane, helicopter, or blimp.  The object made no sound as it moved across the sky.  I wanted to go inside and get my camera, but I didn&apos;t want to alarm any of the other students.

It appeared to travel slightly slower than a usual shooting star as well. I don&apos;t think this was an alien spacecraft; but could it have been some space junk re-entering the atmosphere or perhaps an iridium flare?

I couldn&rsquo;t really determine if this was light generated from within or reflecting from the sun.  They each were extremely small to the naked eye, almost impossible to see if you didn&rsquo;t have excellent vision.  You had to be looking in the right spot.

They were moving rather slowly, yet when I would look at them again (after continuing my walk, then looking up again), one of them moved off and away from the other two.  I kept looking and staring, with breaks inbetween.  This went on for at least 30 minutes, at which time the third one had disappeared, then after awhile, the second one, then eventually all three of them disappeared..They appeared to be hovering most of the time, although there was some movement, then when you&rsquo;d look again, they&rsquo;d be in a different spot relative to the &ldquo;day&rdquo; moon and relative to each other.Again, they were round and not like anything you normally see in the sky.  They definitely were not a plane or a balloon or a helicopter.  They were round and didn&rsquo;t behave like these things.  Helicopters don&rsquo;t go that high to my knowledge.

The two lights appeared to be moving away in tandem with what I can only describe as a &quot;gliding&quot; motion, not fast, but not really slow, either. The courtyard is lit with orange vapor lanterns. I would describe the brigtness of the object or objects as being of medium intensity, and they were unblinking. My friend was facing toward me, so he didn&apos;t observe them.A small plane flew into the immediate area of the sky about a minute or so later, and looked quite different from what I previously saw. I would estimate that the objects were at about a 45 degree angle in the sky from my position and fairly high as I observed them over a two story apartment building. I could not hear any sound from either the objects or from the small plane, as there was traffic noise coming in from the busy street that we reside on.", "2 lights above some houses that moved away from each other and they were low to the ground.I was Riding with my mom and 2 brothers in the car and my mom saw 2 lights in the sky above some houses, I looked and I saw 2 lights moving in a directional angle, the top one was moving slowly upwards to the left, and the bottom one was moving a bit faster to the right going down.", "One saucer in the sky, late at night.My friend and I were walking late at night outside of his home, and as we reached the near end of our walk we looked up and viewed a UFO in the sky.  We both asked if the other had seen what we thought we&apos;d seen, agreed, and headed home.  The craft itself was in the shape of a disk, it had eight lights on the bottom part of it.  The crafts upper part was a gray color, and the bottom part with the lights appeared to be black.  (It was late at night so it might be another color, but I was unable to see what it was).  The experience wasn&apos;t very long, the craft moved to the right from it&apos;s original position, made a small circle, moved left, then seemed to disappear.", "At 0427 hrs I went out to my car to get my soda.  While in my car I saw out of the corner of my eye a bright light moving across the sky maybe 1000 feet off the ground.  So I turned to look at it thinking it was a plane landing at Albany International Airport.  But the light was too bright to be a landing light and it was going in the wrong direction.  Planes landing at the airport have to land either north to south, south to north or east to west.  This was going west to east.  It looked to be a bluish-white Sphere.  I watched it for 20 to 30 seconds until it disappeared into the clouds above Troy, NY.  I don&rsquo;t know what it was but my friend told me to report it so I am.", "Vehicle out of southern sky thought to be shooting star hovers over city.Returning home from a friends house I spotted what I thought was a shooting star coming out of the southern sky at the 11 o&apos;clock position.

Onch it slowed down it made a sharp right then sharp left turn and then hovered above the city and the tree tops. The object appeared round with an orange color. It made an arch as it entered the atmosphere. There was only one vehicle noted. Neither my sister or myself had ever witnessed an event like this before and gave us a very uneasy feeling.", "a small flat disked shape, orange coloured, with orange rays coming off, moved further in the sky at late evening.I was staring out of the car window and I saw this very strong coloured orange thing and because it was dark outside at first I thought it was the reflection of a street light. When I looked again it was this small flat disked shape orange light with orange rays coming off it, which were more faded than the ball.

At first, I thought it was a meteorite, but there were two lights spaced a small distance apart.  Also, Albuquerque has a high amount of air traffic, and I was looking at planes at the time.  This object was lower in altitude then any planes in the area.  Lights vanished before reaching the horizon.  There was absolutely no sound whatsoever.

It must have turned 90 degrees, because then it appeared to be a thin line.  I didn&apos;t see any lights, but it was solid and appeared silver.  It kept heading east(hovering, then moving slowly) and disappeared behind trees.   I was so tempted to follow, but I wasn&apos;t really sure what I was looking at, I was headed to a fitness class and I didn&apos;t want to piss any aliens off.

I was talking to a fellow worker, he was sitting in the work pick-up truck on the driver side the truck and the door was opened. The truck was facing east and we were on the right hand shoulder. I was standing next to the driver door facing east as well.I saw what appeared to be a flash in the sky just a little to the right of me (2 o&rsquo;clock). The flash wasn&rsquo;t like a normal flash in the sky, i.e. lightning, or an explosion it was contained to a small portion of the sky. Then a bright star (in the same area of the flash) began to bulge and seem to be moving or stretching before I could wonder what was happening to the star a streak of brown came from the left of me (11 o&rsquo;clock) it was like the streak you see when you&rsquo;re watching a shooting star. The streak began just above us and to the north and turned into three very fast moving crescent shaped objects then swooped down heading south and turned to the south-southeast. The three objects were almost sliding through the curve in the same manner in which a race car slides around a corner. The objects were a brownish-orange and were shaped like a half moon or crescent with one black window in the middle of each side. The objects didn&rsquo;t fly like a plane they were flying vertically. The rear of the object had a blackish circle.The objects were flying in formation: side by side, the two on the right had made a smooth curve and the one on the left came close to the one in the middle and had to swerve to avoid hitting him, it also increased the speed faster than the other two and pushed himself ahead as if playing a game with the other two.The crafts seem to come from this weird electrical haze and left short gold orange trails behind them. The crafts disappeared as fast as they appeared and they also made no sound and had no lights. The craft were no more than 800 feet off the ground (very close). The whole thing lasted nearly 5 seconds, not even long of enough to fully comprehend what just happened.", "SILVER OBJECT IN ASHEVILLE N.C.Diamond shape object, much larger than a falling star, flew directly down approx. three miles from where I was walking, object went straight down, very fast,that was it, it was to be seen no more.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

However, it moved from north to south across the eastern sky fairly low and there were no other ones before or after it appeared. There was no sound associated with it and it quickly disappeared with no visible smoke or anything left behind leading me to think it was not any type of firework.

It had bright little specks and it started to change shape moving very fast. It moved past my head and it had a whirring sound like a small face fan that is why I know that I really saw it.

My wife said &quot;look honey look, what is that?&quot; When I looked up I saw a disk shaped saucer with a raised area in the middle, maybe for the pilots head/body. It was over a residential area moving right to left towards homes. It had no lights on at the time but it was close enough to see that it did have them. It flew too fast to be a helicopter but too slow to be a jet. were maybe 100 to 150 yards away from it but it made absolutely no sound. It was way too big to be a remote controlled toy, I would guess it was a one man craft. It looked like the classic saucer design from old alien movies. It was dark so it was hard to make out an exact color but I would say it was a dark metal gray. As far as size I&apos;d say it was 15-20 ft. in diameter. If you have any info on this I would love some feedback as Im not a UFO enthusiast and I have no explanation for this. Im %100 sure that what I saw was real.

My dog was woken up and immediately jumped up off the bed and started growling and went into alert mode.

The hand holding the antenna was now pointed at her and she stoped barking and growling.  I then was able to move a litle and was filled with unbridled rage.  I moved my eyes to the left and saw my alarm it said 5:35 A.M.  My left hand that had felt like it was being held down as I stated before being paralyzed now swung to my left with all the force in my body and made contact with a hard but latex feeling body. Immediately I jumped and looked to my left where this being was at previously and it was gone. And my alarm now stated it was 5:38 A.M.

Its brightness was more than Jupiter, but less than Venus.  It was moving northeastwards towards the Atlantic. At first we thought it was an airplane, but the brightness remained constant even after it passed over us.  Also, it was constant and not blinking, so we did not think it could have been an airplane.  It was way too bright to be an airplane, regardless.  So this circular, very bright light is moving towards the Atlantic, and in the span of 5 seconds it goes from very bright to dim to disappeared.

I looked towards the South East over Henderson, NV and observed a bright white light which seemed to be moving slowly from side to side. The object was approximately twenty-thousand feet up in the air. I told my girlfriend to look up at the lights and we observed blue, green, red flashes as the object appeared to be spinning. We observed the object move very slowly in various directions almost as if it was floating around the sky over the Henderson urban-sprawl. The object had a brownish-grey cloud around it at all times and the light it emitted had illuminated the cloud around it, which seemed to follow it wherever it would go. We stayed at the park for approximately an hour, and marveled at what we saw and the changing lights. We decided to drive in the direction of it and ended up at a housing development near Silverado Ranch and Eastern. I believe it was called &ldquo;South Fork&rdquo; off Eastern Avenue. We parked in front of  various houses that were in the South East area of the housing development itself and it appeared to be very close to our vehicle compared to when we were at the park. It made no sound itself. We both stared at the lights which were still green, red, white, and blue at times, but it was mostly white and the colors would come and go. At one point a red laser type light emitted from the craft which seemed to be a smaller light than the others and a different color red that circled around the craft which was spinning. I told my girlfriend looking at the lights was becoming difficult because they were so bright it hurt and she agreed. I flashed my hazard lights, as we were in my vehicle, and when I did this on two occasions the lights became more active and the small red laser light would almost answer back to us and seemed to shine in our eyes directly! The dogs with us were whimpering and whining. The unidentified craft seemed to be getting c! loser to our vehicle. I was looking at the clock the entire time in the quiet neighborhood and I never lost any time during the sighting. At one point my girlfriend says it &quot;looks like a disco in the sky!&quot; She also described the white portion of the lights as &ldquo;like a starburst&ldquo;. I could make out the shape of the craft in only one instant and it appeared to be bell shaped, however the lights made the craft appear to be disc shaped and spinning. The cloud cover around the craft did not look like normal clouds almost as if the cloud was emitted from the craft. At the housing development we could hear helicopter sounds but we did not see any helicopters and I thought this was suspicious. This object was not a helicopter as it did not have small red flashing lights on the tail but large multicolored ones. During our sighting, we both agreed about what we observed and we shared the exact same reactions to the UFO at the same time. We drove up Easter, a little more South up towards the &ldquo;Anthem&rdquo; area, which actually is up the mountains of the Valley and parked. We could still observe the UFO from our vehicle however it appeared to be more East of us and also appeared to be rising in altitude slowly. We came to the agreement that we had actually driven around the UFO, which made me to believe the object was large however not very high in altitude. Other things about the sighting were we observed several shooting stars during this sighting in alternate areas of the sky than the UFO. At one point in the sighting we observed white beams shoot out from the craft. We also observed several smaller orb craft around the craft during the sighting. Because I did not know the exact distance of this craft it is difficult to say the size but I did get the impression it was possibly a mother ship as at about 0530 hours it was high in the sky and only white light when we got back to the house with the smaller craft possibly following it up. This craft seemed to be a pyramid shape at times as it gained altitude. This is my first UFO sig! hting an d we shared it together, as it was her first as well. We felt like we had a connection with it and hope others saw it that very early morning. We did not have a camera in the vehicle and we did not want to run back home to get one in fear we would lose track of the UFO.", "Six  bright yellow lights in kite, backward &quot;L&quot; and diamond formationsIt is 28 October 2008. I drove home from work at 1800 hours along 1-70 interstate highway from Topeka, Kansas to Manhattan, Kansas.

Perfect formation and not moving nor admitting any pollutants in the sky as an airplane would. The &quot;L&quot; formation turned in a perfect kite formation and continued to beam yellow light.  The first light of the kite formation was brighter than the rest. Slowly they faded away but never lost their perfect formation.

I was doing some star gazing with my Celestron telescope.  Sometime after 8pm, I saw a horizontal row of lights hovering about the Las Vegas strip.  They were an amber color, almost iridescent.  I thought they were lights on one giant aircraft.  They were spread out like what appeared to be several city blocks.  Then they disappeared, all almost at the same time.I stood there for several minutes in awe, trying to comprehend what I just saw.  Eventually I went back to my telescope; however I kept looking around the sky with my eyes.  A few minutes later, I saw three lights again, this time in a triangle formation.  It was at this point that I figured each light must be its own craft.  I ran in the house and grabbed my video camera as fast as I could.  I proceeded to record what I saw.I had to keep turning my eyes away from the camera screen, as the camera did not do justice to what my eyes could see (although the video turned out pretty good).  The bottom light disappeared, and then two more lights flickered into view above the remaining two, and disappeared almost as fast as they appeared.  Then the one on the right, to my perspective, disappeared about 20 seconds later. Finally, after about 30 more seconds the last one disappeared.  A few minutes later, one appeared again, and remained stationary for a few minutes before disappearing.  Before it disappeared, a regular plane appeared to fly by the object.I don&rsquo;t know if I should report the next incident as a second occurrence or not, but I saw another &quot;UFO&quot; 10 days later.  I happened to watch a show about UFOs where a man described seeing almost exactly what I saw, and said he saw them again 10 days later.  So, on a whim, I took my camera outside about the same time, 10 days later.  I was shocked to see another one, and I filmed it.  This second occurrence was strange.The light moved slowly higher and to the east.  Eventually, it turned from a large amber-like orb of light, to a small, strange, strobe-like light.  This was not like the strobe on an airplane though.  I have the whole incident on tape.After a few minutes, I saw two more strobe-like lights appear, near the same proximity.  It was almost as if the one was signaling the others, and they started to signal back. It was very strange to say the least. The strobes were very small, and eventually, I just couldn&rsquo;t see them anymore.  The second incident lasted approximately 20 minutes.((NUFORC Note:  We will attempt to obtain more information.  The video does, indeed, show the lights, precisely as the witness describes above, although we do not know what they are.  Ordinarily, we would allow for the possibility that they might have been landing lights on several airliners on long final approach, but they would not be visible for 30 minutes.

I was waiting for management to arrive at a new building where I was installing software.While I was in the rental vehicle listening to a college football game I noticed fish were jumping out of the lake. I live in Las Vegas and I very rarely get to see any wildlife &apos;in action&apos;.  So I sat there and watched this for a few minutes when my eyes caught sight of what I thought were three birds. It was dark and I figured that lights in the distance had illuminated the birds. The birds were headed north but then banked to their right and completed a 270 degree turn. Now they were headed west, right in my direction.The area is very close to the airport and after I figured out the lights were not birds, I braced myself for a plane crash because the 270 degree turn was very fast, low, and heading lower. But once it straightened out, the lights started moving in my direction. I watched this object silently move across the sky (Had to be only 300 FT off the ground and I&apos;d say roughly 1000 FT in front of me and I cannot judge the speed though I&apos;d guess 200 MPH) and it went behind a tree line. I looked to the other side of the tree line expecting to see the object but nothing appeared.When I glanced up before the lights passed the tree line I could not make out any object but there were certainly three points that if you connected the dots you could make out a triangle. The rental car was idling but there was very little engine noise and I did not hear any noise from the object. There were no blinking lights and what made this even more interesting was about 20 seconds after the object went behind the tree line a plane landed. It was a small plane and I was thinking they had to have seen something!  I was in a complete sober state of mind.

There is a company with an office in Durham, NC, called Flairships that leases out aerial advertising blimps to various companies, but they did not have any blimps in the air over SE Virginia on the day in question. I contacted other companies that utilize airships (including Goodyear and MetLife), and none of them had a blimp within 200 miles of the James River on that day.  Having seen advertising blimps on various occasions over the years, I can assure you that this was not a blimp. I had a close-up view of it under ideal conditions. What I saw had no writing of any kind on its sides.  Nor did it have a crew cabin on its belly, a tail assembly, or motors or any other protuberances from its surface. The craft I saw was perfectly smooth and silent.  It was also in the range of 300-400 feet long. Even the largest advertising blimps in use today are only about 200 feet long. And they, like the Goodyear blimp, have the company logo prominently displayed on their hull.  Otherwise, what&rsquo;s the use of having an advertising blimp?   The idea that a blimp might have been blown from north to south by a southwest wind is laughable.  If anything, it would have been blown towards Williamsburg, not away from it. As I said before, the craft I saw moved strongly INTO the wind and was not at its mercy.  And, with all of the empty real estate it could possibly encounter along the river, it chose to stop just opposite a nuclear power station?  That, in itself, is telling.I called the Jamestown airport (which is less than a mile from my house) two hours after my sighting, and the fellow in charge assured me that there was nothing even remotely like a blimp in the air that day. Unfortunately, the local airport does not use radar, so he couldn&rsquo;t tell me just what may have been flying over the river at noon that day.The &ldquo;very highly restricted military intelligence community/base&rdquo; he refers to must be Camp Peary, aka &ldquo;The Swamp.&rdquo; This is the well-known CIA training base on the York River. It lies on the other side of Williamsburg about 5 miles from where I made my sighting. Having lived here for the past 15 years, I too have heard tales of remotely piloted vehicles like the Predator drone flying over the base and the nearby York River. But they are never seen over the historic areas or the James River. I know what a Predator looks like, and with its sleek body, long wings and bulbous nose, it was the complete opposite of what I saw. I suspect you could pack twenty Predators inside of what I saw.Having seen this alien craft up close (at first from less than half a mile away) and then at a distance of about three miles, I am absolutely certain that it was not a helicopter, &ldquo;military item&rdquo; (whatever that means), or small airplane. I spent 6 years in the Navy and believe my eyesight is still good enough to distinguish helicopters, Ospreys, and fixed winged aircraft from the absolutely unique craft I witnessed. And the idea that I&rsquo;d mistake an ultralight for a 300 feet long craft leaves me speechless. I have seen ultralights fly over directly my house while out doing yard work, and I&rsquo;d know their shape anywhere. Besides, they make as much noise as a flying lawnmower. What I saw was silent.In summation, I&rsquo;d like to add that I&rsquo;ve attempted to get in contact with Mr. ((name deleted)), as he so obligingly left his phone number, bur he has so far refused to return my calls. All I know of him is that he lives in Virginia Beach, about 60 miles from the sighting area, which, by the way, is home to Oceana NAS. Just up the peninsula a few miles is Langley AFB, a first response base which is tasked to defend US airspace in the event of hostile activity (such as 9/11). This part of Virginia is home to at least a half dozen very sensitive military bases.I am speculating here, but I suspect that the idea that an alien craft could literally &quot;stroll&quot; past these bases, at midday, right over the heads of millions of people, and not be detected, much less confronted, and then loiter next to a nuclear power station, is something that no one in the armed forces or the intelligence community is willing to admit to. There also appears to be a coordinated effort to discredit valid sightings.((e-address deleted))((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides little contact information.

We noticed a bright light through the trees in a field to the right of the interstate about 200 yards away.  At first we thought it was a large helicopter but when we got closer we noticed the object was very large, and in a triangular or arrowhead shape with 3 bright lights at each corner.  It also had small lights going around the sides, mostly white.  The object was hovering, as if suspended in midair, above the tree line, probably 150-200 feet off of the ground.  At first I thought it might be some kind of tower in the field, judging from its large size, low position, and the fact that it was completely still.  We also heard no noise, but we were driving.  However, as we drove by it, I watched in the rear window and the object began to move south very slowly, probably about 20 mph, over the interstate and disappeared over the trees.  Neither of us was sure what to think and I haven&rsquo;t seen anything in the news today but I know others on the interstate with us must have seen the object too.  The object looked very similar to what was described in the Travel Channel special titled &ldquo;UFO Over Illinois.&rdquo;  Prior to this, my boyfriend did not believe in extraterrestrials or UFO&rsquo;s but now claims to be a believer.  It was a very chilling experience.

If this is true, then the documents are false. One of the photos which was of a hospital in which a nurse was suppose to have witness the alien autopsy shows the name of the hospital as &quot;USAF Hospital.&quot; This could not be a photo taken at the Roswell time.I understand that the USAF was not formed until one year after the Roswell incident.", "Black triangular, round or rectangular object in broad daylight or sunset.Black triangular, round or rectangular object.

I saw two lights moving  high in the night sky moving very fast for about six seconds. The lights were side by side in parallel. The light on the right was moving ahead then behind as they moved from the south to the north. The lights were not very bright. I was glad to read that someone else had seen the same thing that I did from the same city and at the same time.

I&rsquo;ve always wanted to see a UFO and tonight I got the chance to see 4!! I&rsquo;ve seen things in the past that were questionable. But in my mind I could never say for sure. Tonight I finally have no doubts!! The first sighting occurred around 1:30 am and it was one UFO (strobe like) flashing across the sky heading in a slight southwest direction (a lot more west than south). At first I thought it was a shooting star, but it never burned out as I watched it fly from east to west. As it was dawning on me what I was seeing, it then quickly changed directions and turned around and flew south east kind of like what a fish would look like in water.Needless to say, I was stoked (still am)!! About 10 minutes after as I was about to head in, I saw three more headed in the same direction flying in formation. Right before they would have been out of sight I saw both side UFO&rsquo;s split up left and right at the same time with the middle one flying straight. It was truly amazing!! I know what I saw was not birds or jets because they made no sound and flew way too fast (8 seconds across the sky). I don&rsquo;t know star formations, but all four (both sightings) flew between the 3 straight up and down stars, and the cluster of stars (4 total I think) with one in the middle.So yeah, I&rsquo;m very stoked!!!

At approx. 10 degrees above the horizon I viewed a light in the WSW sky.  I called a co-worker to look at the light.  The light was amber in color, very similar to the mercury vapor street lights that are common.  The intensity was about twice the yard light of a ranch that is five miles from our location.  However the size of the light was three to four times larger and did not vary in intensity for the duration of the sighting.We viewed the light and noticed that it was moving.  It was moving very slowly and without deviation from whatever &quot;course&quot; it was on.  The general movement could have been east to west, but from our perspective, it looked as if the light was descending.  We observed this light for at least five minutes.  Our observation was with naked eye and with 10X binoculars.  We could not discern any shape to the object, just a &quot;light.&quot;  We observed this object until it went into obscura over the horizon, at around 250 degrees azimuth.We considered what it may have been, and agreed that it was not a conventional aircraft, nor a celestial body.  The only possible conventional explanation we could determine from our sighting was that it was possibly a satellite reflecting the sun.  Though other obvious satellites we have seen did not have the same color of light, nor did they reflect light so consistently or so long to our respective position as this object may have been.The witnesses have a combined experience of 70 years in ground radar, satellite tracking, and working with military aircraft.", "Second sighting in the same area.Once again, I was lying in bed watching TV and I saw a single light in the field behind my house. I woke my husband and I went out on the balcony. My three boys were downstairs and also saw the light and came up to our room. The light rose out of the field and two more lights became visible in the shape of a triangle. There were some smaller red flashing lights right close to the first light. There was also a beam of light projecting across the sky in the direction the object was flying. It proceeded to fly over our house heading south. As it went over, we heard a low rumbling sound. This is the second time we have seen this craft.", "fast flying object leaving a trailWe stopped at a rest stop in far west Pennsylvania on our way to Youngstown ohio.

It covered the entire viewing area in 4 or 5 seconds. It moved so fast that it appeared to leave a trail (or maybe that was just an illusion because of the speed of this object.) It was much larger than a shooting star would appear to be. The fact that it flew in a straight line, lasted the entire length of my view of the sky, flew much faster than a shooting star would appear too, and seemed to be in our atmosphere caused me to rule out the notion that it was a star.The color seemed to be somewhere between yellow and orange...but not white.", "Are The Tinley Park Lights coming back for Halloween 2008?I was driving down 159th towards Oak Park Ave. when off to my left over the Forest Preserve I saw a triangular shape hovering above with red lights at each corner.

It was around late dusk and I recall remembering the event later and the fact that we seemed to have returned to my friend&rsquo;s home minus any McDonald&apos;s food, no need to discuss the object, and hearing about John Lennon&rsquo;s murder that evening , which helped me date the event.

He was pretty comfortable and we walked in this place often. All of a sudden he and my dog went on alert. I thought it probably a black bear (we have them around). However, I saw something very strange. The best way I can discribe what I saw sounds silly. It looked like two long, really skinny, frogs standing on two straightened out legs - upright. I tried to make sense of what I was seeing telling myself it was two snakes standing up straight or something. When the two frog things bent over and picked up something (and I saw they had arms) that seemed like it was like a bucket. They both lifted it - looked at me and turned and walked into the woods. Despite the fact the dog was barking and my horse was acting up and rearing and pulling and naying - I walked a little forward trying to figure out what I was REALLY seeing. I saw the grass moving as they walked through it.

At first I dismissed it as an airliner since it was close to the typical flight path of passenger jets I often see flying overhead.  What caught my attention however was that I DID see an airliner and at that point I could compare/contrast the two.  The bright orange light had no blinking navigation lights, no spot lights, and was easily traveling 3-4x the speed of the jet &ndash; on which the blinking lights were very evident.  There was no evidence that the orange light was aware of the jet or visa-versa.  The light traveled from south to north-east crossing the night sky in about 30 seconds at about a max of 40 degrees elevation.  The color was a very distinct orange that never wavered.  The flight path seemed constant, but the distance away was hard to determine.  There was a faint sound of jet engines but since there was another plane in the sky I could not pinpoint the source.My next thought was that this could be the ISS which I have taken time to spot a few times with my son.  So as soon as the light passed behind the tree I did a quick online check and verified there are no ISS sightings for our location for a few more days.  And since the shuttle flight was canceled yesterday, there was no need to check its flight path.So all that said, I still cannot dismiss it as satellite or even a very high-flying advanced aircraft of some type.  It did remind me greatly of other ISS passings and being about an hour before sunrise, a satellite makes sense.

She looked back and saw it as well so I knew I wasn&apos;t crazy. The top light went out and the one light was left as we kept watching. As we kept driving we watched it and it seemed to gain immense speed and seemed to be 20 feet (MAYBE) behind my car and then backed off really fast and kept playing this chasing game for a few miles.

Every five or ten minutes it would reappear after another car passed in the opposite lane, but only 3-5 cars passed in the other lane our whole 3hr. trip.

The green flash had a small green object falling from the sky with green rings trailing behind it. The sighting lasted from 1 to 2 seconds and it quickly disappeared with tiny white sparks shooting out just as it vanished. All of this took place without me hearing a sound, probably mostly because I had music on in my car and I didn&rsquo;t have enough time to even think of turning it down to listen, if I could hear anything. I got into a panic as I screamed &ldquo;Oh my God!&rdquo; and I started hyperventilating until I started to calm myself down.I&rsquo;ve never seen or heard of anything like this before.  It wasn&rsquo;t so much of an Unidentified Flying Object as it was an Unidentified Falling Object.  I was not able to determine the distance or speed because it appeared almost as fast as it disappeared.  I was driving down the road in a northward direction when the object fell almost straight down. I expected the object to hit me any second which was part of the reason why I panicked, the other reason was that it happened so unexpectedly that I was startled by it and quite a bit frightened. I was thankfully not hit by the object which makes me wonder if it just disintegrated or hit somewhere else.Unfortunately I did not have my camcorder with me when this happened, which makes me so mad because I&rsquo;ve been trying to be prepared for anything like this to happen.  Even if I did have my camcorder with me I would not have the time to pull my car over and get my camcorder out and turn it on before it disappeared.

Here&apos;s the story...I went outside to smoke a cigarette and enjoy the scenery as I do each morning. The sky was a clear blue with just a few thin clouds passing by. I looked up to the sky for no real reason and that&apos;s when I saw it - a white cigar-shaped object very high in the sky, probably at about 20,000 feet in altitude. The object was heading south/southeast and clearly had no wings. It was just a plain white cigar-shaped image with what looked like an aura of light around it.After watching the object for about ten seconds it occurred to me that this was not a normal aircraft I was seeing so I grabbed my cell phone to see if I could take a picture of it. At this time the object had traversed only about a quarter of the visible sky and I thought it would take another 20 seconds or so before it would be out of sight. I looked down to pull up my cell phone camera and when I looked back at the sky the object was already gone! This was only a few seconds later and I wondered at how the object could have disappeared so quickly since it was still in the middle of the sky when I&apos;d looked away. It should still be there, I thought. Either way, the object had vanished completely and was seen no more.A minute or so later a commercial jet was seen heading east. Even though I could see only the profile of the jet, the wings were clearly visible. This is the part that made me think that I really had seen something strange because when the other object passed directly over head, any wings on it should have been easy to see against the open sky, but there were none.It was daylight when this sighting took place and no flashing lights were seen on the object, but the same could be said about the jet that followed. If the first object was a blimp, what was it doing so high in the sky and how could it have disappeared so suddenly? Beyond that, the object was moving much too quickly across the sky to have been a blimp or similar known flying object. Call me crazy if you must, but I think I just saw a UFO!

It was yellowish-white and somewhat bright (est. magnitude -2), so I thought it was the planet Saturn.  I observed it for approximately 30 seconds; it exhibited no movement or change in intensity, and it &quot;twinkled&quot; slightly.  So I shot at it with a violet laser (power output 111.9mW and spectrographically measured wavelength of ~407.5nm).  After shooting at it intermittently for ~10 seconds, the light started to diminish, until ~5 seconds later it had totally extinguished.I discounted phosphenes pretty much at once because the light remained in a fixed position in the sky when my eyes were moved, and discounted a terrestrial aircraft for the same reason, and because no strobes were seen (I would have certainly *NOT* hosed it down with a laser if I had even the slightest suspicion that it was an aircraft!).Conditions at the time of this sighting were clear skies, calm winds, and a temperature of 47&deg;F (8.33&deg;C).", "Bright scooting light just disappearsObserved at a nearly 90 degree angle.

I stared at this object, at about 2:00  clock on the horizon, just above treetop level.  The sun was above my head. The object was Oval shaped, and very shiny. It seemed strange to me.  It had no tail, wings or windows.  It almost glowed. I could make out the reflection on this craft from the sun&rsquo;s light.  One end would be shining more than the other end, as it pitched and dipped.  It appeared to be a craft in trouble.  I compared it with a large tree in my yard, that it had just passed over.  It was about &frac14; the size of the treetop. This tree is a 200+ year old oak.  It was so close, yet never made a sound.  It vanished behind the trees and out of view.

My friend and I were grounds workers at a mining museum/park, and we had just finished closing up the park and locking the buildings around the site. We locked up our grounds garage last, where our cars were parked, at about 6:00 PM. We ended up getting into a conversation for about 45 minutes. The sun had set, and we were having a deep discussion about 80&rsquo;s Hip-Hop artists, when my friend suddenly stopped talking, looked up, startled&hellip; and then SPRINTED up the road about 20 feet!  I wasn&rsquo;t too concerned, just a little confused. I caught up with him and he explained to me that he had just seen a very large triangular &ldquo;object&rdquo; pass right over us, and just over the tops of the trees near us. He described it as being INCREDIBLY low, probably just 75-100 feet off the ground, triangular, and black. I couldn&rsquo;t help but be skeptical of his account, being as I sensed absolutely nothing of this seemingly huge UFO right above our heads. We were all by ourselves, there was virtually no ambient noise down by our garage, except the sound of cars passing by on the highway near us, and still this &ldquo;craft&rdquo; made absolutely no noise whatsoever.So I stood there for a while and listened to my friend frantically repeat his description for about two minutes. I clearly remember him estimating the size of it and whatnot, when I looked up to the north, pointed at something, and yelled &ldquo;Like THAT?!&rdquo; I felt my stomach drop. He looked and said &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;  I stared directly at it. It was a black triangle, floating slowly upwards. It wasn&rsquo;t as close to the ground as what my friend described, and its really hard for me to guess how big it was, but I would estimate it as being roughly the same size as the one he witnessed first.All I can remember is how directly I was staring at this thing&hellip; it was a totally clear night, the thing was darker than the sky, and I had no doubt about the exact shape I was looking at. It was just a triangle&hellip; no lights, just a shape&hellip; slowly moving upwards. We watched it for what could not have been more than 5 seconds, and it just vanished right in front of our eyes&hellip; just disappeared.I proceeded to freak out and scream a string of profanity, all while we tried to reason and deduce what we realistically could have seen. &ldquo;Things can&rsquo;t just disappear!&rdquo; We ended up jumping in our cars and driving across the street to the &lsquo;Ironman&rsquo; statue/parking lot. We got out of our cars and stood there for quite a while, staring up at the sky, almost expecting to see another one. I imagine we looked pretty insane like that, but it didn&rsquo;t really concern us as much as seeing disappearing triangle spaceships&hellip;  I&rsquo;m not sure how long we stood there, but I swear it was almost 9:00 by the time we decided that we had no idea what it could have possibly been, and it was time to go home. My drive home was about 15 minutes, and I&rsquo;d be lying if I said it wasn&rsquo;t an immensely unsettling drive home. I found myself staring up out my window the whole ride, but genuinely not wanting to.I never really believed in paranormal activities and the like&hellip; I&rsquo;d never seen a ghost or alien or UFO or anything like that, and I always remember seeing UFO accounts on TV and being very skeptical. I always thought &ldquo;I&rsquo;m doubt they could see anything clearly if it was that dark.&ldquo; But what I saw was so clear, and I have no doubt about exactly what we both saw, which I think was actually the part that made me the most uncomfortable.The following weeks I just felt sick, scared, paranoid and uncertain. I told very few people about it. Over the course of the next months, and the rest of the winter, there was more slight&hellip; anomalies. One strange night at around 10:00 PM (again at our workplace), we were in the museum parking lot, looking at the sky and we saw a strange, moving star-like light up in the sky. Naturally we assumed it was another plane, but it was moving it an erratic, arbitrary pattern that was just odd. We watched for minutes as it just moved across almost the whole sky, heading towards the horizon (which happened to be the general direction of the airport&hellip;), when two other lights appeared. We heard distant rotors and decided these ones were helicopters. The helicopters seemed to follow (or chase) the first light, until they all disappeared behind the horizon.Another time my friend called me at 5:45 AM, and I didn&rsquo;t answer. He left me a message telling me to turn on the news. I did, and saw video from the airport cam of three strange, dim lights in a triangular pattern right on top of the horizon. They (or &ldquo;it&rdquo;) weren&rsquo;t moving relative to the surroundings, though when we replayed the DVR in slow-motion, we could see the lights &ldquo;fluctuating&rdquo;.There has been several times where we or I have just looked up and seen a &ldquo;star&rdquo; moving in the same strange, erratic patterns, or just general strange stuff going on. And the weird thing is, its always only happened at work. I&rsquo;ve thought about trying to get a picture or video sometime, but haven&rsquo;t yet.I still work there, and it&rsquo;s almost a normal thing now for strange things to happen.

It was around 9:30 p.m. September 13-19, 2007, (unfortunately, I&rsquo;m not quite sure of the actual day anymore.)  I was on County Road 550, after going through Pleasant Valley.    Shortly after going past a school, the area opens up to a large corn field on the left.  It was at this area that I first noticed muted &ldquo;lights&rdquo; at the very top of my driver side door window.The day care provider lives in the country, and at that time of year, it was completely dark-- so I am unable to determine the shape of the &ldquo;craft&rdquo;.  However, these lights were amber in color and were clustered in, what seemed to me, two different V-shaped formations; one set of three lights were slightly lower than the other set and angled somewhat differently.  It&rsquo;s rather difficult to express in writing the pattern in which I saw the lights but after watching it for about 10 seconds, the lights started, to the best of my guess, splitting off and the two sets of lights became three.  I don&rsquo;t recall any movement other than the lights transforming, (in other words, I don&rsquo;t believe the craft(s) was traveling as much as it/they was just hovering and changing shape.)  I eventually lost sight of the lights in the trees as I went around a curve.  I actually slowed the car down and contemplated pulling over into the drive way of a little camp ground but thought better of it.  The whole thing, while it seemed to carry on longer, really only lasted about 30 seconds.Now, I&rsquo;m not going to assume that I know what these lights are but I will state this&hellip; my mental health is sound and what I witnessed was NOTHING I have ever seen before.  No one will convince me that this was an air plane, (there were no blinking lights as you would see on a plane and while it appeared to be flying low to the ground, there was no noise.  Additionally, at this altitude, had it been a plane it would have flown over the car and out of sight quickly.)   Furthermore, I don&rsquo;t believe it to be any sort of &ldquo;government experiment&rdquo; as I&rsquo;ve actually seen similar lights, in the same formation, on an amateur video taken outside of the U.S.I realize that this has been some time ago, but I think about it almost daily.  (The experience was just too commanding not to.)   I know that there are real risks to admitting seeing something like this, (most people would call me &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; if they knew,) but it is my hope that someone else may be able to write a comment if they saw the same thing that night in the same area.  I know that there were other witnesses-- I recall looking into the rear view mirror at one point to see a motorcycle directly behind me and another car or truck behind the motorcycle.  I contemplated calling the city police or local radio but was concerned that they would not take me seriously, (and living in a small town, everyone knows everyone else, I just couldn&rsquo;t take the risk.&hellip; my father is a doctor in the area&hellip; I plan to open my own business here shortly&hellip; etc., etc., etc.)  Anyway, any information or witnesses would be greatly appreciated.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))", "A very recent Foo Fighter following  a small plane. Maybe pilot reported.I am reporting this the day after the event. I was at a wedding last night and I went outside to smoke. I was with the security guard and we both witnessed what I would describe as a classic foo fighter. We both saw a small, simple, and typical private propellar plane being flanked by an orb that was definitely following it. It was on the left side of the plane and maybe fifty feet lower but moving at the same pace, as if observing the plane. It was glowing in a red-orange way but was not blinking. It kept following the plane over the horizon and then we lost sight of it. Intersetingly, a few minutes later a plane was in the same exact location (following the shoreline) was moving east (the opposite direction of the plane before). Possibly this story could be linked to a sighting given by the actual pilot. It is possible that the pilot was so spooked by the follower that the pilot went back to base. I am not really sure how I would verify it but if anyone knows I would suggest they check the exact time I have given and as a lead the plane might have came out of John Wayne Airport.As a side note, the security officer who watched the event with me, who works these by the beach weddings all the time, was not as excited as I was. I don&apos;t know the date, but he claimed that one evening, at about 9:30pm, the whole wedding party stopped and stared, including the live musicians, and watched a very strange object move through the sky that looked like a fish swimming. He said that this encounter was much more of an unexplainable experience.Personally, I have a lot more respect for people that claim to see really strange things, be they UFOs of ghosts, etc. I have no idea what I saw but I was really in a way feel blessed to have seen something so unexplainable in an age where things in general have mostly been explained.A side note: Of course no one at the wedding believed a bit of my story,even though I had a witness. They all assumed that I drank to much, but I was part of the entertainment and was sober at the time, as I can at best say about the security guard. I really have sympathy now with those that experience something bizzare yet get disfranchised mentally for reporting it.This is not the first time I have seen a UFO. Somehow I feel that this makes this story lose credence, but I am honest about everything. In 1993,I witnessed the &quot;Vulkin Crusier&quot;. Sorry if I didn&apos;t spell it right but I don&apos;t follow Star Trek. It was the exact UFO that was seen in Belgium. I watched it with a witness for five minutes, and it was huge! I have seen stealth bombers while going through the desert and I was definitely way larger. It never did any strange manuvers, it just moved in a straight line though it was strange to watch as it slightly moved left to right as it glided by. It was pure gray, had three red lights on each corner that did not flash, and one additional red light on the center that also did not flash. There was no way it was a plane. It was way larger and it also made no sound. It eventually disappeared over a hill so I never saw a disappearance. Was it alien? Was it military? I have no idea. All I can do is report this as more UFO heresay.", "It had a TRANGULAR SHAPE, was DARK GRAY (lit by the moon light) with 3 ROUND CIRCLES ON IT&apos;S BOTTOMThis current sighting, seen Saturday night on 11/15/08 at 7:55pm was a flying object over the moon lit night sky of San Francisco, California&rsquo;s outer sunset district near my home.ABOUT ME: I am a retired electronics Eng, 59 and working part time. I also have a FAA Private Pilot License and I am a backyard amateur A. I own a 12-inch reflector and a 6-inch refractor. On this night we were experiencing a warm front over the S.F. Bay Area. 20 degrees above normal for this time of year. The moon was &frac34; full and just visible over the eastern horizon. Because of the moon lit sky (the suns light reflecting off the moon of course), birds were easily seen flying overhead at higher altitudes.THE SIGHTING: I was sitting on a backyard recliner drinking ice water using a  8 x 40 quality binocular to star qaize. My eyes were night adapted and just a few seconds before seeing the UFO, I was looking at the constellation Pegasus, I drifted my binoculars upward to look at a nebula when I saw what looked like a large black bird or object flying where my binocular was pointing. I thought how strange the shape as it did not have a bird shape. I continued to look into the binocular and followed this dark object heading 180 degrees south in a straight line. It was almost overhead, maybe within a &frac12; mile east of my home. It was flying with NO LIGHTS and NO SOUND. I live with 15 miles of SFO airport and see many planes turning and overhead for final approach with the red left wing light flashing and the green right wing lit. But this craft had no lights at all, made no sound. It was low enough be heard, but no sound was heard! If it was the size of a 747 jet, then I would say it would have been about 1000 to 1200 feet above SL. What was more unusual to me was its belly. It had 3 round disks shapes connected to it.So in conclusion, It had a TRANGULAR SHAPE, was DARK GRAY (lit by the moon light) with 3 ROUND CIRCLES ON ITS BOTTOM. No airplane wings or rudder or ailerons were seen. It seem to be running in a stealth mode maybe because of its low alitude, but the moon gave it away. I was lucky enough to have my binocular in that direction otherwise I would have never seen it with the eye alone. I followed it for about 7 seconds until my shed blocked further viewing. I ran up to tell my wife and boy but they did not believe me at first but the next day they seemed more convinced by my going on and on about seeing it.PAST SIGHTING: My first was in 1967 over the Pacific Ocean standing on the San Francisco beach and it was at night. I never reported it as I did not think anyone would believe be. But, I did tell friends and family. If you want information on that sighting I would be glad to tell you? I am interested if others had seen it.", "Possible pair of satelites, but I wanted to list it here in case somebody saw more.  I walked outside and looked to the south and observed Jupiter.  I am pretty familiar with the night sky, and Jupiter was to be expected.   But I quickly notices a pair of &ldquo;stars&rdquo; to the left of Jupiter by about 15 or 20 degrees.  If this pair was two marks on a clock, I would say they were at 10:30 and about 4:30, separated by the width of my little finger at an arms length.  These two lights were bright, as it was not totally dark yet, but they were clear to be seen.  They were low to the horizon, maybe just lower than Jupiter&rsquo;s relative height above the horizon.  Being a bright pair was unusual, and after staring at them for about a minute, I just felt like they were moving faster than&hellip;stars move due to earth&rsquo;s rotation.  So I tried to mark their position to a tree branch, and I do believe they were moving away from me, to the SSE, getting closer to the horizon.  The one at 4:30 position faded out first, and then the one at 10:30 faded out.  Probably satelites, but the pair is unusual for me to see.  I have seen three satelites moving together in the past, in the mid to late 90&rsquo;s.  So I know it happens, but like I said, I just wanted to post this little piece that I did observe, in case somebody saw more of it, for verification purposes.  I checked for ISS passes, and I couldn&rsquo;t find one during this time frame.  There was a listing for Cosmos 1408, but&hellip;I think I saw this pair prior to when Cosmos would have passed over as a single object.  Oh well.  Still waiting to see the one light that stops and takes a left!  PD...just delete this post if nobody else saw anything interesting.

Traffic was snarled so it was about 11pm by the time we got back. About a quarter mile away from our subdivision we noticed a collection of 5 (maybe 7) orange flickering objects that some people might describe as a fireball.Curious, we pulled over to watch these objects. We were facing south and these objects were traveling from east to west. Their motion and appearance were uniform although one object appeared to weave left and right slightly relative to the formation and subsequently sped up slightly as if to return to the correct spot in the formation. There was no sound. I would not describe the formation as uniform or tight, just motion in the same general direction.As these objects passed overhead and slightly to our south their flickering began to fade and then disappear entirely well before they would have been out of our line of sight. It is as if the front of the object gives off the flickering orange light but not the rear. We could not see anything much more significant that a faint star once the flickering stopped. At this stage it was difficult to reacquire visual contact with one object if one focused on another in the group.We agreed these were not aircraft. There were enough aircraft flying overhead at the fireworks so we had a good frame of reference for that conclusion. Since neither of us could explain what it was that we saw, we decided that we saw unidentified flying objects.We drove home; I carried our sleeping 4-year-old up to bed and began to unload the car. I noticed a group of 3 more objects traveling in the same manner and direction as before. This was about 5 to 10 minutes later. This time I was easily able to retrieve the camera from the back of the car and subsequently filmed this group of objects in a 30 second .avi clip (the camera&rsquo;s limit).

It was in February, 2007 at approximately 2-2:30 a.m.There was snow on the ground and I remember bright conditions, like moonlight reflecting off the snow making the night seem lighter than normal for that time of night.  I was driving south on I-77, just north of the Pleasant Valley Road exit.  My car window was cracked open because I am a smoker and I was flicking ashes out the window.  I had the car radio on, but it was not turned up loud and there was no music on---my habit at that time of night was to listen to talk radio.There were not many cars on the highway with me and I do not remember any cars near me traveling in my direction close to me.  I was focused up ahead as I was nearing the exit.  There were fairly dense trees to my right off the road.  I sensed movement overhead and looked up through my front windshield and just slightly to my right.I saw a huge dark triangular shape with red non-blinking lights gliding silently over the treetops, traveling north but almost as if it were following I-77 northbound (but next to the southbound lanes).  It was not directly overhead, but no more than maybe 20-30 feet to my right.  I could clearly see the outline of the craft and remember thinking it was not an airplane.  I also made note of the fact that the lights were solid and not blinking.  I put my window all the way down and could not hear anything---it was completely silent.  I estimate the craft to be about 100 yards across at the widest part.  It was clearly outlined against the moonlit sky.  It did not look metallic from my angle; I had the sense that it was black.I turned my attention to the road ahead and drove as quickly as I could to the curving exit ramp.  As I came around the curve of the ramp, I was going to end up facing north.  I looked in the direction I had seen the craft and (as large as it was) I expected to see the back end of it.  I could not locate the craft again and assumed the tree tops were in my way.I looked in the paper and online after my sighting, hoping to see reports of other sightings, but I found nothing.  For a long time I just felt satisfied that I knew what I saw and it was nothing I had ever seen.  After almost 2 years, I&rsquo;ve decided I want to report my sighting to SOMEONE just so my sighting is documented somewhere.  I&rsquo;m not saying it was extraterrestrial, but it definitely was a UFO because I could not identify it, it was definitely flying, and it was an object.  Could it have been a stealth bomber?

Near five minutes later, it came again, this time moving in a straight line to the west, from the direction it disappeared in previously, and went out of sight behind a tree.  Fifteen minutes later, it appeared again, heading south in a straight line. After we had seen it for about three seconds, it began to zig-zag up and down, and as soon as it headed straight, it completely disappeared.  Before the first occurrence with the object, we had seen about three shooting stars, the last being two minutes before the object appeared.

The first one came up out of a field and hovered above their car.  (There were other cars on this dark highway, but no one seemed to notice or stop.)  They assumed it was an airplane, but it made no noise, had rows upon rows of white lights and a few red lights, and was &quot;huge.&quot;  It was much larger than three passenger planes put together.  It was shaped like a triangle only it was rounded at the back.  The sides and front were curled inward. The bottom had a pinwheel of white lights with a red light in the center.  The UFO flew about ten feet above the car for a short distance.  The UFO flew away at an uncreditable speed.  Two miles up ahead were two more UFOs which flew towards them and then away.  Then one more came toward them and it also flew swiftly away.My daughter called her boyfriend on her cell phone after the first encounter.  He was less than ten miles away.  He and his friend were lounging on the back of his friend&rsquo;s pick up truck, listening to CDs and looking up at the sky.  While he was listening to her on the phone and not understanding all that she was reporting, what they thought was a star came towards them.  &quot;It got bigger and closer and was so fast that it was almost instantaneous with no noise in the engines.  It had rows of white lights, and some red lights.  It looked like it was made up of shiny chrome steel with a slight blue tint.&quot;  It flew over them and then instantly disappeared.  He said it was about half the size of a football field, triangular in front and round in back, slightly curled sides and curled tip and resembled a sting ray.I interviewed all four of these teenagers and they each told the same description except for the estimated size of the aircrafts.  My daughter drew a picture of the underside of the UFO and they all agreed that it was what they saw.When the girls had reached the well lit parking lot at Wal Mart, an odd looking man, about 30 years old, wearing a green pullover top and blue jeans, approached their car.  They locked the car and rolled up the windows.  The man seemed to scan the car from the front, sides, top and back and even looked through the back window of the SUV.  He had a bulging forehead (a very large bulging forehead).  After a full scan of the car, the man suddenly disappeared from behind the car. Inside Wal Mart, they encountered a family of four blonde people.  The children looked to be 15 years-old and the younger one about ten years-old. All had the same exact shade of blonde hair. The girls were at the trash bag isle when the family approached. The family was asking questions about the trash bags. The mother spoke without an accent.  The youngest boy had a distinct British accent, and the father and eldest son had deep southern accents.  The girls felt like they were cornered by this family.When they got back home, their computer wouldn&rsquo;t work.  It kept saying &ldquo;Resend&rdquo; when there was nothing they were sending.  After a while, it began to work again.All four agreed that they felt light- headed after seeing these UFOs and very groggy in the morning as though they had been drinking the night before.

We didn&apos;t hear any sound and the light was a interesting one. I can only describe it as a circle with a reddish light on the bottom that slowly glowed brighter as the light sped away in a westerly direction. The light was moving at such speeds it&apos;s hard to describe it accurately. I estimate it at approximately 100 feet off the ground and covering 10-15 miles in just seconds, I would assume there has to be regulations against such speeds at these lower levels. The light was moving from east to west and in a flash it was out of sight over the Bull Run mountains.If that wasn&apos;t enough excitement for one night we encountered another light just minutes after seeing the first.As we proceeded on from the first sighting, approx 3-5 miles, heading toward the Manassas Battlefield, we encountered another light. This light was also moving east to west but was neon green in color and noticeably much smaller. The light was also close to the ground, it couldn&apos;t have been higher than 100 feet and again moving at a speed faster than anything I have ever seen. As with the earlier light, it was headed toward the Bull Run Mountains and in a flash it was gone.I am a avid astronomer and know this wasn&apos;t a Meteor or any other type of natural light phenomena.I am also a very practical person but I quite can&apos;t wrap my head around what this was.

It was an absolutely beautiful fall day with no clouds in the sky. As we were in the front yard we were asking our little sister (who is 3 years old), if she could see a plane (it was a Northwest Airlines 747 because it was low enough that you could see the red on the tail) that was flying into the airport in Flint, MI about 40 miles to the east.  As we watched the airplane, my sister asked, &quot;Do you see that thing above the airplane?&quot;I looked around the plane and then finally I picked out what she was talking about.  It looked like a metallic sphere that was flying at an incredible speed to the north.  It was much higher in the sky than the airplane, and was traveling at a much greater speed.  All we could see was this sphere that reflected light sometimes as it traveled northwards. We watched the craft for anywhere from 10-15 seconds before it eventually disappeared out of view.

PD))", "I saw two identical UFOs this evening about 45 miles away from each other.I saw a UFO twice today, in two different locations.  I have seen the same aircraft 7 times now in the last month.  I am a well-educated woman in her 20&apos;s who is not crazy, but I can&apos;t explain what they are.  The aircraft is shaped like a trapezoid (although it may be a triangle- I only see it at night), and has two extremely bright &quot;headlights.&quot;  On the two corners that stick out most there are lights.  One has a red light, and the other has a green light.  The colored lights lead me to believe that it is man-made, but I&apos;m not aware of any aircraft like it.It doesn&apos;t have wings like an airplane, and it doesn&apos;t fly like an airplane.  It hovers over an area, very low.  I frequently see them when I drive west on the PA turnpike Tuesday evenings.  I drive from the Willow Grove exit to the Downingtown exit.  Tonight I saw the UFO at 6pm in Southampton, PA.  Then I saw it again (or another one) 1 mile from the Downingtown exit of the turnpike.  That one turned all of its lights off a few times, plunging it into darkness.  I thought that was odd.  Last week my husband was in the car with me and saw it, too.  He didn&apos;t know what it was either.", "Two aircraft circling light, light disappears, streaks between them later.I was driving north on the Casey Highway coming home from Marywood University.  At approximately 8:00 PM, I took the Jermyn/Mayfield exit, and I was driving up the ramp to head into town.  As I was driving up, I saw an orange light in the sky, surrounded by two aircraft, possibly helicopters, but I was not sure.  I decided to keep driving until I got to my house, which took roughly five minutes.  I parked my car, got out, and went to a clearing to get a better view of where I saw the craft.At this point I thought there may have been some sort of accident, as the two aircraft were still circling the sky, but the orange light was gone. I kept staring, trying to figure out what was going on. After about 30 seconds of looking, the orange light reappeared between the two aircraft. It streaked across the sky, leaving a trail, and disappeared. This event happened in less than a second.Under normal circumstances, if I had not seen the orange light earlier, and the light didn&rsquo;t streak through the sky between the aircraft, I would have imagined it was a shooting star, but with the events adding up, I believe it to be a UFO.", "Bizarre triangle UFO with three lights hovers over Interstate 5 in Central CaliforniaAt around 2 a.m. on Friday, October 3rd I spotted a UFO while driving on Interstate 5 in Central California. The GPS located that we were between Panoche, and Mendota. I was sitting in the passenger side of the car, while our car headed north on the interstate. There were only 2 passengers in the car including myself. From afar, we both noticed some kind of craft that appeared to be a helicopter or crop duster. At first the craft would pulse light similar to an airplane, then the whole thing would light up, followed by the appearance of three distinct separate lights. This light pattern: pulsing light, to sustained bright light, to three linear lights, continued for about a minute, each individual stage lasting a few seconds. The craft made incredibly low figure eights over the interstate; its&rsquo; distance above the ground roughly tripled the height of an overhanging freeway exit sign. At that point I still could not make out the body of the craft, as all I could see were incredibly bright lights. The craft kept making figure eights over the interstate, flying over both north and south lanes, making low and sharp turns over the fields that surrounded the road. As it continued to figure 8, it no longer followed the light patterns, but was simply three linear lights. I thought &quot;Wow, what a cool plane. This is something,&quot; up until the point when I looked to my left as the craft made its turn back towards the interstate and the three individual lights began to interchange and rotate, changing its linear form into no form; disconnected and spontaneous. Each of the three lights seemed to act independently. As I witnessed this, I knew it was not a crop duster, or helicopter, or normal airplane. This time when the craft came back across the interstate and into the surrounding fields it sank so low to the ground that I thought it had disappeared. I thought it was gone, but out of no where it rose up to my left directly above the car, this time it&apos;s three lights made the shape of a giant triangle whi! ch we we re able to clearly view through our front windshield. While the giant triangle flew over us, the three lights that composed it&rsquo;s shape shifted back into three linear lights, transforming the craft and changing it&rsquo;s direction from straight up, to straight out towards the east as if the pattern of the lights controlled and shifted it&rsquo;s movement. Shocked, I rolled the window down to see if I heard any noise, but we were driving around 70 mph and there were so many cars and trucks on the road that we could not hear anything.  As we continued driving forward, I turned around in my seat to watch it fly away. It appeared to look like a normal plane now (pulsing and flying steady) with an exception of the occasional bright light that would be sustained for a few seconds. Overall, what shocked me about this craft was the way it flew so low and turned with such ease. It did not appear to be flying, but almost floating. In addition, the interchanging, shape-shifting lights that initially appeared as three lights in a linear pattern did not calm my suspicion that this craft was not a normal airplane or helicopter. By the maneuvers that I witnessed, it would have to be one ridiculously talented and daring pilot to be able to pull off such stunning acrobatics in the air.", "My son and I were in our vehicle at the intersection of East Wellesley and North Crestline at about 6 PM on 10/31/08 in Spokane WA and we saw a strange object way up high in the early dusk sky due north and slightly west of us for about 5-6 minutes before it vanished behind some clouds.  Its behavior was strange because it did not move like a helicopter or plane and there were no lights of any color. The object stood out like a blimp but it was not shaped or colored like one.  It was too high up for a kite and if it was a kite at that height it was too large in size.  The object was very dark black and it moved in a somewhat hovering manner almost like a large bird but at that height and distance from us it was too large in size for a bird.  The object shape was somewhat like a boomerang, normally after seeing such an object I would be writing it off as something natural but then after 10 minutes there was no sign of the object in any direction from where we first observed it.I thought that maybe if anyone else made a report to you that my information might help, I am sorry but I had no observing or recording equipment with me at the time.", "a string of four white lights, third one blinking white, appeared about 30 feet above me about 20 feet away from me  in front of memy 13 year old daughter took our two mini dachsunds out to the bathroom at about 830 pm and came in about five minutes later to tell me she saw something weird in the trees. four lights with the third one blinking(white lights) in a straight line about 30 feet above the ground. they scared her but she watched them and they moved very very slowly to the right. she came in to get me and by the time i got out there, they were gone.", "I had just sat down on my patio partially reclined on my chair and looked to the clear sky above before sunset and spotted what was a silvery round object moving west to east as it passed over the only patch of cloud that was in the area it disappeared.  It was up to high to be a helicopter and it had no wings or vapor trail to be a plane, and to be moving horizontally and vertically disappear is unexplainable.", "Fast moving object with flashing red light near Louisville, Kentucky.A few minutes after 10 p.m. on Tuesday, October 14, 2008, I was sitting on the deck in my backyard in Louisville, Kentucky when I observed a small round object with a red flashing light and a white light which was not flashing moving from north to south across a clear sky.    The object appeared to be spinning.   I was lying on a lounge chair facing west and looking toward the sky when I first observed the object coming from the north.   The northern horizon is not visible from our house due to large trees in the neighborhood.   I observed the object first as it came into view in the sky above the trees obstructing my view of the northern horizon.I am not good at judging altitude, but I would guess that the object was at least a couple thousand feet in the air.  We live eight miles southeast of the Louisville International Airport.   The object did not come from the airport and was not going there-it was not in any kind of a holding pattern, and it was moving too fast to be a plane.   It was too high to have taken off from or to be landing at the Louisville International Airport.    I could not hear any noise from the object, but due to the constant drone of the traffic on my street and on nearby Bardstown Road, it is likely that any noise the object was making was drowned out.The sky was completely clear, and the moon was full.  Visibility of the nighttime sky is never good in my neighborhood.  We live two blocks from a major Louisville thoroughfare, Bardstown Road, and the city lights make spotting even any of the constellations difficult.  Despite the completely clear sky, few stars were visible.As I was watching the object move across the sky, my wife opened the kitchen window and asked me what I was doing.  I asked her to come outside.  She and my 15 year old daughter came out on the deck as the object was nearing the southern horizon.  They also observed the object and were unable to identify what it was.I would be interested to learn if anyone else in the Louisville area observed this object.", "A Shapeshifting Black Balloon Flashed A Red Light At MeI don&apos;t know why my report from that day was not posted.  I even spoke to the rep. at NUFORC who seemed to not want to hear many details for whatever reason.  Therefore I am posting this again.  On the date and time specified I saw a black balloon floating high in the sky as I sat on my balcony at my apartment complex.  It was a hot July evening.  I noticed the &quot;balloon&quot; and stood up to look at it.  I thought of a contest we had in Sunday school as a child in which we were all given helium ballons to tie our names and phone numbers to so that if our balloon was found we would receive a call from whomever found it.  The one found from the farthest place was the winner.Suddenly the balloon shifted into a horizontal shape and I could see what appeared to be heat waves like you see when you look down a road on a hot day. This balloon morphed back and forth from vertical balloon shape to horizontal oblong shape a few times as it moved lower in the sky and began to pass over my apartment.  I ran through my apartment to the front door.  When I emerged from the apartment the balloon was just above my apartment. It passed over me at that height and then a slit opened and a red light flashed and the slit closed.  It continued along over the next hill and morphed a few more times.  It made no sound whatsoever.  I don&apos;t know what I saw.  If you know please tell me. I have since seen a video clip of a similar thing from Bristol Va. a few days later in August of that year.", "White light over San Francisco Bay observed from Downtown OaklandWhile driving in the south direction of the 880/980 freeway (MacArthur Maze area), I noticed one bright white light in the sky.  The light was southwest of my location, approximately 45 degrees from the horizon.  The light moved down quickly and disappeared in less than a second.  The light was lower than the fog cover.  It moved much much faster than any other air traffic that was in the area. Other aircraft observed were a helicopter and planes landing/taking off from the Oakland Airport..", "UFO makes low pass over western Washington observer.I was walking across the bus park at Skagit Transit, heading for my assigned vehicle to perform my AM pre-trip prior to making my morning run from Mount Vernon to Everett, Washington.  For some unknown reason, I happened to look upward.  There I saw an object dimnly silhoutted against the night sky, moving in a straight line, south to north, in a steady and totally silent manner.  The body of this object seemed to be black, or some color slightly darker than the night sky behind it.  Its shape, as best as I could tell, looked something like a bat-wing, except the pointed parts were on the leading edge.  On the underside of this object there were two equal-sized, circular openings, which seemed to be filled with a swirling, phorphorescent vaporous substance of some sort.  It looked to be both vaporous and energized in some manner.  It was not like anything I have seen before.  These were definitely not lights; not in the sense that we think of lights.  The object had no other lights or energy sources which I could see.  These two &quot;wells&quot; took up about half the area of each side of the object.There was absolutelyl no sound associated with this sighting; not even the &quot;woosh&quot; of the air being disturbed by its passage.  It was totally silent.  The object crossed directly above me, headed on a general south-north heading, and then disappeared into the pre-dawn darkness.  The total time I observed was probably between 3 and 5 seconds.  Long enough to get a good look and discount any possibility of swamp gas, weather balloons or an early-morning stars or satellites.I spent over 20 years in the Army; almost three years in combat.  I have observed a wide assortment of aircraft in a wide assortment of applications, under a wide range of circumstances and conditions.  I have extensive exposure to many types of military aircraft, including, AH1, UH1, CH47, OH1, C113, C123, C130, C141 and C5A types.  I have observed night-time air strikes and close air support operations both day and night, and in all kinds of weather.  I have flown in and am familiar with CH47, UH1, C113, C123, C130, C141 and C5A aircraft. While assigned to Fort Lewis, WA, I lived in military housing directly under the approach paths for aircraft incoming to Grey Army Airfild for over eight years.  My point being, this observation was well outside the range of my experience and significantly enough to warrant my making this report.What could this have been?  Why was it here?  What was its mission? Where was it going (and where did it come from)?  And, most weirdly of all, why did it allow me to see it??", "The Craft Was An Orange Orb That Blinked then Dimmed And Kept Blinking Until It Sped Away And Disappeared.

I immediately thought it was it was a shooting star or some kind of meteor, but it didn&apos;t appear to be moving.

The light was about the same intensity of a car&apos;s headlamp, but pulsed with a 2 second interval in between pulses. We maintained contact with the light as we exited U32 and continued to watch the light which did not move in over a 2-3 minute period.  At this point, the light began to change color and turn from a whitish color to a red-orange and then disappeared.  My wife initially thought it could be a low flying plane or helicopter, but was disproved when we saw a helicopter flying to a local hospital...and seeing planes flying in the area.  While planes and helicopters have strobe-type lights, these where much larger and pulsed very slowly.  There also where no &quot;running lights&quot; common in other aircraft.", "At about 7pm I saw a light shaped like a sphere move across the soutghern sky briefly then disappear.From my backyard facing in a southern direction at approximately 7:pm I was admiring the early evening sky and noted the usual bright body in the lower part of the sky about twenty degrees from the horizon.

My room was on the north side of the building and the window is a north facing window. The area where I lived was 2 miles north of town. Pop. 12,000 in the town, 40,000 in whole the county. As I approached the window to see what they were, I observed over 10 small lights which alternately flashed blue, green, and reddish orange. They all seemed to be moving in a hap-hazard manner. I then noticed further up in the sky a much larger elongated craft, this object had the same color lights around it with the exclution of of the reddish-orange. I noticed a steady white light on the bottom of craft off to one end. This white light was not flashing but appeared to be from an internal light source. The distance from my location seemed to be at least a half mile at other end of a valley. The larger object was stationary throughout the sighting till the very end. I aproximate the size to be at least 200 to 300 feet long and 75-100 feet accross. The smaller lights may have been 10-15 feet across. Upon seeing this i called my mother who was in her room adjancet to mine. She looked out her window and observed the same scene. The smaller objects began to move up to the larger craft and back down below the horizon. After 20-30 seconds i spotted the objects rising back to larger craft. After 8 to 9 minutes of this action, I heard a loud roaring sound. We noticed 2 objects heading toward the larger craft but they were different from the others. As soon as i noticed them the smaller objects started to disappear inside the larger craft. The larger craft began to move away from the approaching objects, slowly at first, then at a great speed till it disappeared from view. The approaching objects gave off a loud roaring sound that gave me to believe they were some type of jets. The pursuing objects suddenly had 2 large bright orangish white lights at rear, (I assumed afterburners). The large craft well out ! accelera ted the pursuing objects as they approached the area it occupied. After this sighting, my mother was quite un-nerved and had to sit down for 45 minutes to calm down.

I slowed as much as possible to get a better view.  If I had to do it over I would have pulled over and gotten out to at least take a photo with the camera in my phone.  I observed them for as long as possible through my side mirror.I then turned to the east off of Hwy 35.  I drove the one mile to our subdivision.  As I turned into the subdivision, I saw at the end of the street another of the large circular objects low in the sky, just above the tree line.  I was frightened at first thinking that one of the three had followed me home because I had observed them.I very slowly drove down the street keeping my eyes on the object in the sky.  As I came to the end of the street, I stopped and stared up at the object through my windshield.  After about 30 seconds, the object suddenly moved up over and behind the trees, as if to hide from my view.  I could see it through the trees and very slowly turned towards my street.As I came to my street I had to turn my back to the trees where the object was positioned.  As I drove down the street I turned to look behind me and saw the object very quickly coming over the trees behind me.  I stepped on the gas to get as much distance as possible between the object an myself.  I arrived home and got my husband from inside the house to accompany me to the street to see the object.

I could still see the object in the sky ahead of me.  I suddenly found myself underneath the object.  I rolled down my window and stuck my head out to get a good view.  It was shaped like nothing I had ever seen.  It was sort of an hour-glassed shape with lights on either end and a light on the underneath.  I could hear a hum and the pitch would change as the object would light up on one end and move in that direction.  It changed directions several times.

I was filming the sky doing my UFO studies when I witnessed a white light coming down from the sky.  So I gripped my camera and I ran looking to see where this light went.  One second it was in front of me the next it was over my head. Then the next thing I knew it was just hovering left to right it was a dome shaped and changed into a saucer shape and it just took off in one second and disappeared right before my eyes. Right after that I saw a black helicopter fly over head like it was looking for something and then I saw airplanes flying over the area in pairs of threes like they were looking for something. I believe that there is something out there and the world needs to know the truth. Ask yourself in the middle of all this war why are they still sending stuff out into space that tells me that they are looking for something and that they know the truth.

I watched it for approximately 30 seconds and then the green light expanded to about 2 times the size of the visible craft and the craft at least tripled in speed.

He no sooner left than I spotted this perfectly spherical (with just a hint of wings, like the rings of Saturn) object.  It was fuzzy looking like a tennis ball, medium dark grey in color.  There were no lights of any kind, and no noise at all. It came from the West, just passing over the Oquirrh Mountains, and headed straight east over the Wasatch Mountains. It travelled the 25-35 miles from the tops of one mountain range to the other in about 30 seconds, in a perfectly straight line, like it was on rails.  It was about 1000 feet in the air by my best estimate.  At that altitude it would probably be 50 to a hundred feet across. There were no contrails. There was no wind and it did not behave like a balloon.  The air was calm and warm, no storms around.  It travelled at the same constant, fast speed.  30 miles in 30 seconds is a mile a second or 600 miles per hour.  I watched it until it started to disappear behind trees, then I ran to the street out front and continued to watch it disappear over the Wasatch Mountains.  I called the local newspaper the next day to see if anyone else had reported this UFO.  No one had. The significant thing was that it crossed perpendicular to the airlines landing pattern, which was very near to my location, and at the same general altitude, making it very dangerous to air traffic. To me that indicates something very strange. I am a retired Marine Corps Officer, 69 years old, physically fit and have 20/20 and 20/10 eyesight, and a Masters of Business degree.

From my vantage point, (on sofa looking through the rear door out onto our deck facing south, southeast) I witnessed an extremely large oval shaped object punch through a low deck of thick clouds. This object traveled somewhat slowly for about five seconds at a 45-degree angle towards the earth.At first I didn&rsquo;t know what I was seeing and jumped from the sofa expecting that an enormous military craft was going to crash many miles away. I say this because I&rsquo;ve never seen anything this giant in the sky before. To me, it appeared to be as large as an aircraft carrier and moved with that kind of &lsquo;heaviness&rsquo; or &lsquo;substance&rsquo;. It was big, oval perhaps. Once on my feet my family reacted by asking what I was looking at and I replied that I really didn&rsquo;t know, but to stay there&hellip;in case there was about to be an explosion. By this time&hellip;a few seconds later, I was throwing open the back door and was on the deck. I never lost sight of it.The craft began to speed up somewhat, crossed behind a tree close to me obscuring it for maybe a second. Once it cleared the tree (the tree was in my yard,..not far away as the craft seemed to be) the craft stopped mid-flight&hellip;just stopped. If there were humans in that thing,&hellip;they would have turned to jelly. Then there was a flash of the reddest, red I&rsquo;ve ever seen and it shot off to the horizon like a lightning bolt. This final movement was at another 45-degree angle to its angle of descent. It was a relatively clear evening with some low cirrus clouds&hellip;just before twilight. I have never witnessed anything I couldn&rsquo;t identify in the sky in my life. I am an avid amateur astronomer and am familiar with objects that appear in the sky&hellip;day and night. I am also a professional photographer and have never witnessed or photographed the color &lsquo;red&rsquo; that the craft emitted before it jetted off. None of my family saw the thing and that&rsquo;s why I have not reported it. I know with no proof of fact,..it&rsquo;s just a story. Yet, my family and friends DID see my reaction to it and they can tell you I&rsquo;ve not moved that quickly in years.The reason I report this now is that my wife just read today about some sightings in Stephenville, TX. I watched the amateur video footage and saw something that resembled that color &lsquo;red&rsquo; in the lights that were recorded. My wife requested me to report what I&rsquo;d seen. Hope this helps,  Scott Palmer", "Large Fireball Seen Falling from East to WestWhile sitting in front yard of home with neighbors enjoying the evening, my neighbor and I witnessed a fireball moving from Southeast to Southwest, falling downward until it disappeared from our view. It may have been a meteoroid or other debris entering Earths atmosphere. The fireball had a long tail and lasted for almost 10 seconds. The object did not make any noise that we were able to hear from our vantage point.This event would appear to be the one as witnessed by several others in Ocala, FL(see other sighting from same date) which is about 45 miles south of Flemming Island.

We were at the intersection of Witzel and Oakwood looking west, when we saw the flying object in the sky. At first there was one bright dot, but then 2 seconds later, sporadically 6 more dots appeared in a slanted line. We then turned left onto Oakwood going towards Mercy Medical Center, and took a right on 9th, going west. We then again saw the exact same formation of dots in the sky. It was me, my mom, and my friend who saw it. But like I said there were five witnesses, my friend was texting his friend, and when he told them what we saw, they said that they saw the exact same thing.

There was no electricity for many hours, so my husband and I decided to cook our dinner on our outdoor barbeque and invite our neighbor over. We sat on the back porch and it was around 9 p.m., when the three of us went into the backyard. From the corner of my eye, I saw something coming fast and looked up, as did my neighbor.  My husband was looking in the opposite direction.  A disk/saucer shape that glowed light orange-white was racing across the sky, slightly skipping/shifting from side to side.  Since there was no electricity, there was no light pollution and we got a good look.  It was about the size of a tablet of aspirin held at arms length.  We watched it long enough that I began to crouch down afraid.  It went across the sky in about 8 seconds and then tilted up into the night and disappeared -- I&apos;ve never forgotten it and wonder if anyone else saw it.

I stepped out of my car and heard nothing, so i got back in and watched.  After a few minutes the object rose up into the sky and dimmed, after about 3 or 4 seconds it lit up instantly and started doing bigger faster circles around the mountain, even coming close to the reservoir at times.

Afterwards I began to scan the sky, as it was an exceptionally clear night.  I saw the usual streaks across the sky from debris hitting the atmosphere.  I remained scanning for quite some time that morning.06:03 EST Looking out at Orion, I noticed a star-like object moving through the constellation.  As the object approached the Belt area it got brighter and brighter; To the point that it was brighter than Jupiter or Venus, for that matter.  It stayed that way for 10 seconds or so, then it began to dim in luminosity as it cleared the last star of the belt of Orion.  It became as dim as it was when I first noticed it in the sky moving in the same direction.  I watched this object for some two minutes in total, as it faded towards the horizon.  I figured that I just saw a satellite.  It got brighter when the Sun reflected off of it&hellip;Or so I thought.06:12 EST Like the first object, there was another.  Following the same path as the first.  Only this one did not increase brightness.  Note:  These objects did not follow the usual air traffic flight paths through the Pittsburgh area.  The sky was clear enough to see strobes from aircraft at 60,000 ft.  From my perspective, these were not aircraft.06:23 EST With daylight approaching, looking up facing the southern sky, a triangular shape flew overhead at incredible speed.  It was as fast as an incoming meteor, but this thing changed direction from southwest to west.  It headed towards the horizon where the first two objects faded away.  It made no sound.  There were no lights of any kind.  There was enough light from the twilight of morning to ID its shape.Just thinking about how big it had to be boggles my mind.  This thing was 2 to 2-1/2 inches from my perspective.  If it went by in space; Isn&rsquo;t that close to 160 miles up?  That means it had to be more than a mile wide or more.", "Three objects that are silent and unexplainableI woke up and could not go back to sleep. I went outside to smoke a cigarette, while I was outside, I noticed a bright light in the NorthWest sky travelling East. I watched it for about 10 seconds, until I saw, out of the corner of my eye, a dark shape moving South at a slow speed. It appeared to be shaped like a vee, but no lights and no sound. It traveled South for about 2 or 3 seconds from when I sighted it to when a tree blocked my sight. This object seemed to be about the same height that a  small propeller driven airplane would be, and travelled about twice as fast. Then about 3 weeks later, I was out at about 5:30 or so in the morning. I saw an object travelling South. This object was the same shape as the vee, only it had lights. One light was in the center, while the other four were equaldistantly spaced outward on the vee. These lights appeared to be on the rear side of the object, as it was moving away from me and the dark shape of the vee was in front of the lights. I should mention that the lights were not bright, in fact they blended in with the starlight all around quite well. The object, when I saw it, was at about a 45 degree angle for about 2 seconds. Then it leveled off and went south for about 2 seconds until that same tree obscured my view again. Once again, there was no sound. This is very strange to me, since two sightings happened so close together at the same location, and pretty much the same time of day.

It was dark; the sky was clear and there was little or no wind.  My attention was drawn towards a slow moving object to the south west, which was travelling in a north easterly direction. I would estimate the height to be somewhere between 3 and 5 thousand feet.  I was immediately suspicious because the object was bright orange in colour.  As it drew closer (less than one mile) it slowed down and maintained its position above the ground.  A short time later, it backed away, whilst climbing sharply at an acute angle.  It was travelling at an incredible speed and within 20 seconds or so, it was the size of a distant star.  We observed it moving from side to side between 3 stars which were in close proximity to each other.  At no time did I hear the sound of engines or a propulsion system.

It was around 3:45 to 4am but before I walked inside I lit up a cigarette and started to smoke it on my porch.  I don&rsquo;t like to smoke inside my house.   I looked up and about 3 miles away I saw this orange ball of light in the sky and at first I thought it was a plane with orange headlights because my house faces the London airport about 8 miles east of my place.  When I looked at it waiting for it to fly over my house or away It didn&rsquo;t, it just stood there.  Then I ran inside to get my camera and to take a picture.    I hurried because I didn&rsquo;t want it to go away.  Of course my digital camera was low on batteries so I could only manage to take one shot before it shut down on me.

I remember because I had a summer job working at a ranch with my step father.We were driving back from Alice, TX which is a town ten miles from San Diego, TX.  We would go there to look for girls and like the rest of times we came up short that night.  Well, we were about 3 miles from San Diego when a big white bird flew across the rode.  It flew from right to left, then up.  This is what caused us to look in that direction. Abe was driving his small Ford Escort, (he was the first to see it) I was seating in the passenger seat.  Pat was right behind me.  Then next to him was Javier then Spencer.  Unfortunately Pat wasn&rsquo;t able to see this thing from where he was sitting and now we always giving him crap about not seeing it. So, Abe shouts, &quot;What the hell is that!&quot;  I look to see and there it was.High up in the air was this Green Rectangle.  Looking at a full moon it would be twice the size.  The shape and color was awe looking.  I hear people say it&rsquo;s like being in a movie but it&rsquo;s not like that at all.  It&rsquo;s real; it&rsquo;s out of this world.  I&rsquo;m feeling funny just writing and thinking of the magnitude of what we were all a witness to.  It&rsquo;s scary. The color of it was green for sure, but the clarity of it was what gets to me.  It was like a green you&rsquo;ve never seen before. The green was almost smoke like but solid at the same time. The smoke may have been the light reflecting off the clouds. The interior of it was black or we couldn&rsquo;t see it. The size of it!!! I believe with all of my heart, that as far as it was and how big&hellip; it must have been 3 football fields wide.  That&rsquo;s the one thing I&rsquo;m mostly sure of out of this whole thing. It was moving up slowly, straight up, and then it was gone. The interior of the car which was silent is now loud with gibberish and yelling with, &quot;What was it!&quot; and &quot;What do we do?&quot; it was chaotic for bit but we gathered ourselves and went our separate ways that night.

The object in question appeared to be a white light whose intensity matches that of a bright star. The object moved relatively fast however not so fast that this factor in and of itself made me suspect that what I observed might be of unknown origins. The most significant detail of this experience was the absence of any blinking or otherwise red/green lights on the sides of the object as would identify a passenger jet. Furthermore the object made no noise yet it flew at an altitude that seemed to be characteristic of that of a plane that might be leaving or landing at DFW International Airport (relatively low).

The body of the craft appeared to be irregular as far as the texture. It appeared to be pink and some parts red like what the moon would look like if it was going the speed of light.  The collar around it looked like it was manufactured and almost appeared to be opaque with a red outline. This thing was there for only a split second and was gone.  The craft moved so fast that it appeared to dissapear.  However there was a very short, bright trail of sparks in the sky when it left.Okay, now for the real kick, did you ever recall looking skyward and seeing these short burst of sparks and saying, &quot;wow, I just saw a shooting star&quot;.  You know what, its not a star its them. Nowdays if you look skyward at night for any length of time you&apos;ll see these trails of sparks often enough.  Never use to but now we do.  I had made an attempt to bring this to someones attention but instead I spoke to what can only be called the smartest person in the world because this individual didn&apos;t want to hear anyone but himself talk.((text deleted))", "V shaped,  sequential red strobing lights on lateral surfaces, enormous size1/4 mile or greater, no sound.I am a 35 year old male and have the need to share with you this sighting, for it has troubled my mind for the last few years. I have finally been given the strength and courage through much prayer, as to have a record be given of this experience and the significance of this event. On the night of this sighting, I felt compelled to go outside for reasons only God knows the answer to. On or around the the 28th of July, 2006 at 7:00pm....I was witness to a craft which was traversing the sky, at around or above 18,000 feet. I observed it from on our balcony facing due south, in the direction of its flight path. If you know where the I-5 and 14 freeways intersect, this is the general area it was heading from my vantage point.The location was over the Santa Clarita Valley,(Canyon Country is where I lived specifically) and was headed in a southwest direction toward the San Fernando Valley...(both are in the Los Angeles County area respectively). This craft was a boomerang or chevron configuration. It closely resembled a letter V.It emitted no sound and had red strobing lights running laterally down the trailing edges of the body. These lights did not blink, but rather faded one after another before cycling again down the craft&apos;s wing structure. I would with near 100% confidence estimate this V shaped vehicle to be in excess of 1,000 feet...or nearly a 1/4 mile in width wing tip to wing tip! The speed of this vehicle defied aerodynamic law for a vehicle that would have been under conventional propulsion with regard to aircraft such as fixed wing prop, or jets. It moved very slow. The length of time of our sighting was roughly 5-7 minutes, before disappearing beyond mountains that obscured further observation.I can estimate the altitude of flight because it was higher than the Cirrus clouds. Enough light was present from the still fading sun to observe cloud cover and the black coloration of the craft, and was coming back into view from behind (or above) clouds at times. The clouds were sparse and not very many were present.I think you will love to know, that 2 others were able to observe this UFO with me. My mother and father. When I initially saw this thing, I ran into the house and alerted my parents to the presence of this craft. They followed me to the balcony and stood in utter shock as we observed it together. My mother noticed something that gave her a point of reference to the scale of this thing. She pointed out that a passenger aircraft was flying literally UNDER it! Yes we saw it pass under the V shaped craft because the jet was visible with the craft behind or above it in the background. This was possibly a 747 jet aircraft (we saw the jet had 4 wing mounted engines). I made the comment,&quot; Holy crap...that jet could land on it Mom&quot;! The size of the jet was like that of a tic tac in the sky, the V shaped craft was bigger than her fist when she held her hand in front of her and tried to cover it.One more key element that is quite possibly VERY significant. After our sighting of the V shaped craft, for many days afterward, we saw numerous times F-16 aircraft making a highly unusual amount of flights over the area we saw this thing. These F-16&apos;s were seemingly &quot;looking&quot; for it. They traversed the same direction (south western), then east to west and north to south, between the hours of 7pm to 9pm for the next 3 days. They would also fly quite low and then would be at higher altitudes when making grid like flights.They flew in formations of 2 and 3 at a time.What is also unusual is they were flying in airspace that is used by commercial aircraft, let alone the UFO itself had done this also. In and outbound flights use that same airspace from Van Nuys A.P., Burbank A.P. and Whitman A.P. It is interesting to note that Edwards Air Force Base (about 90 miles) and the Naval Air Weapons Station (about 97miles) in China Lake are closest to the location of our sighting and possibly where these jets were based out of.My father later made the comment, &quot;I was in the navy, and that thing was bigger than an aircraft carrier, and it was in the damned sky&quot;! They are now true believers that there are things in this world that are not of this world. Whether or not this vehicle was of our own design, that of extra-terrestrials or a combination thereof or somewhere in between does not matter, it was there and they exist...PERIOD!", "Star shaped light blinking and rotating - then two of same lights after cloud went over and began to moveLast evening, October 1, 2008, at approximately 8:00 p.m. I was walking my dog in the Country Club area of Wilson, NC (40 miles east of Raleigh, NC).  The sky was semi-clear with a few occasional clouds.  As I  looked up a saw a light hovering &ndash; not overhead &ndash; but in front of me, probably about the height of a airplane midway down to landing.   The thing that caught my attention was that this light wasn&rsquo;t moving &ndash; it literally was hovering.  As I walked along and got focused on the light it looked like a star-shaped light (individual lights in the shape) at the bottom that were blinking/rotating.  I thought it was odd as I have never in my 52 years seen something in the sky that resembled this kind of light. After a few minutes of staring at this light a cloud went over it.  When the light reappeared it then looked like there were two sets of star-shaped lights that were blinking and rotating.  After the second set of lights appeared the object began to move southward in the sky at a much greater rate than I have ever seen an airplane.  I watched it for a minute or so and then the lights disappeared. I telephoned the non-emergency 911 number but was told no one else had reported seeing this light.  I am sending in this report just because I know this was not an airplane.  I have Googled all morning what kind of object would have this type of lighting on the bottom but all I have come up with are unidentified flying objects - -", "Slow Moving Fireball ?????My daughter saw the object 1st. We all looked up into the Western sky. It was at about a 45 degree angle from us. The distance was hard to judge. It was night time and there was low cloud cover as well. The object seemed stationary and appeared to be burning Orange / Reddish in color. It was below the cloud ceiling. It began to move slowly across the sky from West to South East. It moved in a slow jerking motion at first,  It began to burn less bright as it flew. It traveled like this for about a 4 minutes. It didn&apos;t appear to travel very far,. Then it went out. The object than traveled the remainder of the skyline at a rapid pass. Even though it was dark you could still see a dark egg shaped object flying under the cloud ceiling headed in a southeast direction. The entire time there was no apparent sound from the object.  The whole event took 4 - 6 minutes. After retuning home I looked up this sighting on your webpage. It is very similar.

It traveled across the sky under the clouds, then it slowed down and turned red, it became smaller and smaller until it vanished. (It made no sound)", "I observed an object that was extremely bright and appeared to be close to the ground, as if it were an airplane heading to the nearby airport, while traveling eastbound on interstate highway 80/94, about a mile away from the Grant Street exit. The object that was observed piqued my interest, and I searched for other blinking lights that would give it away as either a helicopter or jumbo/private jet.  These other lights were not found. I told my passenger to check it out, to see if he could make out the object better than I could. Eventually even another passenger in the back seat witnessed the object, but could still not determine its origin, nor identify what it was, except for the fact that it was very bright. Shortly afterward, the object disappeared into a cloud, and as we all waited for it to emerge, the light shining through the aforementioned clouds dimmed and was suddenly extinguished.Note: All observers are males age 21-25 with college-level educations and above-average intellects.", "Cylinder hsape UFO from south to north Miami FloridaRiding Bike heading east on Sw 117 Kendall before the train tracks.

I ventured off to look for a stick.  I looked up in the sky and called to my friend. In the sky were 5 oval shaped things with 100 feet long tails.  The color of the craft was white with red flaming tails.  The distance apart was at least 20 meters appart.  Planes have to be 100 meters apart so we know it can&apos;t be airplanes.

It was in shape of a triangle, with round lights along each angle. It flew away at a slow speed for around half a mile. I ran inside the house and started flashing the outside lights and the ship stopped in mid air turned around and came and stood over us for around 4 minutes.

Steve Bass, now SSD/FI in Cumming Georgia, was assigned to assist in the investigation. Investigative chores and additional contact with the witness were on-going from mid-April through June and July of 2008. Various authorities and media were contacted during the administrative phase, to include; FAA; Dobbins ARB Public Affairs; Marietta Daily Journal; Atlanta Journal Constitution; NORAD Public Affairs; the Marietta Police Dept; No corroborative information was forthcoming from any of these agencies. NORAD specifically reported that no anomalies had been noted in the area in question. A FOIA against the FAA filed by FI Bass produced a letter of negative findings from the Director, ATO Eastern Service Center, FAA. Sheets/Bass conducted an on-site interview with the witness on 20May08, as well as a site survey of the neighborhood.Steve Bass also conducted an interview with the second witness (an across-the-street neighbor) who, unknown to the Primary Witness at the time, observed the event from outside of his home on 29March08. Please note that this event was not reported by the PW until 14 days after it&apos;s occurrence. Interview with the Primary Witness (PW): We met the witness at his residence in Marietta, an extremely well kept home, the contents of which demonstrated superior tastes in decorating and living environment. The witness was found to possess a broad scientific background, well educated and well spoken. PW holds USAF certifications that would probably equal an Associates Degree in Electronics (radio, navigation, and radar), as well as aviation training to pilot a Cessna aircraft. Additional advanced education includes a BS in Biochemistry from Purdue and a Masters in Business, also from Purdue. He is presently retired from the largest computer firm in the world, and indicates travel to more than 40 countries during his active career. His wife of many years is still actively engaged in the business world. These investigators found that the described event (as well as two previous encounters with unknown objects) had greatly affected the PW. He had become HIGHLY motivated to seek answers to what was observed, and began a vigorous pursuit of various areas of research immediately after 29March08. (Note-The PW has now obtained his MUFON FI&apos;s credentials and has become a valuable asset in MUFONGA operations in the area of Cobb County Georgia). The witness recounted the facts he described in his CMS report and different areas were refined by these FIs with additional questions. PW said that upon first observation of the lights at about 10:30PM, it was as if he was observing a &apos;descent&apos;. As the event unfolded, he attempted to see beyond the lighting configuration to get the details of exactly what was over his property, but was unable to determine any actual structural detail due to the darkness and obvious dark coloration of the object itself. Gathered from this interview, it is obvious the PW seemed to have had a certain &apos;calling&apos; as FI Bass describes it. A &apos;calling&apos; to go out and check his mail, then something that drew his attention to the sky and the subsequent observations and hearing of the described low &apos;winding down&apos;, jet engine-like sound. During said observations, the PW was himself mystified by his conduct and other side issues........that the tree branches overhead in the location to which he had rushed should have been noticeable during the event, but it was if he was looking up with no branches in evidence. Thereafter he lost interest, as if it &apos;was over&apos; and the lights/object began to move away, but he then became, and remains, extremely motivated to delve into this and other such mysteries. (See witness account field). PW said he determined there was no missing time related to the occurrence. While some might not understand the &apos;unusual&apos; feelings attributed to this matter, this writer (Sheets) has experienced the exact same conditions prior to a surprise observation of a major unknown aerial event. In 1997, the writer was investigating two substantial cases; one in Lagrange Georgia within Georgia&apos;s infamous &apos;Troup-Heard UFO Corridor&apos;; and in south Georgia, a series of night reports from law enforcement officials in Jeff Davis County. The Lagrange investigation was arranged for a certain day, and upon grabbing my FI&apos;s kit and walking out the door, the writer felt a certain &apos;calling&apos; (a VERY strong urge) to INSTANTLY and INEXPLICABLY change plans and drive 150+ miles to Jeff Davis County and work on those cases, which had actually been scheduled for the NEXT WEEK. A tense, expectant sensation pervaded the whole drive down to south Georgia........said feelings and sensations ENDING immediately after observation of a dramatic, unknown, night-time aerial display in the area of Jeff Davis County (as if &quot;well, it&apos;s over, that&apos;s it&quot;). Thus, a better understanding of the feelings and motivations of the PW. After reviewing all of the circumstances involved in this case, there seems to be some sort of unknown influence at work in this matter. Is this witness, as well as others, more sensitive or more attuned to anomalies in our environment? I would say yes. Do some true &apos;unknowns&apos;, perhaps controlled or generated by an unseen intelligence, project some sort of subtle communication that can be perceived by such sensitive individuals as our PW, or perceived by others known to this writer both within and without MUFON, and perceived by the writer himself? I would say yes. Do some unknown objects project an unusual &apos;zone&apos; as they hover or move........a zone created by electromagnetic fields, ionization, propulsion, or some other mechanism......giving effects that can influence those nearby? Again I would say yes. In past years, this FI has encountered other case witnesses who have reacted in a similar way, ! some eve ntually joining MUFON and making valuable contributions to our effort, and others not joining the chapter, but remaining &apos;friends&apos; of MUFON for many years. Finally, might some form of &apos;telepathy&apos; also be involved in such cases?  Perhaps. On 20May08, photographs and an event-scene diagram were made, and FI Steve Bass conducted an in-depth interview with the second (separated) witness in this case at his residence across the street from the PW&apos;s home. From FI Bass&apos; field notes and interview:  The second witness (W2) was found to be the mature male homeowner across the street from PW. He is a former aircraft mechanic for defense contractor Lockheed of Marietta, and also a former Lockheed buyer who is ten credit hours away from his Masters in Accounting. In addition to this interview, W2 also provided a sketch of what he observed on the night of 29March08, superimposed onto a printed blow-up photo of PW&apos;s home and property. (See photo and sketch). This witness indicates in margin notes on his sketch that he is familiar (due to his past occupation) with the C-5, C-141, C-130, F-16, F-22, DC-9 and other aircraft which fly out of nearby Dobbins ARB. W2 stated that it was a quiet night in the neighborhood with no one out and about, little traffic, no barking dogs. He stepped outside of his garage to smoke a cigarette between 9 and 10:00PM. He then looked to the east, then ESE, and observed the object in the sky blocking his vision across the street, flying slow and low, right to left, and was about 30 degrees off of the horizon, perhaps about 500 to 1000 feet above ground level. He heard no noise nor saw any lights, and indicated the duration was about 10-20 seconds. Moving at very slow speed, it disappeared to the north, finally about 10-20 degrees above the horizon of the adjacent National Forest. He is of the opinion that it looked brown to him, and as it moved off he got his only look at a more distinct outline, the portion he saw looking like a &apos;submarine&apos;. W2 said he was surprised and excited and considered calling his neighbor (the PW) but did not, feeling he might already be in bed (he did not know at the time that his neighbor, the PW, had been outside and also made the observation, although from a different angle). An additional conundrum involving W2 is the fact that he was outside in order to smoke a cigarette. FI Bass determined that W2 &apos;lit-up&apos; IMMEDIATELY prior to seeing the object, Bass then inquiring where he was on the cigarette when the object had disappeared. W2 replied that he had finished it, which would have taken at least 5 minutes, 10 minutes max..........however W2&apos;s event duration was described as being 10-20 seconds. Is W2 just mistaken about the cigarette time sequence? Was some sort of time distortion in play i.e. the close proximity of the object projecting an influence over W2? Is this an example of missing time? This matter was not resolved........there were just no firm conclusions in this cigarette vs. time issue. FI Bass continued his commentary regarding W2.....throughout the interview, W2 was relaxed and nonchalant and did not go for a &apos;more amazing story&apos;. He sometimes searched for the correct words, speaking slowly, and did not appear confused nor did he go on tangents while talking i.e. staying on the subject at hand. It should be noted here that W2 has been diagnosed with brain cancer, but it seemed not to have been at the stage that affected his thinking or perception very much, if at all. Upon the FIs arrival on 20May08, he was busily at work in his garage tinkering with a lawn mower on his shop bench, and thereafter conversed well with these FIs prior to his official statement to FI Bass. FI Bass&apos; comments regarding the witness are to the effect that this condition &quot;seems to mildly affect concentration&quot;, but W2 is still &quot;articulate, intelligent, easily understood, relaxed demeanor, humorous and matter-of-fact&quot;. It is obvious to these investigators that from the credibility of the two separated witnesses and all of their supportive documents and sketches, and from our investigative findings, that an object from unknown origins overflew low and slow the Marietta Georgia property of the PW on 29March08 at about 10:30PM. Said object was MASSIVE in size, with the PRECISE shape undetermined due to darkness but believed to be rectangular, and containing an array of lights as described and obviously making the bizarre low sound as heard by the PW. From the PW and W2 sketches, photographs made on-site, and other diagrams, this writer feels that while the PRECISE shape is unknown, the size of this massive object might be as large as a football field 300&apos;x160&apos;. Though from W2&apos;s description of it flying away and presenting a &quot;submarine&quot; like appearance, it indeed could have been a geometric shape or a rectangle as seen in profile. Again, it was dark and the objects surface was also dark except for the lights observed by the PW. Note: This event occurred about four (4) miles WNW of Dobbins Air Reserve Base, which also houses the defense contractor offices and factory of Lockheed-Martin. (The home of the PW is in a direct line almost exactly four miles WNW of the westerly end of the Dobbins main runway). Both the military and Lockheed utilize the common air facility. In recent months, MUFONGA has received some additional unsubstantiated information about &apos;unusual&apos; aerial sightings in that vicinity. FI Bass, with knowledge gained from his aviation work and a review of certain public resources related to this facility, found some possible unusual features within the said compound. It has been found that the Lockheed portion of the compound is PARTICULARLY tight in it&apos;s security, which is as it should be for a defense contractor. However these other factors causes one to wonder exactly how forthright is the official response when we seek information regarding things occurring on the doorstep of Dobbins ARB and environs. BGE; Information Quality 100%=1; Reliability 74%=0.74; Strangeness 14.286%=0.14286; Certainty Index 10.58%=0.1058. Due to these aforementioned factors, this case is classified as an &apos;Unknown-UAV&apos;. Many photos, diagrams, sketches, maps and other official documents were generated by this investigation, too numerous for posting on CMS. The most descriptive and vital of these documents will be electronically attached and the remainder saved in the physical file.

Now I feel lucky that I&apos;m a small percentage of people to witness something like this.  I remember the date and time as I had started a new job that day. I took our two dogs out to go to the bathroom around 8:30pm.  We had no fence around the yard at the house we had just moved into, so I had to stand outside with them.  The sky was clear that night and the weather in eastern Oregon in March at night is usually not to cold. I was facing west, watching the dogs when something caught my attention.  I don&apos;t remember a sound, so I don&apos;t know why I turned to look.  I looked to the SE over my left shoulder and saw 4 or 5 white lights moving towards me on a NW path, a little more west than north.  The lights seemed to trail the one in front of it, but had its own flight path.  They appeared like one side of a triangle with the other side gone and no back side.  I would guess the lights to be no more than 2000 feet above the ground and traveled at a slow speed, between 50 and 100mph. My first thought was that it was the wing of a very large plain with lights on it.  But the lights were only a block or so away and I didn&apos;t hear any noise.  This also ruled out helicopters.   I watched the lights fly over the neighbors house directly to the south of my house and where I was standing with no sound at all!  At this point I was not worried, my brain was just trying to figure out what these lights were.  As I watched the lights move in the WNW path something happened that put fear into me.  Once the lights were 2 or 3 blocks past my house, the lights started moving into a circle pattern.  The first light started into the circle pattern with the others following, keeping the distance between them.  The did one or two circles, continued NW and moved out of range of my vision.  I wasn&apos;t sure if the forward momentum stopped when they started to circle, or if they continued to move forward. I called my wife outside in the event they might come back.  She said she could tell by the tone of my voice that something was wrong. I spent 4 years in the Air Force and have watched countless plains fly.  What these lights did (with no sound) is not something I believe our technologies are capable of.", "Midnight 10/27/08 Dallas,TX. Two formations - semicircular &amp; v-shaped. 1st moved from north to south. 2nd moved from east to west.Starting at 11:53 as I lay on the porch of my four-story townhouse in downtown Dallas. I was looking up at the night sky and I saw a semicircular object moving from north to south. The shape looked like an incomplete circle of lights that was missing about 1 or 2 lights that would have completed the circle. The single lights that made up the incomplete circle were blue-white and circular, and there were probably about 7 of them. It was moving across the sky at about the same speed that a plane would but it was moving in very sudden, subtle movements and it wasn&apos;t exactly moving in a straight line. It also seemed like it would stop on a dime and then continue as it was. Also, when I looked at the formation it looked as if I were squinting my eyes and looking at a streetlight (it was blurry), but as I looked at the stars near the formation, I could see them clearly. They continued on their path for about 2-3 minutes until they disappeared on the other side of my roof. After that I saw another formation moving from west to east. This was probably at 12:30-12:45. It was in a V-shape and it wasn&apos;t as blurry as the first one. Again it was moving at about the same speed as an airplane. These could have been jets in a very precise formation heading somewhere but it was completely inaudible.

The air temperature at ground level was between 40 to 49 degrees Fahrenheit.The object was observed for approximately ninety seconds to two minutes thirty seconds. I was about twenty yards east of a fairly-high treeline, but was looking through a gap in the canopy (for at least the final part of the sighting).The object demonstrated the following characteristics:  1) The size of the object appeared similar to that of airliners at high altitude (30,000 ft approx.).2) The shape of the object seemed to differ from that of airliners however (it seemed lumpish, as a large grain of sand).  This characteristic is what first caught my eye. High-quality IS binoculars were needed to clarify and I didn&rsquo;t have any.3) The color of the object was at first darkish, then further along it became highly reflective (due to solar reflection).4) The altitude of the object was perhaps 25,000 ft to 35,000 ft as during part(s) of the sighting it seemed to be passing through high thinish cirrus-type clouds.5)  The speed of the object appeared to be similar to airliners at altitude.6)  The object maintained a straight course.7)  A striking and much more clearly distinctive (vs. the indistinctive shape) characteristic was the lack of any vapor trail whatsoever. Several airliners in the vicinity [traveling in various directions] were all emitting heavy vapor trails.Finally the object seemed to pass into a thin and narrow cirrus-type cloud and I didn&rsquo;t see it emerge (It may/must have but I was mildly frustrated by not seeing that).  It was about this time if I remember aright that I noticed two eastbound airliners (one trailing the other by possibly several minutes) approaching the vicinity to the south of the object. I waited a minute or two then continued on.Perhaps the lack of vapor was attributable to a propeller-driven aircraft and/or the altitude being rather lower than estimated(??).To give an inkling of the general location of the object in the sky I sighted it not directly overhead, but angled down 10 to 15 degrees to the south from the zenith, then up 60 to 80 degrees above the western horizon when initially spotted, then 30 degrees or so above the western horizon when visual contact was lost.

I called to several other Airmen, who also observed the lights decend to a point just inside the base. They had moved in unison across the sky, in a manner no plane could duplicate.  After about 3 minutes , a blue flash of light arose at about the point the lights had disapeared from sight.  A series of explosions continued on light towers around the perimeter, neat the flight line, and the entire base went dark.  The official explanation was, that a snake had crawled into a transformer, causing the outage.  I told my O.I.C. the next morning about the incident.  She stated the her husband, who was a pilot, had not taken a flight in over 30 days, without one or more ufo&apos;s in attendance.

The object had a trail and to my recollection it was greenish blue.My wife and I were traveling southbound on US 65 highway that evening, returning from Sedalia to our home in Cole Camp.  The sight of this object made us quickly forget about what we had been discussing and take interest in this object.  When sighted we were near the intersection of US 65 and westbound MO 50.  After the object dissapeared out of sight to the southeast we proceeded southbound.  We traveled as far south as Lincoln while keeping our eyes fixed low on the sky to the south.  No other sighting was made.I had discussed the sighting with my father a few days later to find out of he had witnessed anything similar that evening.  He had not.  I have not reported this sighting until now as I have just discovered this website and decided to specifically search for other accounts of this event.The above time is approximate - I will attempt to reconcile my time that evening against other records and clarify it further in the near future.", "Unidentified Very Bright Flying Object with Red, White, and Blue Flashing LightsLast Thursday night, September 25, 2008, at around 9:oopm,  I noticed a very bright light sitting stationary in the northeastern sky well below the stars.  It perked my curiosity because it was much brighter than any star and was not moving like an airplane would move.  As I continued watching the object, I could pick out three distinct flashing  colors, which were red, white, and blue.  I also noticed movement in the object, such as zig zagging, a dipping back and forth motion, twitching movements, and a downward swirling movement. It has also darted away to the left, only to fly back in from the right and stop in the same location.  It has showed up for the last five nights in a row, Friday night, Saturday night, Sunday night, Monday night, and Tuesday night, between the times of 9:00pm and 11:00pm.  Generally, we locate it in the northeastern part of the sky.  However, last Monday night, it was more towards the northwest and in a couple of hours had moved to its usual location in the northeast.  My husband, my two children, and I have viewed it through my son&rsquo;s telescope on two nights, last Sunday night and last night, which was Tuesday night.  Through the telescope three very bright red, white, and blue lights appear to be flashing and chasing each other in a circle on this object.  It is definitely not a star, planet, airplane, or a helicopter.  It is something very technological in nature.  As each night progressed and the time became later and later, this object appears to climb higher and higher into the night sky, almost out of view.  Any busy or fatigued person just glancing at it would probably just shrug it off as star when it is sitting still or an airplane when it is moving straight through the sky. It really has to be studied to pick up on the three brightly colored flashing lights and the unusual movement of the object at times.  It is amazing and very fun to watch.  It has made an interesting addition to our home school.  My children can&rsquo;t wait until dark to find out if ! it is ba ck in the sky.  They love to view it through the telescope, as do I.  This lighted unidentified  object would be perfect for anyone wanting to research or investigate  further, because it has appeared without fail now for the last six nights, and I anticipate it will also appear tonight.  We would love to share it with the world, but we do not own a video camera and a simple still photo from our distance would not do it justice.  We have told family and friends to look out for it at night; however, they are all already in bed when we bring out the telescope and I would feel kind of silly reporting it to law enforcement. It really has to be seen with your own eyes, and then you still won&apos;t  believe what you are seeing, and you will not want to stop watching!((NUFORC Note:  Probably a star.

It was a cold night with no cloud cover.  I observed a star like object come over the horizon (thought to be an airplane) traveling in a Northerly direction, except it never had any blinking lights (navigation lights), then it just stopped in the sky, and if you had not seen it move  into position, one could easily assume it was just another star in the sky.  Now thinking it was maybe a helicopter (no sound though) it just stayed in that position for at least an hour, then it would change it&apos;s position in very straight lines, then stop at intervals of 15 to 20 minutes, sometimes covering large distances.  Using a extremely bright LED flashlight, *in a joking manner* I tried to flash it with a morse code like pattern, and to my surprise it appeared to move no longer in straight lines but curved lines at a higher rate of speed.  then stopping to hold a position.  It appeared at this time to change it&apos;s &quot;shine pattern&quot; maybe changing the color of the light and even shape.  Eventually it went back to the star appearance held position, and eventually moved off in a NW direction in a slow straight line until out of view.  this all took place between 9pm and 1am.

I saw some flashing lights in the sky.  I thought at first they might be sky -searching advertising lights but saw no connection to the ground.   I saw two very large circular/oval white nebulous shapes making very quick circular patterns in the sky.  The two white shapes were hazier than search lights and their patterns danced quickly as if two children were playing with LED lights.  They circled counter-clock-wise continuously and always avoided overlapping each other.  They seem to be chasing each other like two butterflies in the sky.  Their flight patterns seem to be extemporaneous and random circling left in small areas and at other times very large areas many miles apart.   At times they disappeared behind thin layers of clouds.  The clouds were not low and there were not many clouds.  I was fascinated by this and thought to myself I had never seen anything like this in my 63 years on Earth.  I walked two doors down and brought out my neighbor to view the scene.  He agreed that he had never seen anything like that and added he did not believe that it could be search lights, LED lights or airplanes and stated that it looked very high.

It was difficult to see them as she told me that they weren&apos;t any sort of known aircraft. I was finally after a couple of minutes able to see them and instructed her to continue watching them as to I was going to get my camera. I ran back into our apartment and got my Canon 5D camera and switched lenses to a 70 to 200mm zoom to attempt to get a shot of them. I used the automatic settings on the camera to insure I did get some quick results if possible. Once back outside I did see them for a second time and proceeded to take a few photographs of each object. The first photograph was taken at 17:47. Neighbors of ours saw me run outside of our apartment with my camera and decided to follow me to see what was going on. They too saw the objects.

NY stock market hours) and decided to go outside and walked out towards LAX which is directly next door to the South. The weather was impeccable approaching 80 degrees and very sunny and crystal clear skies. I crossed the street and went East on a small street that looped behind the local neighborhood HS.As the barren street curved around back of the school I noticed an LAPD (airport police) car with one officer parked facing the same direction I was now walking (North). I passed him on the sidewalk. Continuing my walk I was looking up and noticed the typical air traffic headed East in the usual daytime flight path for approach to LAX from over the water. Suddenly I see what appear to be two large white spherical helium balloons revolving around each other in a jerky manner that I considered odd since the breeze was about 5mph from the South. They appeared low over the rooftops. I continued to watch the objects and they seemed to stop their Westward movement and began to slowly rise. They appeared to be below 1000 ft. when first spotted because I could clearly see the jet traffic well above it. The object(s) continued slowly rising in the northern sky about 30degrees from zenith still doing this strange revolving movement. I watched them rise until they were at least 30,000 feet because they were well above the air traffic at this time.About this time the LAPD car which was almost a block behind me decided to move on. As he passed me I pointed to the sky and pointed to what was by now a very small spec in the sky. He eventually found it and then I described what I saw. He looked at me like he didn&rsquo;t know what to think and I said so long.

I had just gotten off the phone with my fianc&eacute; and was settling down to read myself to sleep on the fold-out bed in the living room.  I was lying on my stomach, absorbed in my book, when a strange feeling of something being amiss suddenly washed over me.  I can&apos;t really explain the feeling better than that; it simply seemed as though something was not quite right.I looked out of the open window, which was directly in front of me at the head of the bed.  This window faces east and overlooks a high school football field at the bottom of the hill that my parents&apos; house sits on.  Beyond the field lies Broadway Ave. and a section of I-5, and beyond that one has a view of the countryside, the small town of Snohomish, and the Cascade Mountains way off in the distance. Peering out the window, I didn&apos;t see or hear anything unusual, just some cars zipping along the freeway and a few lights dotting the foothills of the Cascades.  I shook my head and silently scolded myself for being silly and went back to my book.  After a few moments I glanced out the window again and saw a light in the sky off in the distance.  This light was quite bright and seemed to shift colors; it went back and forth very slowly between muddy yellow and pale orange.  I assumed it was just a helicopter checking out the traffic on the freeway, but I kept watching it anyway.  It stayed in one spot, not moving at all, and I suddenly realised that it couldn&apos;t be a helicopter, at least not any kind of helicopter I&apos;m familiar with.  The light it was giving off was all wrong.  What&apos;s more, I couldn&apos;t hear a thing other than the windchimes on the porch and the traffic on the roads.  Sounds carry very well in that part of the state, and had it been any kind of conventional aircraft I&apos;m certain that I would have been able to hear and identify it.I turned off the lamp next to my bed and lay in the dark watching the light.  It hovered over I-5 for about 10 minutes, then drifted slowly to the south, along the line of the freeway, and was concealed by a stand of pine trees about 500 feet from the house.  I figured it had gone away, but I stayed in the dark and continued to look out the window.  Another 5 minutes passed, and the light suddenly reappeared from behind the trees.  It moved north and took up its former position over the road and just hovered there, not doing much of anything that I could see.  It stayed in that spot for about 5 to 10 minutes. I started to feel uneasy; I squeezed my eyes shut, lowered my head, and counted to ten.  When I glanced out of the window again the light was gone.  I looked all over the sky but there wasn&apos;t a trace of it anywhere. I waited for a bit to see if it would come back, but it never did.  Finally I turned the lamp on and picked up my book, eventually falling asleep sometime around 3:00am.  Nothing else of note happened the rest of the time I was visiting.I would like to note that I did not feel at all threatened by this light, and if it was a UFO I very much doubt that the intentions of the pilots were hostile in any way.  I have the feeling that whoever, if anyone, was inside this craft was simply interested in seeing what the freeway was all about.  I did feel uneasy, as I said, but this mostly because I was faced with something strange, something I could not explain.I have been sitting on this story for a year, too embarrassed to tell it to anyone aside from my fianc&eacute;.  I am above all else a realist, and when I see something strange I like to exhaust all mundane explanations before I label the experience paranormal.  I have been very intrigued the UFO phenomenon for years, though, and I firmly believe that our vast universe is capable of supporting life on distant planets.  Why those lifeforms should be interested in visiting Earth is beyond me, but as long as they&apos;re not engaging in harmful activities, I say the more the merrier.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Me and my friend ((name deleted)) set out to the ranch in Sidney to do some bow hunting.  After the hunt Tuesday evening we met up at my stand and were talking when these three bright light&apos;s came out and were hovering over a large oat field!  Then they went out and a single light began moving very quickly across the sky turning on and off.  There were several commercial airliner&apos;s in the area and these light&apos;s were 5 times faster.  Then we took a couple steps back to see over the trees as the 3 light&apos;s had come back out and were hovering over a different area a little more to the north east.We got in the truck and rushed back to the ranch house and called the police to see what was going on and they had no clue.  I just got home from hunting only to find out that there were dozens of sightings, new&apos;s coverage, and even a few video&apos;s from Dublin, Stephenville area and other part&apos;s of Erath and, Comanche counties. I live next to Carswell Air force Base in fort worth so I see planes and jet&apos;s everyday!

Between 5:45pm EST and 7:10 EST   I noticed a light in the sky that seemed to drift very slightly left and right as well as up and down. It was pulsing mostly orange but did turn red a few times. The light remained in the basic vicinity of the sky for about an hour and a half. I used binoculars and could only make out a pulsing light.The light was as magnificent without the binoculars as it was with. Brighter than any star and certainly not a plane. I watched this pulse and orange to red glow for a good hour.I changed vantage points so that I could balance the binoculars on something solid to reduce the shaking. At this point it was a lot easier to see. Bright pulsing orange fading into red. Then it suddenly turned greenish/blue and faded out.There were no clouds or trees or any obstructions to accomplish this. It seemed to distinguish itself or disappear. About 2 minutes later a greenish/blue light appeared again very small and it faded right back to an orange brilliant pulse. I watched it for another half hour as it drifted very slightly. Then with out warning it disappeared completely. No streak or trail. Just poof!!!!", "12 ovel objects flying east to west orange and red at a slow speed then vanishedUFO sighting in Cincinnati Ohio  On Friday night October 10th my girlfriend and I were coming home after seeing a movie near Hyde Park.  I was driving on Hershel Avenue in Hyde Park when I looked up and saw three orange and red objects that were round in the sky.  I said to my female friend &ldquo;what is that.&rdquo;   A few seconds later another one went by and another one followed closely behind.  My female friend said &ldquo;stop the car I want to get out.&rdquo;  With that I looked to see if there was a car behind us but nobody was on the road.  She got out and I also got out looking in the general direction of the objects.  There was no sound as they flew by.   They appeared to be 50 or 80 thousand feet in the sky and flying a low speed.  The sky  was clear and there was a moon with no wind.   The objects were moving from the east to the west. We got back in the car and drove west.  In the distance we could still see the objects forming a circle and following each other in sequence.  They continue to glow a orange/red color and were spinning yet not moving very fast.  As we headed down Erie Avenue towards Hyde Park Square we could still see the objects then they vanished.When I got back to my female friend apartment we got out of the car and went down to the street level.  I looked to the east and saw one more object coming our way.  The object was smaller than the rest but had a red and orange glow.  There was no sound as it flew overhead at a slow speed.  Then a second later after it passed it vanished.We went into her apartment and called Lunken Airport but they didn&rsquo;t see anything or heard of any reports.  Then we called local news stations, District Two Police and the Cincinnati Enquirer.  All the news agencies said they never heard of anyone else seeing anything.I called the UFO Center to report my sighting and Mr. Peter Davenport answered the phone.  He told me to write down what we saw and we both needed to file a separate report to this agency.  Then Mr. Davenport said see if there is anything on the news about your sighting or if anyone else saw it.  The next day I looked in the papers, and looked at all the local news and there were no reports.In Hyde Park there is an observatory not far from where we first spotted the objects.  I fired an email to the head person there and they respond saying they had guests in the observatory that night but were looking in the direction of the moon.   The gentleman said that there may have been a meteor shower going on at the time or what we saw may have been space junk.  I have seen a meteor shower before, but the meteor past very fast overhead.   I never seen anything that was red and orange that looked like a ball of light flying a low speed.   It was very weird.So far nobody has seen anything to my knowledge or nobody is saying anything.  We live about 60 miles south of Wright Patterson Air Force Base,  10 miles from Greater Cincinnati Airport and 5 miles from Lunken Airport.  We could not hear any sound from these objects so therefore they were not aircraft related.    We both saw them and I must say it was very interesting.", "Events throughout my life  I am not wanting this to be shown.. I have written several times . Many of my reports do not have accurate dates. I have had several things happen.  Anyway.. I have a question that I am hoping someone will have an answer to.  When I was in 6th grade , approx 11 years old, my family and I witnessed an exstreamly large craft go from the west to the east side of town and directly over our home. It started out looking like a brilliant , bright  white light traveling very slowly from the west phoenix area. We were alerted to it by my brother who was on his way home with his father who lived in Scottsdale. He noticed it while on the freeway and was very concerned to see it still in the sky when he arrived to our home which was at Gaudalupe and Dobson rd. My whole family- Mother ,grandparents , step father and one of my brothers friends- all went outside to see what he was so upset about. We observed this  object coming closer to us . It was , no joke, about the size of a football field. It didn&apos;t have lights on it like it looked from far away. As it got closer we could see it was illuminating from within. It made no noise, just a low kind of warm humming sound. Not like a blimp. It was flying  low and it was  exstreamly large. I would say if you were to hold your hand out you would have to put two fingers together to cover it. My step father worked at air research at the time and even he was puzzled as to what it was. It was not a blimp, plan, or helicopter. It looked like it had windows completely around it, or possibly metal  panels and if I remember right it almost (im not trying to make a joke) but it kinda looked like the starship enterprise. Only in the sense that It seemed to have two sections to it. It was moving super slow .When it reached the end of our block it swayed a bit and you could see it was wider that our street. It then sped up and took of ,very fast north east and was gone. Absolutely gone.The next day I said something to my teacher.. He got very excited and made me go to the principles office and draw a picture for the principle. They both questioned me.. My teacher had seen it also and was using me to try to help prove his story.. It was very outrageous and I am sure very unbelievable if you hadent seen this for yourself.. I am getting to my question.. please be patient.  ..Now when I was sixteen, living in the same home, I had a very unexplainable event. I was coming home from my best friend house .. She lived 2 miles from me. I left at exactly 8:50PM .. I know because we use to watch the Waltanns religiously- of all shows!! anyway,  the show ended at 9pm. I was also due in at 9 , if I was late I would be grounded.. At sixteen that is the worst thing in the world to have happen.. My parents were strict and I was never late. So I pulled in front of the house , shut off my VW bug and then I was surrounded by the most intense blue-white light. My car kinda rumbled .. Its very hard to explain. I at the time thought I had been hit by lightning,I could feel the energy. Thats what I attributed it to at that second,  without realizing it was a totally clear night. The color of the light was  not a color I can explain.  It was blueish white. It consumed me and the whole car. Then it was over and I jumped out of the car and ran in. I was greeted with two VERY upset parents. I was an hour late. I had completely forgot what had just happened.. Even when trying to defend myself. I had no excuse and was very confused.. All I know is I left at 8:50 and walked in at 10pm.  I called my friend sobbing, screaming at her for making me late.. She defended the fact of when I left and said I was crazy. I was traumatized because I was not allowed to see my boyfriend for a week, or talk on the phone.. I didnt recall the light thing for about 3 to four years later. To this day my friend remembers the event.. We are still very good friends.. We still cant explain why i was late or what happened.. I am writing wondering if anyone has had a similar event.. If anyone has seen something then while at the same location they have a loss of time or some other unusual event.. Is it possible that the first time we saw the craft it was the first of several visits? I am not making much sense.. I guess I am wondering -if it is possible that abductions occur, do you think they make a planned route that they trav! el?.. Do they scope out , or survey areas and people  first?  I am confused and still want to understand what happened.. I have had 2 other events in my life where I have had the same light consume me. It is an unforgettable color I have never seen duplicated, even in the movies.  Only one of the other  times  I have  a witness to my time loss. Again, at the time you forget what has just happened, and are left just completely confused. .  All the times I remember seeing the light , but never seem to be able to comprehend it or associate with what is or has happened.I am not a very good writer, I hope this makes sense to someone.. I really hope I can get some kind of understanding of this.. Is there any other people in Az that something like this has happened to them? One thing I did not mention.. The friend of my  brothers who witnessed the ship with my family the first time, he still to this day will not talk about it.. He will admit he saw it, but CAN  not elaborate. I tried to talk with him about 6 years ago and he gets all sweaty and freaked out.. He actually almost crys.. He cant talk about it for some reason.. Im wondering if  possibly something happened to him and he remembers it too much.. Or is it possible he had bad things done to him, or ma bey his mind cant comprehend something that happened to him that night? I am hoping someone can give me some kind of answer or insight... ..((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

(approximately a one inch space).  The light shone on my ceiling as if the source were on the ground, then began moving across my ceiling, down the wall, then across the floor toward me. As the light hit me I was paralyzed. It was quite obvious that the source of the light began on the ground and was lifting upward outside my window.  It stopped as suddenly as it began and left my ears ringing. I was about 16 at the time, was home alone, and was terrified.  I have researched thousands of reports over the years, but none similar to my experience.  I want to know what the hell happened to me that night!!!

I had been driving for about 6 hours and wasn&rsquo;t paying attention to what city I was near, but I do know I was in mid Oregon. Out of the top left of my windshield I saw a bright light and thought a general aviation plane was flying really low with an extremely bright light brighter than I had ever seen on a plane.  I watched it for 10 seconds and realized that the light would appear but be still, then move at a fast speed then stop, the light would then go out and the sequence would repeat.  That&rsquo;s how it traveled, it was on a straight plain going north along I-5.  It appeared to be 1200 feet in the air. After the 10 seconds previously specified, I told my passenger to look at what I was looking at and he immediately looked to his left and saw it.  I kept on driving and looked at the light as frequently as possible.  My passenger never stopped looking until it disappeared on the horizon. The light was so bright and so pure it was incredible, it could be described as a white light and it didn&rsquo;t illuminate anything.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I walked south down out of the Cul-De-Sac on which I live, and down the street. I was about halfway down the road when I decided to stop under a streetlamp, and do what I always do on cloudless nights.  Scan the Skies.  I called my dad to ask him something as I began to look around.I began to scan intently and saw a few planes in the distance, but when I looked in the western sky, I noticed an Orange Sphere/or Orb.  It was oscillating/pulsing as it drifted off to the north.  I told my dad I saw something weird in the sky and he must have though I was crazy.I began to feel very startled and almost freaked out by the experience, yet at the same time exhilarated. The object was following a direct flightpath of most planes in our area, but I assure you this was no jetliner.  I have seen many planes, jets, and helicopters; military and civilian in this area but it just didn&apos;t meet the description of any earthly craft I have seen.  Panic set in as I realized this definitely wasn&apos;t something I could not readily identify.  I began to review stories in my head of people being taken while on a stroll in their neighborhoods after dark.  That was when I decided I wasn&apos;t just going to just stand there and watch it.  I was still on the phone with my dad at this time I so I told him that I would be home in a few minutes, and hung up.I then seeming ran for dear life as fast as I could back to my house and watched from the porch.  The craft flew almost directly overhead and just then the Orange Light turned off and gave way to what looked like airplane lights but there was no green or red lights on the wingtips just bright yellowish-white ones, and there were no flashing lights at all.I went inside the house; my heart pounding.  I sat down and reviewed what I saw.  It was then that I noticed the craft also made no noise whatsoever.  After calming down I turned on the TV and began watching Ghost Hunters Live, and all the while I couldn&apos;t get the thoughts out of my head of what in the hell had I seen.  After a couple hours I began to get tired so I walked up to to my room, and jumped in bed.  Surprisingly I slept very soundly.((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus??

When we tracked the plane it was headed north, than we saw a metallic colored ball just in front of it. The plane flew by and the object stayed still and than a couple of planes flew by it, than it started moving south from lets say the 2 O&apos;clock to 10 o&apos;clock ,if that makes since. The object stayed there for a long time. We got tired of looking so we just ignored it.

Even behind black clouds, I can see this light, a trait I have never before witnessed in any object in the sky.It would sit in the sky, completely stationary, for a while, about 30 minutes or so, then it would slowly move.. the most amazing thing to me is when it actually starts moving, all over the place.  It moves seemingly closer to me, or further. This may be the light glowing stronger or weaker, because the light would, after about an hour, begin to dim slowly.  It would dim, and re-light a little bit when it was out, then move more, and stop again, when the light was out, I could no longer see it.The even more amazing thing is, I think I saw the SAME OBJECT IN THE SKY TODAY, which makes me think that it might be a plane or something, using a clock, coming back every day, I do not know for how many days this has been going on.  I started at it the second day today, and it did the exact same thing as yesterday.. it was the most eerie thing I have ever seen in the sky.

It started to turn to the left as if it had feelers to go around a pine tree. it aligned it self turned to the left &amp; started to rise higher like 6ft. I could see the top of the tree. It was half the size of the pine tree high. I move to the right of my window to get a better look as it is moving now into a patch of woods with higher Maple &amp; Beech trees. It was going very slow. I wanted to reach around the corner to get my camera but no it might flash? I see now it is black in the middle with s triangle shape &amp;  amber lights all around the craft. Amber as in a car? I blink my eyes &amp; poof it is gone.Next day I told my husband &amp; 2 neighbors. Within 2 days I hear of a UFO sighting in Texas. The lights were red &amp; big as a football field.  To get the exact date would be 2 days before the Texas 2008 sightings. Larry King had the people on his show who saw them in Texas.I tried to put this out of mind &amp; sight. But no longer as something was seen only 4mi. from here a few wks. ago. 3 people saw it.

The sky is as clear as glass, not a cloud in sight from what I could see.About half way through my cigarette I see this faint light move extremely fast in a zig zag movement (a rough drawing using paint will be emailed) and as it moving it leave a cloudy trail behind it. It acted as if it were moving away from the earth. And then it just disappeared in a very bright light. The time is now about 4:54 AM. It lasted about 2-3 seconds I couldn&rsquo;t believe my eyes so and then I decided to blow it off.  But as I&rsquo;m finishing my cigarette I see three more faint lights zipping through the sky higher than the first one.  The other three were each in a different location all heading in different paths.The first bright light I knew was no airplane, helicopter, or shooting star. The movement was completely random. The other three could&rsquo;ve been shooting stars but it was too coincidental.The first bright light:  Location: just to the left of orions belt The flash was so bright that I could see clouds that I couldn&rsquo;t see with the moon light; the flash was a bright white with a blues tint. The trail if left disappeared moments after the light had disappeared.Now I see weird things in the skies late at night that I know aren&rsquo;t airplanes but this first bright light was the weirdest.

It did not appear to move during this time. The driver pointed to the right of the car as she did not observe it.  &ldquo;Look&rdquo; she said, and I saw she was pointing in the opposite direction.

Watched 3 real UFO craft enter above Orion&apos;s Belt in a streak of white but it stopped its streak. One shot straight for the small stadium and no steak was emitted, stopped just short of the main lights to the stadium and hovered around the stadium, wisping from side to side just outside the small stadium as if unhindered from Earth&apos;s gravity.  The second seemed to dart in and away from the stadium.  The 3rd was flying up at incredible speed and just stopped in mid-air.  It turned in several degrees of turn I am not able to fathom.  No manned or unmanned craft is capable of such of what I saw.  An incredible sight I kid you not.  The 3rd one showed its belly as it darted up and down in the air with no plausible way to decern how it was able to stop in mid air and go a different direction.  I saw 7 (seven)bright blue and white rotating engines underneath as it flew vertically yet diagonally down for several hundred feet and then it stopped.  This duration happened within about 1:30 to 2:00 minutes time.  Captured a bit on my camera but not enough to give an accurate description.  Sorry. I waved and hollered at the objects to get closer to me but I was not within audible range.The belly of the craft as would be the belly of all three craft had 7 bright blue and white lights.  The shape appearred to be hexigonal or octagonal.  I could see their shapes as their engines made streaks of light in their turns.  Phenominal.  I&apos;d say their weight could not be determined.  The size, if they came face to face would have to be about 13 maybe 14 feet in diameter.  No sound was emitted when they entered, hovered or left.  They left because of a police helicopter was patrolling near the exact area which the 3 craft were hovering as the police helicopter was approaching slowly as it neared the one near the stadium... all three disappeared into the night sky.  As if all were informed of the threat, the police helicoper, and shot out back into space.  After they left, the police helicopter made a b-line to wherever they saw as well.  The one I was watching, didn&apos;t change shape, none of them changed shape, they clearly had a top and bottom to them. The top had a curvature to the front of the craft and all three were extremely versitile.  Hope this is enough for further investigation.  Remember. Police Helicopter saw them too.  Very real, not a hoax or a stupid joke.  Odd thou, when they stopped from time to time in flight, I heard no sound, no sound at all.  No shockwave of any sort was audible.  10 years ago, saw a different craft hovering in the same position before the small stadium was built.

The &quot;arms&quot; of the V seemed one solid mass, as opposed to a string of lights.I held my hand out at arm&rsquo;s length and the sides of the V measured just slightly less than my forefinger.

A very quiet whine was heard, low pitched, and barely audible, and in truth may have come from another source other than this object as there is a busy road not too far away.

It was traveling horizontally with a slightly downward angle.I and the other witness, sitting in a car, first thought that it might be a flare or other firework, but we agreed that it moved too fast for that.  Also, it appeared high in the sky and moved horizontally, so it more than likely didn&apos;t come from the ground.  It very closely resembled a meteor, except that it was much larger and brighter.

There were approximately 15 people at the party and we were all baffled.The lights were bright white in color and looked like a ORB/sphere in shape.After about 15 minutes of viewing, I asked my friends if what we are seeing were flares from the near by Quantico Military base. Most agreed and than one said &quot;Yep, I think your&quot; but before he could finish his sentence someone else said &quot;I have never seen flares move like that.

There were Approximately 10 lights, all were lined up in a straight line, from west to east, and seemed to make a noticeable outline of something HUGE.Unbelievably this collection of lights started to move, from our vantage point it looked to be at least 200 feet long and flying at a estimated 300 feet over the tree line.  The lights moved slowly approximately 2.5 miles and than started to turn north. Because of this turn these lights made a dip up then gradually swept North.  This is when we noticed there was another collection of lights on the bottom of this thing. I think this is when most of us realized this was something very special and quite extraordinary.After the lights completed their turn we were able to see the back which was comprised of what looked like eight lights, four on top four on the bottom. There also was a strange haze between the top and bottom lights, I&apos;m not sure how to describe it but it was a blurry bluish haze. It was shortly after this when the lights faded from view as it continued to head north in the direction of Washington DC.About 6 months later I received a phone call from one of my friends, he was also at the November party and saw the &quot;Virginia Lights&quot;.He explained that he had camped the night before at the property and had another sighting of the lights. This time he said it didn&apos;t turn North but stayed due east in the direction of the Fredricksburg area.The reason I am reporting this to you now is that I had another sighting of the &quot;Virginia Lights&quot; this past weekend.This time the lights were further off in the distance when first spotted and again headed North but in a more North Easterly direction, again toward Washington DC. Interestingly, the lights seem to be rising out of the tree line which is approximately 3-5 miles distance.I have done some internet research on the lights and found there has been some very similar sightings occurring throughout the Northern Virginia area.In particular, there were a few sightings in the vicinity of Dale City and the Woodbridge Va area. The description of these sightings were so eerily similar and since this was the direction we saw the lights heading makes me think we may have seen the same thing.That&apos;s all I have for now. You are welcome to contact me if you have any additional questions about this sighting. I hope this report helps you in your research.Thanks, The Virginia Lights", "Color changing light moving erratically just off the horizon in the distance.A friend and I were on our way home from a photography workshop in Jackson, and stopped at the City of Rocks National Reserve in Idaho for the night to camp and shoot some night photos.  After a while of shooting, my friend told me to come to where he was and pointed out what looked like a star that was changing colors from a pinkish color to green to white, blue and yellow.  We both thought the color changing was strange, but he told me to keep watching.A moment later, the color changing light moved very erratically up and to the right.  The movement was similar to what a sheet of paper would do if you dropped it, only moving upwards instead of down.  We both watched it for a while, trying to figure out what it was.  We thought it might be an airplane or helicopter, but the movement was not like any type of aircraft that I know of.  The colors were also not that of aircraft that I know of.  Sometimes the movement was kind of slow, others it moved a great distance very quickly.We watched it for a while, and after a while we both had to get some sleep, and went to bed.  We both thought about reporting it, but figured nobody would believe us, and think that since we are photographers that we were trying to pull off some sort of hoax.  We were both very confused just trying to figure out what it could be.It wasn&apos;t until I talked to my brother about it that I decided to report it.  He told me it sounded similar to the lights sighted over Stephenville, Texas, recently.  I looked for photos of this event online, and found something that was very similar to what I had shot, and decided that I should report the incident.The first photo is shot with a 300mm lens fully zoomed in for 5 seconds (on a tripod).  The second photo is just a cropped image to enlarge detail.  No editing was done to either photo, except for cropping of the second image.", "Large amber colored lightNot really sure what this craft was that I saw but I have seen this before behind my house.At approx. 6:30 pm Est. I was in my back yard playing with my dog when I noticed a craft of some sort hovering in the sky to the West about a half mile away.  This craft was not moving and it was making no sound that I could hear.  It had a huge amber color light that was pointing in my direction.  This light was not blinking or moving.I continued to watch it for about 15 minutes and this object still did not move.  So I went inside to get the binocculars.  I went back outside to view the craft/object and it was still in the same place.  When I focused on the object with the binocculars I could see some sort dark craft around the light but as quick as I focused on it the light went off almost as if they could see me watching it.And then I only saw the darkness of the object for a couple of seconds and it just disappeared but in it&apos;s place were a huge area of small green lights that were flashing in a very large circular pattern but sporaticly and then after a minute or two I couldn&apos;t see anything.Then clouds moved in and I came back in the house.  I do not know that if someone was in a &quot;helicopter&quot; if they could see me looking at them from that distance and if they could see me why would they turn the light off abruply plus the light was not like a light that you see on a helicopter.That&apos;s all.", "3 lights moving very smoothley at the capitalMy family and I were driving down constitution street and we saw 3 lights moving very smoothly at a medium speed behind the statue on top of the capital when we got to union station we had a view of  the capital and they were still there only going in a different direction on are way back home we got the best view yet we could see the lights were circular but since it was night we couldn&rsquo;t actually see the ship itself we went back later that night with binoculars but we didn&rsquo;t see anything.

I saw it while I was laying in the front yard stargazing, I was hoping to see a shooting star so I had my eyes open for any movement in the sky, I saw a few airplanes, and then the UFO. I  KNOW it wasn&rsquo;t an airplane because I had already seen those. It stayed in the sky moving north for about six to eight seconds before disappearing near the constellation Cassiopeia. I then saw my shooting star, but it lasted much longer than any normal shooting star. Then about ten seconds after the object disappeared, there was a strange noise that I couldn&rsquo;t explain.

This was not unusual because plans often came across the lake as one of the flight paths to the Bangor Airport. What was unusual was the light stayed the same with out changing and there was no noise. Both, my husband and I kept saying &quot;that&apos;s weird&quot;, but were convinced it was a plane. After some time we knew this was not right and went out side to see what it was and to our amazement we could distinquish in the night sky, a large triangular shaped object hoovering slightly above the trees of this 3 acre Island. Had the object been more directly over the Island, it would not have been much smaller  in diameter; the air seemed muffled, but there was no sound. Two large round lights which looked like the burners of a gas stove(bluish) were on two ends and under the object, in a circular form were smaller lights (greenish- if I recall). It must have been at leat 200 feet long (at least) My kids would swim to island, but it was about 1/4 mile in front of our house. There was no noise! My husband started to walk closer to the shoreline, to get closer, but I was scared. When he did that it seemed to start to move slowly toward us, and I ran to the house. When I stopped and looked back it sat still for a moment or two, and that just bolted off (still no noise). We called the airport the next day to see if the stealth had been in, but we got no where for information. I have written on-line,somewhere, but never heard anything. No, we were not drinking, do not have psychological issues, or obsessed about this issue. Just very weird, and after this event I would wake up screaming on many occassions, which I had never done before..yet, I had no idea why. And, nearly six  months after the event both my husband and I were slammed out of bed (in the middle of the night) by nothing we could see. We sat up most of that night trying to figure out what was wrong with us, or the house.! . Maybe it had something to do with the object, maybe not...? WE sold the house, and the doctor that purchased it has told me he&apos;s been happy and not mentioned anything &quot;unusual&quot;, and (of course) I was not about to say anything.  Maybe it was really the stealth, and maybe I just had some night screams for normal reasons (I don&apos;t know what, but perhaps it happens), But, there truely is no explanation for the violent forced blow sending both, my husband and I, out of the bed and on to the floor...((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I witnessed a brightly illuminated(blue) object in the sky.  It was just right there motionless(or so it seemed to the naked eye) not too much higher then out tallest building of around 12 floors.  It was unlike anything i have ever seen.  my husband pulled up next to me and i told him to hurry and look.  We sped home to witness this with out children and grab our binoculars for a closer look.  The object seemed to slowly move closer then stop.  At first the shape was round and bright blue in color. We took pictures.  It changed color to a solid orange/red, then began changing shapes. Pear shape, round, oblong, oval, as well as changing to being outlined in orange/red.  I made sure I was propped against car to steady my arms as we were looking through our binoculars and discussing everything we were seeing.  The object made irratic darting movements, causing me to constantly have to re-find and re-focus it. After about 5-10 min. it slowly slowly began drifting up at about a 70 degree angle. as it got higher it again changed color back to the brilliant blue only outlined this time.

The first arc was short, and the second was long then it disapeared into the dark sky. It was about 70 degrees above the horizon.If a shooting star was a ball point ink pen line, this looked more like a large magic marker for size comparison.", "About 7 pm Nov, 2, 2008 I was leaving a restraunt near the Parks Mall and I looked up and notice a very bright white light.  It appeared to look like a star but much larger and brighter, it was moving at a normal speed around 20,000 ft.  It did not look like a commercial aircraft because it was only glowing white light as it headed east towards Dallas.

I am in the aviation industry and it was definitely not an aircraft that I am aware of. Could of possibly been a shooting star but the light pollution from Kankakee and the Chicago suburbs was substantial so this is a very remote possibility plus, the light did not seem like a naturally occurring light because of it&rsquo;s brightness. There were cell towers near the road and it was not from one of those.", "I submitted this report back in 2005.   I have been reviewing my report from that time.  There are a couple of things that are incorrect.  The sighting was South of Lake Michigan Drive and West of Covell Road.   A few more things I would like to point out.  The craft may have been 3 to 4 times the size that I stated (200-300 ft.)  As we were driving up Cenntenial Drive (steep incline) the lights caught my eye.  It was about 20-30 miles away, it was coming at us at a very high rate of speed.  It had multiple lights rotating around the middle of the saucer.  As in other reports that I read, the middle of the craft did not come to a point, it had was a verticle surface (5-10 feet or more)  The strangest thing was that as soon as the spot lights under the object focused on us (my friend who was driving killed the lights and coasted to the end of the road, so I felt it did not know we were there) it rose and speed off at an unbelievable rate of speed (thousands of miles an hour or more)  I was in the passenger seat and never took my eyes off of it.  It traveled 30 miles in two or three seconds.  We jumped on 196 East and followed it for about ten minutes.  It looked like a moving star off in the distance.The strangest thing of all is that after we headed back home, none of us spoke about it to each other or anyone that night (family members, etc.).  It wasn&apos;t until weeks later that we were all hanging out together, and I mentioned it as a dream.  Instantly both of my friends who were with me had the wierdest looks on thier faces.  I could tell they were freaked out.  We had one or two other friends present at this time.  They thought we were joking.

It would move in a sudden motion and stop as quick as it would start.At this point my wife and other two children came outside to look at it.

The object was probably a few thousand feet altitude. The light had shape, was not point source and the colors were not fixed position &ndash; either alternating position or rotating and encompassing a large portion of the object &ndash; the rest of the object maintaining a bright white light.

The light moved East and North passing over a tower with a red beacon on the hill, traveling level and seemingly very slowly. After it was several miles North and East of the tower it turned East out over the Puget Sound and headed North towards Everett, seeming to fly over the middle of the sound.

The second moved very slowly over the tower and towards the East, but before it got to the Puget Sound, it began gaining altitude. It picked up speed as it started upward, but the disappearance took several minutes. As the size decreased due to the distance, you could still detect the rotational aspect of the lighting. When it became a point of changing color, it was noted that there was at least one other object up near the one under observation, a little to the east and lower. It also displayed the same alternating color with predominant white light around it. These lights became discernable after a minute or two.

When standing in the middle of the yard, one can see almost from horizon to horizon.  The weather was clear and the stars were shining in the dark night-sky.  We observed many ordinary-like satellites and at least two shooting stars during the evening.  I would consider me and my brother as two sane and perceptive young men.  We had drunk a few cans of beer but we were not &quot;drunk&quot;.  This report is filed some 4 hours after the sighting and is written without the participation of my brother.At approximately 2000 hrs (GMT + 2) I observed a moving, faint, red dot of light high in the sky in direction NNW.  I told also my big brother to take a look at it.  At first he said that he did not see it, but I used a bright star (Vega) as a static target to point the object to him.  Now he also saw the light.  The light was moving quietly in a straight line towards SSE maintaining a visible speed of an ordinary satellite or high-flying commercial aircraft and kept doing so during the entire sighting which lasted about 2 minutes.At first I thought that the light was an ordinary satellite but it was red in color.  Next I noticed another blinking red light in the absolute vicinity, on the right-hand side of the first light, moving into same direction with same speed.  This observation made me think that it was an ordinary airplane we were witnessing and that the blinking red light was a wing-light or something.  However, I estimated that the aircraft was flying at an altitude of at least 15000 meters because it seemed too distant to be an ordinary commercial aircraft yet too close to be an ordinary satellite.  Moreover, no sound was heard from the aircraft during the entire sighting.As the aircraft reached the southern part of the sky the first light started to change color from red into bright orange.  Also the blinking red light could no longer be seen so there was only one light now.  This orange light made me think of a tail-light of a low-flying aircraft that typically seems to change color as the aircraft passes by.  The light kept traveling in straight line into direction SSE and it was still visible high above the southern horizon as we started paying attention to other things.  The sighting had lasted about 2 minutes and, as said, no sound was heard from the aircraft during the entire sighting.My big brother did not take the sighting very seriously.  Also, he is no expert in astronomy and was of the opinion that the object we had just witnessed was flying outside our atmosphere.  He even said that the object &quot;had it&apos;s braking lights on&quot; as it was red in color.  I however have astronomy as my hobby and this sighting was someting that I&apos;ve never seen before so I took it very seriously and that&apos;s why I decided to file this report.  My best guess is that it was some kind of sophisticated domestic or foreign aircraft flying from NNW to SSE high over the Finnish airspace.  I also see that there&apos;s a very similar sighting filed in your database from 10/25/2008 from location Cedar Rapids, IA, United States.", "The three objects seen in the sky from my back yard in rural Texas.At 22:20 on October 24, 2008 Three(3) objects spotted in upper stratosphere directly EAST of Princeton, Texas in Collin County.The three objects rotated COUNTER CLOCKWISE first flashing all at the same time(independent event lasting 10 minutes), as rotation slowed and spread the three individual object flashed INDEPENDANTLY of each other.

On the 24th of October, 2008 I and two friends were driving back to our hotel in Pismo Beach, California on California highway 101 southbound about 6 miles north of the town of Pismo Beach.  At 7:29 PM, a bright orange light arose from behind a hill ahead SSE of our position.  It initially put me in mind of a helicopter pointing a searchlight directly at us because of the intensity of the light.  After about 20 seconds of  watching and guessing as to the nature of said light, I pulled out my cell phone (while driving, so the video is not only poor, but shaky) and filmed a short video.  The light dimmed as it rose making me initially think it was a flare, so I watched for telltale signs.  It did not seem to accelerate (as a non-propelled projectile at -9.8 m/s^2), it seemed to be rising at a constant velocity.  I was unable to watch it with the attention it deserved until I was able to pull off the highway at the next exit.  So the next paragraph will be the event as described by the passenger sitting in the rear right seat between its initial rise into the air to the time we were able to get out of the car.My friend driving the car pointed out a flying object ahead of us. It seemed to be to close to be an airplane and didn&rsquo;t look like one either. We traced it as it seemed to get farther away from us until it was just visibly the size of a bight star. We kept our eyes on it as we pulled off the highway, there we watched it for another minute or so before it abruptly disappeared.I was taking quick glances up at the light as it rose higher and became dimmer and more angled.  The light seemed to be becoming more triangular (isosceles with the most acute angle seemingly pointing northwest).  It seemed to be traveling more westward over the ocean.  Eventually the light became a single point and was only distinguishable from the stars around it because it still had the characteristic orange color that it had when it first came into view over the nearby hill.  We pulled the car off the freeway at around 7:32 PM, immediately parked and got out of the car to pay full attention (we think it was Spyglass Drive, but we weren&rsquo;t focused on the name of the exit at the time).  The light was suspended in the same position from our perspective and compared to its original size was at least a factor of 4 or 5 times its initial distance from us (just a size ratio and some simple trigonometry).  And that being the case, I&rsquo;m able to determine that it was not descending (unless moving towards me simultaneously, which is easily verified by intuition or vector analysis).  That being the case, the light remained at the same intensity as we discussed what it could possibly be.  I was looking very closely and it seemed that it was getting slightly brighter.  But just about as soon as I made that realization, the light &ldquo;turned off&rdquo;.  It looked like it either burned out or went very quickly away from us.  I started writing this record of the event at about 7:50 PM and have now finished it at 8:58 PM, making sure to be as clear and accurate as I possibly can.As a side note, I just had a friend read this just a few minutes after I finished writing it.  He was driving another vehicle with another of our friends with him.  The report from them is they saw it as well and one reports seeing another similar &ldquo;object&rdquo; in the northwest direction during the event described above.", "Strange objects over lahore, Pakistan.Hi there. I couldnot believe my eyes what just happened last week. it was around 8pm  night time when i was having tea in balcony. half of the sky was covered with black clouds and sound of thunder was easily heard but it was weird that rain didn&apos;t camedown.  As i love to watch thunder, i was watching sky than suddenly i saw 8 big bright lights came out of thunder. they were travelling in V shape and were travelling towards south. i couldnot believe what i just saw, and a very strange thing happened. just after about 3 minutes around hundred small lights appeared from the black clouds and were travelling towards south too. there speed was almost 3 times the speed of a commercial aeroplane as i used to watch aeroplanes frequently and i can guess their speed w.r.t these weird lights. that day onwards i am watching skies everyday but didn&apos;t see them again.", "Large orange ball traveled fast in night sky and then disappearedI am writing to report an old sighting because I am still curious as to what it might be.  It did not appear to be an alien craft but I would guess a strange natural phenomenon or light play.  I&rsquo;m sorry I don&rsquo;t even remember how long ago or the time of year it was. Maybe 20 years ago, a friend and I were standing in her driveway at night (definitely dark).  We both saw an orange ball travel fast from east to west for just a few seconds and then disappear in the middle of the sky.  It was fairly low in the sky and was traveling just above the school building we could see about 1/4 of a mile away.  It had the strength of color and glow of the setting sun.  It appeared large although we had no reference point as to its size. At the time I had no idea who to call to ask what it may have been.  We were in Potomac, Maryland about 20 miles northwest of Washington, DC.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

He&rsquo;s then went a got his field goggles and was looking at and said it was a star that he didn&rsquo;t know what it was.

I was standing in my backyard having a smoke at roughly 21:20:00 on November 7th, 2008 when the sighting occurred.  It was a very clear night &ndash; I cannot remember the moon&rsquo;s status but it was nowhere near the anomaly.  While looking to the north I saw what could best be described as a &ldquo;flash ball&rdquo;, or like that of a striking match head (completely white or VERY light yellow in color), streak across the sky above my apartment building.  I would have immediately felt fortunate to witness a shooting star or meteor but after traveling about 200-300ft it sharply veered off at an angle &ndash; basically flying slightly up and towards the left an additional 75-100ft before the fireball immediately disappeared.  The &ldquo;flash ball&rdquo; lasted 3-5 seconds and completed the described path in as much time.  It created a trail of smoke or exhaust that drew its path in the sky - yet this smoke was only visible in the light of the fireball.  I thought that I could make out a dark shape that continued along the same trajectory as the fireball vanished, but much faster &ndash; but in all objective honesty my brain could very well have just assumed a continuation of movement.  The whole event was over in seconds.  It appeared to be very low altitude, I think too low for a shooting star or comet/meteor.   I estimate it was only 350 to 500 feet in the air.  Very low, and I could hear a noise &ndash; but it did not sound like a flare or firework, close as I can come to describing the noise is a short whistle or an oscillated beep.  The brevity of the experience makes description difficult, but it was like a noise my computer from the late 80s would make.  There is most likely a plausible explanation for this sighting - like a meteor hitting Wonder Woman&rsquo;s invisible jet and bouncing off at the angle &ndash; but I felt like the maneuver would otherwise be unlikely for natural phenomenon.", "Large flame flickered across skyWhile watching satellites at Gaviota State Beach, just to the South of Vandenberg AFB, saw a plume of fire traveled across sky from North to South. At first I thought it was an aircraft with the engine on fire. This was not a streak of light like a meteor that flashes an burns out this was a flickering flame, the relative size of a large turkey feather held at arms length, that traveled across the sky. There was no sound associated with this.  I speculated that it might have been the booster rocket from the recent India moon shot.", "UFO in Chula Vista, CA NOV 19 083 witnesses saw helicopters roughly 200-300 feet altitude flying west above Chula Vista near the Best Buy/Wal Mart close to the 54 freeway.

The object made no noise and just sat there with objects &quot;wings?&quot; on the side of it moving in a constant slow wave like pattern. It sat there for a long time (5 minutes) and slowly was changing color. After about five minutes the object darted towards the south at a high rate of speed.  The objects on the side of the craft &ldquo;fluttering wings&rdquo; started moving more rapidly before the craft darted off.  It changed colors constantly and was very creepy.  I personally was a little scared not knowing what it was and had the feeling that it was watching us since it sat there for so long.

The sky was clear and there was a 3 -5 miles per hour wind blowing. I was sitting on a bench seat under a tree and happened to look up.

The object floated into view, and did not appear to be move very fast.  At first I thought it was something caught on the wind, but then it stopped and hovered for a several seconds.  The object appeared to be solid at this time, and then it moved quickly to the side, and then I followed it as it rapidly moved up into the sky and accelerated away at an extremely high rate of speed. I was able to follow it for few seconds, before it accelerated up at what I estimated to be a 60 degree angle and out of sight.  If the Sun had not been behind the tree limb, I would never have seen it; it would have been lost in the glare. I am sorry, but I do not want to leave contact information.

After that they got really close to each other as if they were in sync and moved extremely fast (way faster then they flew in at first) to the east again and then slowed down before going into the tree line behind my apartments.

To the naked eye they were probably about a mile away and very easy to see.  They were in a random formation although one seemed to be the leader.  They were travelling slowly and quite simply disappeared one by one.

The vibration sounded like a diesel engine outside of the house. I went out to look, as it sounded as if it was in my driveway, but with my going outside the noise was not there.  I looked up and spotted from heading from the south to the north west a starlike object that stopped on its flight path heading north then it stopped again headed north east.  While watching this myself, my friend ((name #1 deleted)) and my fiance ((name #2 deleted)) spotted a flight of 12- 16 yellow-orange, gold orbs fly directly overhead in a tight formation.  The formation at first reminded me of bubbles as they appeared almost translucent but they were self illuminated. My friend ((name #1 deleted)) thought geese, but Geese fly in a v pattern not a tight grouped formation as these had done.  The entire sighting of the orbs lasted 2 seconds. I am confident as are the 2 other witnesses that these were not balloons, geese or conventional aircraft. I would be interested to know if any one else has seen these orbs.

And some flashing red orb shaped lights in the backgroundOk, so the first sighting was a very large aircraft which headed towards me from the far distance which I at first thought was an unusually large star, but as it appraoched, I saw that it had lights, and then at the same time there appeared to be unusual background activity also going on in the sky. I saw flashing red orb like lights that seemed to almost come together and then moved quickly away from eachother, meanwhile, in between there appeared to be a falling star! Now, (and I know this sounds too outrageous), but while the large craft was meanwhile approaching overhead, and it seemed to be possibly a half a mile in width It had at the front of it a horizontal line of yellow lights, and at each end, two red lights. It flew overhead as I watched from my balcony, and was then out of view. I kept on trying to tell myself that it must have been an airplane, but I didn&apos;t know what the other orb lights were all about in the distance. And if that were not enough!!I then heard what sounded like another approaching plane or craft overhead, flying in the opposite direction heading towards the west valley, which was a huge, triangular shaped craft ( as I saw that it was indeed a solidly shaped triangular craft ) with maybe three lights. But as it was gliding over the valley away from me, it appeared to have onlt two white flashing lights, that then dimmed one the lights as the other light kept flashing on and off. I watched this craft until I could no longer see it gliding away in the distance. Now I have NEVER seen anything in the sky unusual except maybe a falling star only once in my lifetime. I have no idea what these were, but i reported the sighting to the ArizonaRepublic newsroom.", "At approximately 19:04, Tuesday nite on October 28, while heading westbound on the I-10: I was riding shotgun as my co-driver and I were watching daylight and Venus fade. As I looked up to the sky over Lordsburg, New Mexico, I saw two gold shining orbs, one of which disappeared as a third one appeared and the second one then disappeared, and  then the third in turn disappeared sequentially and they did not return.

It didn&apos;t appear to be moving so I kept watching it.  My sister was driving and my mom was in the back seat.  I did not say anything at first because I just figured it was a plane.  As we approached the access to the Cross County Parkway, I finally asked my sister to look through the trees to see if she could see something.  We rounded the bend and it was right above us. We pulled off to the side of the road and got out.  As we did this, about 6 other card pulled off behind us. We all got out of our cars and watched this object.  It seemed to be as large as 2 football fields.  It was not moving and there was no sound.  I believe the lights were white.We all watched about 5 minutes until it began to leave.  It went north, some people tried to follow in their cars.  I went home, called the radio station, and they said they had about 80 calls so far.

It was after 11 pm CST but not yet 11:30. My dog was lingering in a parking lot so I looked up as I often do to observe the stars. I saw what I thought was a plane taking off from Love field, north of Dallas, without its bright landing lights on. I thought that was strange because I expected the dimmer lights to be red and green for port and starboard. The lights were square, orange and made a perfect triangle. The craft never made any noise at all! It moved in a straight line over downtown Dallas at an almost due south direction; slightly east. I watched for 20 minutes for other crafts or for it to return and saw nothing.

It was shaped like a cigar and towards the back instead of being chrome it looked almost as if it was gold. It didn&apos;t fly straight it sort of floated in my direction then floated in another direction while still moving forward. There was no vapor trail.

Off to my right, I looked through the tree line and saw an object that look out of place through the trees, up in the air.  It took a second for the thought to register in my mind and to take a second look.  Upon looking again, I caught a clear look at it through an opening through the woods.  I had an instantaneous feeling of fright consume my body because I know what I was looking at was really there.  I immediatley slowed down to try and get a better look, but another car was coming up behind me and I felt obligated to move along.  I hoped to drive along another 100 feet or so and be able to pull over and see through the trees, but when that opportunity came, I could not find the object.  The area in which the object was was about 400-500 feet off the ground....well below the two &quot;mountain&quot; tops which it was flying between.  This was not a plane or helicopter.  I think some other people may have seen this...because I noticed an unusually high number of skid marks (I could smell the freshness) on that exact spot when I went back later that day.  I only saw one object, it was metallic, disc-shaped, and probably 20 feet long.

My first thought was that what I was seeing could not be for real. It was so big and unmistakably an alien craft, or a projection of one, that I could not believe what I was seeing. It appeared to be spinning and changed colors. The only colors I remember vividly were pink and green. Because of the size of the craft, I started to get nervous thinking that this could be an invasion. Instead of stopping I slowly turned down my street and eventually lost sight of the craft.

There is a patch of hill than a stone patio next to a dock we have permission to fish from.  We decided to setup on the patio.  As we fished you could see the street light across the way by the park.  So we fished and some time later around a hour or two I noticed that the light didn&apos;t go out and seemed a little closer.  I thought nothing of it and fished some more.  Then I noticed it closer than BAM.......... I looked up in the sky and saw a Black object hoovering oh so slow above us moving toward our backside and were only 100 yards above the 60 foot treetops.  It looked like no UFOs I saw in books and other source before.  The shape was like a small triangle in front with another bigger triangle combined together. I have a attachment drawing it was all black.  As I ran to the road that circumferences the lake the craft went slowly out of sight, moving along the mountains behind the lake.  When I ran back tomy friend and  he looked bewildered ,  I said;  hey man did you see that and he just keep fishing with a sort of nod. At this I asked my friend  what time it was he said 10:30 am..

I stopped the car and both my wife and I got out to look... Three other cars also stopped during the sighting, their occupants also got out to observe.The object was huge perhaps 50 or so metres wide, with no clearly discernible shape. It was &quot;burnt orange&quot; in colour, towards the yellow end of the spectrum.It hovered above some houses about 200-300 metres above them....

I recall another witness saying to us, &quot;What the hell can it possibly be?&quot; Of course we do not know!  The object closest to us remained there for about 5 minutes.  After which it sped off rather rapidly in a southerly direction, towards the second object.  There was no sound and no &quot;fancy&quot; manoeuvres....I must confess I am completely bewildered as to what it (they) could be and how an object can remain stationary, given its enormous size, at such a low altitude.

It seemed to hover at a stand still without moving for a couple of minutes. I am sure other people had to see this as there were many people on the freeway.

Then it stopped and hovered not moving once again. Then it began to fly in a sepentine fashion towards us, zig-zagging back in forth at a slower speed, very rythmically like a snake as if it were putting on a show.

I know there were no sounds associated with this sighting since I got out of the car and watched it for fewer than five entire minutes, then drove home where I was expected.
