He said he noticed a very strong light, low, that was moving very slow.  When he went outside on our deck to look closer, he said it moved a little to the left and it kept changing in intensity.  He called me out and we watched the light and suddenly, it moved towards our house and I looked at it quite critically, as since we are at the highest point in our town, we are used to small planes and helicopters over our house.  This had no noise and resembled neither. When it passed over the house, it had a light configuration that we had never seen--a rectangular one, behind a very bright lead light light. The object flew over our house and then disappeared, only to reappear a few minutes later to the east, and then disappear before it would have logically gone over our home.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with one of the witnesses, and both of them now believe that the lights they witnessed probably were from aircraft taking off from, and landing at, a local airport, used by light aircraft.

While standing in my yard you can see the plane traffic lanes going from west to east and ease to west.Well that night I was looking at the sky as I always do.  I picked up on a star in the North, North West moving.  Well it looked like a star.  It was as bright as a star.  I watched as it moved to the South, South East.  I first saw it at about 25 degrees in North sky and it disappeared at about the same in the south.  This thing was way higher than any plane I have ever saw.  It had no flashing lights just a constant white, like a star.  It went with the curveature of the earth and left no trail.  So I know it was not a shooting star.  It only took 30 seconds or so to travel from one horizon at 25 degrees up to the other horizon about 25 degrees up. Trees got in the way to the south and I first saw it about that degree to the North.  I thought, maybe a satalite or Space Station.  Then I thought glowing like a star, maybe the sun was lighting it up, but the sun is on the other side of the planet then and it would not make it look like it was glowing.  This is the first thing I have ever seen that made me think that it could be a UFO.  Also, there was no sound at all.  I do believe in UFO&apos;s this is why I go out back with the dogs every night weather permitting around 1 AM to 3 AM.  It was really fascinating.  I will keep my eyes looking to the sky, hoping to shoot a 7 mm. magnum at one that is up real close.  If it ever happens.  Bringing one down is the only way one could prove they are here.

PD))", "I was out camping in the country in Benton County, MO in the Truman Resevoir area. I was lying outdoors, snuggled in my sleeping bag in November, 2001, at about 1 am. It was a full-moon that night; ceiling and visibility were unlimited. I was encamped in a sparse cedar grove at the Southern end of a 40-60 acre cattle pasture. Wind was almost still; ambient noise was basically non-existent; air temp was approx. 40F. What breeze there was from the NW&lt;5 mph. I awoke to my wolf-dog hybrid(1/4 wolf;1/4 malamute; 1/2 yellow lab; I include this description of him to give a sense of how much I trust this dog&apos;s senses and instincts; he is very intelligent, very observant, and knows the difference between a possible threat or unknown machine or entity and something to be disregarded) growling--not viciously or menacingly--at first, just suspiciously, and observing something off the ground over the pasture. At first, very faintly, I hear a &quot;swooshing&quot; noise with a high pitched whine approaching from the North very slowly. Also, the swooshing noise was deep and rythmically slow. The best thing I could come close to describing it as sounding like is an attic fan with a whining, loose bearing. As it approached, the noise became more pronounced, but the same rythmically. This was a full moon night; this thing was within 200 yards of me over open terrain. I would judge its alltitude at between 100 and 200 feet. Its airspeed was much, much slower than any man-made aircraft I know of could maintain and stay aloft. I was in the military; I have flown in Blawkhawks, Hueys, Sea Nights, and C-135&apos;s. As this object approached, my dog became much more menacing in his deep-throated growl, and his eyes locked onto this object and started tracking it.  Yet, I could see nothing.  This object flew directly over me; my vision was unobstructed.  The moon was overhead slightly to the South West. The object flew over me at about 100-200 feet.  Airspeed was &lt;60mph. It was a slow &quot;wooshing&quot; sound, and the whine was so high pitched as to become almost auditorily painful and inaudible at the same time. It agitated my brain and nervous system to a point almost unbearable as it passed over. Again, the closest I could come to describing the effect is to compare it to the EMF field surrounding a powerful electric sub-station. My dog tracked this thing with a deep-throated rumbling growl and an intense, unabated stare all the way over us and across the horizion until it was inaudible; ie: He could see it, I could not! Its vector was from 11:00 NW to 5:00 SE. There was no visual obstruction overhead in the starfield; no obstruction of the moonlight; no visual distortion of any kind overhead against the starfield, the moon, nor either horizion from its approach to its departure. The diameter of the &quot;wooshing&quot; sound as it passed directly over me I would estimate to have been 40-60 feet??? There was no air displacement. The wooshing sound was moderately loud, but nothing to the point of roaring or uncomfortable. INVESTIGATOR FOLLOW UP: In reference to your questions, I will try to answer them in order. The only other bodily sensations I  had consisted of the &quot;tingling and icy cold-blooded feeling&quot; one gets when confronted by something they have never experienced before; and cannot identify--in other words: &quot;fear&quot;! (also, hair standing on end, ect.) As for how I felt after it left? Physically fine; no lasting hearing impairment or pain. Now psychologically, I was very agitated and anxious; it was very fascinating, exciting, and frightening all at the same time!  And no, no missing time. Sorry! lol. Again, no; no dreams--just fascinating and life-long memories. And yes, I have been back there since the incident--and many times before--and only this one time has anything unusual occurred. As for it being worth further investigation, I sincerely doubt it. Again, I have camped there many times since 1986, and have had only this one experience. However, I spent allot of time out West in California, Wyoming, and Colorado. I was in the Marines in California from 1988-1993 in the infantry. I am an avid backpacker, hiker, camper, and general all-around outdoor-nature nut! I have spent allot of time in far more remote regions than this; and this was my first and only experience(and my grandmother&apos;s &quot;sighting&quot; was in the same county back in 1987). So, who knows for sure?  As for an electrical transformer sound? No, not really; it was a whining noise: very high-pitched, rythmical, and...&quot;mechanical?&quot; Not a humming or buzzing type noise. But without a visual/phyisical description, I&apos;m not sure of what value it would be; other than its uniqueness of being only heard and not seen, I guess! lol.

I watched for several minutes and it never exited the cloud.  When it dipped on one side I could see that it had a plate formation below the shiny upper portion of the craft.

The UFO moved around the plane over the top, port side, under and back to the right side.  It flew along side for several minutes. The pilot made some maneuvers and the UFO followed precisely.  The UFO pulled away at a high rate of speed and disappeared in the clouds.  Later the Navigator ordered everyone to turn over their cameras and film.  ((witness)) kept the first roll, 6-pictures.  He had the 6 pictures developed and there clear as a bell was the UFO.  I was fascinated and looked at the pictures a long time.  There was a row of windows along the side, like round portholes.

Her friend told her to look up at Mars, it was near the moon. (by this time the moon/mars had set I think) So, we look up at what we think might be Mars, it looks like a big bright star / planet in the sky. it had bright green / blue look to it.  So we look up, thinking that we are looking at Mars which was nice, but otherwise unremarkable.  Then the light which we think is Mars just takes off!  At first I think, did I just see a shooting star?  But there was no trail, not debris, no charged particles in the atmosphere. &apos;The light seemed to follow the curvature of the earth as we watched it exit over the horizon to the west.

It was traveling southwest toward my location.  Around the border of the horse shoe were a series of large pulsating red lights.  They may have been flashing or lighting in a series, but the effect was such that the light seemed continous.  The object appeared to be wobbling as if it were having difficulty maintaining its attitude.  It&apos;s stopped and remained stationary for approximately 1 minute.  I estimate the altitude at about 2,000 feet.  The object then began to move backward - away from my location.   While there was no sound, the movement was such that the object appeared to have some form of propulsion - i.e., it was not floating as one might expect with a balloon.   It traveled into the distance to where I could no longer see it.

A few mins later, there was this orangish fireball shooting across real fast, it looked like a shooting star or whatever, but after seeing those weird objects flashing those colorful lights, I really can&apos;t say what that orange fireball was, but that fireball was very noticable, it caught right in my eyes, and I have never seen anything like that.

Weather conditions were chilly and clear.  I looked up to admire the stars, and saw a boomerang-shaped object slowly moving South (parallel to Tx. Rt. 59.)  It did not make any sound.  The object appeared to have lights evenly spaced along its perimeter.  The lights were white/amber colored. I stood with my mouth hanging open, watching it move over me and towards the south.  Interestingly enough, my dog promptly sat down and stared up at the object as well! After about 15 seconds, it speeded up and disappeared over the Walmart on Route 59 (as best as I could tell.)  Since that night, the dog&apos;s behavior has changed when he is out in the backyard at night, on his tether.  He appears to not like being out at night, which is a change for him.A few weeks after this sighting of...whatever it was, we have begun to experience intermittent episodes of neighborhood dogs going crazy and barking at no visible stimuli, almost on cue, in the evening.  I have also been startled by what sounds like small footsteps pattering behind me, when I go outside after dark. This tends to coincide with the dogs &quot;going nuts&quot;.All this is very creepy.

I SWEAR on my life and in the name of God that what I have typed below is true, and it did happen to me, my mother, and my brother. I figured it must have been in the fall of 1977 or the spring of 1978, as I was in 3rd grade, and there were no leaves on the trees, and was warm out. My mother was driving down Route 9 in Natick, 9pm-ish at night, and we saw what looked like a round shaped stationary flashing of Christmas lights hovering about 1000 feet above a Car Wash about a mile down the highway.....  My brother who is 3 years older than me was also with us in the car (my mom was driving the 1970 Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser Station Wagon).  I was in the back seat, my brother and mother were in the front seat. WELL, me being 8 to 9 years old at the time, I knew that this was no hot air balloon, nor a blimp, nor a giant kits with lights.  There is not a night that goes by without me thinking of that night.  IT was the SIZE OF A LARGE HOUSE !!!!!!!!!  As my mom continued down Rt. 9 near the car wash, It dropped out of the sky unlike any aircraft could ever do.......and there were the most colorful lights/beams rotating everywhere flashing from this round house sized thing......... lights all over it (I don&apos;t recall seeing any beams).............it made NO noise.......it hovered over our car, then it was following us........also, every dog could be heard howling and barking in the neighborhood.........it&apos;s almost impossible to describe.............and it was hovering right over the car with us in it.....it was at the tree tops, following us...  as mom was driving, she lost sight of it, and so did my brother......and I was in the back seat, terrified...looking all over the place for it as it couldn&apos;t just dissapear like that.......and then I looked up through the tinted moon-roof window of the car (the 1970 Oldsmobile Station Wagon) and I yelled &quot;it is right on top of us!!!  and it&apos;s getting lower!!  It&apos;s following us!!!&quot;  It was right over the car, and then the lights on this thing started going even more crazy....once again, it was the size of a LARGE house, and round with all colors of lights - mostly on the outside what I can only make sense was the rime of the UFO.  Underneath the UFO it was solid, as even though it made no noise, I could hear it hovering over us, as sounds were bouncing off of it.....   The only way I can explain that I knew it was solid, is to close your eyes, then have someone walk by you.... you can hear a solid mass blocking sound.  Does that make any sense??   Every dog in hearing distance could be heard braking like crazy in the neighborhood my mom was driving (behind the car wash in Natick, Massachusetts).  I never knew so many people owned dogs.....  People were coming out of their houses, and I remember so clearly a woman coming out of her house, looking up above our car, and her screaming for her kids to get back in the house at the top of her lungs.....door slammed, and her outside lights turned off.  THis lady was obviously terrified.  As my mom drove around the neighborhood, and this giant silent lit up christmas tree appeared to get even lower below the trees.  My mom knew a lady who she did typing work for in the neighborhood, and my mom pulled the car into her tiny driveway....  we got out of the car (I don&apos;t remember seeing my brother get out of the car or not, but I do remember my mom with me against the car.) .........and when Mom stopped the car in someone&apos;s drive way (whom she knew and did typing work for), the house sized sphere with rotating lights on the outside rim of it, and some lights flashing underneath it was something I could not make sense of..... being ony 8 or 9 years old, the only thing I could associate it with was flashing christmas lights in ALL colors...BUT, the lights were not apearing to flash/blink on and off......it was as if the lights were all joined together, making it look like the giant house sized silent object that was hovering or spinning over our car......but the lights I believe is what made it look like it was spinning as that is the only rational explanation I know.I swear on my grave, and on my life, that the house sized object looked like it lowered below the trees, almost in an arms reach.  My mom then told me to climb up on top of the car and see if I could touch it.  I climbed up onto the hood, then with one foot on the windshield of the car, I reached up my arm (I don&apos;t remember which arm), but I reached my arm up to see if I could touch it.  For that moment we had no fear of it, and the terror was gone.  I was unable to touch it, and it was higher above the car than we thought it looked like.My mom, still to the day feels so guilty as she will sometimes say to me these days &quot;Why on earth did I ever tell you to see if you could touch it....Gahlleee&quot;   &quot;We didn&apos;t know if it was good or bad&quot;  she still says today.So, now that we are in this lady&apos;s driveway, parked.......My mom ran up to the lady&apos;s front door knocking like crazy....and when she came to the door my mom said to her &quot;You have to come out here !!   You have a UFO in your front yard !!!&quot;  So the lady walked out to her front steps and looked right at it, and calmy said &quot;hmmmm....  oh yes&quot;..........    Then she calmly proceeded to ask my mother how she was.  I was stunned with this lady&apos;s reaction.  My mom (still to the day) says that the woman was in a trance when she came out of her house, making very light of the GIANT ROUND house sized light show that was drifting off into her back yard, and into the woods of Natick where it faded behind the trees in the forest.Then, I realized what I just did.  I was on my mom&apos;s car trying to touch this huge thing !!   I got off the car, my mom made some light conversation with the lady, and we got the heck out of there, back home to Wayland.  That was when the real terror started to set in of what happened.  We got home, my mom reached for the phone and said &quot;Who do I call!!!  I can&apos;t call the police!!!&quot;..... so my mom called my sister who was newly married in Marlboro, MASS.     I was terrified for months when it got dark.  There is NOT one night that goes by that I don&apos;t look to the sky, waiting for it to show itself to me again. The whole UFO incident from start to finish lasted about 5 to 10 minutes.  I have recently discussed our experience with my mom, and she said that she will drive the same exact route with me in the day time, and I&apos;m going to film it with my digital camera as Mom tells the story - remember that my Mom was the driver, and her being the only adult in the car, she noticed other things that my brother &amp; I didn&apos;t. Now, you can understand why I think of this thing every night...always looking into the sky at night, almost waiting as if the giant lit-up round freek show thing is going to come back some day or night.   My brother still doesn&apos;t like talking about it to anyone else besides me or Mom... What ever it was, it sure it wasn&apos;t there to greet us as friends, or to let us know that it would not harm us......or to bring peace.....but there was only that brief moment of fascination when I climbed up onto the car to see if I could touch it..... I was absolutely terrified when I went to bed that night, and was for many nights after that waiting for it to appear in the back yard and come back for us in Wayland - the next town over.  Remember that I was 8 or 9 years old....... It just ticks me off as I will always wonder what the whole point of this giant airship hovering over us in the car was for....   ya know?   Ok, so we saw this huge floating round UFO with colorful lights.  What did it want?  What, did it want to put on a show for us??  What was the point it wanted to make??  These a questions that have bugged me for the last 30 years, and I am finally coming out with my experience..   No, we weren&apos;t abducted, none of that stuff...... no physical contact. Maybe if it were evil, I shouldn&apos;t want to know what it wanted, and why it was there that night, floating down to our car.  I remember being so mad at school when telling my friends the next day of what happened.......then they would tell me that it was probably a hot air balloon..or a blimp.....that I shouldn&apos;t lie................that was when I stopped talking about it...  Well, I have seen a blimp, I have seen hot air balloons in all shapes and sizes, and this was NO BLIMP or HOT AIR BALLOON. I understand I am not allowed to reveal my identity or contact info in this forum, and if I were allowed to, I would take my chance and give out my name and email to see if there are others out there that experienced what we did back in the late 1970&apos;s in Natick, MA.......as we have NEVER reported this UFO before, and this forum is the very first time this UFO that we experienced is being shared to the world.  I just want to talk to someone else that saw what we did that night. Nailing down the exact date is difficult, but I do remember I was in 3rd grade, born in 1969, so it had to be 1978 or so......  I do remember that there were little or no leaves on the trees, and it was warm outside....and very dark. Agian, I swear on my life in the name of God that what I have typed above is true, and it did happen to me, my mother, and my brother.  Follow-ups, PLEASE....   Thank You. - D.", "Dozens of Boomerang/V Shaped Formations Floating in the sky from 2:00am-5:00am on 11/20/2005 Witnessed by 4 People.Went outside to take out the trash at 2:00 AM.  It was a clear night sky with a bright moon.  I scanned the sky for several minutes as I always do, ever since my wife and I witnessed a sighting on November 18, 2001. I spent about 5 minutes scanning the sky an then, out of the corner of my eye I noticed a formation of objects with a dim/amber/reddish &quot;glow&quot; float across the sky silently in a &quot;boomerang&quot; shaped formation.  The formation was heading North West.  Visible for aproximately 15 seconds before going out my line of sight. As I continued to scan the sky - there were several &quot;formations&quot; of amber glowing objects floating across the sky. One formation after the other.  Some in perfect V shaped formation, other formations of various sizes.  At one point you could go so far as to describe it as &quot;fleets&quot; of formations....  I ran inside my house to alert my wife.  It took about 30 seconds for me to get her off the computer, and run outside to the front of our house and when we looked up in the sky more formations were floating across the sky. Literally dozens of ambering glowing formations in several minutes.  We stayed outside for 30 more minutes but did not see any more objects in the sky, so my wife went back inside I continued to scan the skys, but also went back inside after a few more minutes of non-activity. At 4:00 AM I had an urge to go check outside again, and within 20 seconds of viewing the night sky from my porch a giant Formation in perfect V shape formation floated beneath the moonlight sky.  I observed this for 15 seconds before the formation blended into the night sky. I told my wife, and I went back outside.  In the next 15 minutes I saw 2 more formations float by.  At 4:15 AM my 21 year old son and his friend came outside to see what I was doing. I greeted them in the front yard, and told them I was scanning the sky for &quot;formations&quot;. Our son had witnessed these objects with my wife, and I back in February of 2005. And within minutes 1 smaller formation of objects floated across the sky, as witnessed by my self, my son, and his friend. His friend was completely in awe of what he caught a glimpse of. We scanned the sky for a few minutes before going back inside at 4:30 AM. At 5:00AM I checked again from my balcony and observed another V Shaped/Boomerang Shaped Amber glowing formation of objects float across the sky. These Formations/Boomerang Objects have been witnessed several times before since November 18, 2001.  One of the reasons I was scanning the Sky tonight was because I had a feeling the sighting my wife and I had in November of 2001 would repeat...and it looks like it did, albeit not as intense as it was on November 18, 2001 .... but still a pretty good show by whatever those boomerang/formations are...", "Unidentified bright, colour and form changing object in the sky.The object changed shapes, colours and when photographed it appeared in various shapes and colours. It started out as a bright yellow light in the sky, just above house level, too low for stars and aircraft.  It did not move for a certain period of time, but then it would change its location after a while. It was brighter than anything else in the sky, and was the only object of its kind in the sky.  It disappeared completely for about 15 minutes, but then reappeared in a different location in the same direction. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Mars?  PD))", "I was driving home late one night from the city of Diamond Bar, when I noticed a very bright light in the sky. I thought it might be landing lights of an aircraft, but it just hovered in the air. The shape was disk or saucer shaped, and it appeared in the horizontal orientation- like a flat oval. The light became very bright- like arc welding or a flash of lightning when all of a sudden, the object shot off at the speed of light at I would say about a 45 degree angle. It was much faster than any aircraft known to man. Although it did rise straight up slightly, it definitely was not a Harrier.I also experienced a loss of time and location. I do not know if the actual date is correct or even the city in which it occurred. I think others may have pulled over on the freeway to see it. I have always accepted the idea of other intelligent life forms in our galaxy or elsewhere in outerspace. The incident only strengthened my belief in UFO&apos;s and extraterrestrials. I have since had a(n) experience(s) that I  thought I was under a very bright, hot light and individuals were examining me and making strange noises. I have also had episodes since then of seeing imagery of everyday scenes when my eyes are shut that appear holigraphic and 3-D. I don&apos;t know what this is, but some tell me it&apos;s called &quot;remote viewing&quot;.

No other cars were around, however several passed by on Hwy 71 as I sat there. It was just after noon and a clear blue sky day.  A silver-bluish chevron shaped craft of 5-7 feet in length appeared near the edge of the parking lot and swooped low over the parking lot, coming from a wooded area to the west of my car.  It came in low and passed within 20 feet of my car, dropped its speed as if to observe me, making a sharp turn.  It then zipped off at a higher speed, gaining altitude rapidly.  I have seen radio-control planes the color and shape of this craft but nothing that is capable of turns and changes in altitude like this !

I turned to see a massive ball of white light falling toward the earth.  I first focused on it when it was at about 45 degrees from my position.  It fell to what appeared to be about 15 degrees and then was not visible.  I believe the mountain range to the East would have precluded it from being a celestial event since it was visible at such a low angle to the ground.  Additionally, it appeared to be no more than a few miles away.", "Very bright light slowly moving north and then turned upward and faded.My friend and I were about to leave my house when I looked up and saw a very bright star.

The light was an orangish color in eastern sky, due south from Mars which was visible in the sky that night as well.  I estimate the object to be somewhere over the Cherry Valley/Beaumont area. Light was at first a single, clearly visable light and was easily seen with the naked eye and seemed to be hoovering in one general area with some slight but quick movements. Small flashes of light appeared to drop from underneath the object, appear brilliantly and then fade out (not a flare). After a few of these lights were seen the single light turned into three lights, possibly four, but the three lights formed what could be described as a triangle shape (clearly seen on the video in still frame).  We counted 6 of these objects being dropped on video before it disappeared. In reviewing the video there appears to be some form of movement above the light which I thought could make it a helicopter (not sure why a helicopter would be dropping something over a populated area though)? Side note: I and my family (wife and two sons have witnessed this same type of light on 6 seperate occasions beginning last May.  I have two seperate videos of this object, (although one is very short and doesn&apos;t show much detail as it was a cloudy night) in roughly the same area. The other times that we have seen it we have not had our camcorder to record.  I am keeping a vigulant eye to the East in hopes of catching more footage.

It was going up (or approaching from the distance) but then went down for about 30 seconds.  I thought maybe it was a flare, except that it was orange, not red.  Then it rose up (approached) again and stayed in one spot for a brief moment before moving in a north, northeastly direction.  It was moving slowly, and with the binoculars I could see what looked like a large flame/glowing ember, and above it a perfectly shaped dome, like the kind you put over a clock or figurine.  The dome was translucent, like a jelly fish looks, colorwise.  The object continured across the sky and i lost sight of it when my neighbors trees got in the way.  At one point red embers fell from it.", "four bright harizontal lightsOn a recent trip to southern Ohio from Cleveland, my daughter TJ, (26) and myself (50) were three quarters the way through a normally 4.5 hour trip.  We turned off Interstate 71 about 15 miles south of Columbus on State Rt. 62 at the Harrisburg/ Orient exit.  We were seven miles south of I-71.  The terrain is flat for the most part. Upon approaching a rise in the road, (much like an overpass), the road curves to the left.  As we were approaching the rise there was a bank of four white lights came on above the rise.  They were straight ahead and beyond the rise/curve maybe 500-1000 feet past.  They were 300-400 feet high.  They were street light sized and intensity and spaced 4-5 feet apart in a stationary horizontal line.  I know the height because I routinely climb a 200 foot tower for work.  At first I thought they were maybe a cell phone tower.  I did not see a strobe or beacon.  My daughter was awake and saw the same thing.  We didn&rsquo;t say anything about it at the time.  The time was approx. 2100 on Friday the 28th of October. We were chatting normally for the next few miles maybe 5-7 and the we saw exactly the same thing on the opposite side of the road.  This time we both looked at each other in amazement. She asked what the heck was that and she indicated she had seen it back at the curve.  I replied that it was probably an aircraft or cell phone tower.  We kept talking about it and then we wondered if maybe we had seen a UFO. The lights did exactly the same thing each time.  All four came on for about five seconds and then went out one at a time from left to right at one second intervals.  Each time it looked like we were passing the object because the viewed angle changed as we moved forward.  Speed was approx. 60mph.  The object stayed motionless.  No sound. No shadows.  No illumination of the surrounding structure. The night was very clear. Moon was maybe a crescent.  Air was cool, about 35 deg F.  We were well into the country. Not much ambient light. We continued talking about it the rest of the trip.  We arrived at out destination at the expected time, about an hour later.  We had not been on this route since May but had been this way many times before.  We decided not to worry about it but to look closely on the return trip, which was two days later.

We would then know if there were indeed cell phone towers in the area.  There were NO cell phone towers anywhere in the vicinity of Rt. 62 north of Washington Courthouse and all the way past the overpass where we first noticed the lights.

The object then stopped its downward linear motion and at a 90 degree angle began going from right to left across the sky at speeds I have never seen. This motion lasted approximately 3 seconds. The object, at that time, had my full attention; therefore, I noticed a blue and red trail.

No noises at all.AT dusk, approximately 5:50 PM, I was in the front yard, letting my dog snoop.  I was therefore wasting time, As I happened to look up, I saw what I originally thought were three helicopters approaching from the west.  I kept waiting for them to get closer and bigger, but even though they finally flew over, they never got bigger, I never hard any sounds, and they were MUCH higher than jetliners flying over either, into or out of the airport.  And even as they leave the airport, they are much higher than a helicopter. When an actual helicopter did actually fly over, then is when I realized these three items were WAY too high to be helicopters, as I had originaly wondered about.  One item, the front one, looked as if maybe it was a large rectangle item, and did turn 90 degrees a number of times.  Their fomation stayed consitent.  In the past, others have reported the &quot;sighting&quot; over Phoenix at night, and the lights.  This time, there were no lights, but the sun had not yet gone down.I am a man, aged 64, sane, and have never before believed I&apos;ve ever witnessed UFO&apos;s.

This time an extremely bright light was spotted through a window as I was sitting about 6 feet across the room.  I immediately went outside. The light was in the SW sky about 4 thumbwidths from the horizon.  I flashed a flashlight into the sky in the direction of the object.  When I did that the light changed shape many times.  It went from a vertical line, to sideways chevron (&gt;), then it turned into a square and finally into a triangle and back to a circle.  It appeared to have rays of light radiating in all directions from it which could have been an optical illusion, although the rays disappeared within 20 minutes.  When I first went outside, every dog in the neighborhood was barking.  The light appeared to pulse after I flashed a flashlight at it.  It also morphed into a triangle multiple times-the morphing happened for the first 15 minutes.  I saw five airplanes fly in opposite directions above and below it with one looking like it nearly collided with it.  After about 25 minutes it began to dim and had very slowly descended behind a tree and within 30 minutes it had floated down and to the west too far to be seen from my vantage point.  There was no sound associated with it. I saw a similar light this morning at 7am in the same part of the sky but dismissed it as a star. The sky was clear and the temperature was about 40 to 45 degrees Fahrenheit. The nearest Air Force base is several hours away, an Army base is 3 to 4 hours away and the nearest commercial airport is an hour away.  This light was 10 times bigger than a star and probably 20 times brighter. I am a former teacher and currently provide homecare to an invalid with multiple health problems.

I just thought maybe it was a plane as there is a local small airport near by. Well the object stopped and hovered there for a moment then proceeded to fly the other way.

From directly behind the screen appeared a huge chevron shaped craft with many white and orange lights along the forward edges.  People instantly started yelling and screaming while pointing to it, several cars started and drove quickly and erratically out of the drive-in lot.  I heard no noise, but the noise of everyone in the lot was fairly loud so it would have been hard to hear anyway.  Several people starting yelling that it was &quot;ultra-lights&quot;, (small planes), and I felt very strongly at that moment that this thing was one object and not a formnation of several objects.  I am lucky enough to have also witnessed the small craft (ultra-lights) that were indeed flying the Hudson Valley at the same time as the famous triangle ufo and I can say with conviction that the two sighting were instantly and exceedingly different. The first craft was very slow, very steady and it seemed that a jogger would easily keep up with it.  The second sighting of the ultra-lights was easily recognized as a formation of small aircraft, unable to stay in precise formation, drifting towards and away from each other, and recognizable engine noise as well.  Also, the second sighting was not really a chevron shape, but more of a sloppy semi-circle of small white lights.  I can understand how those who never saw the first could dismiss the rash of sightings as bogus when they saw the second, but those of us who saw both things cannot be convinced they were one and the same.  Although there were hundreds of witnesses at the drive-in that night, and the craft moved slowly towards Peekskill city proper and many more must have seen it, I don&apos;t recall reading or hearing any report of it specifically.  At the time it was one of the first of many sightings of this craft.  I estimate it to be about 200-300 feet at its widest and nearly that long as well.  There was a smaller red light at its center.  The larger lights were huge themselves, maybe 20-30 feet in diameter.  I saw similar lights (very large) during daylight about three years later moving in the exact same valley as the drive-in, many people pulled off the road to see them as the were BELOW tree level.  The sighting lasted only a minute or so, and there were several  huge white lights in a staggered pattern.  I could not make out any structure, even though this was a midday sighting.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was a crystal clear night without a moon when I spotted four large round lights glowing softly off to the right side of the road ahead about a quarter of a mile away.  They seemed to be motionless at first and my first thought was that they were lights on top of a communications tower because of the numerous towers in the area.  Then I realized that tower lights were just small blinking lights there to warn aircraft of their position.  These lights were large, about 3&apos; in diameter, they didn&apos;t blink, and they had a soft glow like a child&apos;s night light, not like a spot light, and they didn&apos;t light up the ground or anything around them.  Then I noticed they weren&apos;t stationary, but they were moving very slowly towards the road that I was on.  I started to slow down and realized that it was going to cross over the road right over my head if I slowed down enough, which I did.  I rolled down the windows of the car so I could hear it but there was no sound at all.  There were trees lining both sides of the road that obscured my sight of this object as it got nearer to me but I finally slowed down to the point that I came to a complete stop on the road.  I hadn&apos;t seen any other cars on this road at all and hadn&apos;t passed any houses for miles, so it was pretty much an isolated and deserted part of the country, so I was safe to sit at a stop on the road with my car idling, windows down with my head out the window and looking up as the front of this thing appeared over the tree tops and slowly and silently floated overhead.  It wasn&apos;t more than a couple hundred feet high at the most because it wasn&apos;t much higher than the pine trees alongside the road.  Its speed made me think of a blimp cruising along.  It was black and blended in with the pitch black night, making it very hard to see the exact shape of it inspite of being so close, but I could make out what appeared to be panels on the uder side of the craft as the front disappeard over the trees on the opposite side of the road.  It continued to glide in total silence at a very slow speed until the back of the craft appeared over the trees on the right side of the road and then disappeared over the treetops on the left side of the road.  I couldn&apos;t see the whole craft at one time because of the trees so the exact size and shape is hard to determine for sure, but because of my occupation I can be considered a very reliable source for size and shape estimates, and I believe what I saw was in a triangular shape and was at least 300&apos; long and 150&apos; wide.  And the strangest part about it is that as it passed over me not more than 200&apos; to 300&apos; overhead, I didn&apos;t see the four large round lights that first brought my attention to the object.  I was directly under the craft so they might have been located on the sides and not visible from where I looked up at it.  I have only told a few people about this experience because nobody seems to believe anything that can&apos;t be explained, and that things that don&apos;t fall within our general knowledge of things just can&apos;t be true and must have been imagined.  But I know what I saw and I didn&apos;t imagine anything.  And this wasn&apos;t something that was in the distance either.  It was only a few hundred feet away from me at the most.  It was huge, totally silent, moving very slowly, and because it was either painted black or made of a very dark material it was almost invisible against a black night sky.  I&apos;m glad I finally found a place that I can tell about this experience because it&apos;s been on my mind for the past year and seems so significant that it should be told.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident in November 2004 is approximate.

In the winter we lose the leaves that obscure the skyline in front of our kitchen windows. I&apos;d say we are about 3-4 stories high.  Now that the leaves have fallen we can see the city pretty easily through he tree branches.  Since it was a clear night out and we were cooking dinner I was in my kitchen and looking out at the sky line and sky - we eat late.  I could see the typical air-traffic approaching Logan as well as the high altitude military and international flights that go over Boston daily.  Immediately my attention was drawn to a VERY bright  white light, slight reddish hued edges at first, that seemed like an approaching airliner but it didn&apos;t move, or so I thought.  It was very twinkly. Wondering if it was a star or a planet I continued to look at it until I noticed, thanks to the position of the tree branches, that the light was indeed moving but very slowly (there was little to no wind outside). I called out to another person in the kitchen to come to the window and have a look.  He saw it immediately (you&apos;d have to be legally blind to miss it) and he was at a loss as to what it could be since he saw that it was indeed moving but more so like hovering. He went to see to dinner and I kept watching. Suddenly it got brighter and I could see on both the left, right, and the bottom edge, the light became more oblong, that there were two red lights that could be seen partially through the bright white in the center.  The other person heard me yell out and came to see it too.  Just as suddenly as it brightened it started to dim.  The white light part turned all red and just faded out til it was gone -  like CRT TV&apos;s that have the center dot that fades out. The whole time typical aircraft were flying above and near(ish) the object.  It was much larger and brighter than any of them regardless of altitude. Thinking it was a star, I thought I would try and see if it was there the next night.  Venus and Mars have been pretty big in the sky over the last months so I thought I&apos;d wait until I could rule it out.  Of course it was cloudy the next two nights but the third night was crystal clear (11/17/05).  Not one star would have even come close as to rule it one in the same.  Not that you can see a ton in the city anyway. There were none in the area where this seem to be in the sky.  As a point of reference, the Prudential Tower was directly below it&apos;s position.

They were flying what i figured to be about as low as a passenger jet readying for landing, for i also figured they were at least just as big.  i watched them carefully, not taking my eyes off of them. they made no sound.  even with the street traffic, i can hear aircraft that fly that low.the sky was patched with clouds.  The sky where i saw the craft was cloudless and dark and starred with the night.  the objects were as dark as the dark sky, with wings near the angle of flying wings. there were at least eight white lights on the backs of the wings, like one would see on the wings of a passenger jet.  there were no headlights, no blinking wing lights, no tail lights, blinking or otherwise and no body lights.There was no body per say and no tail.  It was just a wing, kind of a long triangular shape, but with a dip in the back middle.They were side by side, wing tips nearly overlapping. One of the &quot;wings&quot; was slightly in front of the other.  As they were both moving across the sky, the one behind moved just slightly in front of the one that was in front before.  Also, the angle of the &quot;wings&quot; was a bit different for each craft.They flew slowly north and disappeared into the clouds.  I saw them for about a long 15 seconds.

Cant find the report in my puter stuff) wasn&apos;t known of by the public in 1981/82.I told them that I knew of the flying wing at least by then, if not before.

The first thing that I noticed about the object was that it had no navigation lights on it, instead the whole thing glowed brite orange/yellow.  It was moving much slower than an airplane and made absolutely no sound. After about 20 seconds of watching this object it did something very weird, fire fell off of it.  It looked like some one poured a flaming liquid out of this object, at first the steam of fire coming out was brite yellow and then it changed to orange and then vanished.  If the object was say fifty feet in diameter then the steam of fire was 150 feet long. As we watched, fire fell off three different times and then the whole object made a very sudden slow right turn and headed east, as it headed east the object began to turn a dull orange and then it vanished into the night sky.

It was hard to make out but the motion of the object was obvious- It was very slow moving and either very very low overhead- as an approaching plane- or it was absolutely enormous and flying at a normal altitude. At first when I recognized the dark triangular shape, I thought perhaps it was a stealth bomber, but realized it wasnt possible as it was so low, moving so slowly, and did not make a sound.  Two guys my age (mid-20&apos;s) walked past me, and I asked them if they had seen &quot;that&quot; but neither had a clue to what I was referring. Everything echos in my apt complex, so it must have been silent or the guys would have heard it.  It was a perfectly clear night with the stars shining. The moon was just rising as sunset was only about an hour prior to the event. (maybe to help the ship blend in they chose that time to be fly so low, since the background sky wouldnt be as bright from the then waning moon) The object which was barely noticeable, except that it seemes the object had either very dim lights around its edges- roughly as bright as the dimmest stars you can see- or it distorted the background skyscape to conceal itself.  It moved due East and I watched it until it passed over the roof of the adjacent apartment building.  I actually followed it as best I could in my car since I was originally leaving my apartment to go to my destination which was also due East- but no luck- nearly got in an accident trying to look for it though! Incidently, I have a BS in psychology, and am pretty even keeled, but when I saw this I was afraid I was having a psychotic break from reality brought about by stress, but I knew I had seen SOMETHING, even though I wasn&apos;t sure that it could be a UFO- the only other theory I came up with is that it was a hangglider- but there aren&apos;t any open fields around here to land- its pretty heavily developed.

The only craft I have ever seen traveling East/West are military aircraft of some sort.  I saw this object traveling almost due East. What I saw was a very bright light that was constant with no flashing or blinking as with normal aircraft lights.  The object appeared to be at a lower altitude or was very large.  I could hear absolutely no sound as it flew over.  I would normally hear a jet engine if it were an airliner or normal military craft.

It ranged from orange, red, blue, and green. The brightness of the light also varied during the time we watched.  It was always the brightest object ib the sky, but it seemed to periodically change in brightness, often emitting different colors of light in different directions.As we watched we noticed an abundance of aircraft from the nearby naval base flying towards or in the area.", "Bright, pulsating light in night skyThe object appeared as a bright light, almost like a star.

These objects were much lower to the ground and moving much slower than traditional aircraft.  I can say this with certainty because there were planes simultaneously flying in the area (there were much higher and faster).  These objects seemed to ascent individually, one at a time.  Each ascended at an angle similar to that of a plane taking off--but this inclined ascent was done from mid-air, not from the ground.  In one instance, an ascending object appeared to come very close to a jet in the air.  After watching 2-3 do this, I lost track of the objects.  About an hour later, I saw another cluster of lights in approximately the same area of the first cluster (within several miles of each other--at the most).  This cluster more resembled a constellation than the previous one, almost like the Big Dipper where one can visually connect the objects in an ascending line.  Again, these objects were much lower to the ground and much slower moving than aircraft that was simultaneously in the same airspace.  At times, it seemed that these objects disappeared, and then reappeared shortly thereafter.  However, I did not witness the process of re-appearance because I was traveling home in a car by this point.  It is now approximately 90 minutes after I first saw this strange occurrence, and I cannot see these lights from my home. I have never reported a UFO sighting in my life, and never before today had I ever believed I saw UFOs.

At the top of my windshield I immediately noticed a VERY bright--brighter than any stars or planets--spherical or possibly oval shaped white light heading towards the southeast at a VERY steep angle. It was such a steep angle, and it was moving SO fast that I thought at first it must be a HUGE meteorite (it looked like the size of a small house)--and it was going to crash.  I awaited the inevitable flash of light (assuming there would be a flash), but there was only silence.  There had been no noise before it hit/landed either. Also, there was no tail (or trail) attached like a meteor would exhibit.I have seen dozens of meteorites during my lifetime---either in meteor storms or other times---and this was NOTHING like that.

The sphere had sharply defined edges and appeared translucent and seemed to turn various shades of grey.  It began to move in an arc downward and to the right, as if circling the balloons.  I called the parking attendant to come and see this but before he returned the sphere, after completing a quarter circle and being below the balloons, simply vanished.What happened next was strange in that both the attendant and myself had this unusual visual effect like hundreds of bright particles flashing around in front of our eyes.  The attendant described it like crystals shooting about.  This effect continued for 4-5 minutes before it began to dissapate.

My mother and sister are still alive and have validated my memories of the event.  I went back home to Roseburg Oregon and interviewed the neighbor lady and her husband who still lived there who also remembered the event. In August of 1967, approx 7:00pm in the evening, 3 saucer aircraft appeared from the west traveling toward the east, and hovered above our neighborhood (we lived in a valley), approx 500 feet off the ground.  I rememeber my sister ran in the house telling us her car was enveleoped in a blue light as she was heading to work in a local movie theater.  I recall being scared as my mother turned all the lights off in the house. We watched them from inside our home for about 5 minutes,  then slowly went outside to look. There was no sound.  Silent. In the air above our home approx 500 feet up were 3 disc shaped objects, with red-blue-green swirling lights rotating around the craft in a clockwise circular pattern.  They were about the size of a house, quite large.  I remember the colors being very striking, almost a neon glow only more intense.  On top was a large orange glowing dome, which reminded me of a lantern.  After 10 minutes, sprarks began to fall from beneath the crafts, at the same time.  Long showers of sparks falling with NO SOUND at all.  Suddenly, they accelereated so fast in a northly direction that it almost looked as if they disappeared. There was NO WIND either, as the sparks were all that remained falling in the air where the craft were. The sparks did not blow around as the craft left. It was as if the craft &quot;disappeared&quot;. This event ocuured precisely at 7:00pm for the next 2 evenings.  Exactly the same things happened, with the sparks falling after 5 minutes of them approaching from the west. On the 3rd day, my sister went to her wealthy friends house on top of a nearby hilltop.  They had a telescope for star viewing.  My sister said when they appeared, she plainly saw what appeared to be round black windows where the orange glow dome was.  The craft was metalic.  The lights swirling around the craft were something she said she has never seen before. Beautiful colors just swirling around the outside edge of the saucer shaped craft. There were flames and sparks emitting from the bottom/center of the craft. The airport was called during the 3 day event. They said they saw it, as the airport was only 5 miles away.  They said there was nothing on the radar screen, yet there they were.  The local news station had a report on the objects on the evening news the next day.  But right after that, no one spoke about it.  There were military officers I remember in the news, but not a word about any craft.  My mother, sister, friends all talked about it amongst ourselves, but never to anyone else as people would think we were were crazy, so we never talked about it. I began recalling this whole thing about 15 years ago, and it has been getting more vivid, as if it just occured yesterday.  If I could take a photo of them from my mind, you would also agree this was not a helicopter or airplane that we know of. I am sure there were pictures taken by townsfolk. There were FAR too many people who witnessed this. But what was weird was that it was NEVER talked about by the media again.

There was two of us and we both saw these objects.I just got home a couple of hours ago and started to do some research on this and found the phoenix lights.  My sighting was very similar. One last thing i dont know if this has any relation but a couple of mins after the lights we witnessed what looked like a small meteror or something of that sort about 100-200 yards from the aircraft.  There were some other aircraft in the area anyone else see anything?((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we found him to be an exceptionally good witness.  He provided a seemingly quite accurate azimuth to the lights, which suggests to us that they could have been over the Gila Bend Firing Range.

Knowing that stars twinkle, and the light of a planet stays steady, I assumed this must be a planet. I grabbed my binoculars.  As I was fixing on the object I noticed that this light was kind of bobbing back and forth, and up and down in small increments.  I&apos;m thinking that atmospheric conditions are the cause of this apparent movement of this &quot;hanging light.&quot; While looking through the binoculars it was impossible to keep the light steady in view, but I noticed a black triangular shape which was darker than the night sky that enveloped the orangish-white light. This thing just continued to slowly bob and zig back and forth and up and down in very small increments while at the same time slowly moving to my right until it moved out of view disappearing behind the rooftop of my neighbor&apos;s house. The period of time from first notice until it was out of my sight was approximately 20 minutes. The next night (tonight-10/29/05) I went to shut the blinds in the guest bedroom as usual and this light was exactly where it was the night before--appearing and behaving exactly as before on the previous night. I will be looking tomorrow for another appearance.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the light may be a celestial body, given that it has been seen on sequential nights.  We do not know what the black triangle was.  PD))((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous, and provides no contact information.

I was on my way to work at ((deleted)) plant in Marysville, Ohio.The time was about 6:25 AM.I was about three miles out of town before I entered the city limits when I spotted a round light in the north east.  I could also barely see the colors of the morning rising sun in the east, but the sun was still way below the horizon.The light I seen was not a star.  I am familiar with what the planet Venus looks like on certain mornings, and this light was not the planet Venus.I&apos;m not sure how far or close it was to me, but if I was to hold out my arm, the object would seem to be about the size of a pea between my fingers.What caught my attention with this object is rather than having a flashing strobe light like most airplane lights, this light was pulsating. It faded in and then faded out continuously. ( the speed of the fading in and out was no faster the the second hand of a clock ticking away.)  As far as I could tell, the light did not seem like it was moving in the sky, I can&apos;t be sure of this though as I was driving at the time of the sighting.The color of the light was white. There was only one light, not two or three like an airplane.I observed the pulsating light for about thirty seconds as I drove along the highway curves, the light occasionly was obscured by trees as I was driving, and when I came through the trees into another clear shot view of the sky the light wasn&apos;t there anymore.I didn&apos;t think much of what I saw, telling myself maybe it was a helicopter light, as I am not familiar with helicopter lights...maybe they have just one light that pulsates and fades in and out.About a minute or so later I spotted the light again in the same spot in the distance...although, this time the light was not pulsating. It was a constant white light, no fading in or out. It also appeared to be stationary and not moving....I asked myself what this could be and I tried to observe it as much as I could while driving and trying to keep my car on the highway.I observed the light for about another thirty seconds while it was constantly &quot;on&quot;.I looked away just for a split second and then when I looked back the light had disappeared.I thought that maybe if it was a helicopter, it could have turned and the light would no longer be visible in my direction, but I closely observed the area where I had seen the light, and I did not see anything at all, no side view of a light, or no back view of an aircraft,it was as if the light had just disappeared into thin air.I am not so sure what this light was, it may very well have been a helicopter.", "Bright disk in skyA bright yellow disk to dim to be the sun but to bright to be the afternoon moon.

It was low in the sky, about 800 feet up in the air, silent as I said, and in motion, as if it was carried on a breeze. It had no lights. I only estimated its shape by the pattern it took in blocking out starlight above it. I watched it for about thirty seconds, then got scared and went in the house.

I asked my friend to take a look at the them, since I was driving, and tell me what they were.   He told me they were moving.   They first appeared to me  like lights at the end of a runway or something.  I was curious if there was an airport nearby.   But my photographer said they were rotating.

I was on the roof and asked one of the guys on the ground to hand me a nail gun. As he handed up the nail gun, he said, &quot;Hey, look at that&quot;.  &quot;What,&quot;  I said.  He said, I don&apos;t know, look. So I did. I saw nothing and was busy so I blew it off for a few minutes.  Then he said check it out.  I turned and looked at the sky for several minutes and saw nothing.  It was 10:00 in the morning and the sky was almost clear. Just then a small cloud was drifting across above us.  He said right there above that cloud.  Do you see it?  After a few more minutes, I did.  It looked like a little speck of cotton off of a cottonwood tree, way up in the air, only it wasn&apos;t moving. I had to get back to work, so I did. The next chance I got, I started looking for the dot again.  Now all 4 of us were looking for it. After a few minutes the person who originally spotted it, spotted it again.  An airplane was flying alomg now and we used it as a guage to let eveyone else know its locatuion. Pretty soon, we all saw it It looked like a silverish metallic orb with the sun shining off of it.  It&apos;s altitude was way greater than the airplane or the cloud that went past earlier.  It was not moving.  I thought for sure it had to be a satelite. Everyone else went back to work except for me and the person who spotted it first.  After about another four or five minutes the object moved in a direction that appeared to be down for about a half a second, then went to our right (west) very rapidly until it went out of sight. When the object moved the speed appeared to be constant.  No starting slow and then going faster, and when it went out of sight, it was due to the fact that the sun reflecting off of it quit shining on it, so we couldn&apos;t see it anymore, not that it went behind the mountains or anything. I would estimate the speed to be about five times as fast as the speed of the planes that were flying over at the time.  I looked at my friend and said did you see that?  Yes he said.  I said what did you see?  He said he saw the dot drop down and then take off that way, (indicating towards the mountains).  Me too, I said. That was about all that was ever really said about the incident.  It was just forgotten and dismissed as one of those things that make you go hmmmm. I will never forget what I saw though.

The water was calm, the air cool and the stars shining.  We both witnessed a shooting star.  At first it was blue and after it broke up some, it turned green then finally vanished leaving a gray trail.  I saw a red shooting star that my friend unfortunately did not get to see.I was sitting on the beach facing east and turned my head to face north-northeast.  I first saw a flash of light, like a fat short lighting bolt with even sides.  The end of the flash bent to my left slightly, then disappeared.  What appeared then I can describe as a small dot of light.  It was an orange-yellow color and it just stayed in the same place motionless. After a moment it started to move to my left.  At first I figured it was a helicopter, but it soon made a manuver I haven&apos;t seen a helicopter make (aviation has been a hobby of mine all my life).  It went down at a 45 degree angle to the right for a moment, then stopped.  It glowed different colors after it stopped, from yellow to orange, then the light suddenly disappeared.We both watched in amazement of what we had just witnessed.  After no more then 10 seconds the light reappeared in the same position.  This time it was shifting from red, yellow to orange (in no particular order).  The light then moved to the left, and then in front of it several different colored lights appeared.  I would say there were 3 green lights and one yellow/white light.  The formation of lights slightly resembled an airplane, but pretty soon the lights were changing formation.  More yellow/white lights appeared and the green lights went into a triangular formation.  As the lights moved to the right, my vision of them was obstructed by trees.  As the last light was just about to vanish by the trees, it violently changed colors from red to yellow/white.  The rate it was flashing was like a strobe light.  It then was gone.The objects were only round dots, like the period at the end of this sentence.  Me and my friend are both 18 years old and male.  We were only star gazing looking at constellations on a beautiful night.  A few minutes after witnessing this my friend became irrationaly afraid of a noise in the bushes behind us.  It was just a deer and nothing to be afraid of, and he knew it; but he still wanted to leave the beach.  I told him to calm down and to give me a cigarette.  I layed down on the beach trying to make sense of what happened. Halfway through the cigarette I sensed an overwhelming sense of dread and panic, basically my brain demanded that I leave the beach.  I told this to my friend and he agreed wholeheartedly.  We walked back to my house and didn&apos;t talk much of what we saw, we mainly focused on the shooting star we both saw.For some reason we both try to deny what we saw.  We told our friends but the memory is a burden, it feels like something only crazy people would talk about.  We both tried to agree to not mention it again.", "Large silent triangular craft sighted.Mr. Dennis Balthaser said that I should report the two triangle sightings I have had this year on this site Mr. Davenport.  I consider him a wise person, and will follow his suggestion.On June 8, 2005, I had just recived a phone call from my son that he had been involved in an accident on a road near a nearby lake.  I was running out the front door and down the sidewalk to my car when I realized there was something coming out of a cloud.  I looked up and saw a huge triangular craft exit a cloud or something reddish brown like a cloud and it was straight up above me.  I was facing somewhat south as I headed to my car in the driveway.  The size and the silence of the craft stopped me in my tracks and for a second  I couldn&apos;t do anything but stare.  It came out of the north and was directly paralle to Interstate 540 in Lowell.  This meant it was headed in a southerly direction. The only way I can guess at the altitude is that it was about the altitude of a plane upon descent to the airport about 15 miles west of me.  That, or very shortly after lift-off altitude.There was no sound coming from it at all, and no strobing lights visible.  The shape was well defined triangle.  There were cream or light yellowed colored lights across the back or flat edge of the triangle and they went up towards the front point about three-quarters of the way.  The lights didn&apos;t extend all the way into the point. The width of it across the back edge appeared to be a football field or more perhaps.  I couldn&apos;t guess at the length because I was pretty overwhelmed at the size as it went over me.  I watched it long enough for it to go over several houses after mine, but it may have only been a minute or more.  I am not aware of any other witnesses, because I had to quickly go to my son&apos;s accident, but used enough time to run towards my front door screaming for my husband.  He ran out the back door of the house but it had already appeared to enter another clouded area. I have not talked with any of my neighbours except one who did not see anything that night.  She was not outside at that time..", "a dark oval shaped object that made no sound that travelled at very very high speedsthis is very exciting as i have always wanted to report what i did see that day, the time of year above might not be exact,it was somewhere between april and august 1997 i think possibly around june?i was blockpaving a driveway at the top end of Lancaster near the motorway (m6) when me and a friend heard military fighter jets approaching from the south,we observed two,both flying very low,one of which flew right above us so low that my friend commented that you could read the numbers or lettering on the underside,the other plane flew above the houses on the other side of the road,we observed these for about 7 to 12 seconds approximatly till they were out of sight,my friend then walked off the drive and was stood facing me on the pavement,i was still on the same spot looking south for any more that might of been flying in our direction when i seen something else approaching,there was no sound at all and it was moving fast very fast it was following the path of the plane that had flown above the houses on the other side of the street,it was higher up on its approach but sort of swayed from side to side as it lowered down above the houses,the movement sounds simple i know but i cant exactky describe it but this is what made me think,what the hell am i looking at and i said to my friend &quot;look at that&quot;,to which he grinned,all he had to do was turn his head,by the time i said it again i was shouting and pointing frantically,at this point it was directly behind him,he was still grinning,by the time i said &quot;look at that&quot; a third time i was jumping up and down like a mad man pointing and shouting and that was it the object had gone,sadley i alone witnessed this and it was only there for afew seconds it travelled i would say three times faster than the planes we seen only afew seconds earlier and must of easily caught them up,the shape of this object was i would say was oval it was dark in colour black or dark grey and it was kind of fraid and blurry around the edges i couldnt say if it was spinning or what it was hard to tell it was amazing and i have woke up in the middle of the night years after wishing that my friend had looked round so i could of been backed up on this,because it made no sound he didnt look,what i seen that day was a UFO to me,wether or not it was man made or not who knows?((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

When in the parking lot leaving work at approx 0320, facing the south, I looked up to the sky and noticed what appeared to be a round light, surrounded by fog, very high in the sky coming from the south heading NNE at a very steady pace.  The stars were bright and there did not appear to be any clouds that I could see. Thinking it was probably a jet flying quite high, it kept heading NNE, but right as it got overhead, it sped up dramatically and when it got slightly north of my position it quite abruptly made a 90 degree turn straight west and I lost sight of it.", "Hovering object with circulating yellow and green lights slowly began to move before attaining hyper speed from virtual dead stopWhile driving towards a remote and rural school pearched atop a small mountain ridge for an evening athlethic event in extreme northwest Alabama, my mother and I witnessed an object that appeared to be hovering just above (500 - 700 ft) the school that we were driving towards.  We were drving up hill and the winding road caused us to lose site for a couple different moments, but it became visable again each time our vision cleared.  We could not see the school, but we could see how the night sky was slightly illuminated by the presence of the school and associated ground lights.  It appeared that the hovering object was observing the location.  The object appeared circular in shape (not round, but more disk shape).  There were slowly rotating lights that I beleive to have been yellow and green in color.   After having watched this object and having seen it for a sustained period of time, and from different angles, there was no doubt that we were seeing an actual object and not any type of projected light or reflection, etc...As peculiar and interesting as the sighting had been, what followed was most remarkable...  I would suspect our distance from the scene to have been about perhaps a quarter of a mile, at the time.  We noticed that the object began to move slowly away from the ground illumination, and then, in a instant the object from an almost dead stop accelerated to an incredible speed that took it away from our vision in a fraction of a second.  It didn&apos;t just disappear, it disapppeared as a result of distance covered from our location.  We saw it go truly out of sight.  It left no light trail of any type whatsoever. What we saw was clearly visible and clearly trackable. It was a clear night and we had even discussed the event as it was taking place.  Our view was excellent for the sighting.  It truly looked like it was observing the mountain top scene, and simply left when it was done.  It&apos;s possible we spooked it off as we progressively drew closer to the locale with our car lights pointing in its general direction.The event is etched in my mind and always will be.  I never gave much (and still don&apos;t) to the idea of it being extraterrestrial in nature, but it was without any question and unidentified flying object unlike any known then or today.", "First sited around 21:27 moving at a very fast constant rate to the NW.

I was doing these security rounds at about 8:15pm at night when I had my sighting.  I had just walked out of the Southern part of a building, into a courtyard between the offices buildings, turning East to walk back towards the main building.  I looked up into the sky as I usually do and spotted what I assume in Mars.  I remember reading a news story about how Mars is supposed to pass close to the Earth again and look bigger than normal.  I noted this must be Mars as it looked bigger than any other star and seemed to have an orange tint to it. Just to the right of Mars, off to the ESE, I then I spotted something I&apos;m not used to seeing at all.  In that part of the sky, I saw two very far off red flashing lights. They did not flash at the same time, rather one and then the other. The first thing I thought was that these were military helicopters, flying at a very high altitude. They seeming to be flying to my right, which was South. I assumed they were flying from Camp Pendleton to Mira Mar, both Marine bases in San Diego. This would not have been unusual if this was the case. I&apos;ve often seen helicopters fly a NNW to SSE flight path over Vista and San Marcos down to Mira Mar, even at night. I stopped for a moment to watch them... and they blinked out. The sky was completely clear. You could see every star. There were absolutely no clouds. I was stunned. I waited. I wanted to see them again. I wanted to make sure that maybe they didn&apos;t just fade behind a very thin cloud that I was unable to see in the night sky. I expected them to pop back out further to the South, possibly leaving my vision on the SE horizon. That&apos;s when they reappeared alomst directly overhead. I looked up, surprised by their new position, but then I realized that they may not have been flying SE at all. They may have been approaching and flying directly West. I just percieved the wrong thing at first because they were so far off on the horizon. They were now directly overhead, just South of the zenith. I watched them pass. They still appeared to be very high in the sky, however, the red lights flashed a lot brighter. The stars were even more clear in the sky. I thought that I might be actually seeing a black tringle. So, I carefully watched the sky between the lights to see if I could see an edge or perhaps see stars &quot;blink out&quot; as it passed by. I did not, so I was able to rule out this was a single craft. The two red lights were two seperate objects. They matched each other in speed and brightness so well, though, that if was hard to tell. I had to look just to make sure. Once I ruled that out, I still noted no sound. I called my roommate on a cell phone I was carrying and reported what I was seeing to him. He was at the apartment, a few miles to the NE of my position, in Vista, however, the apartment faces NW and he doubted that he would be able to see it. Even as I spoke with him, the two lights were slowly making their way across the sky and out to the Pacific Ocean. I continued to watch them, never taking my eyes off them, as I spoke with him and watched them bank to their left. The two lights took on a 45 degree angle in the sky as they seemed to turn from going West to SW. Eventually, the lights met with the horizon of another office building and I had to walk away because I could no longer see them from my point of view. My thoughts are that I believe this was military. It could possibly be either fighter jets or military helicopters flying at the highest altitude, however, what gets me if the total absense of sound, nor any other lights. Now, in the flashing of the red light, there could have been a smaller white one mixed in there, but the lights were so high up, and the red flashed so quickly, that I was unable to tell for certain. I&apos;m reporting this just in case I&apos;m wrong and the military didn&apos;t fly these two crafts tonight. I am familiar with the two red light sightings in San Diego around the 4th of July and New Years. I&apos;m reporting this just in case these may actually be tied into those sightings as well. Note: As an added note, there was tons of air traffic tonight. I saw at least 5 other small planes in the sky returning to the main building. Three of which seemed to be flying up and down the coast of Carlsbad at the same time as my sighting. One plane was landing at Palomar airport at 8:18pm. It&apos;s possible other pilots in the Northern Western part of San Diego County may have seen these two lights and can be a better judge of altitude and position.((ADDENDUM FROM ORIGINAL WITNESS; SUBMITTED 10/28/2005 AT 21:02 HRS.))Flashing red light returns, alone this time, flies same path overhead, and disappears over SW horizonRefer back to 20:15 sighting in same location.  This is the same person reporting. The lights came back.  ((NUFORC Note:  at 21:40 hrs.))  One of them did, anyways.  This time there was only one flashing red light in the sky as it passed overhead, going the same speed, same direction. Now I really am wondering if it&apos;s military aircraft circling.  However, as always, because the lights would completely stop flashing and go out for a few passing moments, and because this still did not have any sound, or any other lights associated with it, I wanted to report it here. This time I can give you something else I didn&apos;t note the first time.  There was a sequence to the flashing lights.  It flashed in sequence of 1-2-3-stop... 1-2-3-stop... each time it stopped, there would be no lights at all.  I could only still make out a red light.  I watch it blink out while overhead this time and still could not even make out a shadow of a dot in the sky.  I watched it fly west, all by itself, and bank to the SW again before I returned to what I was doing.((END ADDENDUM))((CORRESPONDENCE FROM WITNESS))Peter, I&apos;m sorry, but it turns out that these aircraft were fighter jets from Miramar MAS. They returned a third time later in the evening and I had a witness with me who was able to say with certainty that these are what they were. During the third sighting, we actually saw four of them, flying the same exact circular path, two by two.He agreed with me, however, that it was very strange that the pilots were turning off all their lights. Again, right over the area of Encinitis, Ca, the flashing red lights would turn off and they&apos;d fly a short distance for about a good 10 seconds with no lights at all.Also during the third sighting, things were finally quiet enough in the area that we were both able to hear the very distant rumble of fighter jet engines.I apologise for posting these reports, now that I know what they were, but, like I said in those reports, the fact that I couldn&apos;t hear them at first and the fact that they were actually turning off all their navigational lights was throwing me off. I guess they thought they were flying high enough that they didn&apos;t need to worry about commercial and private aircraft hitting them. I wonder why they still did that, though...I guess you can still post the reports based on that weird fact. Maybe they didn&apos;t want to be noticed and were flying at such a high altitude because they were flying something unconventional. I have no doubt now, though, that it was military aircraft from Miramar.((END CORRESPONDENCE))", "8:14 a,m,  My family apparently saw a scene of two bright white objects destroyed by a green object.It was at 8:14 a.m. on October 27, 2005, that I and my family saw two unidentified flying objects.  We were on highway 280 driving on our way to Redwood city from San Francisco when we saw these objects. It was my wife who pointed these two mysterious objects out as I was driving.  She tapped me on the shoulder an told me to looked up to the upper right corner of the sky.  I saw two bright stationary objects (they appeared to be brighter than the sun or anything I have ever seen in my entire life. There was a large object above a smaller one. I did not look at them the entire time because I was on the high-way and I did not want to risk an accident with another car, so I turned away and started driving.  When there were not any cars around and it was safe to slow down, I looked back up into the same spot of the sky I had just looked at and saw five white lights in the sky. They were as bright as the other objects I had seen except this time they were smaller.  As I watched them they appeared to be falling towards the earth (I do not know how high up the objects were). I asked my wife and children what had happened and they told me that the object had exploded in the sky after a light green object emItted some kind of a beam.  According to my wife and children, the two bright white objects had been obviously been attacked and destroyed by the green object.  I would have taken a picture but my camera phone does not take pictures of far away objects.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was very bright and the incident occured in open sky with no clouds to obstruct anything. Since then I have had various sightings through the years in which I observed something moving at appartently thousands of miles an hour.  They would leave a light trail behind them and seemed jerky in their movements.  Sometimes they would make a sharp 90 degree turn without any arc at all. One very clear sighting was a object bright green in color and at first looke like a meteor coming down. This happened here in Coolidge AZ in the late 80&apos;s. Something wasnt right so I called my wife to come outside.  Before she arrived the craft seemed to flip sharply then the end flared bright red and it shot straight up into the sky. Another and this time documented sighting was in Spring Arbor MI  There were two witnesses but they spoofed me.  The next day it was on the news in which a UFO had been tracked by police for over 200 miles. This happened in the summer of I believe 1973 or 1974.  I also have vivid memories of a wing shaped object hovering over a house in Michigan in the later 60&apos;s. I have also observed the mysterious lights here in Arizona and late saw where someone was shooting flares.  These lights were nothing like flares and had their own qualities that set them apart.  They had a clarity about them like no lights I had seen.  They did not flicker or seem to float.  A flare with flicker from near to black to bright and then eventually burn out.  When these lights disapeared it was as if someone had turned off a switch.  They were also about thirty miles further south from where the Air Force reserve range is supposed to be.  What these craft are, I do not know but they are nothing I know of along with the manuvers they make.

It was far enough away that I could not notice detail, but it appeared to be tapered at each end.  It definitely had a mass to it and didn&apos;t appear to be something that was projected, as I could notice a bit of light reflected off of it.  Its movement was very fast and it almost seemed to move from one part of the sky to another by &apos;zipping&apos; along and then suddenly slowing and stopping.  I&apos;m not sure how else to explain the odd movement. I don&apos;t believe in aliens or anything of the like but I know what I saw and I do not believe it was of this world.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

While looking south at the moon, at about SSE, there was an object that was was Very Bright, way to bright to be star or planet and way to bright to be a plane sitting stationary (we are right in the fly way for an airport so we know what planes look like coming in ). I called my wife and had her come out and she also witnesed the object.  The object was there tell I finished my cigerette. When I went back out about about 15 minutes later it was gone.  I probably would not have reported it, but noticed some one in MTKA MN had seen what sounds to be the exact same thing (and where I was looking was right where MTKA would be) but there sighting seems to be a little later.Whatever it was, it was BRIGHT.((NUFORC Note:  We note that the planet Mars would have been in generally the same area of the sky that the witness indicates above.  PD))((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))I have already sent a report on this, but wanted to mention a mistake I made. The object I seen was SSW. Would of there been possibly a star in this area? I was looking directly South. The moon was out and this object was was about halfway between the horizon and the moon and about 15 degrees to the right. Exactly where the MTKA sighting was on the same date. Not that I was seeing the same object. But it was really something to see.

I Have always been very interested in UFO&apos;s ever since as a child at the age of about 13 me and about 6 other kids were out in a swampy area in Minnetonka, where I grew up. We used to go out in the cat tails and and pat down a circle and hang out together. One evening it was getting dark, and we all decided that we should probably get going. We all stood up and, when one of my friends looked up and said hey look at that! I looked up and to my surprise was three star looking objects in a triangle. the wierd thing is that this tringle of three star looking objects were so high up that they looked to be up in space, and also that they were moving at a slight angle straight up into space. As far away as they were ( if you held out a marble in your fingers that&apos;s about how spaced they were), the triangle had to be so far apart I can&apos;t even begin wonder how far apart they were to make that triangle. They just kept moving almost staight up into space tell we couldn&apos;t see them. This all happenend in a matter of about 20 to 30 seconds. Very impressive.

We were a few blocks from the trailer park that I lived in, when a large lightening bolt appeared to come horizontally out of the back-side of the white truck and struck a power pole.  The car in front of me kept going and I could not tell if they noticed this extremely unusual event.  The white truck continued on, giving no indication of anything else unusual.  I was scared to meet the truck on the highway, but did not have any other choice and passed the truck without further incident.  I drove into the trailer park as the neighbors were coming out of their homes, wondering why their electricity had just shut off.

I thought it was a plane at first.  It was off the normal pattern.  Only thing I&apos;ve seen here coming from the East are choppers coming into the hospital here.

And that&apos;s when I noticed it was triangular shaped, with round lights on all three corners and one in the center of the belly.  One red flashing strobe underneath about center.

I can only estimate the number but i would say approximately 12 of these circles were laid out very symmetrically along the Y. This object had no lights or no self luminescence.

Both the witness and I are pilots involved in a flight training program and fear our careers as airline pilots may be jeapardized by this report.  On September 23rd, 2005 the witness was flying a small light twin aircraft (a Piper Seminole) on an IFR flight plan from Montgomery, AL to Jacksonville, FL.  The sun had already set so it was dark by this point.  Both witnesses on board the aircraft were instrument-rated pilots and were on frequency and in-contact with Air Traffic Control.  The aircraft originated in Dallas, Texas and had been attempting to outrun Hurricane Rita before it hit the Texas and Louisiana coast, so there were very few, if any, other aircraft on frequency or even airborne in the area.  Very frequently, it is normal to be one of the only, if the only aircraft on a controller&apos;s frequency later at night.  This was the case this evening, as the airlines and other traffic were being vectored or vectoring themselves well north of the gulf coast area.  The two pilots were about to enter what is an MOA or a Military Operations Area.  The name of the MOA was either the Moody 3 MOA, or the Moody 2 South MOA which are both located over southeastern Georgia, but the witness can&apos;t remember as to which one it was.  These areas are a type of airspace mainly used for military aircraft training purposes, or other types of military activity.  When one of them is active or what we call &quot;hot&quot; it is normal for aircraft to be vectored around them via Air Traffic Control.  This was not the case that night, as the MOA was reported &quot;cold&quot; by Atlanta Center after the pilots queried ATC.  It is not illegal to enter these areas, for they are not prohibited or restriced airspace.  Suddenly, prior to entering the MOA, ATC informed the pilots that their aircraft would go out of radio contact for the next 5 minutes.  This is fairly common, especially along the gulf coast during this active hurricane season when transmitters have often been hit.  Soon after radio contact was allegedly &quot;lost&quot; with Atlanta Center, the pilots both said they saw a light, like a strobe or beacon, similar to that of another airplane, not far in front of them at a distance of 3 miles or less.  As it began getting closer, the two pilots became nervous as ATC normally informs aircraft within that close of a vicinity to one another.  Suddenly, the object began to move rapidly in a way that known aircraft don&apos;t move, darting to the right, then straight up, then back left in right angles.  It got close to them, then suddenly sped away at what seemed to be thousands of miles an hour.  The pilots then conferred with one another as to whether they should try to contact Atlanta Center and ask about what they saw.  Since it seemed that their safety was at stake, they decided to make the attempt.  The following is an aproximation of what was said: (I am making up the call-sign in order to once again protect both of the witnesses identities) Witness: &quot;Atlanta Center, 123 Alpha Romeo&quot; (short pause) Atlanta Center: &quot;123 Alpha Romeo, go ahead&quot; Witness: &quot;Atlanta Center, do you possibly have any traffic up ahead of us at our 12 o&apos;clock?&quot; (almost immediately and seemingly aggravated) Atlanta Center: &quot;3 Alpha Romeo, negative I have nothing ahead of you.&quot; Witness: &quot;Roger, 3 Alpha Romeo&quot; The witnesses never saw the object again and had an uneventful duration of the flight.  They both found it peculiar that Atlanta Center would report going out of radio contact, but when asked about traffic ahead got a very rapid and aggravated response.  Upon arriving in Jacksonville, both witnesses met up with me and described the event.  After discussing it with them, we&apos;ve come up with our own conclusion:  It was probably something military in nature, possibly top secret or a black-project aircraft but we can&apos;t be sure.  We also think that Atlanta Center knew it was there, and wasn&apos;t supposed to give any traffic advisories while the object passed through his airspace.

I looked to the South and saw seven enormous, bright light, amber orbs (spherical)  in the southern direction of the night sky.  They appeared to be in a line formation from our angle.  They appeared to be stationary or hover at a high altitude.  I think we were watching for 5 minutes maybe even a little longer before I thought to note the mile marker that we just passed, 82.

It was too high to be a streetlight, but I thought that it could possibly be an indicator fr airplanes.  Regardless, I was transfixed.  As I drove closer, expecting to find the pole to which it was attached, it seemed to drop in the sky.  I assumed this was just spacial relation due to my coming nearer, but it dropped vertically in the sky and gradually moved across Michigan Avenue as I was driving straight ahead.  Driving under it, I simply could not take my eyes of it. If it had been a plane, it was flying unusually low, and had a very strange shape.  Given that I&apos;ve seen many planes flying at night, and the constancy of this objects light (as opposed to the strobe action of planes), this was not a plane.  So enthralled by the hovering craft, that just seemed to linger over the building opposite the side it just crossed, I pulled off to the shoulder and tried not to let it leave my sight.  In the time between me taking my seatbelt off and clamboring to the passenger window, it was gone.  One of the strange things I noticed about this was my inability to identify just how close it was.  As I got closer to its location above me, I could differentiate it from a mass of really bright light, into a grouping of lights that centered a greenish/blue light.  I thought that it could be some remote control objectt because I was stumped as to how close it was, and what it was doing.  There is no possible way that could have a plane.  The brightness of the light, the motion, and my inability to identify anything at all common about that object tell me one thing - I witnessed something incredibly out of the ordinary.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Though I cannot remember the exact d/t, based upon where our lives were at the time, I do know that it had to be fall of the academic year 2002-2003. I had just picked up my daughter at around 5:15 or so, and we were heading home to Blue Lake via Jane&apos;s Road/Guintoli Road in the northern reaches of Arcata, CA. (in a development area called Valley West).  The sun had set, the sky  was darkening to a deep purple, but there was still enough sky light that the hills to the northeast were clearly silhouetted, with some slope details still visible.  There were a very few stars starting to show the skylight combined with a hazy sky allowed only the very brightest to emerge at that time.  It was this paucity of stars that brought my attention to the lights. We were heading north, approaching the point where Jane&apos;s Rd curves east to become Guintoli, when I noticed a formation of 4 very bright stars over the hills just northeast of us.  As we began climbing the overpass that Guintoli takes over US 101, I could see these stars more clearly and thought that there was something odd.  I interpreted them as a familiar constellation made peculiar by the selective manner in which the atmospheric conditions permitted its bright stars to appear earlier than the rest.  Honestly, I thought I was looking at the Big Dipper, but only its brightest components.  Still, they were preternaturally bright and they didn&apos;t seem high enough in the sky to be the Dipper.  I grew very puzzled and unsure of what I was looking at.  I called my daughter&apos;s attention to the &quot;stars.&quot; Apparently she had already noticed them and was also trying to figure out what they were. Unfortunately, there was no place to pull over and observe.  However, we got the definite impression that these &quot;stars,&quot; these lights, were moving.  What other real stars we could see were not near enough to confirm this.  Our direction was toward the lights, with those northeast hills between us and them, so there was not much in the way of lateral relative motion, making absolute motion easier to detect.  Since I was driving, I couldn&apos;t watch steadily, but my daughter could.  She was able to tell, after a little while, that they were  moving as a solid group as if in formation.  There was a stop sign along our route, and we were able to briefy watch them, and yes, they were definately moving in a northerly direction, perhaps somewhat east of north since they seem to be moving inland slightly. There is an airport in a town not far to the north (McKinleyville), and I thought maybe we were seeing some kind of commercial aircraft or maybe something being flown by the Coast Guard which has its Air Station next door to the airport.  We dismissed these possibilities after watching while paused at the stop.  These lights did not flash nor pulse, and they were large, opaque, globular, almost solid looking, if light can be said to look solid.  Their color was a brilliant white, no other colors, no prismatic effects, no bluish or reddish hue, just white like wedding cake frosting.  They were not phosphorescent or neon-like, not fluorescent, but more like incandescent, though that&apos;s not quite right either.  They did not twinkle, nor dance, nor do any of the things that starlight does under atmospheric influence, they were dead steady.  In size, they appeared to be slightly larger than a large bright planet, Jupiter, on one its closer approaches, maybe, but clearer, with more well-defined edges.Since we were travelling in a car, we don&apos;t know if they emitted a sound.We proceeded on through the interesection, and I began looking for a place I could pull over to watch the lights.  We turned off Guintoli onto State 299 (the hwy we would take home), trying to keep the lights in view.  The lights&apos; altitude was low enough and our relative positions and vectors were such that those hills rapidly got in the way.  As we were passing the lights (yes, rapid paralax changes also clued us in to just how close and low the lights really were), seeking a way off the road, one light suddenly disengaged itself from the formation and arced over its neighbor in a smooth curve.  Before we could see the final shape of the maneuver and the resulting formation, the crest of the hills and its trees obscured our view completely.I swung off onto a side road that would take us back the way we came, got back onto 101, and headed north toward the neighboring town, McKinleyville.  I had hoped that since the lights were heading more or less north and didn&apos;t seem to be in a big hurry, that we could pick them up again and watch them some more.  Unfortunately, by the time I had gotten back to 101, the lights were gone, either too far to the east to see past the hills, or they simply disappeared like these things have a tendency to do. I was so excited that I phoned by son as soon as we got home.  He sees odd lights and objects all the time, so I knew he&apos;d be interested in this.  As it turned out, he and his girlfriend had seen two simliar lights over Eureka just minutes before we first spotted our lights over north Arcata/Valley West.  This is why I put 4 witnesses in parentheses, if they were the same lights, then four of us saw them, not just two. According to him and his girlfriend, they were in my mom&apos;s back yard watching the sunset.  The house is in west-central Eureka.  Not long after the sun had disappeared, his girlfriend noticed an odd bright light approaching from, if I remember right, the west, and my son saw one coming in from the south. The sky was still fairly bright for them, and these lights were quite brilliant despite the light sky. Note: At this latitude, at that time of the year, there are no long lingering sunsets, the sun would have fallen to the horizon as if gut-shot and the sky darken within 15 minutes or less.  That means their sighting could not have preceded ours by more than a quarter hour.  The two lights approached each other, one fell in behind the other, and both continued on in a northerly direction, heading toward Humboldt Bay, which lies between Eureka and Arcata. These sounded like two of the very same lights that my daughter and I observed.  We surmised that they picked up two other companions somewhere between Eureka and north Arcata, and continued on north/northeast where we saw them disappear into the hills which skirt the eastern frontage of our coastal towns. If you look on a map of northern Califormia, you will see that Eureka, Humboldt Bay, Arcata, and McKinleyville line the coast only a few miles from each other.  I will try to create a map of our sighting and mail it to you. Our family has had a lot of weird sightings and other &quot;paranormal&quot; events.  I&apos;ve often thought of writing them all down and sending them to someone doing research into these things who is looking for raw data, but I wouldn&apos;t know who to send them to.  I found your sight while looking for information on anomalous sky flashes such as the one our area experienced last Sunday.  (That has been explained, apparently, there were distant witnesses who saw a bolide).  If you would be interested in any other reports for your stats or whatever, let me know.  One thing I would like to know is if you received any reports of these same lights from this general area, or points north of here.  There was nothing in our local paper and I&apos;ve not heard of anyone else who saw them.  My son is wondering if this isn&apos;t an example of the &quot;Pearl Necklace&quot; that has been seen in times past.Thank you.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I approached the object as I was driving in my car again and could see it quite some distance away behind the nearby trees.  I drove past the trees into the clearing where I could get a good view of the object.  When the object came into clear view I started to wonder if what I was looking at could possibly be a planet, because it was much too large to be a star.  No sooner did I have this thought in my mind when the object quickly faded out (as if someone had quickly turned off a dimmer switch) There were no clouds nearby in the sky that could have hidden this light.The sighting only lasted for about 10 to 15 seconds this time, but what really bothered me about this particular sighting is that I had the feeling that this object knew that I was looking at it.In my last report I suggested this light could possibly be a helicopter. I firmly believe at this time, that the light/object is not a helicopter. I don&apos;t know what the light is, but for some reason it seems to be hovering around this one particular spot in the country...as far as I can tell, there seems to be nothing but farms and fields in this area.I&apos;m reporting this sighting in case someone else in this area or other areas may have seen what I have seen. I&apos;m not sure what it is, but it just doesn&apos;t look like anything that I&apos;ve seen in the sky before and it certainly doesn&apos;t act like any sort of familiar aircraft.", "Bright blue lights in the night sky above downtown Seattle.At a large party at a downtown Seattle loft, I and many people were on a rooftop veranda enjoying the mostly clear night sky.  I looked up and noticed what I thought was an airplane but as I stared at it, it was a brilliant blue light that was not blinking.  I stared at it for quite a while and noticed it would not blink, stay still for a bit, then move in one direction for a bit and then disappear. Seconds later another bright blue-tinted light would appear in another section of the sky; maybe the difference between 12 o&apos;clock and 2 o&apos;clock. I asked others to look up and see if they saw the same thing.  They all agreed they were not airplanes or satellites.  There were probably as many as three at one time but they kept popping up and disappearing.

It was the last 10 minutes of a 3 hour drive from Cinci where I&apos;d been living for the last 6 months or so, travelling back to Toledo for what *I think* was Thanksgiving. It was dusk, the sun had already set, but the sky was still somewhat illuminated.  Off to the right at about a 45 degree angle I notice 3 balls of light, each of which were somewhat stationary, rapidly changing colors from blue to green to orange to red to white, etc.  About 1 second later the balls started rapidly moving small distances (which seemed like them &quot;revving up&quot; as if they were getting ready to partake in a celestial drag race) and proceeded to zip into the sky, out of sight in a fraction of a second. Others were in front of and behind me on the road, as well as automobiles travelling in the opposite direction, so others probably witnessed the same thing. I feel like this is probably the most important thing I&apos;ve ever witnessed in my life.  I&apos;m 110% certain these were definitely not of our world.

As I was driving north I was approaching a development called Weinkeeg Valley Estate and I saw these lights that were in a single row, stacked vertically, flashing on and off like the ones on a broadcasting tower.  I remember thinking to myself that there was no tower here so what is that? I started to drive by but for some reason my curiosity got the better of me and I stopped my vehicle and backed up.  There was no other traffic on the road at that time so I got out to have a better look.  As I stared at the lights I became aware of faint round windows arranged in between the lights.  If my memory serves me well I believe there were two lights above and two below with the windows, more like port holes, running horizontally.  To my amazement I noticed that the portholes were indicating a round surface as they went from round to elliptical at the edges. I still had no clue as to what I was looking at until it very quietly drifted away over the tree tops. This oblect was no more than 75 feet from the ground and directly over a small home.  I seem to recall a soft humming sound and nothing else.  It wasn&apos;t a helecopter, no noise, no rotors beating the air, nothing conventional that would explain what I was looking at.  It just floated away in total silence.  I would estimate that the diameter of the craft was about 30-40 feet.  It was so dark in color that despite being less than 200 feet away I could not see its form.  It could have been a sphere for all I know.  I honestly could not see a shape to this thing at all. All of this happened in the early 80&apos;s and I never forgot it.  All my life I wanted to see a UFO and when I got the chance to I had no clue as to what I was looking at until it was gone.  I have never seen anything again up that close but I sure would like to relive that CE one more time and have the chance to really observe a chance of a lifetime.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

As we stopped for a few seconds, I looked up at the sky, which is my habit to do. At about 75 degrees up from the horizon, I saw what looked like a small star emerge from another, larger star...this was probably an illusion,as I believe the smaller object simply passed in front of the larger one. But it was this emerging that got my attention. I thought, &quot;Cool...a satellite&quot;, as the small object moved from west to east. I then noticed the quality of its illumination, which seemed to be more of a glow as opposed to reflected light or from an incandescent source. I watched it for about 4 or 5 seconds, as it moved at what seemed to be a believable speed for a satellite(don&apos;t really know, as I am not familiar with this enough to know for certain), when it came to a complete stop.  While stopped, it remained the size it had been (a bit larger than pin head), so I do not think it was coming more in my direction, but was at a standstill.  If I had held a ruler up to the sky along the path it traveled, it would have gone a few inches over a foot, in a straight line, before stopping. After a second or 2, it bolted in a more northerly direction...this was at about a 30 degree angle to its stopped position, and moving at least 4 times as fast as it had been ( I say this as it appeared to cover as much space going in this new direction in a little over a second as it did when moving in the beginning of my sighting, which lasted 5 seconds).  As it bolted away, it never seemed to get any closer to the horizon, which also struck me as a bit odd.  It remained very visible, and then, it was gone.

At first I thought of discounting it as just a bright planet in the sky, but the brightness of the object was much brighter than any planet could have been. The object was so bright that it gave of a white aura; perhaps haze in the atmosphere. We were in the car when we spotted it. The object appeared to be located over a nearby national gaurd base -- Stewart Air National Gaurd base in Newburgh, New York. It was in the south western sky about 30 degrees above the horizon line. As soon as we got out of the car we rushed to see the object. At this point we could verify it was a UFO. It was seemingly stationary like a planet or star would be, but when standing still and comparing it to a stationary object (tree -- there was no wind) it verifiably moved ever so slightly. We got a telescope and further verified the object. We could also verify its movement -- not that of a normal star, plane helicopter or balloon. It moved left to right and differed in distance at times. The object was circular with three quadrents. It appeared to morph in shape as we looked at it. The object was white through the telescope and had a dark center to it at times, sort of like a donut. The three quadrents pulsed with different color lights to the naked eye and through the telescope. The three quadrents gave it a trianular shape to the naked eye, but in the telescope the object appeared spherical. The object also had a forcefield like quality to it. the white light would shimmer and shift like plasma or some form of energetic matter. At one point there were other lights, which some of us thought were planes circling around the object. At another point a verifiable plane flew directly in front of the object -- keep in mind this was in close proximity, if not over an air base. The object was in the sky for about an hour from the initial time we spotted it. Then after being in aproximately the same proximity for about an hour, flew off out of telescopic and naked eye range.

It simply vanished after five minutes. The object was brilliant white and seemed to &quot;hang&quot; and twinkle.  Some slight motion seemed to happen, but this could have been my eyes.  No shape was discernable, though it was not point-like. it seemed to have planet-like girth. I know the night sky well and for a brief second thought it could be Polaris (was in the same general direction) but it was still too light out and no other stars were visible.  When it vanished, I knew something unusual was up.  It was not moving like a satellite, though I cannot rule out a large geo-synchronous object of some sort (ISS?) This could be checked I suppose. It seemed to be lower than a star.  I can&apos;t say that for sure of course, but it appeared &quot;inside&quot; the atmosphere.  I do not have the ability to judge altitude.  The sky was perfectly clear and a few planes flew near it but made no approach.  After it disappeared, an old bomber looking plane flew over.  That was unusual but may have no bearing whatsoever on the sighting. For the record, it was NOT Venus or any other planet.  Wrong side of the sky, way outside the orbital plane.  I&apos;m only making this report because this was an unusal event and perhaps other people saw it...((NUFORC Note:  Given the witness&apos;s experience with viewing the nighttime sky, we agree with his assessment that the object almost certainly could not have been a celestial body, i.e. a star or planet.

PD))", "Bright, white light moving horizontally/vertically visible from I-495/I-95S in Northern VirginiaBefore I begin, I would like to qualify myself just a little.  I am an experienced aviator with more than 12 years of flying experience.  Over my flying career, I&apos;ve seen several things most people would believe to be UFOs, but my experienced eye can immediately &quot;debunk&quot; (e.g. bright planet on the horizon, aircraft landing lights in clouds, etc.)  What I saw last night is not easily &quot;debunkable.&quot;  1)  Date/Time: October 26, 2005, 1850-1930 E.S.T.2)  Witnesses:  Myself, but there have to be others.3)  Weather: Clear skies with broken clouds at approximately 2000-6000 feet.4)  Narrative of Event:  At 1850, I was traveling south on the &quot;outer loop&quot; of the Washington, D.C., Beltway (I-495) heading towards I-95 south.  After passing the exit for US-50, a strange light configuration in the sky came into view on the right side of the highway (to the west or southwest) and it caught my attention. I could clearly make out the lighting pattern of a helicopter and to the left of it were two white lights that were too far away from the helicopter to be attached to it but seemed to be keeping pace with it.  The aviator in me immediately wondered if the helo was flying in formation with another aircraft, and if so that sure was a weird lighting configuration.  The helicopter was moving towards the highway ahead of me at an altitude of about 1000 feet or so, and the two lights remained in perfect formation with it. As I got closer to the helo (I was travelling at about 70 MPH), it was just crossing over the highway.  I rolled down my window and could hear the sound of its rotor blades and could briefly see portions of the fuselage of the helo illuminated by ground lights and its own rotating beacon.  It appeared to be a Blackhawk helo, but between watching the road and looking at it I couldn&apos;t make a positive identification. What kept me focused on it was the two weird, white lights to the left of it.  As it crossed over the highway just in front of me, I couldn&apos;t make any sense out of what the two white lights were.  If they were attached to another aircraft there was no visible fuselage, and I continued to watch as the helo and the lights crossed the highway in perfect formation.  At the point when it was closest to me, I was able to discern that the two white lights were not part of an aircraft or the helo, but instead seemed to be just &quot;floating&quot; in the sky next to the helo in perfect formation.  I then lost visual contact with helo and the white lights because of trees along the left (eastern) side of the road. In my mind I thought, &quot;Hmmm, they must have been hauling something underneath or trailing wires of some kind with safety lights so other aircraft wouldn&apos;t hit them.  I put it out of my mind and focused my full attention on driving again.  I noticed my speed had dropped to 55 while I was watching the helo and some cars had stacked up behind me. I increased my speed back to 70 and kept driving.  In my mind I just thought &quot;Wow, that was kind of weird,&quot; and I more or less put it out of my mind.  A few minutes later (1855 or so), I was travelling SE on I-495, and when I was near the exit for 620 (Brook Hill Road) a new, bright, white light appeared in the sky to the right (SW of my position) of the road and immediately began to drop straight down. Being an aviator who had just seen a helicopter, I immediately thought &quot;Wow, they&apos;re dropping flares now, I wonder what&apos;s going on.&quot;  Keeping my eyes on the light, I watched as it dropped straight down with an increasing rate of speed.  As I watched it fall I thought &quot;Wow, that&apos;s pretty bright for a flare.  If that&apos;s a helo&apos;s landing light, he&apos;s auto-rotating and he&apos;s going to crash!&quot;  I then thought that perhaps it was a meteor burning up in the atmosphere, or perhaps I&apos;ve just got a weird angle on an aircraft approaching Dulles airport from the south.  What I saw next is very difficult to explain in terms of my aviation experience. After falling straight down for about 5-7 seconds at an increasingly fast rate of speed, the white light just stopped (on a dime) and became stationary in the sky.  12 years of aviation experience immediately told me that was no helicopter, and certainly not a flare.  Meteors burn up and the light extinguishes.  I couldn&apos;t explain how the light just stopped after dropping straight down vertically.  The light remained stationary for quite some time. As I drove on, I-495 got closer to I-95 south and I had intermittent visibilty with the bright, white light.  During about a 10 second period of visibilty I was able to clearly discern that the light had started moving horizontally to the south.  I-495 was now taking me SE to almost E, and I lost visual contact with the light. It took me a few minutes to get to I-95S because of traffic and once I got onto I-95S, I checked the time and it was 1905.  I was looking for the light after I got out from behind the sound barrier walls on the sides of the roads, and immediately regained visual contact with the light.  It was now clearly moving horizontally to the south and would stop for short periods of time then continue moving.  The way it was moving didn&apos;t seem quite right for it to be a helo.  It would go fast, then slow, then fast again.  Sometimes it would drop straight down for a second or two, then continue moving horizontally.  (A key point here: I never saw it move straight up!)  I was now travelling S-SW on I-95S and I scanned the horizon for aircraft.  I could clearly make out 2 low flying helicopters.  One was to my left (east) and another to my right (west).  I could see other aircraft flying at much higher altitudes, but the prominent feature in the sky was the bright, white light to the SW of me. Using my fist, I checked the distance from the ground to the horizon and made a note that  the white light was about 15 degrees up from the horizon.  It began to move south again and I wanted to follow it.  I got off of I-95S and went west on Prince William parkway to try and follow the light. The light then became stationary again.  I knew there was a Wal-Mart nearby and that I could park and look at the light from there, so I went to the Wal-Mart parking lot at 1400 Worth Ave, Woodbridge, VA and got out of my truck to look at the light. I keep a pair of binoculars in my truck (I&apos;m a country boy) and I took them out to look at the light.  I focused on the light which was stationary again and all I could make out was that it was white, bright, and fairly large.  It remained stationary for so long I began to think that I must be just making something out of nothing.  Perhaps it was just a bright planet or star on the horizon and the fact I was moving when I was watching/following it is what made me think it was moving. I was about to just write it off as an overactive imagination when I looked at it again through the binoculars and it slowly moved horizontally out of my field of view.  Thinking that perhaps it was me, I spread my legs shoulder width apart, stood firmly and regained the light in my field of view.  I was not moving, IT WAS.  It then dropped straight down out of my field of view, and when I regained it, it was stationary again. At this point, it was almost 1930 and I had been drinking coffee during my drive.  I had to go into Wal-Mart ((deleted)).  I put the binoculars away and walked (at a fast pace) into Wal-Mart.  The light was visible in the sky to the SW the entire time I was walking in.  What struck me as odd, was that no one was looking at it or noticing it, and having seen everything I had just seen I thought &quot;Wow, there really could be UFO activity over a populated area and most average citizens wouldn&apos;t even notice!&quot; I went into Wal-Mart, used the restroom quickly, and when I came back out the light was no longer visible in the sky to the SW of Wal-Mart.  I looked for it on the horizon but couldn&apos;t find it anywhere.  I went back to my truck, got out my binoculars, and scanned the sky visually and with the binos waiting for it to reappear.  While I was waiting for it to reappear, I noticed there were two aircraft flying high-enough that I couldnt&apos; hear them and in a tight formation (that appeared to be military) flying SW. The light never reappeared, and due to all the buildings and ground-based lights I realized I couldn&apos;t really see much anyway.  I got in my truck and left at 1945.", "Flash lighting entire skylineWife and I were driving eastbound on State highway 36 about 15 miles east of Red Bluff, Ca. when we saw a flash that lit up the entire eastern skyline.

He continued to watch the formation of lights in an attempt to identify what type of aircraft they were.  As he continued driving W, he realized the formation (described as sort of a diamond shape) wasn&apos;t moving, but just hung in the sky at approx 35-40 degrees elevation.  Since he was driving, he couldn&apos;t remain visually fixed on the formation, and after approx 10 mins of glancing while driving, he glanced back and realized the lights were no longer there.  He did not see them depart, but claims he had only looked away from the formation to the road a matter of a few seconds.Witness 2 was also driving W-bound on Hwy 98 near Navarre and observed a similar formation of lights.  He at first assumed they were AFSOC helos on a night training mission, but after several minutes of driving realized his helos were still there, in the same angular, diamond-like formation, and the lights continued to hold position, hovering at what appeared to be very high altitude.  He said as he continued his drive W he doubted his helicopter formation theory more and more, especially when the formation broke apart.  He described the formation break as a one-by-one realignment into almost a straight line, with some decending and some ascending, then the light on the far end of the formation suddenly veered away from the others and vanished.  This pattern of breakaway continued for the next minute, until all the lights were gone.  He has no explanation as to the source of the lights, but is very familiar with flares and other air-ordnance which could cause illumination, and stated &quot;These lights were under controlled guidance.&quot; Witness 3 was driving N on Hwy 87 after turning from it&apos;s intersection w/Hwy 98.  He witnessed &quot;several bright lights&quot; through the trees off to the western sky.  He at first thought they were stars or planets, but as he got more glimpses through the trees, he said he realized they were &quot;way too bright&quot; to be either stars or planets.  He then also assumed they were a formation of helos doing night ops, and didn&apos;t pay much more attention until he turned W-bound off Hwy 87 onto East Bay Rd just south of Holley.  That was when he saw the lights better and re-evaluated them as &quot;unknown.&quot;  He only saw them for a minute or less after turning onto East Bay Rd before each light &quot;took off like a bat outta hell&quot; and the lights winked off, one by one.  He said he believes there were four or five lights in all.None of the above three Air Force flyers reported seeing other aircraft in the sky during their incidents, and all three reported the times at somewhere between 18:30 and 18:50, lasting from 5-10 mins in duration.((NUFORC Note:  Dates of the sightings may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

He spent many moments in deep though no doubt trying to explain to himself but after several days i asked him and he said it must have been a weather baloon or something.

They flew in patterns, almost parallel at times, and other times in more opposite figure eight-like patterns.  They most interesting thing they did was occasionally &quot;collide&quot;, after which they would ricochet apart and fly randomly until they got back into some kind of pattern.  We were not afraid, because they appeared almost &quot;playful&quot; in nature.  There were no sounds that we could hear.  In addition, there was a strange flashing behind four clouds, which were close together.

Four of us ran out to the front porch to see bright neon blue smoke in the sky with electricity arcing over the blue hue about 1 1/2 blocks away.

We could see 4 bright white round lights - not blinking, bright as car headlights. They were a diamond shape. It was narrow in the middle, long on the ends - basically an elongated diamond, maybe somewhat of the chevron shape.  The lights headed in a southern direction.  We live less than 1 mile from the beach and these lights were over the ocean.  The explosion had knocked all the power out in a 4-6 block radius.

One of the people ran the station and some friends would often come by at night to pass the time.  This station was on Woodbridge Avenue and led up to a town about two and a half miles away.  At that time the Raritan Arsenal was on the east side of the road and there was a strip of woods about a half a mile wide owned by the arsenal running up to the  the town on the other side of the road.  They saw a light go down in the woods and he closed the station down.  They drove up there and told everyone for about a week that they saw a flying saucer on the side of a service road.  Then, very oddly, if anyone asked about it, they would deny knowing anything about it.  They had spoken to the FBI, and maybe this had something to do with it.I was sriving down this road some time after this, and the traffic was stalled.  At some point I saw an MP directing traffic in the  road and thought to myself that this was the place were those people saw that thing.  The army had the woods there roped off and a tracter trailer on the side of the road.  Some time after this I was shooting my shotgun back there and walked into a field and thought for a moment that I was standing where there had been a fire, probabley in the summer, fires being common from people sitting back there and throwing cigarettes out the window.  But I then saw that there was a smooth edge to the area and the grass was not burnt but scortched, and I was standing on the edge of a circular area about a hundred feet across, with all the bushes, mostly blueberry and about six or eight feet tall and everything else crushed down.

I was facing easterly, so the path was roughly south to north. The light was far, far brighter than the landing lights, anti-collision lights, or navigation lights on any aircraft I have ever seen.  I have witnessed dozens of &quot;shooting stars&quot; over my house as recently as the shower this summer, and it did not, in any way resemble the intensity, path, or time that a meteor has.  The light extinguished instantly as if it was turned off, and did not appear to burn out as a meteor does. I don&apos;t know what else to say-  I am baffled enough to write this.  I hope someone else in Connecticut saw this event and may shed some light on it.((NUFORC Note:  The ISS was not visible from Guilford on this date, at this time.

We were anchored off the Northwest corner of Norman Island. The night was very clear and all of the stars were extremly bright.  As I was laying in my berth looking out of the hatch, an object appeared.  It was oval in shape and had 2 sets of white lights around the outer edge.  It moved from North to South. After the object passsed by the first hatch I sat up and looked through the secong as it passed by that one.  I moved to the deck area to find it continuing South until it was out of sight. It was difficult to determine the size as it was diffcult to determine how high it was.  I do believe that it could have been perhaps 20,000-30,000 feet or more determining the speed that it was moving.", "Rectangular bright craft on Hwy 139 From Monroe to Bastrop,LA.Leaving Monroe, LA, around dusk on Hwy 139,This was seen in the East appearing to be only just above the treetops.

Their were three familys, myself and two of my freinds all lovers of beach fishing.I will explain that my two friends both in their forties were sensible, ordinary family men, not into making up stories.  we usually went fishing together, but on this night we were going to meet on the beach at different times, one of my freinds Bob was the first to leave, a bit later the second friend John left we were all going to meet on the beach,a beach usually  pitch black at night. I was the last go to the beach. I drove on to the beach hoping to find Bob and John but I was unable to find them, so I left to go back to my caravan on the way back up the beach I came across Bobs car high up on a sand dune  but Bob was no where to be seen.When I got back I found Bob at the caravan site looking pale and shaking,He said he was fishing on the beach when he saw a light out on the water, said at that point he was not really concerned, as he was fishing he noticed the light getting closer to the beach but up from him, This light which he described as like a light from a helicopter travelling just above the water but no sound,the light eventually came closer to him, again it was out from him, but within casting distance.He said he was not too concerned, had not got a clue what it was but carried on fishing anyway.He said he started to get scared when as he tried to cast his line out, it the fishing line kept dropping at his feet, his line would consist of one  large hook and a lead weight. He tried casting several times but with the same result, feeling a bit nervous at this point he started to panic when the light started to come towards him, he jumped in his car and drove away as fast as he could, thats how he ended up in the sand dunes, when my other friend john returned a short time later he relayed a similar story. They were fishing seperataly as they could not find each other in the dark. Does this mean it was a UFO I dont know, but whatever energy was coming from the light source was repelling lead weights. Not wanting to look foolish they made discreet enquirys with the locals asking such questions as ,has anyone ever noticed anything strange on the beach late at night. But apart from telling them that their was a lot of spanish Galleons wrecked on the cliffs, and people sometimes say they can hear the screams of the dying. But that of course is just local folklore.It has facinated me to this day and I am so disappointed I missed out on that experience, of course I would have been just os scared as my friends were.I was just curious to know has anything similar ever happened to anyone else?((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I told several other people to look up in the sky and they all agreed that it was not a plane nor a mylar ballon (object was shaped like a mylar balloon).

I was 10 years old in 1988 and I remember my mom running in the house saying she just saw a UFO!  She was very excited and she told my brother and sister and I all about it.  Then, we watched the news at 10:00 and it said there had been sightings of UFOs in many states that night.  That night started my interests in UFOs and I was browsing your reports and found the report of a person in Belle, Missouri, on October 15, 1988, that had seen the same thing!  I immediately got chills and called my mom.  She told me to write you because she always knew there had to be other people that saw it and also did not agree with it being &quot;space junk&quot; as the government claimed.  She was on a dirt road coming home from taking a friend home when she seen a &quot;giant&quot; dark object in the distance.  Her first instinct told her it was a blimp.  As it got closer she realized it was too big to be a blimp.  She pulled over her car and got out.  She told me &quot;I have no idea why I pulled over by myself on a dark country road because any other time I would be too scared, but I was so amazed at the size that I was almost in a trance.&quot;  She said it was very very slow and did not make one single sound.  She didn&apos;t see any lights like the report from Belle except what looked like one light on the rear.  Also it was very low (too low to be a plane)  She watched it for 10-15 minutes until it had gone over some mountains.  She told me today that even though it was 17 years ago she remembers it like it was yesterday and she could still sit down and draw a picture of it.  My mom is a quiet woman and does not cause trouble,  but she has always disagreed that it was pieces of a Russian rocket falling through the atmosphere (one of the governments explanations)   She said whatever she saw was definately flying.  Not falling.  She does not have a computer therefore she has asked to write you.  I know it has been a long time since it happened but My mom could never find anyone who seen the same thing that night until I read the report from Belle Missouri.

I am writing to you about a very strange sighting I saw around my house about a year ago and that my younger brother saw October 26th 2005. In the mid summer of 2004 I was driving home from work and it was around 12:00 in the morning. Living in a fairly rural area with fields and forests all my life I am accustomed to seeing the occasional deer, fox or if I am lucky Moose. On that night I came around the corner of my street and saw in the light of my neighbours driveway two upright beings that stood at around 7-8 feet tall and did not appear to be clothed.  At first I thought it was my neighbours walking at night, but when I saw the height, I was surprised and the their walking movement was much different then that of a human being. Consequently I was a bit nervous, but as I turned the corner and had them in full view they walked into my neighbour&apos;s driveway out of sight. As I came by my neighbour&apos;s house the two beings were no where to be seen, there is a 16 foot cedar hedge and large overgrown field next to my neighbors that&apos;s where I think they may have gone.  Once I came home I recounted the situation to my family and haven&apos;t really thought much of it since then. Tonight, the night of the 26th of October 2005, my father asked my brother to bring the garbage out at around 9:30.  To my surprise he came running to my room out of breath and recounted what he had seen in front of my neighbours driveway.  To my surprise his sighting sounded very similar to mine accept for the fact that he only saw one being and not two. I feel kind of stupid and I have spoken to my girlfriend about it and she just laughed at me, but I know what I saw and I feel kind of stuck because no one will believe me  accept my brother who has witnessed the same sighting.  So I came on to the internet and decided to look for places who studied aliens and other strange sightings as this and I came across your site and decided it would be best if I wrote to you about the situation. I am just wondering if anyone else has seen anything similar and if you have any explanations as to what my brother and I saw.  I would like to thank you very much for your time and hope to hear from you in the future. I remain. Contact me via e-mail.", "Bright spherical object seen hovering above hills of Angels CampOn Wednesday night, my wife hollered at me to come outside and see what it was she was looking at. I stepped out and immediately knew where to look.  I had been spotting bizarre lights in this area for months, and knew she was looking to the West.  Sure enough, this extremely bright ball of light was sitting in the sky.  It looked to be just above the hills between where we live and the town next to us, Copperopolis. I truly wanted to dismiss this thing as a star, but it was simply too bright.  I have never seen stars that bright.  I went back inside, grabbed my Sony video camcorder and taped this object for maybe 5 minutes.  It didn&apos;t do much at all, just hovering. I grew tired of it and went back inside. I came back minutes later to retrieve firewood and the object has vanished.  Looking at the tape later, I had zoomed in on the object and noted that it appeared to have a perfect round shape to it, except the 1/4 bottom half wasn&apos;t lit as much as the rest of the ball.  And there appeared to be a smaller object just above it.  Whether or not this 2nd object was a star,  I am not sure.

My wife was driving, I was sitting in the back seat driver side of the car next to my infant son&apos;s car seat.I noticed 2 flashing white lights approaching us in the sky from the west.  We are next to a military base and see plane&apos;s lights in the sky all the time.  I&apos;m an aircraft enthusiast and can make out aircraft by their lights at night.   At first I thought these were wingtip lights of an approaching plane, but these lights were flashing much faster than an aircraft&apos;s lights (almost like strobe lights) and not in the same pattern.  I also caught glimpse of a red light between the two white lights, but it was hard to make out with the rapid strobing.  My wife, who is not an enthusiast, even recognized it as something strange and said,&quot;What is that?&quot;  The two lights approached the highway and then came to a hover, not directly over it, but near it.  It was at an altitude of perhaps 500-750 feet.  I was still trying to figure out what it was, and said I thought it might be a helicopter, but I had seen helicopters at night, also, and this was not one.  We were still heading toward the craft and as we passed to the side and under it, another light came into view and it was recognizable as a triangular shape craft with a white light at each point.  The red light I had mentioned earlier was not at the center of the points, it was just blackness in the middle, so it must have been on the one side.  As we passed by it, I got a sort of panoramic view of the light formation and could approximate it&apos;s size to be that of slightly larger than the rotor radius of a newscopter type helicopter. I wish we had stopped, but we didn&apos;t as the highway was busy, and it went out of view behind us.

The night was mild for November and clear.  I paused to look up at the stars above the roof of my house.  Movement to the east caught my attention.  I looked east and there were 15-20 (best guess) objects flying very high, I would guess 30,000 feet, from east to west.  They may have been higher than that but I have no idea how large the craft were so I have nothing to base a better judgement on. They were in a line that formed north to south but it wasn&apos;t an organized line.  As they flew the line flucuated as to which &apos;craft&apos; was in the lead.  It reminded me of how a flock of geese act when they are trying to decide which will lead the flock until the V formation is made.  They were illuminated a blue/white but were high enough that I could not determine a shape.  They resembled small blueish stars.  Although they were flying at high altitude and a high rate of speed I was still able to stay focused on them from east to west.   At the rate they seemed to be traveling I would guess it was would have taken a very short time for them to cross the distance (east to west) of Illinois.  I heard no sound, either before I caught sight, during nor after.  I did not observe any contrails from them.  The illumination seemed steady, not flashing and only the blue/white hue.

Drove past and for some reason decided to turn around.  I turned my vehicle around and approached the area where the lights were located - again at a distance.  They were above an area that had a chain linked fence and was actually Aerojet property.  As I approached I noticed the outline of what appeared to be the outline of a bowl shaped figure.  As I brought my vehicle to a complete stop in the middle of the roadway, I noticed that the &quot;bowl shaped figure&quot; had begun to turn.  I focused upon the figure itself as it turned.  While my eyes were fixated on the figure at a distance, I suddenly and instantaneously sensed a very close presence.  Within the blink of an eye - the object that began it&apos;s turn at a distance completed it&apos;s turn two feet from the driver&apos;s side of my vehicle.  The object appeared to defy known physics and made absolutely no sound.  As it completed it&apos;s turn, several very bright lights came on.  I did not feel heat but the lights themselves were somewhat blinding.  Due to the closeness of the object to my vehicle and the lights - I could not see the object in it&apos;s entirety.  The portion of the object that I could see at that point, however, was not particularly bowl shaped but, rather, appeared somewhat rectangular and similiar to the front grill of a car (but much larger).  There were approximately a total of six lights- three on each side - that, again, were large and very bright.  When they went on - it was similiar to a &quot;lights, camera, action&quot; scenario where you see movie lights on a camera set turned on.  The object remained in the air and at it&apos;s lowest seemed suspended approximately one foot off the ground on the driver&apos;s side and at an angle.  The rear - that I could not see clearly - appeared  to be, perhaps, higher.  There was a window of sorts - somewhat similiar to the front window on a vehicle but smaller.  I detected movement from within but could not see anything clearly (and did not want to).  Initially I froze and then absolutely floored my vehicle in an attempt to get away.  As I swerved down the darkened two lane road, the object that was facing the driver&apos;s side of my vehicle turned with the lights remaining on and faced the back of my vehicle.  I watched it in my rearview mirror - fearing that it would follow.  It did not but, rather, turned once again, in the opposite direction.  I drove to Hwy 50 (nearby) and took some comfort in the fact that I was surrounded by other (known) vehicles.  To my left, however, as I drove a stretch of 50 heading home - I looked to my left and could see the lights of a very, very low flying object - flying parallel to me and at a distance.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I know the chances of a UFO sighting is rare, and I know that multiple encounters almost never happen. But I beleive this is due to the fact that simply no one is looking up or noticing what is around them everyday. I felt compelled to seek this site out and tell my stories since my latest sighting is the third within 48 hours. But I have had several encounters with these objects over the past 10 years. I will explain below. I will start with the first of the three sightings this week:  Sighting 1 -  On 11/17/05 at approximately 18:35 while driving east on Tellico Pkwy in Lenoir City,TN I noticed two extremely bright lights hovering approximately 200-300ft. over the lake. This was a familiar site to me as I&apos;ve seen it before, so I pulled into the next boatdock that happened to be within site of the object. I watched as the object slowly creep across the lake and change direction several times before flying over the hills. I also noticed that it seemed to be purposely  staying away from the houses.  Sighting 2 - At precisely 22:50 that same evening, while sitting at a traffic light near the Wal-Mart/Home Depot plaza in Lenoir City TN at , adjacent to the highway in a field I noticed the two extremely bright lights again slowly hovering approximately 200-300ft off of the ground. The traffic light turned green but since there was only one other car on the road, I decided to sit and watch this object. I rolled down the window to hear a faint &quot;shooosh&quot; sound coming from the craft. It continued to slowly make it&apos;s way torwards me but the veered off away from me right before passing over. I turned my vehicle around and decided to try follow the slow moving craft, but in an instant, the craft quicky accelerated out of sight. Sighting 3 - Earlier this morning,at precisely 5:42, I was heading east over Ft.Loudoun Dam in Lenoir City TN, when I notice the object hovering over the lake approx 300yds off the highway. Again it was very low to the surface. I pulled off to watch for approximately 1 min before the craft did a perfect 360 and headed north. As I said before, I&apos;ve had multiple sightings of what I believe is this very same type of craft. My very first sighting was approximately 10 years ago in Loudon out in the country. I&apos;m guessing the time was around 22:00 - 23:00 and noticed the craft slopwly moving across the top of the treeline. I immediately knew this wasn&apos;t your everyday airplane. I followed the best I could with what roads I could find to lead me in the same direction. This went on for about 10 minutes. I managed to get within a few hundred yards of the object, but eventually lost it. My next sighting would prove to be the best to date. It about 5 years ago. I was driving west on Hwy 72 in Monroe County leaving Vonore TN. It was approx. 23:00 - 24:00 When topping a hill I noticed a tractor trailer heading my direction violently swerve over the yellow line. I slowed to see what was up when I ten saw the craft about 400 yds in front of me hovering 100ft over the highway. I assume the truck driver was seeing what I was. Though I&apos;m not sure if he stopped as well. I watched the craft hover across the highway into the wooded area to the left of me out of sight. And then to my surprise, to my right was another craft slowly headed northeast of me. It was about the same height off of the ground. I creeped my vehicle down the highway to watch this second craft when the object stopped and changed directions. I pulled off to the side of the road and I turned off my vehicle hoping to hear a sound. I proceeded to get out. I watched the second craft for at least two minutes when all of a sudden I started to hear this &quot;shooooooshing&quot; sound coming from behind me. I looked around and saw the first craft headed directly over top of me. It was now about 200 ft over me. These crafts appear to be approximately 30ft in dia. I can tell it&apos;s either a diamond or cross shape due to it&apos;s lighting pattern. It has two very bright lights in front with one light on each point of the craft. The rear light appears to be red or green and usually blinking. To anyone not paying special attention, the lighting configurations may look like a common domestic aircraft, but their maneuvers are quite uncommon. The only military aircraft that I know of capable of this is the Marine&apos;s Harrier or the new F/A-22. But these crafts appear to be smaller and extremely quite when compared to the two. If these are indeed military, then they have managed to keep this secret aircraft under wraps for at least a decade. If they are visitors from another world, then what better camouflage than closely mimicking our aircraft&apos;s lighting designs. Ether way , I hope to get one of these objects on film very soon. I should also mention that all of my sigthings have all been in the colder months. Not sure what significance that is,(if any) but it&apos;s defintely worth noting. If anything, I hope this report causes more people out there to look up more often and pay closer attention. It&apos;s very easy to get into a routine and take your surroundings for granted. I would imagine there would be thousands more sightings every month if not every week if people would just look to the skies more often.((NUFORC Note:  We have invited the witness to submit separate reports.

The object, only 1,000 ft. above me had silver rectangles outlining the front edge of the craft.  My first reaction was geese flying but I soon became interested because the formation was perfect.  Geese always has a straggler. The body of the craft blocked out the stars against the dark, clear sky.  No sound whatsoever.  At 23:26 I saw the second craft.  Smaller than the first, and one of the silver rectangles outlining the front of the craft was missing.

The wind was blowing from the West approx. 10-15mph. The weather was nice with clear skies with a temperature of about 75 degrees F. The humidity was around 50%. There was no moon visible. There was a meteor shower later that night. I was sitting in a lawncahir in my backyard enjoying the evening, listening to the wind blow and gazing up at the stars. So I was listening to the wind and looking at the stars I noticed what sounded like a flag whipping in the wind directly above my head.  I looked up and immediately saw a very large delta or wedge shaped object flying over the house at a high rate of speed. The object was larger than my house (2200 sq. ft. 3 bedroom single floor brick home with an attached 3 bay garage).  The object appeared to be no more than 150 - 200 feet above the ground.  It was travelling North to South at what appeared to be around 200 - 250 mph.  As it passed directly overhead it made no dicernable noise except for the sound of &quot;wind&quot; rustling by.  It emitted no light and has no distinguishing features on it other than what appeared to be two corrugations in the skin from the front to the rear of each &quot;wing&quot; (two on each wing).  The color of the object was difficult to make out, but it appeared to have a grey color to it.  It couldn&apos;t make out any sort of &quot;cockpit&quot; nor could I see any windows or other points of entry on the object. As the object passed overhead, I exclaimed &quot;Holy sh*t!&quot;, jumped out of my chair, turned around as it passed over.  I then grabbed a high-intensity flashlight the was hanging around my neck and shined it upon the object.  However, the object cast no refelction, so it was either much higher in altitude than what it appeared or the surface properties of the object were such that it absorbed the light.  As I was shining the light I was running around the corner of the house (West) towards the drive way in order to keep the object in view.  however, by the time I reach the driveway (3 seconds) the object has disappeared from view over the neighbors house and tree line acorss the street to the South. The entire incident lasted no more than 5 - 8 seconds. I rushed in the house to tell the others what I had seen.  I went out to the front lawn (facing South) with my Mother trying to see it the object might come back in view.  As we were looking South I saw a large green meteor shoot dowm at about a 60 degree angle and disappear behind the tree line on the horizon about two miles away.  I don&apos;t think this was related to what I had witnessed moments before, as a meteor shower was scheduled for later that night.  I DO however, know that the object that flew over my house was NOT a meteor. As a side note.  There are two large Air Force bases here in Oklahoma.  Tinker AFB is located just Southeast of OKC and is only about 30 minutes from my house.  There is also Altus AFB in Altus, OK. in the Southwest of the state near the Texas border.  I have never witnessed any sort of B2 stealth bomber flying in or out of either these AFB&apos;s, especially ones that emitted no sound from the engines.

This is where the sightings took place, and apparently have been taking place for several weeks now.  While standing on a large hill overlooking a wide open golf course, we witnessed at least 3 at any given time, orange bright lights that almost looked like planets, that twinkled at times and flickered erratically at other times.  The lights would rise up slowly from the horizon, and then the light would go out and be replaced by a fast blinking red and white light.  At first we thought of an airplane, but then when the lights began moving from side to side up and down and in zig zag patterns, we knew that any aircraft in existance could not perform manuevers like we witnessed.  We also witnessed the 3 lights forming triangular patterns (perfect ones i might add) and this triangle moved in unicen and at times seemed to rotate on an axis.  We also saw an unbelievably bright blue streak that almost looked like a commet streaking through the atmosphere but the width of the two &quot;tales&quot; was too wide to be a commet.  Between the tales were blue streaks and it moved very quickly over our heads and disappeared without a sound.  We have been coming to this location almost every night and it seems as if the activity continues, but the lights get farther and farther away each time.

I asked my wife what is was and she could not tell either.  What was alarming to us both was the fact that this thing made no noise and was large, as large as a 747.

The &quot;craft&quot; rolled at an angle for us both to see one large white light in the front and three white lights in a row at the back.  In the middle was one red light and one green light.

I thought nothing of it since I thought it was a plane coming this way since there were two planes that came to the sky. So I was going to wash my dishes but I noticed that when the first object was coming towards my apartments, I got a bit nervous. The first object had a bright yellow light in front of it and it looked like a plane coming since it had two red lights blinking on the sides of it. But when that went past my building, I started to clean my dishes. However, when the second object came by I ran to my other window because this object just took over the night sky. From my 2nd bedroom window, I noticed that it had a yellow light towards the front, followed by red lights that were in a pattern on the side of the object, then when I was beginning to lose sight of the object I ran to my other bedroom and I noticed that the second object was traveling upwards and I saw a bright yellow light on the bottom of this object. I lost track of this object since it continued traveling northward. I am not exactly sure how far apart these red lights were on the side of the object but since the object was very close to my apartment and it appeared to be over the residential area that was a little bit westward, I knew it was to low to be a plane. Not to mention the fact that both of these objects made absolutely no sound. But, back to the lights, there were only read lights on the side of the object and this was nothing that looked like a plane. There was no wing shaped object on this craft, the lights were lined up in a straight line. I believe there were about three or four red lights that were blinking in a pattern.

The distance was great as you could not see this with the naked eye but it had me interested for one reason.   Even though at a great distance with each strobe flash it would be quite a distance away from the previous one and then not at predictable areas that you would normally guess to be its next location, sometimes it would increase that space and sometimes it would appear to just move a hair in distance.  The thing that really got me watching intensly was when it started to move up and down then left to right and then the opposite direction.  I tried to come up with some sort of explanation such as since it was so far away that it could be that it appeared to be moving all around but just traveling away from me and changing altitude and direction.  I have lived around many military bases and am familiar with air craft and such.  I have never seen anything that could do the things that this flashing light did!   Who knows!

After 20mn, it changed direction and aimed towards a cloud where it stayed put as if it tried to hide.  As the cloud was translucent, the object could still be seen but as minutes went by the cloud became darker, grew a kind of tail looking like a sea medusa and it became more and more difficult to distinguish its host.

Both my mother and I witnessed what looked like a large ball or sphere of orange light, lift up and over the interstate.  This object was extremely bright.  I estimate it&apos;s distance from us at approximately 75 to 100 yards.  I estimate its diameter at about 10-12 feet because it was about the same size in height as the diesel trucks driving under the object.  There is no way the drivers of vehicles on I-40 could not have seen this object.  My mother was driving and I was in the passenger seat in awe of this sight.  She (my mother) slowed the car as we watched this &quot;thing&quot;. It lifted about 50 to 75 feet off of the ground and then changed color.  Now it was a blinding white color.

I saw, several miles east of Lincoln, a flashing egg shaped, or circle shaped, object in the sky above a ridgeline directly in front of a bend on Hwy 200.  I&apos;m not familiar with the area&apos;s backroads so I couldn&apos;t tell you exactly what mountain range or roads you would have to take to reach that summit.  Now at home, I can look at the map and say that it was north of Nevada Lake, west of Great Divide Ski Area.  My depth perception probably wasn&apos;t that great, so the object was probably farther west than that - probably at a distance near I-90 - as I later figured once I headed further west (but I&apos;ll get to that in a minute). I just remember rounding the bend and immediately having a gut feeling, after looking at the extremely large light in the sky, that I needed to pull over to make sure I knew what I was looking at.  I wanted to make sure it wasn&apos;t a mountainside flashing beacon for planes or an airplane itself. It hovered above the ridgeline.  So I thought, perhaps, that it was a star.  However, the flashing red and yellow or white lights were really curious looking.  Aircraft have rhythms, straight flight pathes (pretty much, unless they bank and even then it&apos;s a wide turn) and consistent light patterns, but this one did not.  It was sporadic and the red was flashing in uneven, non-patterns.  It stayed in the same position and did not move for approx. 7 minutes.  Then it moved right and then straight down beyond the ridgeline out of sight. I pulled back onto the road and headed west again on Hwy 200 hoping to catch another glimpse of it just to be sure - I like to play devil&apos;s advocate, even to myself. I did see it again and took a left turn at the Avon/Helmville cut-off road.  I drove down about a mile and parked to see it better.  It eventually disappeared out of sight, down over what seemed to be a ridgeline of some sort way in the distance (looking towards the Garnet Range (now that I&apos;m looking at a map).  There must have been some kind of ridgeline in the distance maybe covered by fog because of the way it disappeared.  But you couldn&apos;t see it with the naked eye either.  Once I head back that way during the daylight hours (and no fog) I&apos;ll try and see if there is indeed a mountain range there. To the right of me (during this occurance, as I was traveling to my second location to stop and look) there was one aircraft flying which eventually flew so far north I couldn&apos;t see it through the clouds anymore.  Then about the time that one was too distant for the naked eye, another one appeared and went parellel to Hwy 200, then out of sight.  I stopped even further down the road, approx right past the North Fork of the Blackfoot River, just before Ovando and looked back into the sky to make sure I didn&apos;t see anything else.  Once stopped, I saw another three jets total in the time that I sat there.  I marked the time that I started watching from my first stop, but then lost track of the clock at this point while looking.  One of the jets was traveling quite fast and you could see the mist tail emitting from it. Whether or not these jets were military or commercial aircraft, I cannot say.  I thought it extremely peculiar that so many aircraft would be in that vacinity at the same time buzzing around.  I kept looking at the sky all the way back to Missoula and never saw any more aircraft.  And why not?  I was nearing Missoula, which has an airport!  Am I just a dork?

I tried to power up my digital (still) camera for the really awesome one of the four UFOs I saw that would have shown you something interesting, but was too late to capture it. BTW, these are the first UFO&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve ever seen.   We were 13 miles South of Mt. Adams looking towards the mountain at 10:15 pm Saturday night until midnight.  Here&apos;s a synopsis:  First sighting: a star sized white light UFO was crossing the sky directly above us going from approximately North to South at a fairly fast clip, and was &quot;snaking&quot; perhaps 10 degrees back and forth by several nearby stars.  It moved across the sky for about 20 to 30 degrees of arc, and stopped, parked there and dimmed.  With the hundreds of stars visible and the fact that it stopped moving, I soon lost track of the UFO&apos;s exact position.  Another witness had a telephoto lens and saw a red light attached to its tail, while it was moving.  I managed to spot this UFO first, as I have excellent long range vision. Second sighting: a brighter star sized UFO came into view from the East traveling in a Westerly direction.  It traveled for about 10 to 15 degrees of arc across the sky at about a 60 degree angle from the ground.  Then, in a very short space, it took a smooth 30-40 degree arcing turn to the NNW, traveled a short distance, and stopped high above Mt Adams.  No dimming.  Lost site of it among the hundreds of stars that were out (I can only go so long without blinking!).Third (and best) sighting: A medium bright, star sized UFO came in from the WSW, meandered somewhat randomly for 10-15 degrees of arc, heading in an Easterly direction.  It stopped right next to a dimmer star.  Suddenly it &quot;lit up&quot;.  I don&apos;t mean it got a little brighter; it got hundreds of times brighter than it was.  Imagine Mars, when in view, is the brightest object in the sky by 2-3 times the brightest stars in the sky, and multiply that by 50-100 times. The &quot;lighting up&quot; lasted for 3-5 seconds, then dimmed to a faint star in size and brightness, and moved off into space, dimming to nothing, within a couple arc degrees, in a snaking trajectory, heading ENE.  When that UFO lit up, the dozen or so people there reacted with awe, cheering and yelling for more.  That UFO was just letting us know it was undeniably there and perhaps saying &quot;Hi&quot; -  I was extremely impressed... Absolutely drop dead awesome!!!!!!  Fourth sighting: A star sized UFO traveling from the North and very dim, was moving South when it &quot;flashed&quot; like a strobe pulse, maybe 5-10 times brighter than Mars would be, then returned to a very dim object (barely visible). A few seconds later, it flashed again, and dimmed. This scenario repeated 10-15 times while crossing directly overhead, and traveling 30-40 degrees of the sky, changing directions several times, along the way. The flashes were randomly timed, varying from a second to several seconds in between. The UFO then stopped almost directly above us, and parked there for the rest of the night, dim and unmoving. It was SE of the big dipper, then, and was aligned to two stars below it, where I could see and check on it, and it didn&apos;t move again. During the viewing time I saw a shooting star (which I&apos;ve seen dozens of before), and airplanes, which were obvious by their trajectories, flashing colored lights, straight traverses and speeds. Observed them many times before. The four UFO sightings, above, were nothing of the kind.((NUFORC Note:  We cannot be certain what the witness observed, but we have an opinion on the third and fourth sightings. The third is not inconsistent with the flash of an Iridium satellite.

The reports appears to us to be consistent with the direction a witness would have to have been looking, in order to witness the &quot;flare.&quot;  The fourth sighting is not inconsistent with a tumbling booster in space, but that is only a guess.

This was a monumental endeavor never mind the fact that the two wheeler hauler/trailer was critically overloaded!  Since the trailer was new and had new 8 ply tires my brother decided to pass on a spare and this was a mistake. The temperatures  during the day ran from 95 to 108 degrees  and we got baked!  A few times I told ((name deleted)) to slow down as he was pushing it and about 30 miles north of Lareto the rear right tire on the u-hauler melted. The first indication I had that something was wrong was when I heard that familiar and dreaded sound of a tire breaking down! As soon as I felt the Ford Exloder we were in shake my brother was fighting the wheel to bring us to a pull over stop on the side of the road.  One of those gravel pit side bars that humans seem to gravitate for with a variety of reasons and intentions. Right away I ran a mental inventory and realized we did NOT have a spare for the trailer!  Phil did a problem solution and I sat with the trailer like road kill waiting to happen and ((name deleted)) drove to Lareto to find help. About an hour and a half later ((name deleted)) drove up with another car following him into the roadside rat trap.  ((name #2 deleted)) told us not to worry that he had been in the &quot;business&quot; for 25 years!  As he checked out our bad right tire on the trailer he told his friend to check the air pressure on the left side.  ((name deleted)) and I did not pay attention as I was sick and he could only watch so much of it.((name deleted)) told us he would take our rim to his shop to find us a tire and fix the bent rim. This was around eight o clock to eight-thirty. For about twenty minutes ((name deleted)) and I hung out and as I was looking out into the darkness I saw spotlight come out from what I first thought was a helicopter going real fast. I said to my brother, &quot;Are they using a helicopter to look for illegal aliens or drug smugglers&quot;? Thing was the light source was a square box as apposed to a round searchlight!  The light source then did a sweep over the hills lighting up some hillsides and this was about 2 to 3 miles from where we were. Then the light source seemed to zip straight away from me and I was looking towards the north west. It the seemed to turn to the left and at that point my brother and I were yelling at each other that we had to take in every second of this. I could just make out a slivery pinpoint that was stationary in the sky for at least 20 to 25 seconds. Then it took off and all I could see was a thin vapor trail.  However this was a vapor trail that was different from any I had ever seen.  It was heavy and dense and as it started to dissapate  it started to form a long egg shape/oval  type balloon!  It was then I noticed a shiny glint coming from the vehicle.  Almost like some had a silver knife at a camp ground and the sun reflected off it as you looked down from a switchback or peak of a mountain. Right away I thought I was looking at some kind of inter-planetary space shuttle type vehicle!   My brother was also in a state of near hysteria as the vapor trail continued to expand and for 8 to 10 minutes it continued to expand as it dissapated.  The pin point silver object seemed to have left for a journey into space!  ((name deleted)) and I talked, ranted and raved about what we had seen and what it could be or mean.  I do know that I did see this light coming out from a vehicle that I thought at first was a helicopter but it had a square light source and ended up taking off like a space shuttle only NOT from a launching pad strapped to 3 rocket engines!  My brother and I will always be convinced we witnessed a UFO and when ((mechanic)) and friends returned they told us they had seen the &quot;strange&quot; balloon type light that lit up the sky!  They all told us they had NEVER seen anything like it before!!", "Object left no visible exhaust chased by jets leaving white exhaust trailsOne object reflecting sunlight followed by a military jet.

I know that&apos;s a classic excuse, but you&apos;ll have to take my word for it.As I watched it suddenly vanished, but appeared again at the far right of my eyeline as I was seeing it.  I focused ALL my attention on it.  There were occaisonal flickers of runway-like lights heading outwards in the cliche-like chevron pattern.  I swear on my parents&apos; my sister&apos;s and my own life that I watched this craft for 20 or so minutes tonight in a stationary position.  It gradually began to move, but REALLY slowly.  It would then dart at speed to another position, but it would sit there for ages.  As I say it was REALLY high.  Above cloud level.  I watched it until it was out of eyeshot.  It seemed to ascend. Clearly getting higher in a weird way, but not appearing duller.  Lights totally clear all through the incident.  Then it was suddenly gone.This didn&apos;t scare me at all.

They seemed to reflect the sunlight.  They weren&apos;t moving, as much as I could tell.  One simply disappeared as I looked at it, the other disappeared moments later.  They were clearly above the clouds and were in close proximity to one another.  Best guess is that they were round,  but they were too high to tell for sure.  My wife witnessed the one, the second one appeared after she got into the car, we witnessed these objects as we were late to getting out 6 month daughter to her first picture session.

Slower than a falling star, but much faster that commercial air traffic and faster than normal military jets.  There was some jet noise, but not nearly as loud as most jets, there were also some commercial jets in the area.  My conclusion is that this was either a very low flying, very fast,  and very quiet military jet or ???.  It was flying in airspace that is between the two typical patterns for planes landing at John Wayne airport, but in the same general direction.", "Looked up while walking west on Sand Lake Road.

It was low and moving silently across the horizon in a gradual descent that she thought may result in a crash but it disappeared instead. Both my wife and I have seen it the last two nights in the same position in the sky about 15-20 degrees above the horizon.  The shape is indistinct but one can see the changing colors (green, red, white) with the naked eye. It is impossible to judge the size, altitude or distance from us.  It appears about 23:00 and disappears very gradually into the distance in 30-45 minutes. Last night we could see it moving up, down and side to side abruptly but never too far from its original position.  Tonight it was more stationary and slowly disappeared to the west as if moving away from us. The tower at the local airport closes at 23:00.  The sky has been very clear and we have seen several shooting stars the last two nights.  I have been around aircraft since I was a boy and built many a model airplane.  And I have seen space junk a number of times.  My wife is a graphic artist and has a good eye.  We have never encountered anything like this.((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))Dear Mr. Davenport:Mars was orange/yellow and very bright above and behind us to the east. The object was in the western sky and much nearer the horizon so that we had our backs to Mars as we watched the object. We observed the object with binoculars which made the changing colors, not just a distorted shimmer but a flashing, more apparent. It isn&apos;t the usual &apos;twinkle&apos;.I checked periodically last night waiting for the object to appear and when I looked out about 23:00, there it was. The night before last, it was moving very distinctly in small increments back and forth and up and down. That&apos;s what really threw us. It didn&apos;t move as much last night. Springfield is 110,000 people and we live about 5 or 6 miles east of town and the last few nights the atmosphere has been very clear and absolutely beautiful, but I don&apos;t see any body behaving or looking like this.

The fireball was traveling N to S we assumed it was space junk or a satellite, because it had a fire trail behind it.

It was late at night, so I discounted that, and became curious as to what it was (and somewhat anxious).  A few seconds later the room illuminated bright turquoise blue.

As I was veiwing the planes I noticed this object moving perpindicular in a downward motion away from the planes.  At first I thought maybe they dropped something or that maybe I&apos;m seeing a satelite moving in space?  The object was a silver cylinder with a bright flourescent blue round top.   It reminded me of a wand or staff.  It was kind of moving back a forth as it appeared to move down away from the planes.  I&apos;ve never seen anything like it before.  I&apos;m thinking it may of been a satellite, but it was to big in comparison to the planes I think to be a satelite, plus I don&apos;t know if I would be able to see a satelite that well being that they are higher up outside the atmosphere.

Witness was an out-of-state participant in an annual bicycle ride-across-Iowa known as &quot;Ragbrai.&quot;  Witness&apos; original report is very descriptive, and the only point needing clarification is that when the triangle moved from horizontal to vertical, it headed straight up. Certainly this witness seems to be a very observant individual, and since he resides in the vicinity of the Atlanta, Georgia, airport, he is familiar with airliner approach altitudes, and so was able to not only estimate altitude, but was confident in his size estimation as much larger than a normal aircraft.((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Beverly Trout, State Director of the Iowa Chapter of MUFON, for following up on this report, and for sharing her findings.

Only these i think had a reddish glow and were about not very big and moved very quickly ... every time i went to watch what was happening nothing was there, but then i would sit back down and see them out of the corner of my eye.  I almost called someone last night but figured she would think i was crazy and then this morning heard on the radio lots of people saw lights.

When I thought a low flying small airplane was heading towards the Hayward Aiport which was roughly 5 miles from where my friend lives.  It was rectanglar in shape and was lighted like a white flourescent light bulb.  It made no noise whatsover. It glided on a downward slope as if it was hugging the terrain, and then disappeared into thin air.

Since I had taken her out at 11:30 p.m., before I went to bed, I thought it quite unusual, but took her anyway. I was outside with enough time to sit down on my front steps when a movement in the southwest sky made me look up. I will do my best to describe what I saw. If I had to compare the object I saw in the sky to something I have seen in my life, I would have to say it had a rectangular shape and moved somewhat in an undulating way, like a jellyfish. The outline and brightness of the thing against the dark sky was very crisp and clear. It was bright, glowing white. It had a white oval disk, which I&rsquo;ll now call a head. The head seemed to lead what I&rsquo;ll now call a tail. The tail was the same width as the head. The oval head was solid white and distinguishable from the tail because the tail was transparent but streaked with white light. When I say transparent, I mean I could see the dark sky behind the tail part but I could not see the dark sky behind the white oval. The tail moved in graceful, undulating like way. The object never stopped moving. It seemed to me it had a destination. At times it seemed to almost dip as it moved across t he sky, which made it seem fluid.  It made no noise. My thoughts at the time: What is THAT? It&rsquo;s so much bigger than a star or plane. It&rsquo;s so defined and crisp, it looks like a cartoon or a fluorescent light. The light is coming from within it. It&rsquo;s graceful. It flows. It&rsquo;ll be gone before I can get a camera. I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like this before. I didn&rsquo;t feel threatened but I was a little scared. When I first sighted it, it appeared to be moving at me, coming from southwest direction but then began moving west. As it did so, the tail seemed to undulate, almost as if it were blowing in the wind, like you might see flag or a scarf do in a light breeze. However, there was no wind that night. The leaves were not blowing in the trees. At some point after it began moving west, my dog noticed it. She had just finished relieving herself when it must&rsquo;ve caught her attention. At 2:30 am there were no other people or animals around to distract her. My dog, a beagle, has never barked at anything in the sky before, but she looked up and began a frantic, sharp bark. She has a bay type bark but when she noticed the thing in the sky, her bark was frantic and sharp. As I recall, my dog was looking up in the direction of the thing in the sky but her head was moving as if she couldn&rsquo;t quite focus. I was really surprised that she was barking at something in the sky and was having a hard time myself because I couldn&rsquo;t understand what it was I was looking at. I&rsquo;m a nearly 50-year-old professional and have never seen anything like that in my life. As it was 2:30 in the morning and my dog was barking frantically and I have neighbors, so I had to pull her inside. The object in the sky was moving in a northwestly direction in an undulating way when I last saw it.((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with this witness on several occasions, and she seems quite reliable to us.

I was thirsty and wandered out into the living room to fetch a glass of water from the kitchen.  We had a large bay window in the living room and I saw the lights outside so I decided to climb up onto the couch and look out.  It was the moon.  It was full and bright and very red, then blue, then green, then yellow and red again. I saw 3-4 flying saucers and they hovered just outside in my back yard.  I walked outside in my pj&apos;s and looked up at them.  They streamed acrossed the sky and danced with colored lights.  I watched one land on the hill just behind my house and I remember walking up the hill and into the space craft.  I don&apos;t remember too much after entering the ship but I do remember not feeling afraid. I walked back inside my house and got my glass of water and went straight to bed.  I woke the next morning and in my tiny little hand was a flower.  It was colored a brightly blue soft color with a red center and the sem was a greenish yellow tint.  I put it away inside a book so my mom or dad wouldn&apos;t find it.  I would find myself looking out the big bay window from my living room almost every night after that first night for a long time that I can remember.  But they didn&apos;t come back until years later.  I saw them again in the years between 1986 &amp; 1987 while I was feeding my horses one early morning in May.  Also again on my way to work in 1982.  And again in Rockville Md while driving home along Shady Grove Road off RT270S near the Metro Station in 1999.

My friend was with me for about 30 minutes he saw a shooting star or a possible satellite fly across the sky he sighted this for about 3 seconds two days before I saw a very similar thing the night continued and we saw nothing else.  My fried was then picked up by his parents at 19:00 on the night I went back to sky watch. I was watching for 15 minutes and recorded no events. But then at 19:23 I saw two lights fly across the sky I was in utter shock because the thing was so low in the sky it was only the height of a two story building it had not engine noise what so ever that is another thing that really startled me about it I watched for about 20 seconds as it flew past I quickly acted and ran down two stairs that leave off the patio and then I had to get up a flight of 8 stairs these are stairs because it is a house that was built on a slope so there are stairs down to the garden which is a very strange layout. I got up the stairs and got my camera ready I saw the two lights as it past out of sight behind a tree. There is a massive double gate at the top of the stairs and it is chained it is chained because we have recently been getting burglars attempting to get into the garage and steal like they are known to do I pulled endlessly on the chain but it was no use it just would not come on I am not sure if this is due to the cold temperature and the chain was stuck on by ice or frost or something along those lines but it would not come off. I ran down the stairs and round to the other set of stairs which is at the other side of the garden and is a very long way away I got up those stairs but when I got up the stairs there was nothing at all to be seen. But I am 100% sure this is a UFO it could not be identified I just do not know what the hell it could be.

The &quot;falling star&quot; was falling at a tremendous speed as we have noticed other &quot;falling stars&quot; in the desert.  This light was traveling straight down as opposed to an angle that other &quot;falling stars&quot; we have previously noticed.

At about 8:35 p.m.,  in the east/southeast sky, about 35 degrees above the horizon, several of us parents noticed a bright light that we assumed was a airplane moving toward our location many miles off.  The light did not fly in a straight line and we all took notice of this. The motion of the light was very fluid back and forth as it flew toward our location from the east.  As the light approached closer, still miles away, the light became larger and red in color and the light from it appeared to have  rays or spikes  radiating from the center (like a stereotypical depiction of a bright star/star of Bethlehem).  The light began to dramatically fall some distance.  It grew much brighter and glowed orange-red, and we all assumed this must be a giant meteor coming down. It did not fall too far though, and again gained some altitude, started flying again and proceeded extremely fast mainly south-southwest.  It was never flying in a straight line and always wandering from side-to-side or up-and-down. It then appeared to explode, but the light did not disappear, it again looked more white and flew very fast far to the south.  We lost sight of it as it went over the tree line. The light never got very close to our campsite and at the highest was about 50-55 degrees up from the horizon.

After about a second-and-a-half, the lights dimmed, then disappeared.

To the NNE, I could see what I thought was an aircraft headed south at approximately the same relative altitude as the rising moon from my ground perspective.  The bright white light which appeared to be the same intensity as a small aircraft&apos;s and about the size of a pencil eraser held at arms length, also appeared to have red light in a halo effect around the white light but at a greatly reduced size and barely discernable from the white light.  I estimated the &quot;aircraft&quot; to be approximately &frac12; mile away from me based on numerous other aircraft sightings over the years of airplanes flying overhead en route to our local airport. I watched the &quot;aircraft&quot; for approximately (1) minute and realized that it&apos;s lateral speed was slowing and it was now turning further west towards my location which could account for the illusion of it slowing down.  Although it still had the red halo effect, I realized that it was not an aircraft rotating beacon or navigation light.  I then called to my wife and twenty year old son to come outside and we watched for (1) minute more as the object began to slowly weave left to right and began to drop in altitude. The white light dimmed slightly and then it suddenly dropped what appeared to be (3) red fragments much like flares dropped by jet fighter aircraft.  The object zig-zagged left to right and still continued to drop in altitude headed south.  It emitted (3-4)red fragments and appeared to turn due east.  Its size continued to reduce which led me to believe it was moving away from me.  It was also appeared to reduce in size every time it emitted the fragments.  It finally disappeared altogether which left my family and I, awe struck. I have been a patrol sergeant with a local law enforcement agency for almost twenty years and have observed several missile launches from Vandenberg AFB which is approximately (200) miles SE of me.  The launches leave a visible smoke trail from my town and sometimes I can see the booster separations and engine burns, if the sky is clear.  I have also observed dozens of space junk re-entries, satellites including Iridium flares, and orbiting spacecraft, but I have never seen an object perform as this one did tonight.  It went from controlled navigation to weaving like a drunk driver and then straighten itself back out in seconds.  I have seen jet aircraft drop flare counter measures before and they have a systematic ejection, controlled decent and separation.  These fragments did not. I have a Navel Air Station approximately (30) miles west of me and FA-18 Hornets fly overhead day and night.  They are flying over to the China Lake and Nellis AFB test ranges, so I&apos;m accustomed to the sounds they make, the navigation lights they have and the speeds they transit our airspace at.

While driving to work on the Crosstown expressway in Tampa, I noticed a strange rectangular craft in the distance, traveling in a NW direction.  At first I thought the craft may have been a balloon because it was traveling slow (about 60 mph) and was very large.  I first noticed it about 2-3 miles away while I was traveling 55 mph in my vehicle while going to work. When I was about a mile away I noticed that it had no curves like you would expect a balloon (blimp) to have and the ends were squared off.  It was of a rectangular shape.  I never got close enough to get under it. It maintained an altitude of approx 1000 ft. The altitude, speed and direction were all consistent and I could not notice any deviation in any axis.  I had a camera in my bag on the passenger seat next to me and I wanted to take a picture of it but I was unable to do so-weird I know but I just couldn&rsquo;t do it.Physical Description: The length was in excess of 500 ft (2-C-5 type transport aircraft parked end to end)  The height was in excess of 120 ft.  Since I retired from the USAF 5 years ago and have worked on many kinds of fighter, cargo and high performance reconnaissance aircraft, I sort of know what to look for in aircraft and below are my observations.The exterior was more rectangular shape with minor angled variances along the sides. The exterior composition had the appearance of sandy gray concrete. There were areas along the sides that that had several rectangular colored red and some orange areas. I specifically looked for any type of letters, symbols or markings which would indicate anything of significance and there were none. No windows, ports, hatches, panel lines or discoloration of surface could be made out from my closest approach (2,000 ft) were noticed.  No external pods, antennas i.e. long-wire, Radar-dish, directional, panel mounted, loop, adf, blade, towel-rack or anything that resembled an antenna was noticed. No engines or propulsion system of any kind were noticed nor any noise of any kind.  No electrical interference on my car AM radio was noted either.((NUFORC Note:  Witness suggests that the date of the event is approximate.

We are on flight path into Larnaca airport and this object was going in the complete opposit direction.  Then the object appeared to stop and hover.  It had green, amber and white flashing lights around it.  It moved in irregular directions, back and forth and side to side.  Difficult to tell how far up it was but the lights were large as the size of an aircraft on on its final approaches to land.  I observed it through binoculars for approx 45 mins and could see it was a triangle shape, and woke another family member to witness it.  I wanted to video it as the video has a very strong zoom.  When I tried to video it, it was like someone put a hand over the lens as I was unable to see anything.

The object was bright as Venus and about twice the size of Jupiter.  At first I thought it was a helicoptor but the object did not move.  Also of note was that the object did not waver like a bright star would do as seen at night; the light was steady and bright, brighter than an airliner or helicopter would emit.  As I got closer about 5 miles from the object (Loop 1604E and Highway 281 North) it started to disappear or vanish from the sky.  The object did not move away it just vanished.  At this time I was at stop light while it disappeared.  It never seemed to move from the same point in the sky as I observed it.

I myself have never in the past seen anything like this or any other UFO&apos;s. I still don&apos;t know what we saw but it was really wierd and surreal. My boyfriend and I were having a smoke out in our back patio.  I happened to look out towards the west and saw a bright object.  At first I thought It was a really bright star. I said to my boyfriend, &quot; Isn&apos;t that a really bright star?&quot;  He agreed. The more we looked at it we realised that it couldn&apos;t have been a star.  We&apos;re not too far from Vandenburg air space so we tried to rationalise the whole thing.  But then it started. From the left of the bright object a flashing red object appeared.  Naturally we thought it was a plane, but the more we stared at it the more we realised that it was not moving like normal planes.  It would hover down then go up suddenly.  But naturally we tried to rationalise what we were witnessing. The red-flashing object was getting closer to the bright star object and circled it once and then quickly hovered away.  The more you tried to look at the red-flashing object it seemed to go out of focus. I decided to get my camera, and as i came back out both me and my boyfriend witnessed something that almost made us S*** in our pants.  The redflashing object stopped floating and became as bright as the bright star object for just a few seconds and dimmed out quickly. As i tried to focus my camera on the redflashing object, I noticed another redflashing object that we had not seen before.  As I panned out to look at it, not through the camera lens, I noticed that it was THREE more redflashing objects higher up in the sky that weren&apos;t near the original one we initially saw. I wanted to take pics of them and as i tried to fit them into the shot i noticed that they were traveling at a very slow pace in a triangular pattern.  One was all the way at the top or the point of the triangle, and the other 2 were below. I have to say that I&apos;m not a UFO nut, never been something I&apos;ve been interested in, but this night sent shivers down my back.  We went back inside after having enough of what we saw.  We really tried to rationalise.  After watching tv an hour later I decided to go back outside to see if anything was still going on.  When i stepped outside I was stumped to see that everything, the flashing red objects and the bright star looking object were all gone.I only had a disposable camera and the flash kept going off. i have yet to develop the camera.  I was really hoping that i would read any similar sightings on this site.  There is no way me and my boyfriend were the only ones that witnessed this.

In 1965 my Dad bought a 1965 VW Bus.  Once a week we used to drive in to Pittsburgh so that my Dad could drop off his Football Contest at the Pittsburgh Press.  On the night in question we were heading towards down and I remember my Parents kept commenting on a strange light in the distance.  After we had dropped them off and we were on our way home, we were heading up Bower Hill Road and I remember my Day saying Holy Sh*t look at that. He then pulled off of the road to look at what he had seen.  I vividly remember looking up out of the window and seeing a large Round Saucer hovering several hundred feet above the Houses and Trees.  The Craft was slowly rotating and had windows all around.  There were also lights on the bottom.  It reminded me of a ring with Diamonds all around it with the Diamonds being Windows. Me and my Brother and Sisters were very scared and were crying.  My Parents watched it for several Minutes before my day reached for his Camera.  As he was preparing to try and take a Picture it tilted slightly and took off at a high rate of speed.  It was gone within Seconds.

Again they were moving too fast to be that.  They were moving from west to east.  Then all of a sudden one of the objects makes a 90 degree turn in front of the path of the other object and they they both move off into a southerly direction.  There were some meteors last night but those were easy to differenciate. Then probably less than 5 minutes later we see a group of 3 red objects coming from the same direction all in parallel.

They were traveling from over Keel mountain east to west direction heading towards Huntsville.  There was no organization to these lights. My wife got her telephone and called her friend to tell her what we were witnessing.  While she was talking on the phone I noticed a group of these white lights formed a large circle behind our house out in the field and stopped for several minutes and began to flash wildly.  They didn&apos;t flash all at once but randomly wild with intensity.  They must&apos;ve been two hundred feet away and about one hundred feet off the ground.  They were not equally spaced but they did form a perfect circle. After a few minutes the lights from the circle that they created took off like a stream of bees flying.  They took off west towards Huntsville too.  I couldn&apos;t make out any shapes and didn&apos;t hear any sound. There were more of these lights coming over Keel mountain when my wife pointed to a faint object overhead.  It looked like a faint burnt orangish disk that was stationary in the sky.  I went into the house and got my telescope out to see what it was.  The object was still there.  My wife is far sight and kept telling me that there was a second object overhead too but I couldn&apos;t see it.  What I could see with my telescope just made me more confused of what I was looking at. It looked like a faint burnt orangish disk with knobs on the bottom like you see with some reflectors. The flurry of white lights finally ceased but the disk overhead was still there but faintly. Afterwards my wife and I went inside because we were getting too cold.  We were speachless as to what we witnessed.((NUFORC Note:  We have no idea what the multiple lights may have been, but we have written the witness, asking what direction the clouds were moving at the time of the sighting of those lights.

I have travelled the NYS Thruway frequently this year and this is my 3rd sighting in a little over 2 months.... The last sighting was just prior to exit 23 heading north of which I pulled over and witnessed a triangular shaped object moving at 15-20 mph only 150ft in the air which flew right over my vehicle..It sounded like a huge power transformer...

The fall day was clear, no clouds in the sky, and the temperature was in the low 70&rsquo;s.   The Sun was low in the western sky and blocked by high rise building.   The jet reflected the silver off the body of the aircraft. I just happened to look off to the side and I noticed a small rice grain shaped object that was a reddish brown color, very subdued.   I watched it and at first I thought I was watching a very high flying bird or weather balloon.   I now saw another object that appeared to be about the same size.  I looked at my clock on the wall and it was 17:25 (5:25 PM MST).   I continued to watch for about 5 minutes as the two faint objects went around each other.  If I held out a silver dollar at arms length the two things would have circles that item. At about 17:31 (5:31 PM MST) I noticed a very bright object appear.   Now that looked like a weather balloon, very bright, silver colored and the other two objects circled it.   One of the smaller object started to move southeast and a slow rate, about the speed of a satellite crossing the night sky.    The larger object and a smaller one stayed in the area of the northern sky, high angle to me.   I was under the impression that the objects were reflective and the light was reflected from the Sun and they were very high in altitude. At this time a friend, lady was leaving the building and I showed her the two small objects and the larger one.   The objects were as follows.   The small one was traveling south east and I showed her.   The larger one was in the northern sky with one of the smaller one.   At this time another small object just appeared.  We both saw it and the lady stayed for a few minutes and watched but left to get a bus to go home. It was 17:36 (5:36 PM MST.   A friend that worked with me came on station, (Court Security Officers) and I showed him the objects.    The first small one was moving slow and almost east of us and the larger one was moving in that direction.   I lost sight of  the two and as my friend and I watched, two more appeared, we looked at each other and I said, &ldquo;God they look like weather balloons but they move as if powered.    The first small one was still moving southeast and went behind a building and we lost sight. The bright, larger one was moving south east and as it was east of us just stopped.   At this time the two lost objects came from the north and passed by the larger one with in 30 seconds and were gone out of sight.    The large bright object appeared to have stopped and I I would not have seen what took place I would have thought that I was looking at Venus or Sirius at this time.  Several other people came by and we showed them the object, they saw it and thought it was a star or weather balloon.   One of the younger men stated that the bight object looked cylindrical in shape and was reflective.  That object stayed in the east and I had high rise buildings covering 75% of the sky.

At first, I thought this was just normal landing lights which are seen frequently, but because of the speed, direction and brilliance, this caught our eye.  Our location at the time was in east Layton, UT and the fireball appeared due north of us, or (given the visibility that night) approximately due east of Ogden, UT, and appeared as if it were directly over the mountains.  The fireball traveled quickly, was very bright (considering there was a full moon out, the object was very brilliant) and its line of travel was approximately NNW.  It traveled about the same speed as other meteors I have seen (i.e., quite fast) although the direction (a bit west of north) was unusual.  Less than a minute later, planes (distinguishable by their navigation lights) could be seen making their routine turns in their approach to land in Salt Lake and elsewhere, but this was no airplane.

I watched these objects stay in one spot for at least 5 minutes in the same spot of the sky.  So I ran to my 2nd bedroom window in my apartment and that&rsquo;s when the planes started coming from the western night sky.  So I ran back to my kitchen window to see what was going to happen.  When the planes came up to the sky, that&rsquo;s when things got really interesting. When the planes came from the western sky, one of them went over the middle object since they were in the original spot from where I first saw them.  When the plane went over the middle object, I lost track of the plane since I was focused on what the light was.  I&apos;m not even sure what happened to the other plane, but I&apos;m sure both of them just took off.  But, when the planes came to where the objects were, the objects started traveling north towards my apartment.  I thought nothing of it since I thought it was a plane coming this way since there were two planes that came to the sky.  So I was going to wash my dishes but I noticed that when the first object was coming towards my apartments, I got a bit nervous.The first object had a bright yellow light in front of it and it looked like a plane coming since it had two red lights blinking on the sides of it.  But when that went past my building, I started to clean my dishes. However, when the second object came by I ran to my other window because this object just took over the night sky.  From my 2nd bedroom window, I noticed that it had a yellow light towards the front, followed by red lights that were in a pattern on the side of the object, then when I was beginning to lose sight of the object I ran to my other bedroom and I noticed that the second object was traveling upwards and I saw a bright yellow light on the bottom of this object.  I lost track of this object since it continued traveling northward. I am not exactly sure how far apart these red lights were on the side of the object but since the object was very close to my apartment and it appeared to be over the residential area that was a little bit westward, I knew it was to low to be a plane.  Not to mention the fact that both of these objects made absolutely no sound.  But, back to the lights, there were only red lights on the side of the object and this was nothing that looked like a plane.  There was no wing shaped object on this craft, the lights were lined up in a straight line.

At the time he pointed it out, I thought it was a street light, because it appeared to be the same color as one, but soon noticed that it went from hovering to moving at an exceptionally fast speed to our left.  We followed the ball for a mile or so and saw that we were actually gaining on it until we ended up behind a grocery store. It was very clear that we were much closer to the orange ball now.  It appeared about half dollar size from our viewpoint and was hovering over a patch of trees.  It moved closer to us (what seemed a very gradual speed) until it was right above my friend&apos;s parked car and much lower to the ground.  The thing seemed only a matter of feet above us, and had a bright orange light in the middle with blue-ish lights surrounding.  It hovered over us for some minutes, and made no sound at all.

I watched the object go into the distance and noticed that it kept descending, so that eventually I was looking straight out at it.

My father contacted the local FAA office but unfortunately, they did not see this from their vantage point in the tower.((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Mr. Kim Shaffer, State Director for Eastern Tennessee, who can be reached at &lt;shaffer56@earthlink.net&gt;.  PD))", "We Had An Alien Trapped!After a week of multiple sightings throughout town we (my best friend and I), who were skeptical, decided after work to swing on the rope of a flagpole in front of a local school. We were 15 and bored.After swinging for a few minutes we stopped to rest at the base of the pole, back to back, when we saw over the top of the schoolhouse, just above the shadow of the wooded area immediately behind the playground in back of the school, a blue ball/light which curved down to the treetops and disappeared. When we investigated we were witness to a craft hovering above the woods where the light disappeared. It silently made it&apos;s way over our left shoulders, which were backed against the brick backed school building. With a low cloud cover toward the downtown area, which reflected the city lights, we could see 3-4 more ships slowly circling toward and then stopping above the same area. They seemed to be patrolling the area around and above the woods. After a time we could make our a figure walking along the edge of the woods on the other side of the large yard making up the playground. We could barely make it out but it stopped every time we called out. As we continued to watch the circling ships one suddenly made it&apos;s way toward us. Frozen against the wall and unable to move from fear, it was right in front of us about 50 feet in the air above and immediately in front of us. We could see the windows surrounding it and lights moved in a circular motion as the illuminated each window. There was absolutely no sound made. We were sure they were going to do something but it just slowly lifted and again made it&apos;s way over our left and over the school building out of site.After awhile we decided to move up closer to the yard from the building. As we moved forward we cleared a part of the school to our left that jutted out and my friend alerted me to someone running to our left. I forgot to mention that during the initial sightings of the ships we ran back to my friend&apos;s house to get a camera. His family actually didn&apos;t have one but we were able to find a pair of binoculars. That and a borrowed leather jacket for me that belonged to his father were all we could return with. As we walked toward the figure that was running, which had stopped at my friend&apos;s alert/shout, it became clearer that it was one of the aliens from the ships. He was tall and thin and was a light orange/white and appeared to have a suit with a black square on the chest. And a collar that appeared to be for a helmet or something. He was poised to jump as we approached. We were within 25 feet of him when we remembered we had the binoculars. When I lifted them to my eyes it was as if someone punched me in the eyes. I looked directly into his face. My friend&apos;s reaction was much the same. After I called out to him his face turned into us and he looked directly at me as I looked through the glasses. When I called out with &quot;we mean you no harm&quot; I felt silly saying that and was embarrassed. After about 20 minutes of holding him there, he started to make coughing sounds and a whistle of some kind. We decided to let him go as we didn&apos;t know what else to do. We backed away and (no kidding) as we cleared around the blocking part of the school, a police car came toward us from where we&apos;d first started. As they approached we just knew the alien would no longer be there. The police (two of them) stopped us and asked us what we were doing behind the school and we told them about the alien. They first searched us, our pockets and such and of course my friend&apos;s father&apos;s jacket had a bunch of matches deep in one pocket I didn&apos;t even know were there. We did convince one of them we were telling the truth and they agreed to accompany us to the site. As we rounded the blocking part of the school we could see he was gone. The police, to their credit, did go up into the yard and shine their spotlight into the woods that edged that side of the playground. The alien had been standing just inside that thin line of woods that went up the left side of the school to the main woods that ran left to right.The sightings that the whole town had seen, including my mother and sisters, claimed there were three craft with one appearing in trouble and two on either side of it following. We surmised through the years that they were maybe repairing that craft in the woods and we happened there.If we had a camera, especially a video camera (not common then) we could have made a feature movie! This is all 100% true. By the way, to make matters worse (for our credibility) the National Enquirer was on a UFO kick and had along one whole length of the front page an exact picture of our guy! Unbelievable. But absolutely true.When I hear of regular sightings I just think, &quot;wow, if they&apos;d seen what I saw!&quot; Thanks for letting me tell someone.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I focused on a standard movement in the  North West sky I was  thinking that it was just another &apos;light&apos;.  I can spot them almost any night I want.  I saw a faint white light, almost undiscernable.  (If a friend was standing there they wouldnt have seen it w/out me spotting it, Ive trained myself to see faint lights.  It was a variably speed and  was slowly &apos;weaving&apos;, as if its occupants were drunk.  I knew it was REAL close ( &gt;1 mi), so I grabbed my binoculars.  Then saw a definite blue light w/no other colors flying from the northwest to the north.  Within an instant the object turned directly toward me.  The craft&apos;s blue light was pointed directly in my position, because the degree of light intensity was almost blinding in the binoc&apos;s.  It all happened in 3 to 4 sec&apos;s and it scared me so bad cause it was so close and not a normal phenomenom, that my fear caused me to throw down my binoc&apos;s and i ran inside. I live w/in 15 miles of an international airport.  The craft was not a plane.  It zipped away in the beat of a heart.", "Fireball seen after 10 shooting starsWhat i saw:  At same moment my attention was caught by many shooting stars all moving in burst of maybe 10 or so in top of sky from East to West near Mars.   Appearing in a group like shooting stars in their nature.  A few secs later i saw a bright glowing ball appear in the sky in this same area, an object i would call a fireball and move with less speed also East to West and vanish behind a cloud and for a moment causing lighting of the cloud. It did not see it come out of the other side.  More so i had my camera with me and i GOT THE THING in 3 PICS! I saw no signs of intelligent flight, but i can say it seemed to slow down as it moved and was VERY bright and color shifted from yellow to red.Obviously if i had time to raise my camera and snap 3 photos it was not moving nearly as fast as what a shooting star&apos;s nature would be.  I was able to keep sight of the object for about 8 secs on its pass over. On the largest photo you can see Mars and get an idea of the level of zoom was minimal  (did not have time to zoom)  Object was moving about 5 times as fast as a jet would cross the sky and was EXTREMELY bright when you compare it to Mars and realize how bright Mars was in the nighttime sky to your eye. I had my camera against a tree and the streaking does not appear in Mars only in this object.

I was there with a guy named ((name deleted--male)) and his girlfriend ((name deleted--female)).  Unfortunately, I can&apos;t remember their last names and don&apos;t know if I could even find them these days as I live in Missouri now. Anyway we had laid out a blanket and were laying side-by-side stargazing when I saw what looked like a normal satellite tracking in a straight line from east to west across the sky.  I pointed it out to the others and everyone acknowledged that they saw it too.  When it got directly above us it suddenly did a fast, tight loop, seemingly around a bright star exactly above us.  At that moment all three of us received a very strong mental impression that I can only describe as a telepathic message directly from this object.  I know this was real because we compared our experiences and all three of us felt the same thing and received the same &quot;information&quot;. Then the light continued in a straight line until it went over the horizon.Now the important thing about this experience is the &quot;message&quot; or &quot;impression&quot; we all received from the object which I will describe the best I can.This object was a group of beings that were aware of us watching them and they timed their loop maneuver somehow so it would seem to us that they had looped around a star.  Of course this star was millions of miles away so these beings had some way of seeing themselves through our eyes or maybe calculating everything perfectly, distance and angle and such.  They did the loop just to amaze us in a playful, humorous way. We all had the impression that these beings were beneficial and had a sense of humor.  At the same time, the beings imparted to us a very strong impression that they were watching over all of us on this planet and not to worry, they weren&apos;t going to let anything really bad happen like us destroying ourselves or something.  We were hit with a very nice sense of calm and well-being.  This feeling was very profound and life-changing for me; I can&apos;t speak for my companions after all these years but at the time they were just as deeply affected as I was.The loop this &quot;craft&quot; made was so fast and perfect as to be impossible for even the fastest airplane to do.  We all had the same impression that the &quot;craft&quot; was more of a ball of energy then an actual physical ship, the energy ball was a conglomeration of at least several beings traveling in a group.  I&apos;ve had the opinion since this experience that the &quot;visitors&quot; are capable of existing as pure energy and have no need of an actual craft.  This is why I don&apos;t put a lot of faith in most sightings I hear about that describe metallic craft and the like. I also really don&apos;t have a lot of faith in the &quot;abduction&quot; phenomena that is widely reported, I don&apos;t see the need these beings would have to actually physically abduct people since they are so far advanced they probably know everything they need to know about us just by sensing it somehow.I have only told a few prople about this in passing over the years and I really don&apos;t care who believes me.  But what happened was real and I don&apos;t know why they chose to contact us in this way or to impart this information to us, maybe they were just having some fun.  I hope this is something you can use.Note: I am not a mental patient nor have I ever had any type of mental or phychological episodes whatsoever.

I thought &quot;Not a jet, because a jet&apos;s tail extends behind it and stays in the sky looking like a whitish line and this ain&apos;t doing THAT!&quot;.

On Friday night, October 29, 2005, at approximately 18:51 hrs. (local/Pacific), I was driving south on Interstate 5, and was just north of Boeing Field, near the Albro/Swift Exit.  I was driving in the right hand lane, which affords the best view of Boeing Field of any of the lanes, given that it allows a person to look down on the airport, located on the west side of the highway. Despite the fact that my car radio was on (tuned to KING FM 98.1), and despite the fact that my windshield wipers were operating at a &quot;continuous&quot; setting, I became aware of the roar of jet engines, set at a high power setting.  Assuming that the aural report was from a jet aircraft taking off from the long runway (34 right), I glanced down at the airport to my right, expecting to see a jet beginning its take-off role. However, my attention was drawn to a jet aircraft that was streaking across Boeing Field at very high speed, and very low altitude, transverse to prevailing air traffic, i.e. it was streaking across the runway, flying from west to east!  Although I could not see the fuselage of the aircraft, I could see the cones of white hot exhaust, together with the shock cones clearly visible, streaming out the exhaust nozzles of the aircraft, permitting positive identification of the aircraft as a military, twin-engine jet fighter, therefore probably an F-18, an F-15, or an F-14.  As the aircraft passed over Interstate 5, having passed over Boeing field at approximately mid-field, it executed a slight, e.g. 5-10 degree, roll to its right, and it disappeared from my vision, passing over the slight hill to the east of the highway. I estimate that the aircraft was below 1,000 feet altitude, and perhaps below 500 feet, and it was traveling at between 200 and 400 knots.  The weather was poor, and the (lateral) visibility was not more than one mile, I estimate.  The ceiling, I suspect, was at approximately 1,000 feet, or less, and I was driving in light, though continuous, rain. In my thirty one years in Seattle, and during the 28 years that I have held a commercial pilot&apos;s license, I have never witnessed such a dramatic event in the vicinity of Boeing Field.  Given that the weather was so poor, I presume that conditions were conducive to IFR (instrument flight reference) only. The incident is being investigated by personnel who work in air traffic control.  They report that at least one other witness reported the peculiar incident. I have no reason to believe that the incident was, in any way, related to a UFO sighting or incident.

Was completely silent, close, and very largeMy girlfriend, brother, and myself we on our last day/night of vacation in North Myrtle Beach, S.C.  It was nearly the off-season and was pretty empty at the pool/patio area where we were.  We were at a table talking on the patio that borders the beach.  IT was a clear night and you could see stars, airplanes way up in sky, etc.  I was facing the beach, my brother on the left of me facing my girlfriend who was seated on the right of me.  I saw two lights appear about 400 yards out over the ocean  (orange-ish in color) that looked like wingtip lights of a large airplane that would be flying directly at us.  However it was much too low to be an airplane and it wasn&apos;t moving.  I got the attention of the two others with me who watched.  A 3rd (center light) then appeared.  The object was silent and not moving.  Then the lights disappeared.  It was there for a total of about 5 seconds.  We watched the ocean, waiting for something to happen.  About 4 minutes later the object reappeared closer and a bit to the left now.  It was now at about 200 yards (close) and it was not moving at all.  It was completely silent and you could see 3 lights rotating to the left (clockwise).  It had more lights but you could only see 3 at a time as the object was rotating in place on it&apos;s axis.  We were all shocked and my girlfriend who is a complete skeptic just kept saying &quot;Oh my God, Oh my God.&quot;   It stayed in the same spot (silently hovering) for about 15 seconds and then the lights turned off all at once and it was gone.  It did not reappear.  I noticed about 5 guys gather on the beach after this occured who were pointing toward the ocean.  I believe they saw the object also but to my regret, I did not ask them about it.  Did anyone else see this?

Was it space junk?   Was it only one event?  Or in the case of the truck driver&apos;s adamant description, is it possible that there were two (2) events in progress?  Or was it only one event, with a temporary change in altitude, speed, etc., with the light then proceeding on its westerly way unobserved by the truck driver?

We live in a very rural area, with no city lights to obstruct the night sky view and it was perfectly clear this evening so every star seemed visible. As soon as we pulled out of our driveway and headed south we saw 4-5 VERY bright lights in a row at about 45 degrees up from the horizon in the south western night sky.  We noticed them at the same time and simultaneously we said to each other &quot;What the h--- is that?&quot; The lights were in a row and glowing very brightly, probably 5x the brightness of the brightest planet/star in the sky.  They were so bright that we thought at first someone was shooting off fireworks somehwere south of us.  But it only took a second to realize that these lights were standing still, in a row. We stopped the truck and got out to see better as soon as we saw them.  Suddenly they began to move slowly to the west in this manner: the light to the far left end  of the row of lights would fade completely out and a new light would appear to the right end of the line and then the last one on the left would fade, then a new one appear to the right end of the line.  It kind of snaked its way along like that for about a minute. Then, we saw three more lights of equal brightness forming what appeared to be a large triangle formation around the first group of lights, but at a distance.  These lights glowed brightly, then dimmed completely out, then glowed brightly again, then dimmed completely out. After about 4 repetitions, all the lights diappeared, then the sky in the area they had been in was filled with random sparkles of light, much smaller then the first lights.  After about another 30 seconds we saw a single bright light identical to the first ones more to the south and higher in the sky.  It got very bright then dimmed completely out probably 3 times before disappearing. Then we spotted another one, this time in the west, about 70 degrees up from the horizon.  Same bright light, exact same intensity, same glowing and dimming pattern.  After about three reps it, too, faded completely out and we saw more of the small sparkles. At first I thought &apos;meteor shower&apos; but meteors don&apos;t come in in lines, nor fade and glow over and over, do they?  The last set of sparkles took on a pattern, like: 3 blinks, no blinks, 3 blinks, no blinks, and moved in a very randam, almost haphazard pattern.  It was too weird. This all took place in about a five minute time span.  We got back in the truck, going on and on to each other about how cool and weird that was.  We headed east toward town and I spotted another light, exact same brilliance, to the southwest again, same dimming and glowing pattern, then disappearing.  And again, after it disappeared, there were two sparkly lights, doing the 3x blink pattern. I have never seen anything like this before, and would welcome any sensible explanation!  We saw several airplane lights in the sky at the same time, as we alwasy do at night, but they were obviously just that, airplanes, blinking, moving slowly across the sky. These things were NOT airplanes.", "Observance of UFO over military base in 1979 or 1980Occurred many years ago, but while my father was stationed at the Whidbey Island, Wa Naval Air Station, my mother and I obeserved a UFO. We were coming back from a friends house later at night, it was a clear night and dark with no cloud cover. We stopped to get the mail from our box, and my mom said to look out the window. In the sky was a large and very bright circular object, yellow in color with a streaking appearance to it, as if you threw something wet and the water would come off it as it flies. The streaks were yellow and would disappear. Here is the interesting portion of the event. Behind the craft/UFO was a Naval jet from NAS Whidbey, probably an A-6 Intruder, which were stationed there, chasing it. The craft flew behind the trees and we lost view of it. The A-6, about half a mile behind it, followed, and we lost sight of it. We went into the house and never heard anything about it. I have since served in the military, and have never seen anything of the like of this occurrence. I was young, but this is still very clear in my mind. I never reported it until now as I never knew of a place to report such info.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

At first my wife and I thought someone had fired off some fire works but then we noticed that it lasted way to long and the trajectory did not match that of a fire cracker.  Then we thought it was an airplane but the light also shortly after certainly was not that of a plane. So we thought possibly it was a meteorite but we have never seen a meteorite last as long as this light did and it got closer and closer to the horizon and then it disappeared.  I have seen some interesting sights over the years such as the Northern Lights when I lived in Washington and when I made trips to Canada but this was unique.  I do not believe that life from other planets, similar to ourselves, is visiting us because of the technology that would have to be obtained and that even at the speed of light it would take milleniums just to travel any where in the universe.  I do believe in higher life forms of an angelic type but  such contact at this point in time would be of those angels that have rebelled against man&apos;s creator and are actually enemies of mankind which is reflected in 2 Corinthians 11:14, 1 John 5:19 and Revelation 12:9.  But I strongly do not believe that this situation has anything to do with what we saw. I would like a logical explaination for this unidentified red light appearance.  Was the red light caused by some type of natural occurance or was it man made?  After my wife saw the light she told me that a teen age son of a friend of ours saw the same type of light last night.  He shared this with my wife this afternoon at about 1 pm when my wife was visiting with his mother.", "After retrieving a few items from the trunk of my car, I noticed three objects following each other in a line, flying north, then northeast in an arc. The lights appeared at first glance to be nothing more than commercial air traffic, but following extremely close to each other, and clearly at the same altitude.  I watched this formation for three minutes. A small red blinking ball of light was leading a cross shaped object, and the third object was shaped like the bracket key on a keypad, flying with the two small appendages towards the ground and at its sides.  The cross shape blinked alternately red and white.  The bracket shape blinked at the same time on its appendages.  One blue, the other white. The small red object in the lead, blinked red with some white to it.  This small object also seemed to shine a faint white beam in front of it and moved to the left and right. As it flew in this arcing pattern, the last object flew above the second cross shape and maintained this position for fifteen seconds.  The bracket shape then slowed below the speed of the first two, and sank back to its original position.  The last two objects were the size of a quarter at arms length.  They must have been at high altitude because i did not lose sight of it behind any ground based structure.  It just flew far away and became faint. The sky around this event was clear.", "floating, moving  object in Park Rapids,MNMy wife and I were taking our two dogs out to do their duty,when we had seen a strange light I mistook as a bright version of Mars. As we kept looking at it,the color was more golden than anything else.  As we continued looking at it, it was moving in a erratic behavior, similiar to the pattern the lady you reported in Canada saw.  It had been showing itself at night every night this week.

We had happened to look up at the stars so that I can see if the Planet Venus was out that night?  Meanwhile, while we were stargazing, there was this odd looking airship that had neither any wings nor any propellers on it.  It was in a shape of a bottom of an ice-cream bowl. it made a low gargle-ling humming sound.  It had started to floated eastward towards by Midway Airport, and then this object had flown out west just like a shooting star.  And we&rsquo;ve never seen it again. My grandma said that it was a shooting star, but I saw it different, it was more of a strange object to me rather than a shooting star. Back then, I was 12-years-old at the time back in 1972, we were living over on xxrd and Oak Park Ave. I was living with my grandmother at the time, because my mother had passed away in 1970  During that time frame my life was much different than any other ordinary child, due to my handicap disability my experiences were un-explainable.

We saw the object in the western sky at about 45 degree elevation.  It appeared to us to not be that far away.  I called the local airport to see if they had gotten any other reports, but they had not.  The object was exibiting a non ballistic flight pattern.  Up, down, left, right but primarily moving from south to north.  It was a bright orange color, not blinking.  Even though I know alot about planes and hellicopters, I don&apos;t know how I would explain this motion.  I am a bit of a skeptic, I don&apos;t usually believe in this sort of stuff.  The thing that sealed it for me was the fact that the object changed from bright orange to electric blue for a few seconds then back to orange.  It did this several times during its transit of the sky which lasted 2 or 3 min.  This color change along with the non ballistic flight really puzzled me.  I have no idea what we saw.  Some background:  I also saw the same thing in the early summer around 10:00pm one evening.  No color change that time, but non ballistic flight.

The first light I observed made an almost complete circle around the crescent moon.  From ground level it is impossible to verify the height, shape or speed of the object, however it seems to be extremely high in the sky.  I believe the light is reflected off the sun much like observed satellites at this time of evening/night, because after dark I was no longer to see the moving light/object.  To reiterate, the light/object in no way moves like a satellite or aircraft.

Smith chevron sighting.This is a follow-up to my recent post here regarding the specific chevron-shaped object.  I have since done some research that would dispel two of my theories.  I contacted a retired B-58 crew member who confirmed that the leading edge of the wing did not glow when supersonic. I have also researched the possiblity of the XB-70.  The Final Report on the the XB-70 program published in 1972 lists every flight of each of the giant delta wing aircraft.  A/V-2 had already crashed by the time of this sighting. A/V-1 was flying. I have been unable to determine if the XB-70 did any night flying, or flying significantly away from Edwards AFB, CA.  From reading the chief test pilot&apos;s summary, I would highly doubt that this aircraft did either.  It was a very complex aircraft, often having malfunctions requiring unique support.  To intentionally stray from its support base would be doubtful. Also, it was a very crudely equipped and instrumented aircraft in its experimental form.  Its single TACAN worked poorly, requiring the crew to rely heavily on FAA ATC for help with navigation. There is one long-shot date of possibility. The aircraft flew on 8/24/67 for over two hours, reached over Mach 2, and an altitude of 58,000 feet.  If the actual sighting that I witnessed occured on this date, it would be an interesting coincidence.So, I believe that leaves this sighting on mysterious footing.  Other possible aircraft of the day are the CIA A-12 Blackbird and its followers, the YF-12 and SR-71. That will take more research and will probably be more difficult to find records in the public domain.((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the source of this report for his having done such nice investigative work regarding his sighting.

We had to night hike for a few hours on Friday.  The exact location of the sighting was across from a dirt boat ramp on Sweetwater Lake, which our hiking trail passed by. As we broke into the field that runs along the lake and watershed, the fog was very thick.  This is when we first noticed flashing that we assumed to be heat lighting or something similar.  By the time we reached the boat ramp, we were away from the field and completely out of the fog. The flashes were coming from 3 points.  Two points were far away enough that the source could not be seen.  The 3rd flashing was across the lake and only a short distance inland (I guessed around 100 yards at the most).  The light was flashing at various intensity, length, and time.  Ranging from a very small fraction of a second to nearly a second.  The intensity also ranged from:  just enough of a flash to see the low level clouds light up with a white ambient light, to a bizarre ball of light that peaked over the tree line by many feet.  When the ball of light was large enough, it resembled plasma.  The colors were red, yellow, white, purple, etc.  The ball also appeared to move around, by maybe 30 yards to the left or right. Other than describing it as plasma, my friend suggested the side of a huge water tower was reflecting the flashes at us.  There is no structure at all in the area.  The flashes were coming from the center of the Talladega National Forest, indeed, there is no plumbing. I should also note that the &quot;ball of light&quot; as I&apos;ve called it, was only 300 yards away at most, and completely silent.  We watched the 3 flashes for about 30 minutes until they became quite infrequent.  It was such a strange thing to see and we still have no good idea as to what it was. I hike there frequently and may inspect the area sometime. My best guess to date is that we saw military testing of some kind. Heflin, the nearest city, as I now know, has many reports of strange sightings and some other odd things.  The Fort McClellan Military Reservation was to our West as we watched the light to our East.  The Comanche helicopter was supposedly tested in that area. Also, that whole area of Alabama is a huge military arsenal.  The military has installed solar powered sirens throughout the forest recently and some old timers explained that there is a history of weapons buried in the forest during the Cold War era who&apos;s keepers died with the knowledge of their location.

As the object came over my house and back into view I looked at it through the binoculars and I could see only a perfectly round white object. It had no blinking aviation lights and was moving extremely slow like it was gliding or floating. I heard absolutely no noise for as a plane at that height of which I estimate to be between 4,000 and 10,000 feet I would have heard. The light did not change in hue or intensity no matter what angle on the horizon the object moved. The shade of white also did not resemble a plane&apos;s lights. As if flew over my house and was now 30 degrees in the sky and flying away from me, the light started to fade, not turn off but get dimmer and dimmer (in a cloudless clear sky) and then disappeared with no other lights visible. What was strange was 3 things. First there was only one bright perfectly round white light with no other aviation lights, 2./It moved extremely slow at the level it was at-It seemed that it was moving so slow that a plane couldn&apos;t have flew that slow and finally 3./there was absolutely no noise at the altitude it was at.

PD)) Cosmic bolt probed in shuttle disaster  Scientists poring over &apos;infrasonic&apos; sound waves  Sabin Russell, Chronicle Staff Writer  Friday, February 7, 2003Federal scientists are looking for evidence that a bolt of electricity in the upper atmosphere might have doomed the space shuttle Columbia as it streaked over California, The Chronicle has learned.Investigators are combing records from a network of ultra-sensitive instruments that might have detected a faint thunderclap in the upper atmosphere at the same time a photograph taken by a San Francisco astronomer appears to show a purplish bolt of lightning striking the shuttle.Should the photo turn out to be an authentic image of an electrical event on Columbia, it would not only change the focus of the crash investigation, but it could open a door on a new realm of science.&quot;We&apos;re working hard on the data set. We have an obligation,&quot; said Alfred Bedard, a scientist at the federal Environmental Technology Laboratory in Boulder, Colo. He said the lab was providing the data to NASA but that it was too early to draw any conclusions from the sounds of the shuttle re-entry.The lab has been listening to the sounds of ghostly electromagnetic phenomena in the upper atmosphere, dubbed sprites, blue jets and elves. For some time, scientists have speculated on whether these events could endanger airliners or returning spacecraft.A study conducted 10 years ago for NASA found that there is a 1-in-100 chance that a space shuttle could fly through a sprite, although it concluded that the consequences of such an event were unclear. And in 1989, an upper- atmospheric electrical strike &quot;shot down&quot; a high-altitude NASA balloon 129,000 feet over Dallas.NASA officials have said they are looking for a &quot;missing link&quot; to explain the shuttle&apos;s breakup that killed seven astronauts Saturday, and they are downplaying the theory that foam insulation falling from the shuttle&apos;s extra tank may have contributed to the shuttle&apos;s demise. The little-known infrasound project at the Environmental Technology Laboratory operates a network of sophisticated electronic ears that can pick up subaudible thuds of waves crashing on either coast of the United States and the hiss of meteors and spacecraft re-entering the atmosphere thousands of miles away.Sound waves of this nature are called &quot;infrasonic&quot; and are below the range of human hearing but travel unimpeded for extraordinary distances. Arrays of infrasonic sensors in the high Colorado plains east of Boulder recently have been looking for the crackle of the ghostly electromagnetic events in the Earth&apos;s upper atmosphere.&quot;We basically detect events at very long ranges,&quot; Bedard said. But he stressed that it was too early to draw any conclusions from sounds of the shuttle re-entry. Bedard said the acoustic sensors had previously detected the re-entry of a space shuttle from Northwest Canada to the Kennedy Space Center.CELESTIAL THUNDERCLAP Originally, it was thought that the electrical charges in the thin atmosphere 50 miles above Earth were too dispersed to create infrasound. But Los Alamos National Laboratories physicist Mark Stanley said that, on closer inspection, &quot;we&apos;ve seen very strong ionization in sprites&quot; indicating that there were enough air molecules ionized to cause heating and an accompanying pulse -- a celestial thunderclap, as it were.NASA administrators confirmed Thursday that the photograph, taken from Bernal Heights in San Francisco by an amateur astronomer, is being evaluated by Columbia crash investigators. However, Shuttle Program Manager Ron Dittemore told reporters at a Houston news briefing that right now NASA is trying only to verify &quot;the validity&quot; of the image.The astronomer, who has asked that his name not be used, has declined to release the digital image to the media. But earlier in the week, he permitted Chronicle reporters to view the image and invited one to his home Tuesday evening, when the camera, and a disk of the image, were turned over to former shuttle astronaut Tammy Jernigan for transit to Houston.The image was also e-mailed Tuesday evening to Ralph Roe Jr., chief engineer for the shuttle program at Johnson Space Flight Center in Houston.Dittemore would not say during the news conference whether NASA has ruled in or ruled out one possible explanation for the photo: that the image could have been caused by jiggling of the camera. It was a Nikon M-880 mounted on a tripod. The automatically timed exposure of four to six seconds was triggered by finger.&quot;We have to validate whether it is real,&quot; Dittemore said. &quot;This particular one is no different from the others. . . . It has yet to be determined whether this is important to us or not.&quot; SEEKING EVIDENCE NASA officials have stressed the importance of photographic, video or debris evidence from the earliest moments of the shuttle&apos;s distress, which sensors indicate began at about 5:53 a.m. above California. That&apos;s when sensors in a wheel well blinked out, in the words of NASA investigators, &quot;as if someone cut a wire.&quot; That is also roughly the time during which the amateur photographer snapped his image of Columbia as it streaked across the sky north of San Francisco. A precise time may be mapped by matching the photo and the strange electrical signature to the crisp background field of stars.Physicists have long jokingly referred to the lower reaches of the ionosphere -- which fluctuates in height around 40 miles -- as the &quot;ignorosphere,&quot; due to the lack of understanding of this mysterious realm of rarefied air and charged electric particles.The family of &quot;transient&quot; electrical effects occupy this part of the sky, including sprites, which leap from the ionosphere to the tops of thunderheads, and blue jets, which leap from thunderhead anvils to the ionosphere.Streamers of static electricity can travel these realms at speeds 100 times that of ground lightning, or 20 million miles an hour.Ten years ago, Walter Lyons, a consultant with FMA Research Inc. in Fort Collins, Colo., conducted a study of sprite danger for NASA. &quot;We concluded that there is about 1 chance in 100 that a shuttle could fly through a sprite. What impact, we didn&apos;t know for certain. It didn&apos;t appear at this time that the energy would be enough to cause problems.&quot; But Lyons conceded that the &quot;ignorosphere&quot; is a mysterious place that has yielded startling surprises. &quot;Since then, with research on electrical streamers, the discovery of blue jets, the doubt has gone up,&quot; he said.&quot;There are other things up there that we probably don&apos;t know about,&quot; Lyons said. &quot;Every time we look in that part of the atmosphere, we find something totally new.&quot; LACK OF RESEARCH FUNDING But the field is dominated by a small club of electrophysicists who have seen their money for research dry up. Ironically, an experiment of Israeli astronaut Ilan Ramon, aboard the doomed Columbia, was among the last fully funded work conducted on sprites. Lyons, considered to be one of the leading authorities, said he played a role in the design of the experiment.To date, sprites have required the presence of a significant electrical storm on the ground. As the shuttle passed over Northern California, there were some heavy rain showers in the far north of the state, but none of the wild weather normally associated with sprites.Hearing a description of the purplish, luminous corkscrew in the San Francisco photograph, Lyons said, &quot;This was not a sprite event . . . but maybe it is another electrical phenomenon we don&apos;t know about.&quot; Whether or not an electrical discharge might be involved in the demise of Columbia, there is precedent for an event like this.Scientists have observed interaction between a blue jet and a meteor. And in December 1999, Los Alamos National Laboratories researcher David Suszcynsky and colleagues, including Lyons, published an account of a meteor that apparently triggered a sprite. Their account is published in the Journal of Geophysical Research.&quot;It was a singular observation that had us all scratching our heads,&quot; said Lyons. In the strange world of sprite and elf research, scientists have documented one event in which some sort of high atmospheric event &quot;shot down&quot; a high-altitude balloon over Dallas.On June 5, 1989, before the first sprite was ever photographed, a NASA balloon carrying a heavy pack of instruments suffered &quot;an uncommanded payload release&quot; at 129,000 feet, according to Lyons. It landed in an angry Dallas resident&apos;s front yard.Investigators found scorch marks on the debris and considered it one of the first bits of solid evidence that sprites exist. As a result of the accident, NASA no longer flies balloons over thunderstorms.Ironically, the balloon was launched from a NASA facility in Palestine, Texas, one of the towns where debris from the space shuttle Columbia fell Saturday.

It seemed to be in outer space, and I thought it was a satellite. I soon realized it was moving at &quot;sporadic&quot; rates of speed, it would stop, and go, and change direction seemingly randomly.  After raising and lowering from about 40 degrees in the sky to 30 degrees in the sky again at sporadic rates of speed for about five minuets, it started to move to the west, to the point I was looking north at it, where it stopped and held its place for about 30 seconds.There were very few small clouds that night, and one of them happened to be passing over the moon which was bright.  I could see the object more clearly when the moon was covered, and spotted two (2) more crafts approaching from the east.  At this time I was under the impression that they were in our atmosphere, and I could see more detail, they seemed to be oval in shape, and possibly metallic in color, and slightly reflected the moons light when the red blinking lights paused.The first object was holding its ground while they moved from my east to north field of view, and as the second and third object held speed at my approximation of over 300 MPH or at about the speed of a jet.  The first object instantly picked up speed and traveled in triangular formation with the other two seamlessly, as they did not hesitate or slow down.  They then seemed to grow brighter, or move closer to my location. I could make out a fourth ship, which came from under the tree line/horizon and did not follow in formation instead rising in the sky and movingly slightly North East.  The first three objects continued to move to my west, where they stopped, and the third most eastern object would stray off to a random direction and the other two would then lag behind for milliseconds, then have to keep up with the third ship to keep formation.  The fourth object was moving sporadically in all directions, at different speeds, ranging from very a halt to faster than an airplane.The fourth object then moved behind one of the clouds in the sky, and then reappeared on the other side as it traveled South East.  The first three objects were hovering about 30 degrees over the horizon.  The fourth object then was flying south to the point where I had to look away from the first three objects, where I could not see it.  The first three objects then started to move east, and I could see them more clearly then ever. They had three (3) red lights, seemingly moving as if electrons around an atom, around the ship, pulsing or blinking at different seemingly random rates and times.  They then moved south, and seemed to get more distant as if flying upward.  They continued to grow fainter over the last five minuets, as they moved south and lower in the sky below the tree line.The objects did not produce any apparent smoke, or exhaust or a trail of any kind, nor did they make any noise.Abruptly afterwards I called my friends that live 30 miles north east of me and told them to look for them, and to my surprise they had been watching them for the last thirty minuets as well, and told a very similar story to mine.This could not have been a hallucination; I was of well state of mind and sober, as well as all witnesses.", "10/23/05; Park Valley, Utah; rectangular; 4-5 seconds, looked like a flying boxcar; posted 10/28/05Time:  Sunday Evening, 10-23-05, about 11:00 PM Place: Somewhere along Hwy. 30, Northern Utah, west of Hwy. 84 around Park Valley Event: UFO Sighting  My two sons, 24 &amp; 30 yrs. old, one of their friends (asleep at the time) and I were traveling back home to California from Preston, Idaho.  I was driving at the time along a very dark roadway (clear skies with a waning partial moon) looking for the correct turn toward Wells, Nevada, when the 3 of us that were awake saw an object above the truck.I was wide-awake for we mandated that a &lsquo;co-pilot&rsquo; always stay awake to keep the driver alert and it was still the early part of the trip.  ((name #1 deleted)) was the co-pilot while ((name #3 deleted)) and sleeping ((name #2 deleted)  were in the back seat.  ((name #3 deleted)) was helping us navigate correctly (extremely minimal highway signage in that part of the country).  ((name #3 deleted)) could also see the object while sitting in the back seat of the 4-door pick-up truck.  The truck we were in is a 2005 Chevy with a lift-kit, thus the headlights (on high beam at the time) shine higher than a normal truck and are very, very bright covering a good distance and a wide, high area. I don&rsquo;t believe that we would have seen the object if the headlights operated as manufactured. The surrounding countryside was devoid of anything except relatively flat land with low brush and the roadway.  All three of us saw the unidentifiable object in the lower sky, traversing relatively fast from left to right.  I&rsquo;m surmising South to North or SE&rsquo;ly to NW&rsquo;ly. It was sometime between 10 PM and midnight. My rendition of the sighting: I recall the object traversed a visible distance of maybe 1000 feet and was seen for about 4- 5 seconds. It appeared to be about 300 - 500 feet in front of us (about 1/2 the distance of the traverse or less) and at 200- 300 feet in altitude (about 3 times the visible length).  For some reason at the time it reminded me of a &lsquo;flying boxcar with windows&rsquo;, I don&rsquo;t know why but that&rsquo;s what I sensed it looked like. The definitely-visible portion of the object was roughly rectangular in shape and hazy around the edges (long-ways parallel with the ground) with several (4 - 6) dimly lit &lsquo;windows&rsquo; along that length.  The &lsquo;windows&rsquo; seemed more square-like in shape as I recall, rather than round-like. At each end of the object was a roughly-visible indistinct area that was darker-than-the-sky and about 1/2 the definitely-visible length, or more.   A distinct outline of the entire object wasn&rsquo;t evident and it seemed there was no distinct bottom.  Again, as previously stated it appeared to look like a &quot;flying boxcar with windows&quot; or to a lot lesser degree a passenger train car, while sensing at the time the feeling that a massive, heavy object was traveling in the wrong place, the sky. The light intensity reflecting off the object was similar to watching a car maybe 20-30 feet away drive through the beam of a fixed flashlight held horizontal.  The visual clarity was slightly dull with no sort of glowing or trailing evident.  I definitely recall the object was absolutely silent and colorless. I believe that I can judge distances fairly well because  I like to hunt upland game &amp; waterfowl and am also a licensed land surveyor.", "Bright bell shaped object with pronounced light blue sphere shape encircling the bell with an amazing flying ability.Approximately 1830 pm I pulled out of the company parking lot after work.  This company is located in Wolf Lake, Illinois. I started for home turning left out of the company heading south on Highway 3 heading approximately 17 miles to Illinois 141 which heads west across the Bill Emerson Bridge into Missouri. I noticed a very bright light in the sky that on first glance appeared to be a very bright star.  I went approximately 4 miles south and kept glancing at the light which was at approximately 3 o&apos;clock out my passenger side window and noticed that the light appeared then to be moving south and was paralleling at what appeared to be the same rate of speed.  I was driving the speed limit which was 55 miles per hour for that highway. The light was very bright and as I continued south the light almost seemed to wobble as it moved through the air.  My best quess at it&apos;s was maybe 1500 to 2000 feet off the ground.  The light seemed to almost stop at one point and when I would slow down it seemed as if it would too.  As I got further south the light appeared to speed up and eventually I was watching it at about 1:00 o&apos;clock out of the windshield.  I watched it all the way to 141 and I turned due west on 141.  The light moved further south and west and it appeared to move over the Lonestar Concrete factory just south of Cape Girardeau and at that point I thought it must be a plane or chopper because this is the general direction of the Cape Girardeau Airport. I never saw any aircraft blinking lights, it was a solid light with an erractic flying behavior.  At this point the light came back toward highway 141 and again seemed to parellel me as I crossed the Bill Emerson bridge.  I continued west toward Interstate 55 which is approximately 4 miles once you cross the bridge. The light was south and slightly west but was moving back to the north as I neared the interstate.  Once I turned north onto I 55, the light then moved at a high rate of speed and again seemed to be parelleling me as I proceeded north on 55.  The light got much closer at this point and the appearance of wobbling as it moved was very visible and it began to take shape which was like a bell shape and at one point I could see a very distinct blue sphere of light encircling the bell shape. I continued north bound now very intriqued as you can imagine and I kept my speed at 50 to 55 miles per hour because now the light was in 9 and 1000 o&apos;clock window out my driver side door.  My intended exit was the Jackson Missouri/Fruitland exit which is my exit to go home in Jackson.  This is approximately 10 miles from Cape were I got on the interstate.  The light was very bright and would speed up and slow down and even hover almost as if it was regulating it&apos;s speed to keep up with me. At this time I tried to call my wife to ask her to step out of our house and see if she could see the light although I doubt she could because the light was to low.I exited off I 55 and turned left heading back south into Jackson.  Now the light was about in my 12:00 o&apos;clock position, very bright with the bell shape and the blue sphere.  As I drove south I tried to call my wife again.  This distance from the interstate to my turn off into my subdivision is approximately 4 miles. The light then moved slowly to the west and I intentionally did not turn off at my subdivision because I wanted to see were the light would go.  I watched the light drift over the Jackson City Park which is near my house.  I then turned due west on route D in Jackson and drove about 1 mile turning left or south on to Broadridge. The light drifted in front of me heading west and slightly south. There is a water tower on that side of the city and it made a great reference point as the light moved west of the tower.  I then turned immediately off of Broadridge onto a small dead end drive called independence medical street because it gave me a great viewing vantage point.  There were very few city lights to make it difficult to see the light.  The light then stopped south and west of me and south and west of the water tower.  It took on that distinct wobbling behavior and was very bright with the blue sphere intermitenly visible. It should be noted that when I was on 141 I rolled my window down to hear if there would be any engine noise.  There wasn&apos;t.  And when I was watching the light from the last vantage point, I turned off my lights, turned off my truck, took the keys out of the ignition and I got out to watch and listen.. There was never any engine noise. At one point I turned my lights on and off and the light seemed to get brighter as if it was actually coming closer.  It stood stationary with only the wobbling effect and the appearance of moving slightly side to side.  It never moved for twenty minutes.  Finally the light appeared to move south and west and I lost sight of it. I know it wasn&apos;t an aircraft (airplane or helicopter) nor was it a star or anything else like I&apos;ve ever seen.&hellip;((NUFORC Note:  We do not know for certain what the witness observed, but we note that Venus is VERY prominent in the southwestern sky, at present.

I am familiar with the the visual sensation known as hysteresis I.e., a light will seem to move if stared at for a time.  While observing the night sky near Austin TX at about 6:15 pm,  I noticed a light in the high western sky which was barely discernable moving approximately south to north.  I assumed it was a satellite, but it soon started to turn in a curving motion.  It also slowed to almost a stop and then accelerated sharply.  The actions it took could not have been that of a satellite or high flying aircraft. I kept sight of the light for at least 2 or 3 minutes before I lost it.  A few minutes later I picked up another light with similar actions.  As stated it had all the appearance of a high flying satellite but no satellite could possible move like this light.   Anyone else closely observing the night sky at this time could not have failed to see the same movement as I did.

What we all (a couple neighbors also came out and witnessed them) were five bright lights (amber-colored) which were holding steady in the shape of a giant &quot;W&quot; up in the night sky.  The formation was approx 25 degrees abv horizon, sky was clear and dark (1.5 hrs after sunset.) The lights held position, evenly-spaced, for approx 5 mins, during which time I ran back inside my house to get the video camera, but battery was dead!   At one point, watched a small, civilian plane approach the formation, then turn away and circle a couple times before departing.  From our perspective, believe the plane was closer to us than the bright lights. When &quot;W&quot; formation broke apart, they did so one by one, starting w/furthest N or right side, turn away, then vanish after a couple seconds, then next one, and so on.  Next day, I spoke w/military contacts who researched and told me no milair was up over the Eglin reservation in NW Florida at time of sighting.  Am a retired USAF Special Ops aviator w/nearly 5,000 hrs of flight time in a wide range of fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft, and I can&apos;t explain what we watched that night.

There were no milair in the area (Eglin Military Reservation) at the time of sighting (I checked w/base) but one small civilian plane did fly into the area during time of sighting.  It flew N to S, crossing in front of formation, then circled a 180 back N until it was clear of our view, then did a 360 before departing back to N.  We all felt the small plane was closer to us than the bright lights, since we could see it&apos;s red and green wing beacons and white anti-collision strobe.

He continued to watch the formation of lights in an attempt to identify what type of aircraft they were.  As he continued driving W, he realized the formation (described as sort of a diamond shape) wasn&apos;t moving, but just hung in the sky at approx 35-40 degrees elevation.  Since he was driving, he couldn&apos;t remain visually fixed on the formation, and after approx 10 mins of glancing while driving, he glanced back and realized the lights were no longer there.  He did not see them depart, but claims he had only looked away from the formation to the road a matter of a few seconds.Witness 2 was also driving W-bound on Hwy 98 near Navarre and observed a similar formation of lights.  He at first assumed they were AFSOC helos on a night training mission, but after several minutes of driving realized his helos were still there, in the same angular, diamond-like formation, and the lights continued to hold position, hovering at what appeared to be very high altitude.  He said as he continued his drive W he doubted his helicopter formation theory more and more, especially when the formation broke apart.  He described the formation break as a one-by-one realignment into almost a straight line, with some decending and some ascending, then the light on the far end of the formation suddenly veered away from the others and vanished.  This pattern of breakaway continued for the next minute, until all the lights were gone.  He has no explanation as to the source of the lights, but is very familiar with flares and other air-ordnance which could cause illumination, and stated &quot;These lights were under controlled guidance.&quot; Witness 3 was driving N on Hwy 87 after turning from it&apos;s intersection w/Hwy 98.  He witnessed &quot;several bright lights&quot; through the trees off to the western sky.  He at first thought they were stars or planets, but as he got more glimpses through the trees, he said he realized they were &quot;way too bright&quot; to be either stars or planets.  He then also assumed they were a formation of helos doing night ops, and didn&apos;t pay much more attention until he turned W-bound off Hwy 87 onto East Bay Rd just south of Holley.  That was when he saw the lights better and re-evaluated them as &quot;unknown.&quot;  He only saw them for a minute or less after turning onto East Bay Rd before each light &quot;took off like a bat outta hell&quot; and the lights winked off, one by one.  He said he believes there were four or five lights in all.None of the above three Air Force flyers reported seeing other aircraft in the sky during their incidents, and all three reported the times at somewhere between 18:30 and 18:50, lasting from 5-10 mins in duration.((END ADDENDUM #2))", "RAINBOW PHOTO IN OREGON SHOWS TRIANGLE OBJECT IN SKY.THE FOLLOWING WAS AN EXCERPT FROM THE HAND WRITTEN ACCOUT ON THIS SIGHTING SUBMITTED TO THIS INVESTIGATOR, PHOTO HAS BEEN SENT TO NUFORC IN A PREVIOUS EMAIL. &quot;ON THE AFTERNOON OF JULY 12, 1990,  I NEEDED TO USE THE LAST 2 FRAMES OF A ROLL OF FILM I WANTED TO DEVELOP.

WHEN DEVELOPED, THE NEXT TO THE LAST FRAME HAD WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A DUST PARTICLE ON THE PICTURE. BUT WHEN I CHECKED THE NEGATIVE, IT WAS VISABLE THERE TOO.&quot;   ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SENT IN REGARDS TO THIS PHOTO AND SIGHTING FROM THIS INVESTIGATOR. This is a photo of an unknown object taken about late evening 12 July 1990.  The local farmer I received the photo from was taking a shot of the &quot;rainbow&quot;.  When he had it developed, the object was noticed. It also shows up in the negative, so it is not from the processing.  It was taken from his front porch, the dark area in the upper right corner is the roof line of his house. The witness lives on the corner of Ten Bush and Fort Hill Rd. here in Willamina, Oregon.  He is a long time resident here since about 16, he is 72 years of age now. He is an advid photographer. This object is estimated at about 2000-3000 feet in altitude, at a range of about 1/2 mile to under a mile.  Flight direction looks to be south by southeast.  The lights seen in the bottem of the photograph is the local wood mill here, estimated time was about 7-8pm on the 12th of July. Witness does not remember anything being in the photograph except the rainbow... it was taken with a 35 mm. camera.  I live right at the top of Oak Lane, so I am familiar with this area... Currently, the witness is writing his account on the sighting with some additional info on a &quot;blue sphere&quot; his wife saw in the same area just a few years back.  Most the land around this area is Confederated Tribal Lands of the Grand Ronde ... so it has some interesting history.  I will forward this on your site. I scanned and enhanced the object.. which is interesting.  The closest military base is a Air Guard  Base, but for the 3 years I have lived in this area, I have never seen any low flying military a/c in the area, except for choppers.  For now this object is &quot;unknown&quot; as for its orgin, as it does not conform with any conventional commercial or military aircraft I have seen.((NUFORC Note:  We have not yet received the photograph, to the best of our knowledge.

There was no visible trail.  My first inclination was that it was a falling star; it was travelling in a straight line, and I tried to point it out to my son beside me, but found myself sputtering and unable to say anything till it was gone; about 5 seconds.  It appeared to be within our atmosphere, but way up; perhaps 5000 feet, (guessing from how high passenger jets usually fly) and would have been able to fit a couple of those passenger jets inside of it.

WE HAD A PAIR OF BINOCULARS IN THE TRUCK.  WE GOT THEM FOCUSED ON THE BRIGHT YELLOW LIGHT. WHAT WE SAW WAS A TOP-SHAPED OBJECT THAT WAS SO BRIGHT IT WAS LIKE MOLTEN, FIREY,WHITE-YELLOW METAL.

After my mom and I saw the UFO, I put it out of my mind for a while, I guess I was thinking we had just imagined it.  Anyways, the subject came up with a good friend a little while ago.  I confessed to having seen what I thought was a UFO, and thinking she would laugh at me.  However, she instead confessed her UFO experience that happened also many years ago in California. This got me thinking about it again, I brought it up with my mom to see if she remembered it and to see if it was really imagined.  My mom also remembers it vividly and also still wonders about it.  Reading other stories on this site, it doesn&apos;t sound so spectatular, but for me it was an amazing thing that makes me believe that I don&apos;t yet understand everything about our world and other worlds. So...what happened is that I was living with my family on a ranch near Pryor, MT, on the Crow Indian Reservation.  The Pryor Mountains are rumored to be a scared ((sic--sacred??)) place and the Crows have many stories of bizarre occurances there, including UFO sitings.  Still, didn&apos;t think we&apos;d ever see one.  Where we were living is very remote.  We did actually have one neighbor about a 1/2 mile away, other than that, there was no one for apx. 6 miles.  The house sat is a coulee between two ridges, with the Pryor mountains to the South of us.  We were driving down the hill toward the house with a clear view across the valley to the other ridge.  There, floating above the other ridge across from us was a very bright, large light, like a huge spotlight.  It just floated there for apx. 20-30 minutes.  We sat and watched it for awhile, then went down to the house, came back out and it was still there.  When we next checked on it, it was gone.  It was too large to be a car headlight, or a star, and too high off the ground for any other reasonable explanation.  Hoping someone could shed some light (no pun intended) as to what we saw.

I believe it happened between 1980 and 1982.  I would have been between 10 and 12 years old. One night before going to bed around 10:00 p.m., I was looking out the window of my bedroom in my family&apos;s 11th story apartment in Jersey City, NJ, when I noticed a large blimp shaped object hovering slowly toward our apartment complex.  I had often seen the Good Year Blimp passing by are apartment building, and being a child I always found them somewhat interesting and worth watching.  Back then, I liked to read the advertisements that scrolled along the side of the blimp in the array of lights that Good Year Blimps had for advertisements. This time however, something was different. As the object approached closer, I realized that the lights on the side of the object were not reading any messages or advertisements.  The lights were just flashing randomly.  My first impression was &quot;wow, it must be broken&quot;. Then as the object approached even closer I realized that the lights were extremely bright, far brighter than I had ever seen on a Good Year Blimp. As for the color, I only remember the lights being white. They were all over the craft in no discernable pattern and they pulsed slowly and seemingly randomly. The intensity of the lights were very similar to magnesium burning.  It was a very intense, pure white light.The object moved slowly and steadily toward our apartment complex and eventually got very close. There was no sound.  In my best estimation it was probably only 250 feet in the air and 300 yards away from my vantage point.  It was very large and looked very similar to a blimp in shape and size.  I remember being absolutely mesmerized by the bright flashing lights, but not afraid. Then, all of a sudden, it went from casually hovering along, to an insanely fast dash into the night sky. In a matter of 1 one thousand, 2 one thousand, 3 one thousand, it went from being this large bright object to a speck of light that looked like a star, and then completely gone.  The rate of acceleration was unbelievable.  There was no sound. The next thing I recall, is that I was in a state of delirium after this incident, and I didn&rsquo;t even mention what had happened to anyone.  I just went to bed.  The next day I hadn&rsquo;t remembered a thing.  This memory actually came back to me slowly but positively over the next 2-3 years.  In my estimation the lights that had so mesmerized me, probably had something to do with this memory loss.Anyways, that is my experience. It is actually quite hard to put into written words, and hopefully I&rsquo;ve conveyed myself well enough.  I am a believer 100%, that this experience was real and UFO&rsquo;s do exist.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was not there. We then went to a lake to go parking.  While we were parked, in complete darkness, I noticed that it was light in the truck.  We looked out the back window and saw two small craft, I would say the size of 3 cadillacs.  They were oval and dark except for amber lights around the base.  The lights were very soft but iluminated the area well.  They were about 30 feet in the air hoovering. This went on for about 10 minutes. Then both of them slowly went over the truck to the road.  At that time one appeared to land in a field and the other went down the road and it just speed up and disappeared.  Although speed up is not a correct description.  It zipped, zoomed or what ever out of sightand left a trail of light.  It was there one moment and we were watching it, then in a second it was gone. We went back to the field where the other landed and shined our lights in the direction where it should have been.  It was not there.

I was there for about a minute before I noticed the object hanging silently above the treeline.  Out of the corner of my eye, I figured it for a plane, but it didn&apos;t move, and that&apos;s what got my attention. It was probably a few blocks away from me, but hanging right above my street. It was a row of strobing lights, tilted at about 25 or 30 degrees.  The lights strobed very fast, from left to right, emerging from around the side of the object, and disappearing around the other side.  They were mostly white and red, with a few blue strobes near the middle of the object. The way the lights disappeared made the object appear to be either circular or triangular shaped. It hung in the air silently for about one minute after I noticed it.  It was still hovering when I ran inside to try and get it on camera.  (I did what I could, but I used the video setting of my digital camera, and it came out very dark, and I don&apos;t have the technology to lighten it.)   After I returned, and tried to film it, it began to slowly move southward, down my street it seemed, and then curved to the southeast, out of my view. It frightened me when I first saw it. Really scared me.  It took awhile for me to realize I could capture it on film.  When I got my camera, I fumbled it around a lot. I was shaken. I know it was not a plane.  Two planes flew by later, following their normal east to west, or west to east paths that I see all day. This object was very low in the sky. Probably less than 500 feet above the ground.  It was close enough that I should have heard some sound from an engine. It was also huge. I can&apos;t say how big, but from one end of the strobing lights to the other, it was far bigger than any plane I&apos;ve seen.  I&apos;m even familiar with the sight of C-130&apos;s flying at night, having lived for two years at the Marine Military Academy, right next door to the Confederate Air Force, and an airport that allowed C-130&apos;s to practice touching down and lifting off. This object had a solid row of strobing lights that moved in one direction.  I&apos;ve seen no plane look like that before. It was not a plane.  It was also not a helicopter.

((dog&apos;&apos;s name deleted)) after approximately 1 or 2 minutes raised up and ran into his make shift den area under a picnic table that we have in the backyard.The craft was within 50 to 75 feet of where my wife and I were standing inside our bedroom looking out the 2nd floor balcony of our bedroom.I told my Wife that I was going to run downstairs and take a picture of the craft but she became very upset and almost broke my hand holding onto me, not really making any sounds but let me know she was afraid that whatever was in the craft might come out to recover any type of documentation and come into our home.We watched it hover for about 5 minutes, noticed there was a dull light on the swimming pool and then it slowly rose and moved away slowly and in a trajectory that was almost straight up, the rate of climb would be at an estimated angle of 60 degrees at about 20 to 25 feet per second.We were up all night.The next morning we went outside and the water level of the swimming pool had dropped almost 6 inches from the time of the incident.  That is really the only significant and viable impact the craft left besides the clocks all losing about 5 minutes.We sat up all night last night to see if it would return.  It did NOT return.This was an extremely intense and emotionally draining experience.((names deleted))  in Houston Texas", "6 dimly lit orbs travelint at a high speedI cant remember when exactly this took place, it was a saturday night, but that night I along with three other friends we&apos;re camping outside of drumheiler fountain on the UW campus to watch a meteor shower.  We were literally under the stars (no tent). We were all looking for meteors when we all saw six dimly lit orbs traveling at a high speed from the north east sky to the west.  It was practically impossible to see they were almost under camofluage or changind colors to reflect the night sky.

Our company allows us to sit down after our work is completed for the day. On this day we decided to go outside and sit.  It was a mostly clear with a little wind blowing to the west.  Our plant is near the railroad tracks so we watch the trains and the jet airplanes as they pass by (there were several that day as always). When I first noticed the objects (at least 3 maybe more) they were northwest of our location.  My first thought was that they were gulls (birds) because they appeared to be white in color.  They were circling each other when I said to my co-worker &quot;look at that&quot;. At that point one shot off in a southeast direction at a high rate of speed (much faster than any jet we have ever seen).  When I looked back to where they were the rest were gone. My next thought was maybe this was a mylar balloon.  That is when I noticed which way the wind was blowing (the other direction).  As the object moved across the sky it sort of changed colors.  As I said, it first appeared white but as it moved it would look metallic or silver in color. This might be because the object appeared to be banking or rocking back and forth.  When it had left our sight (because it went over our building), my co-worker said &quot;what was that?&quot;.  I ask him if he had seen the other ones, to which he replied that he had only seen the one moving to the southeast.  He also stated that he had never seen anything like that before (me either). There was no sound or if there were it was covered up by work being done on the railroad. After discusing what we had just seen, we ruled out a jet (moved much faster, at least twice as fast), a gull (they don&apos;t look like metal), a mylar balloon (it was going against the wind), we decided we didn&apos;t know what it was, except a UFO.", "5 disk shaped objects flying north towards kalbarie, it was the scaries thing i had ever seen, it seemed to glow a yellowie greenish colour and it was humming((NUFORC Note:  One of two reports from different witnesses of apparently the same event.

The lights were round white like a headlight but they did not have the red flashing or blue/green lights that normal aircraft have.  They were just solid.

The lights appeared over a wooded area or a field.", "Saw a craft decend over some power lines and hover.  Saucer shaped with bright lights around the middleWhile driving a friend home, myself and another friend noticed some weird lights coming toward us, about 2-3 miles away.  We drove to the end of the road and turned off our lights.  The craft came directly at us and stopped over the top of a high power electrical lines.  There was NO noise.  The trees adjacent to the lines were bent over.  The craft was about 50-70 feet wide, all different colored lights rotating around the middle.  It appeared to be using the power lines for energy.  We were approximatly 200 yards away.  The craft hovered for 1-2 minutes and then some spot lights at the bottom of the craft rotated and shined on us.  It then took of at a very high rate of speed on a diagonal.  We jumped on I-196 East and followed for about ten minutes, at this point it was just a light traveling very fast.  The weird thing about this is that me and my two friends never remembered this until two weeks later!!  I thought it was a dream until I talked to my friends and it all came back to us.  This happened at the Consumers Energy Power lines West of M-45 and just north of Covell N.W.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))((ADDENDUM FROM ORIGINAL WITNESS, SUBMITTED ON NOVEMBER 05, 2008))I submitted this report back in 2005.   I have been reviewing my report from that time.  There are a couple of things that are incorrect.  The sighting was South of Lake Michigan Drive and West of Covell Road.   A few more things I would like to point out.  The craft may have been 3 to 4 times the size that I stated (200-300 ft.)  As we were driving up Cenntenial Drive (steep incline) the lights caught my eye.  It was about 20-30 miles away, it was coming at us at a very high rate of speed.  It had multiple lights rotating around the middle of the saucer.  As in other reports that I read, the middle of the craft did not come to a point, it had was a verticle surface (5-10 feet or more)  The strangest thing was that as soon as the spot lights under the object focused on us (my friend who was driving killed the lights and coasted to the end of the road, so I felt it did not know we were there) it rose and speed off at an unbelievable rate of speed (thousands of miles an hour or more)  I was in the passenger seat and never took my eyes off of it.  It traveled 30 miles in two or three seconds.  We jumped on 196 East and followed it for about ten minutes.  It looked like a moving star off in the distance.The strangest thing of all is that after we headed back home, none of us spoke about it to each other or anyone that night (family members, etc.).  It wasn&apos;t until weeks later that we were all hanging out together, and I mentioned it as a dream.  Instantly both of my friends who were with me had the wierdest looks on thier faces.  I could tell they were freaked out.  We had one or two other friends present at this time.  They thought we were joking.  Each of us took turns telling exactly the same thing that happened.If anyone would like to talk to me about this, I would like to talk to someone if possible.", "It was circular with three round lights on the bottom in the form of a triangle, hovering right over us before taking off into the skyThe date and time are just my best guess...I&apos;m almost 20 now, and it happened when I was in junior high or so. My friend and I had took off one night on Spring Break for a long walk.  On our way back from the walk we took Scott Boulevard (coming from Herbert Hoover Highway) and turned on Court Street.  There is a gas station right on the corner there and after we had passed it a little ways, we noticed something above us and looked up.  It wasn&apos;t very far up at all, it was close enough to appear bigger around than our heads (I don&apos;t know much about altitudes), and it was totally silent.  All I really remember was looking up at a circle which was just hovering over us, and I saw three round lights in the shape of a wide triangle (they were all closer to the outside than in, leaving the middle black) on the bottom. We, being 13-14 years old (and neither one of us had seen anything like it before) were pretty spooked and didn&apos;t stare for more a couple seconds before we started running. We ran about half a block to a block and then turned around to take a second look (in curiosity, and also to proove to ourselves that we had actually seen what we did).  When we looked back it was no longer hovering in that spot. In the couple seconds it took us to run away, it had flown off and was way up in the sky. It didn&apos;t change shape or anything, we saw the side of it which looked like a thin oval (as most of the pictures you see of sightings look like), and could still see the three lights on the bottom spaced out to form a triangle.  We stood there for another minute and watched until it was out of site.", "two yellow objects sitting over the corn field in Franklin, IndianaWe was on my way back from picking up my dad, and all of a sudden, these weird lights was sitting over the corn field about a mile away.

There was one commuter jet that was in the air at the same time as this star like object and it appeared to pass over the UFO.  This is the second time I&apos;ve seen this type of object.

As it got over the street, I ran to the street still with the camera up and trying to snap the photo. This sighting happened very quickly and I didn&apos;t yell for anyone while i was running behind it with the camera.  It went very quickly towards the south.  Like the first triangle I saw in June, there was no sound whatsoever.  This on seemed to have light all the way to the fron point of the triangle and across the back as well.

We were generally in the area of the highway that is south of Pittsfield.Though the sighting duration may seem odd (4 seconds), and leave too many questions for the average skeptic, please allow me to elaborate before you hastily draw a conclusion.I was the driver of the vehicle and had a passenger in both the front and rear of the vehicle.  A rapid movement in the corner of my eye, slightly above and to the left caught my attention.  A green ovular/cigar shaped ball of pure, very green (and unchanging) energy was there, cutting perfectly horizontal to the surface of the earth from right to left.  It was heading from south to the north as we were traveling east.As I caught the end of its horizontal manuever it suddenly, and drastically, changed directions in an impossible fashion.  It was a movement that would be be impossible for any known earth technology.  It was also something that defied the physics of a plane, comet or fireworks.  It suddenly headed downward and at an angle to the left of my position.  It suddenly vanished a hundred feet above the treetops.  The ball of pure light was described by the frontside passenger as &quot;a green lightsaber type energy.&quot;   Coincidentally, she saw it about 1 second after it caught my eye.  She screamed out, &quot;Oh my god a plane is crashing!&quot;  Then she suddenly froze up and sort of stuttered when it changed direction and blinked out of existence.  Right when it was over the trees it illuminated them slightly which was strange.  It radiated a green ambient light that matched the color of the energy. She became very shaken and emotional.  She took out her camera in the event there was another appearance of the craft but it suddenly died entirely.  Ten minutes later, further down the road, it turned on with a 100 percent full charge. She started talking to the passenger in the back who did not see the craft because of her position. The roof of the car blocked her line of sight.  She began getting teared up and inexplicably emotional. We both agreed that we felt very vulnerable.  She began saying that she felt as though she was a child laying in bed.

All of them completely still, the orange light on the lower left faded out and was replaced with another orange light right next to it to the left.  This too faded out and was replaced with yet another orange red light to the left.  This fading out happened once more before I realized what I was seeing.

They saw the three remaining orange/fire balls each fade out one by one until there was nothing in the sky.The sky was cloudy that night and the objects were below the cloud line.There is nothing out in that area besides a very long road and a landfill to the right, and I think the lights were over this landfill or very near it.", "Bright green flash of 2 parallel lines, lasted a second or less.I was driving east on Route 2 near Leominster, Massachusetts, when there was a flash in the sky - there were 2 parallel lines, further apart than an airplane&apos;s wings, and much longer than an airplane.

We had layed down on the blanket and stargazing when I spotted a shooting star.  This prompted curiosity and wonder therefore we both searched for possibly more shooting stars.  The shooting star that I saw had tail and was falling. The following sightings were completely different. Four different lights were seen.  They had no tails like the shooting star.

The first one was about twice as high as a normal jet but traveled across the sky about 10 times faster.  It was traveling South by South-East.  After crossing about 3/4 across the sky, it shot straight up into space. The second one was about 5 minutes later traveling in the same direction as the first but a little more eastward.  It was about twice as high as the first.  This one&apos;s trajectory was not straight like the first.  It wavered back and forth as it traveled like an oscillation wave. The third was even higher than the second one.  It too wavered.  The direction was not southward but due east.  This one traveled across the sky briefly and then shot out into space.

It was about 8:15 PM. My brother, his friend, and I were on our way back from a foothill we call &quot;Sawtooth&quot; out by the Silverbell mines. I was spacin&apos; out, staring out the window. Directly where I was staring about 4 or 5 larger sized (about the size of 2 or 3 planes coming in to Tucson)yellowish orange lights appeared in the blank sky, and held a steady glow. They sat there for about 15 seconds with their lights on, then all went dark. At this point the 3 of us were standing out on the side of the road. So, about a minute or so later, a single light comes on. Then another up and off to the right of the first one lights up, then another in the same direction, and another. There ended up being I believe 5 lights at that time. By the 3rd light, the first was fading out simultaneously, and the rest followed suit. After a little of this type of action, different light patterns and #&apos;s of lights, etc. they seemed to be playing or something, maybe just flying around observing. The thing about it was that now there were maybe twice as many lights and they didn&apos;t blink. They would sometimes shut off their lights, but never blink. Then, at about 8:45PM, the Marana Regional Airport sent 2 jets out. I heard them take off and watched them cross the sky. All the unidentified lights were now shut off. But once the jets were close, they all turned back on, and were very close together, shining toward the jets. There had to have been like 15 of them. It was like a wall of light in the sky. Eventually the jets arrived and chased about 4 of them toward 3 Points, and 2 or 3 toward Pheonix. The rest were gone. I&apos;ve seen them do many different but similar things since then on maybe 7 different occasions, and have maybe a dozen other witnesses.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

One before the event and 2 after the event.  Coming from the southeast heading to the northwest.  Heard no noise, but a train was passing about 7 miles away.  A large lake is the the south/southeast of us so sound travels very well.  The object reminded me of a falling star, but orange/yellow in color and about 20 times larger.  Also it was going in the opposite direction of a falling star.  It had somewhat of a trail or tail following behind. This whole episode only lasted in our eyesight only a few seconds do to trees, barns, awnings.  Waited and watched for about 1 1/2 hours to see if another one came by, but nothing but the 2 falling stars that were more of a white color.

I gazed up at the sky to see if I could find Mars at that hour, when suddenly I saw a ball of light flash (to the west).   At first I simply thought it was a light flashing from an airplane, however, as I searched the sky I could see another airplane off to the left traveling southeast with it&apos;s lights flashing.  The plane was further in the distance, but I was actually able to discern the form of the plane when its lights flashed.  But, the other light I saw was bigger and closer, but there was no form of an airplane visible.  I continued to observe the sky to see if I could follow the path of the light object to determine if it was a plane.  I continued to see this light flash quite a few times in various random places in the sky.  It did not travel in a straight-line movement like a plane, but somewhat in a wide zig-zag pattern, but more random--and it appeared to move towards my house.

However, when I read the report on this website of a sighting in Naples, Florida on 11/3/2005 I couldn&apos;t help but be stunned. The reported sighting was almost identical to a sighting I had about 15 to 18 years ago. I also live in Naples, Florida.The night of my sighting, I was walking down my driveway with my dog.It was less than an hour after sunset.I was walking from north to south. I looked up because I saw what I believed to be a satellite moving from west to east. For some reason I can&apos;t remember I thought it as Hubble. I watched the satellite until it disappeared into the dark side of the day/night terminator to the east.At almost the same time the satellite disappeared, there was movement directly above me.  Whatever the object was, it was absolutely flat black, and very very fast!  The sighting was so brief (only a few seconds), that I could only gather impressions of what I saw.Although the sky was dark and moonless, the object was so dark that I could see a boomerang shape against the slightly lighter night sky.  It seemed to be low,  and was very large.  Much larger than any airplane I have ever seen.  It was absolutely silent. Not a hiss or whoosh came when it passed overhead.For some reason I had the feeling the leading edge of the shape was just a very little lighter than the trailing edge.  Basically, I saw a very dark object against a slightly lighter, clear black sky blocking out the stars.  The weather was clear, with a few clouds on the southern horizon.  The star Fomalhaut was clearly visible above the clouds to the south. The thought has occurred to me, the object was intentionally flying near the edge of the terminator in order to remain in darkness.  When I checked the date and time of the 11/3/05 sighting, I found that the position of the terminator would have been similar to my sighting.  The largest discrepancy in the two sightings is that my object was traveling in a north to south direction, rather then the northeast to southwest direction of the 11/03/05 sighting. I can still see the object in my minds eye, although some of the detail has been lost.

I TOLD THE 2 OTHER OCCUPANTS IN THE CAR TO LOOK AT THE FALLING STAR AND LOOKED AT IT BUT ONCE IT STARTED MOVING IN ALL DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AND AT AN EXTREMLEY FAST SPEED THEY ALSO NEW RIGHT AWAY THAT IT WAS NO STAR, NOR NO PLANE. ONCE WE GOT TO OUR PLACE OF DESTINATION APPROX 5 MIN WE JUMPED OUT OF THE CAR TRIED TO LOOK FOR THE SPEEDY LIGHT WE WERE ABLE TO SEE IT FOR ABOUT ANOTHER 30 SECONDS AND IT DISAPEARED AGAIN BUT THIS TIME FOR GOOD.

I thought it was firework but when two light came back look like entering earth and doesnt even look like shoot from the ground it and it defintely came from the sky.

(Closed to non-tribal members of Taos Pueblo Indain Reservation)   While driving, the road we were on &quot; Rio Lucero Rd&quot; goes in the direction north, with open land full of sage, and pinon juniper trees to the left of the road.  On the Right hand side of the road is &quot;Pueblo Peak&quot; or &quot;Taos Mountain&quot; as many of the locals and natives to Taos call the mountain.  Puebo Peak is part of the Sangre De Cristo Mountains which runs from Colorado through Northern New Mexico.  Taos Pueblo is located at the base of Pueblo Peak. The Reservation which has roughly about 2,500 residents, and 150,000 acres of land most of which is wilderness.   Along with Pueblo Peak and the mountain range is pinon juniper, cotton wood trees ponderosa pine, doug furr, white furr, (mixed conifer) and the Rio Lucero River.  While driving north we noticed lights in the trees to right of the road, which we thought at the time was someone else driving in the area at the time.  We paid no attention to the lights, we moved another 100 ft ahead and I noticed the lights shifted from behind the trees to ontop of the trees, at that point I asked my friend if he had seen the smae thing.  He aknowledged yes.  He steeped on the gas to seed up and the head lights flickered on and of three times, and the instrument lights of his truck faded in and out.  When his lights flickered the object above the trees which had two lights flickered its lights back to us.  Then a third light came on underneath the two which were already on.  Bright lights, almost as brite as day.  When we started to approach the lights, they backed up towards the mountain and started to go higher in the sky.  My friend stopped the truck and we got out to take a look, when we got off the truck the lights disappeared.  The night was clear and no moon, just stars, so it took a while for my eyes to adjust to the dark.  When i got my vision stable we noticed a triangle shaped object above the truck, you could barely see it but, you knew it was there.  And boy, was it huge!  No lights, just the light from the sky and stars against the backdrop of the trianlge.  At that point I wasn&apos;t scared, but something in the back of my mind told me be worried.  Before I could talk to my friend the object left from where we standing in a blink of an eye, to about 11,000 ft in elevation close to the mountains, Vallicto Peak, which sits at about 12,300 feet behind pueblo peak.  When it got close to Vallicito Peak, orange and blue lights came on, on the object.  It stood, still at that point for a second and then again the orange lights went off and it went vertical straight into the sky leaving a trail of blue light as it went.  After the the Triangle left a feeling of panic and paranoia fell over me.  We left the area and went back to town.  The next day we went back to the area and looked for clues, but found none.  The Pinon Juniper that grows aroung here in Taos grows to 8-10ft in height, but still we never found anything yet to this day.", "Seeing a Group of shiny UFO&apos;s while a Military plane &quot;flies low&quot;My brother and I were driving back from the Store when we noticed a large Military looking airplane that was flying so low it looked like it was going to land. Then we looked above the Airplane and in the distance we saw around 5 or 6 really shiny diskshaped looking lights in the sky.  They appeared to be in a &quot;group&quot;.  It was really cool! I was so happy and I pointed at them and said &quot;Their are UFO&apos;s!!!&quot; My brother siad: &quot;Yeah I see them too!&quot; We kept looking at them when we stopped at the Stop Sign, and then they were just &quot;gone.&quot; I have no idea where the Military looking plane went - it might have landed but I am sure it was aware of the &quot;LIGHTS&quot; as well.I&apos;ve been looking outside continuously since then hoping to see them again haha.", "rocket shape traveling south to north, no noise.Looked as if it was in orbit, steady path from south to north.

This cigar shaped object did not appear to get larger as it traveled westward across the sky and eventually dissapeared beyond the western horizon in a timespan of just over 1 minute and 45 seconds.  It had no color, and appeared translucent.  There was no sound, no vapor trail, and there were no apparent lights on or near the object.  I could not estimate the altitude of the object, as there were no aircraft in the area as it traveled across the sky.  It did not appear to be traveling lower or higher in altitude than a typical trans-continental commercial flight, but depending on the actual size of the object, its true altitude could not be determined.", "Saw a small, bright object move across the sky, come to a complete stop, and begin flying in circles.The object was about the size of a plane in the night sky.  It was bright white, with no blinking lights at all.  I assumed it was a satellite or possibly the International Space Station, as any airplane flying that low would surely have visible blinking lights.  Two friends and I (all of whom are, in fact, college students) saw the light move east across the sky in a straight path.  It was somewhat faster than an airplane, but still slow enough for us to stand and watch it move for a good minute or so.  Then the object came to a complete stop in the sky, just above Mars.  We continued watching it further, and the object grew considerably fainter.  Then, it began to slowly fly in irregular circles for about ten minutes or so before finally fading away.  All three of us saw it move across the sky, stop, and begin circling, and all of us agreed on the direction it was moving.((NUFORC Note:  The ISS pass over Wilmington at 18:11-18:15 hrs. on this date.

When we got closer the lights now formed a perfect rectangle; each light was .5 to 1.5 miles away from the other.  After &quot;hovering&quot; for about 1 minute, 2 of the lights slowly began moving out of the formation and the other two dissappeard.  These WERE NOT helicopters!  There was absolutely NO sound coming from them. We traveled down the road another mile where we parked near my home in a large open parking lot.  At this time the sky became flooded with extremly low and slow flying as well as high altitude jets which seemed unusually quiet.  All of the jets seemed to be 737&apos;s and 767&apos;s and all had identical lights that I didnt recognize as commercial.  These jets were unusually quiet, had no window lights, and had dark colored paint schemes.  I believe the jets I saw were the aircraft in the following links http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/e-767.htm http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/e-737.htm After about 10 minutes of watching these low and high flying jets, the strange objects returned.  Flying at about 1500 feet and making absolutely no sound, these craft seemed to move against all aerodynamic principles slowing down almost to a stop then suddenly speeding up extremely fast and reaching very high altitudes very quickly.  They had green red and white lights which pulsed in a bizarre sequence unlike any aircraft I&apos;ve ever seen.After watching one of these craft for 2-3 minutes it dissappeared. My friend and I were looking in the direction that it disappeard when I looked away for a second and he screamed out &quot; did you see that!&quot; He had seen a white ball of light streak across the sky (half the distance horizon to horizon) in the blink of an eye. 5 minutes later, one of the low flying &quot;dark&quot; jets was flying overhead when my friend and I saw one of the &quot;hovering&quot; craft with odd sequential lights about 1 mile away over a nearby golf course. I immediately looked to the &quot;dark&quot; jet that just flew overhead and it banked suddenly very hard right and accelerated towards the &quot;hovering&quot; craft we had just seen.After this the skies emptied and after about 20 minutes and there were absolutely NO airplanes in the skies overhead. We stayed outside for another hour staring at the sky when I saw what my friend had seen earlier. A small egg shaped light streaked halfway across the horizon at rediculous speed. The one I saw was horizontal and the one my friend saw shot upwards diagonally. I&apos;ve seen shooting stars many times and I assure these were not. WHat really solidified my sighting for me as being at least &quot;unusual&quot; was that no more than 5 minutes after I saw the light flash, a military helicopter flew overhead at maybe 800 feet with the brightest search light on it that I&apos;ve ever seen.", "Falling fireball ended in lightning-like flash to north of Napa, CA 10/30/2005 19:30 PSTWhile traveling north on CA SR29 near the Napa County Airport we observed a rapidly falling fireball dropping behind a small (200&apos; elevation) hill to our north.  Scale and distance are hard to guess, but we thought it might be on the order of 25-30 miles distant.  Much farther than that and the scale of the object would have been rather immense.  Our location at the time of sighting was approximately  38&deg;13&apos;59.74&quot;N by 122&deg;15&apos;34.61&quot;W, elevation about 88 feet ASL.  Skies were pretty much clear all around.  The odd thing about it was that as the fireball disappeared over the horizon there was a tremendous flash of light, very much like lightning in the color of the light and how it lit the sky and backlit the hill between it and us.  It was almost a disappointment that we did not hear a corresponding kaBOOM.((NUFORC Note:  We received several other reports from California about this incident.

When the white tank mountains came into view, we observed three (3) lights (white) that looked like they were on top on the north side of the mountains. We watched them for at least thirty minutes dimming on and off.  There were no strob lights or the normal plane lights one would see. When we arrived at my house we observed a large bright white light to the southwest of the white tank mountains.  This one was either much closer or much bigger than the other three that we had been watching.  My neighbors came out and started observing the big light with us.  About that time my wife and daughter,husband and two kids came home.  My daughter went and got my high powered binoculars and spotting scope.  With these we could see is a bigger brighter light. It seemed to have a red glow around it at times. My brother deceided to drive down sun vally parkway west to give chase to it as it was moving off to the west.  By now an hour had passed.  As he got north of the white tank mountains they could still see they smaller lights above the mountains still stationary.  But now the biggest light was center of the mounatins some three or four hundred feet above the mounatin top headed west.

They were diffently not flares, nor choppers.This is the second time in a year I have seen these lights over or behind or on top of these mountains..whats weird is we watched jets from Luke Air base flying all around but seemed to be oblivious to these lights.

I have shot off hundred&apos;s of hand held flare&apos;s myself while in Vietnam.  I know what a flare looks like and how it reacts to wind and other climates.. These lights were NOT flares.. Flares do NOT move horizonally at the rate of speed these traveled when they left the area. I will send you a map and try and get asmuth&apos;s for you..

First, let me say a few things about myself:  I know something about aircraft.  I am an aviation enthusiast, and I am always observing things in the air.  Professionally, I am a ((deleted--media person, involved with cameras and production)).  One of the subjects I ((deleted--interested in))  is aircraft and air-shows.  In the past few months I have shot F-18&rsquo;s flying at extreme rates of speed, Harriers going more up than out, high level bombers cruising at altitude, and, of course, the slower and more conventional vintage war birds.  I do this work as an officially ((specialty deleted)), not just an enthusiast.  I am not an aviation know-it-all, but I have carefully observed most known aircraft, including rockets and space shuttles.  What I saw tonight doesn&rsquo;t fit into any known aircraft category in any way. I stepped out into my back yard after 7:25.  I wandered toward the west and I saw something streaking from south to north.  It was not lit up like an aircraft should be, and it was moving faster than anything I&lsquo;ve ever seen.  It wasn&rsquo;t too far away, but that was hard to judge (maybe a few blocks?).  It was moving so incredibly fast that I might have thought it was an aberration in my eyes, but then I saw it slow down and head more easterly.  Every hair on my body stood up perpendicular to my body.  It wasn&rsquo;t static electricity, it was the chills.  I was terrified at that moment.  I ran under the big tree to hide from it.  I stayed there for about 10 seconds, but I couldn&rsquo;t stand it.  I went northerly to get out from under the tree, and there it was--almost due north of me!  It was traveling east-south-easterly at a more normal rate of speed, like a small Cessna would.  There were absolutely no lights visible, inside or outside.  I couldn&rsquo;t see any windows or markings of any kind.  It was relatively hard to see, and even if I&rsquo;d have had my TV camera with me, it probably would have been impossible to shoot, because it was only visible due to the bright moon that was rising to my right.  At that time it appeared almost like a cloud, sort of in the shape of an oval from my perspective.  It seemed to be gray in color. I thought the oval-like shape was weird, because when I had first noticed it (when it was moving very fast) it seemed more angular, almost like a long rectangle.  Then it paused when it was NNE of me at about 100-300 feet off the ground.  It seemed to stay there for about 10 seconds, then as it was getting larger, I thought it was coming toward me, and I got more scared and ran toward my back door (to the south).  Then I watched it from there for what seemed like 15 seconds.  I noticed the dog two doors down was barking, and that was all I could hear.  He is usually a very quiet dog.  Then the object got smaller, or farther away.  Then it just seemed to get a little smaller still, and then it was gone.  It may have gone north or east, but I can&rsquo;t be sure, because it disappeared very quickly.   I looked all around for a few minutes, but it was gone!  I don&rsquo;t know how close it came to me, but it is possible that it came as close as a block away.  If it was a block away, then it must have been about 30-40 feet long.  I went inside to document the time, and it was after 7:50, so it must have happened about 7:46, and it only lasted what seemed to be a minute or less, but maybe it was longer, because I was outside for up to 25 minutes.  It was very surreal to me, and I can&rsquo;t be sure about that.  What I am sure about is that the experience was exceptionally unusual.In summary, when it wasn&rsquo;t moving so fast, it looked sort of like a small cloud on a moonlit night.  However, it definitely went easterly.  I noticed a short time later that there were a few clouds in the north heading westerly.  I verified this less than two hours later on the Weather Channel when I was trying to figure out what had happened.  The clouds are definitely going toward the ocean tonight!  There were no clouds in that direction at that time.  Had I not seen it moving so extremely, I would have thought it was just a cloud.  I don&rsquo;t know what it was, and, unfortunately, I was alone, so I don&rsquo;t have a witness or a second opinion of any kind that I&rsquo;m aware of.((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with this witness via telephone on three occasions, and we deem him to be an exceptionally capable, and reliable, witness.

The object looked kind of like what a very bright star might look like during the middle of the day, and it appeared to be very, very high up, but I had nothing to relate size to, so I can&apos;t exactly gauge altitude.  The sky was clear and bright blue, and it was between 3:30 and 4:00 (MST)in the afternoon.  The more my eyes became accustomed to the sky I realized another identical object to the right of the one I had been looking at.  It also appeared motionless.  On further observation I soon located a third identical white object above the two I was looking at, and the three of them together formed a triangle.  They remained completely suspended for several minutes and did not move.  They were all, in fact, stationary when I first located them.  Suddenly the two objects which flanked the middle one fanned out to form what was now an arc.  This was the first movement I witnessed.  Their movements were sudden for having been suspended for so long.  Once they had formed an arc formation they once again quit movement and suspended themselves again.  They were all equally spaced in this formation.  After a couple more minutes I noticed a fourth identical object coming out of the southeast at a very high rate of speed.  It approached the middle object in the arc formation and suddenly came to a very quick stop next to it.  It looked as if it was going to bump the middle object.  In fact, I have described the fourth object as racing in and &quot;flirting or dancing&quot; with the other object.  It would approach it as if it was going to bump it and then it would back off and repeat the motion.  Suddenly the two other white objects, which had remained stationary all this time in their formation, fanned out again, but this time to line up in a perfectly straight line with the middle object which was still being &quot;taunted&quot; by the fourth object.  Once the three lined up they suddenly started moving northwest at a consistant speed and evenly spaced.  During the duration none of these objects ever changed shape or color.  Soon the original three were gone over the horizon.  The fourth white point (object) remained suspended where it had been when the others left it.  After a few minutes it began to slowly move in the same northwest direction as the others.  I watched it move quite a distance, much more and it would have disappeared over the horizon like the others, and then it suddenly stopped and suspended itself again.  Coming out of the southeast was a fifth identical white object also traveling at a very fast speed.  It was headed directly for the &quot;straggler,&quot; the fourth object, which remained motionless.  Again, this object seemed to &quot;dance&quot; with the other object once it got close to it.  It went through the same taunting motions, and would make passes at the other object, looking almost like it was going to hit it.  After a minute or so of this &quot;activity&quot; the fifth and newest object proceeded alone on the same northwest course as the others.  The &quot;straggler&quot; remained suspended for a few more minutes before it too resumed the same northwest direction.   The full experience of what I have just described took place over about a 20 minute time period.I have checked our local news and have talked to a few people around town and no one has made mention of seeing anything like this.  I would be more than interested in knowing if there is anyone in my vicinity who may have witnessed the same thing I did.  I have never seen anything like it, nor can I think of anything that &quot;we&quot; know of that would act in such a manner in space.  This is my first sighting.", "bright red light, hovering then flying awayMy two brothers and I were driving home from Asheville that night and on the way home we were kind of looking in the sky on the way home. We usually just observe the stars and planes in the sky. Well, about a quarter mile from our house we were roun ding the last curve before you get to our house and to the right in the sky there was a bright red light in the sky. Now, this looked like a tower light but the thing is there isn&apos;t a tower in that location. We watched the road again and then my brother looked up and said, &quot;It&apos;s moving!&quot;. I looked up and the red light is flying to the left of us in the sky. The thing is, is that there were absolutly no blinking lights of any sort on this craft. Plus it was hoverin g stationary to begin with. Thats why at first we thought it was a tower. I was flipping out. I had never seen anything like that before. It is just something we saw and when I tell about it, som e people think i&apos;m crazy or either making it up. I hope I have another encounter of some sort where i can make out a craft. I hope maybe someone else has seen something like this.", "Slow moving red light,with no sound.It was just before sundown, a red light, twice the size of a basketball was moving at 150-200 ft up and about 30 mph.  No sound of any kind was made, no wings no nothing, just a red light. I&apos;m positive about the height and speed, it was not man made. Now i wonder why its so hard for people to believe in life out side of our planet, after all, humans are the direct result of life from out side our planet, we are made from star material, we are made from the same material that is abundant across the universe.  The thought of humans being the only intelligent life form in the universe is silly.  I believe that other life forms are here now and have been here for thousands of years, they study us just like we study insects. I also believe the govt knows all about UFO&apos;S.

I was driving up Soundview Dr and saw a large flame moving sideways, I stop and pulled into a lane facing the water and the flame stoped My daughter started to shake I told her not to speak that it was to far away to see us, the flame turned into lights and the shape of the lights changed and it looked like it was taking water then the lights started to move and a airforce c130 (I think) almost hit it and then the lights went into the sky and the sky turned red.I went home with my daughter and told my husband and we went back to the site but everything was gone.

The next thing that i remember is a large saucer shaped craft with a slight dome on the top appear right in front of me from now where.  On top of the craft was a red light and arond the dome was what i would describe as arched windows but you could not see through and were as bright as a bulb. The craft appeared about 100 foot away and about 50 to 75 foot in the air. From what i can recall the craft was about as big as an English red bus.  It slowly turned and made no noise at all and started moving towards and the right hand side of our house.  I ran in to get my mom and brother who then came out to watch the rest of the event.  After going back out we all watched the craft move towards and fly over the right hand side of the house.  We all went into the back garden and watched the craft move off and dissappear another 50 foot away.

He is an architect and is helping me design an add-on to my dining room. Just after the sunset, we noticed a orange glowing oval shaped object.  It seemed to be gliding west with a gradual and steady pace.  Then it would disapeared for about 30 seconds and reapeared in a different position.  At first we thought that it was just a high altitude air craft.  But when we looked with binoculars it was very obvious that it had no emisions, and it had no definite coarse.  A few minutes later another object just like it appeared.  They almost looked like they had an invisable bond between them because they stayed the same distance apart for atleast 5 minutes. And when one would disapear the other would at the same time, they also both reapeared at the same time. Then it began to look like the object was making a 90 degree change in direction. Its coarse was now southward, but it vanished and never reapeared after that.", "Several bright lights moving erratically for extended periods of time, including growing in size and brightness, and disappearing.On the night of halloween, October 31st at 6:00 to 7:30 PM in Poughkeepsie NY two college students observed several unidentified flying objects, over a course of an hour and a half. It could have been one object disappearing and then reappearing, or several different ones.  It was a large, bright, orange light the size of a large planet that was moving erratically for continuous periods of time ranging up to 30 minutes.  It was moving, stopping, hovering, then moving, going up and down, side to side, and in curving arcs with akward angles. It appeared to move fast and with great agility. In addition there was a sharp, crisp, but slow-moving streak of light across the sky as an outlined object descended consistently in a straight line over a large area of the sky and heading directly to the large orange object described above. This streaking object disappeared right before reaching the actual object.  This orange object eventually disappeared behind the trees.  It was found later at another point in the sky - on the opposite horizon.  This appeared suddenly - in a point in the sky earlier scanned - it had not been seen there moments before. This one moved erratically for two minutes as before and then suddenly grew in light, color, and size - to an overwhelming and startling appearance - this flash/flare was 2 seconds in length, after which it disappeared entirely. Finally another bright orange orb appeared, moved consistenly in one direction across a large portion of the sky before akwardly and suddenly reversing direction, angling downwards towards the horizon. This object then grew in intensity and brightness and size, with sharp and protruding white light, in such a fashion as to create the distinct impression that it was coming closer to the viewers - approaching the point of observation. This action caused fear for the viewers as well as immense apprehension, to the point where one viewer began running away towards the vehicle out of fear and panic. The object quickly thereafter diminished and turned to another direction.The final phenomenon was a different bright red light above the horizon to the East that both viewers saw clearly at the same moment. It then disappeared from view - vanishing - while in the periphery of both viewer&apos;s vision and was afterwards nowhere to be found.This occurred from 6:00 pm to 7:30 pm on Monday, October 31st, 2005, over the Vassar College Farm in Poughkeepsie New York.", "Three day sighting spectacular!Just moved here from Fresno CA.  I have had only 2 other sightings in my life.  None of which compared at all to what I have seen on the dates of 10-05-05 through 10-07-05. The first night, I was stuck outside of the house (keys were not made yet) waiting for my girlfriend and her family to come back home.  We live in a residential area nearby the airport, and Malstrom AFB is about 10 or so miles away. Around 9:30 pm, I saw 2 shapes outlines under the clouds.. pitch black.. large boomerang shape, no lights, not a sound.. at arms distance, they would be about the size of my hand.  One was slightly smaller, or further away.  I have no idea how high the clouds were that night, but I felt they were close. I didn&apos;t think much of the sighting at first.. there were lots of large birgs flying south, and I had seen them in the day time, flying in similar formation.  But I kept my eye in the sky.  About 5 minutes later, a few more went nearly overhead, no sound, same shape.. but these were not birds, or crazy hang-gliders.  They seemed to be going to slow to stay in the sky, but really how  can you know how fast they are going. After that.. I saw something that made me scream literally... And cuss... just a bit.  A triangle shape, with two rows of lights on all sides came just over a nieghbors house, about 200 ft. down the road.. silent. Then stopped completely, and stood up as to show off... and sat for maybe 3 or four seconds.. and faded into the stars... I am surprized I didn&apos;t get shot at for yelling like that.. my heart was pounding.. and no one else was seeing this. After some more sightings.. and around 10:00.. the family pulled up, and I told them what I had seen. After a few jokes...haha, and unloading the car at light speed, I was out in the driveway again.  My girlfriend stayed inside. I ended up seeing &quot;something&quot; 32 times that night. The next night about 16, and the last night, I stayed up until past 4 in the am.. and saw roughly 44 of these... altogether, a a few triangles, and even a circle shaped craft.. my girlfriend and I together have seen well over a dozen... and even her mom saw one nearby.. and well, shes not one to give in easily... I know the airbase is nearby, but the people here say that the runway at the base is shut down, and they are flying out of the airport... Unfortunatly, I haven&apos;t seen anything since... I believe these are not experimental.. and why would they fly them right over the city all night... &quot;Electric City&quot; at that. I don&apos;t have internet access my self, but I had to get this report down.. so I am at the library.  If you have any other questions, or any other reports of this, please contact me .. I know others have seen these craft... unless the people here didn&apos;t look up on those days. Have a great day!

During the time it took me to smoke a cigarette, this object came to within 75-100ft of the roof of the neighborhood homes, and was on a path that would take it directly above me. AS it passed over my head I could see tat it was triangular in shape, with three lights (one at each corner).  It was almost completeley silent with the exception of a low humm.  Shortly after it passed over me it changed direction abrubtly and instantly made a slight course adjustment.  From what I obseved this object was not beholden to known principles of flight.  It traveled at I would estimate 3-5 Mph., it&apos;s turn was the most baffling becuse the objects speed remained a constant and as the object itsef rotated to the right its direction simultaneousley changed, there was absoluteley no delay between turn and direction change! It was about 50ft across and had windows.  As the object left going south in the distance I turned and noticed another light where I had originally saw the first object.  I waited to see what this new object was and to my surprise it was an identical triangular object, identicle path and trajectory as well as speed.  The weirest part of the sighting to me was that the second object turned at the exact same point,at the exact same angle (vector)and the exact same speed of 3-5 mph.!!!  These triangles that I saw definately were not reliant upon any air flow for flight.Definately had the feeling they could be man made.  Not too sure but I think there are/were Air Force bases near there point of origin. (weymouth)((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

They said whats that.  I looked up and saw two pure white egg shaped  objects moving slowly accross the sky.  Side by side one half a length up on the other.  We watched for a few minuits.  Then another one come along behind them moving faster, a few hundred feet below the other two.  When it was underneeth the others it flew straight up and joined the other two.  They all stopped and formed a perfect triangle they kept still for about 20 seconds then they all moved off in opposite directions and slowly.  I would say they were about 20 to 30 thousand feet high.

THe lights looked like there were about 7 huge spotlights pointing down. Then it started to move slowly down towards us. My wife was getting scared and I couldnt believe what we were seeing. This light was so bright it felt warm when I got out of the car. Then it came to a stop about 500 above us. You couldnt see exactly the shape because it was to bright to fully look at it. I would say it was bigger than a 747 but there were no wings as far as we could tell and there were no blinking lights. This is what surprised us the most is that this thing had no noise dead silence. Then all of a sudden it took off. It went from just sitting there to gone and I could see it leaving in the distance. I have seen F-16s and other fighter jets and they could not touch this. This thing did turn off his lights right before he left. THere still was no noise of it even when it took off. This object was just gone. My wife and I said to each other right there that we would never speak of this because nobody would ever believe what we just saw. Well this is the first time I have ever spoke of it to anyone.", "This is the fourth report concerning the &quot;lights&quot; I have seen in the skies near Austin, Texas.  I placed lights in quotation marks because I am now convinced they were not lights at all but certainly had the appearance of a high altitude light, similar to a passing satellite.  It hs been my long experience that it is extremely dificult to judge the appearance, speed and altitude of objects seen in the sky from ground level.  Once while stationed at Holloman AFB NM, I viewed what appeared to be very fast moving objects flying over a nearby mountain range.  It turned out to be a flock of geese. Since NM has always been famous for unexplained sightings it is easy to wrap one&apos;s brain around that possibility.  This evening I was able to focus my binoculars on the objects I have been seeing.  The result was blobs which I now believe are flying spider webs which are prevelant in this area.  The remaining problem in my mind is tht the objects do seem to speed up, slow down, and make turns which would not normally be the characteristic of wind borne objects. I hope someone else will be able to provide additional sightings and info.", "looking over  cornfield round bright object lookin through binoculars many separate bright lights moved foward back north then south in a pattern appox. 5 times lights changed colors red orange and yellow only when it moved north to south lost ight of it when it went north", "UFO over IraqAs a UH-60 Black Hawk medevac pilot I was on a routine night transport from Al Asad to Balad and back to Al Asad.

The sky was blue and mostly cloudless, only a few cirrus clouds here and there.  I was driving due north in a rural area.  I looked up through my window and noticed several airliners at normal altitude.  We are in &quot;flyover country,&quot; so it is not unusual to see airliners traversing the sky and leaving contrails.  While watching the &quot;normal&quot; airplanes, I noticed approximately 5 or 6 contrails very close together, to the northwest of me (about 10 o&apos;clock high from my perspective driving north).  The closely-bunched contrails were forming parallel to each other.  They appeared to be on a southeasterly heading.  I could not see the airplanes leaving the contrails, which led me to believe that they were at extremely high altitude.  The contrails were clearly moving (growing in length).  As I continued to watch, several more contrails began to form to the sides and behind the original few.  All told there were probably around 10.  They appeared to be very close together, which led me to believe that they were high flying military jets in formation. The odd thing was that the contrails faded very quickly.  I grabbed my cell phone and called a friend to have her go outside and take a look.  I asked her &quot;Do you want to see something unusual?  Go outside and look up to the northwest.  There is a bunch of contrails very close together.&quot;  By the time I got those words out, the contrails had faded, so I told her to forget it. My overwhelming impression is that they were military jets in formation, VERY high in altitude.  Once again the odd thing was how the contrails faded.  It was as though they just &quot;turned off.&quot;  Very odd.((NUFORC Note:  We agree with the witness that the objects almost certainly were contrails.  Probably not UFO-related.

I live several miles Northwest of Point Mugu Base.  Several miles north of Port Hueneme Naval Base.

The object was the size of three football fields and had a red light at the front tip and back tip.  The lights were connected by a dark mass.  Since this object was traveling diagonal from me it is hard to give an exact description of the shape for I was seeing it at a side view.  It was low in the sky for something that huge.  I would say approximately a mile off the ground.  The object moved slowly... guided.  There was no noise.  It headed from my north toward the Point Mugu base.

I was trying to make sense of the what we were looking at thinking maybe it was a kite with lights on it, but it was moving to fast and covered so much distance and there was no fluttering noises like kites make.  Then I thought maybe it was a remote control airplane, but there were no engine sounds.  When the object would descend and climb it would strobe 4-6 lights in front of it and when it would spiral it would only have 2 red lights at the tips of the craft.  My daughter and I watched the lights/object in the sky for about five minutes till it disappeared.  Then I picked up my son a few minutes later at kids club and started telling him what we saw and where in the sky.  Then my son spotted the lights in the sky and so we watched the lights in the sky while in the car driving east on Chapman Avenue we stopped at the red waiting to make a left (north) on Knott avenue, that&apos;s when we noticed the second craft in the sky with the same exact characteristics as the first one and we watched the two(2) objects flying in the sky flashing their lights and spiralling in all directions. That&apos;s when the signal light turned green and I raced down the street to pick up my wife from work and I got to her worked I parked in front and honked like a mad man telling her to hurry and get in the car so I can show her the lights in the sky so I raced around the office buildings to the back where there was a clear view of the sky but when we parked we only saw one of the objects about 3-5 miles south east but she was able to see the objects lights and its extraordinary maneuvering capabilities.  We watched the objects for approximately 2-3 minutes till we lost sight of it.  The whole sequence lasted about 30 minutes from 5:30 pm till 6 pm.

I was about 8 or almost 9 months pregnant.  It ws almost dark and I headed home which was swampy and more isolated then on Fort Johnson Rd. James Island, S.C.  This incident was in 1975.  I saw something hovering over the swamp, it was tremendous and had bight lights all over and around the top of a hugh disc, rotating around and around.  I don&apos;t remembe a lot after that but I think I stopped the car and got out to go and look at the object.  I must have been there about 2 or 3 hours.  I think the object was glass or opaque in color and I remember that I was not afraid as many people say they are.  I don&apos;t remember a lot more and then I was back in my car and it was really dark about 6 or 7pm.  I had lost about two or three hours.  I did not think much of it at that time and went home.  I did not feel drained, tired confused or anything.  I did not feel threatened either.We had our daughter and called her laughingly our little alien child.  I was alone so there were no witnesses that I know of concerning this object.  I think the object had an ability of letting us see it and then some sort of way of not being seen.  This was the only time I ever saw this thing.  Thirty years later we took some photos of the little house we owned out on the island and walmart developed them.   A disc like object was seen in the left corner of the house.   I questioned Walmart and they said it was not any of their equipment, and they asked if my car window was down, and yes it was.  I still have the photograph.  I am a retired nurse and also have a background in sociology.  This was a strange event and I rarely talk about it, and I do not laugh at those saying they have had encounters.

I ran inside to grab a family member.  Me and my little sister looked up to the sky, when we did, the craft began to move slowly.  We just stood there with our mouths open wide.  Then all of a sudden, the craft was gone!  We didn&apos;t see any explosion, or anything.  Ever since then, if I am to go out in the dark, I always look up to find only stars.

This smaller light grew to the intensity of the first light, while the other light dimmed out and seemed to drop in altitude.  I eventually lost sight of the initial light behind a hill, but the second light crossed over the expressway above us.  I didn&apos;t hear any sound from the light.

I was taking pictures of the fall colors at the Lake Michigan lakefront in Milwaukee with my Sony Digital camera from my apartment window on 10/17/05.  When I looked at the photo, I saw a white spot in the right center of the picture, which I first assumed was a reflection or flaw in the memory chip. Upon closer inspection, I thought it could have been a lighted glowing object racing across the lakefront at a very high speed - which would not have been seen by the naked eye, but was captured by the very fast shutter speed of the camera.  It appears to be heading east to west, leaving a small trail of light in its wake, similar to a jet exhaust. I took numerous other photos of the same area under similar conditions that night and some days later, but could not reproduce the object, whatever it is.

The hair on the back of my neck stood up and I could feel like an adrenaline rush shoot through me cold when suddenly, after it was stationed for 3 minutes, shot to the left, still in sight, and then right back to its original position.  It stayed in position there for another few seconds before shooting to the left again and back before it shot off towards the right, but back behind it.

There was extensive cloud cover and a fairly brisk breeze blowing the clouds along. I looked up and saw a glowing elliptical object moving below the clouds. It was yellow/white in the center and reddish/orange around the edge. Their were no blinking lights and no sound. It appeared to be about three times the size of Mars right now which is on a close approach to Earth. I had the object in sight for about 5-6 seconds before it slipped into the clouds and was gone. A short time later the clouds blew out and I could see the stars of Cassiopeia in the area where the disc was.

Well anyway, I was like 7 or 8 years of age, with my sisters and mother all watching tv after a late dinner.  My father was at work and my older brother was sleeping in the basement. All of a sudden I remember my house being violently vibrated, not like a earthquake vibrate, more like a fast high pitched vibrate.  Like a loud bumble bee. My mother goes outside with me in arms to check it out.  We both look up to see a steady hovering circlular plane about a 20 feet from the top of my house.  We just stared at it for about 3 minutes and it slowly moves down my street going over all my neigbors houses.  Very dark black base with three ports of blue red and green.  The colors are faded from my memory. Anyway, my mother calls up 911 to report it, the operator said she doesnt know whats going on.  She says to my mom the switch board over at the control center is lit up with callers from the same area.  We get a call back from the operator to let us know that response they got from air traffic control was that it was a military test.  Obviously this is bull, or maybe not, a few neigbors call my house to ask about the loud noise, and some call ask about seeing a large object above my house. I was so young when this happened but it is all pretty clear to me. I mostly remember seeing the fear in my mom&apos;s face making me nervous.  When the object was out there, she had tried to video record it but her batteries were dead.  Sounds a bit clishea (spelling) ((clich&eacute;)) but she remembered charging it to full the day before.  The wierd thing about this story is also that, when I asked all my sisters, neigbors, and mother about the details of what they saw.  They all say a different thing.  That&apos;s what baffles me.  My mother said it was triangular, I say it was circular, two of sister say long oval, neigbor says sphere.  One sister recalls hearing no vibration just seeing a silent object in the sky.  Another sister recalls vibration.  I recall it too. Mother says red, green, and blue portals, siter says pitch black, other sister says one big port in the center.  I feel that what happened that night was alot more than I can remember.  I suffered from chronic day and night terrors ever since it happened.  No alien dreams or anything, just the feeling of pure fear.  I&apos;m getting tired  noe and would like to share more but Im going pass out, good night :) :)  p.s this is no bull, i work full time and dont have the time write false crap, but how can I prove that. I guess I can&apos;t.((NUFORC Note:  The date shown above is approximate.  We will invite the witness to have his family members submit reports, as well.

This put the object directly over Laughlin, Nevada.  She indicated that it was visible since at least 2120 hrs.We continued watching the object until aprox. 2134 hrs. when it moved north east from its origional position.  At the time the object faded out and disapeared.  This happened extremely quick.We went back inside at that time.  About 2138 hrs., her mother contacted us on the phone yet again and indicated that the object was back and was now much closer and moving at a much higher rate of speed.  At this time, I took two pictures of the object which unfortunately came out extremely blurry.At this time, the object appeared to be in a large spiral towards the ground.  The object disapeared behind some houses out of sight and was not seen again.  It is unknown if the object made contact with the ground or not.  We left and traveled to the river to get a clear view of the area it would have landed, but were unable to witness anything.The object was a reddish color.  The size was spherical, but appeared to be attached on a pendulum in the way its motion was preceived.There was no wind present, so the lateral movement would not be plausable to move a flare around to the extend that occured.I can provide the photos if needed, however the quality is extremely poor.Another issue that may or may not be related to this case is the portable phone my wife was using was acting up.  Normally, the phone is good at the distance we were from the base station.Air traffic was present in the surrounding area, although they were up above 30,000 feet.", "7 ufo&apos;s stop over the upper delaware river valleyIt was dusk, I was driving along the pennsylvania side of the upper delaware river valley (route 191) I noticed lights that seemed strange, so I pulled over to the side of the road and got out of my car. There were red &amp; white lights on the front of the ufo, about 15 or 20 lights going across. They would flash at different speeds, from one end to the other.  So you would see a red light flash on the left side, then a white light next to it, then a red and so on.....there was absolutely no noise from the ufo, then I noticed another one in the distance, with the same type of light pattern, and then another one flying from another direction.  On the other side of the road behind me, there were many trees, so when a ufo flew that way, I could not see it anymore.  So when a ufo would come from over the trees in that direction, I could not say if it was the same one I just saw minutes ago, or if it was another one.  The most I saw in the sky at any one time was 7.  My best guess is that they were flying no higher than a 15 story building.  One flew right over me, and from underneath it seemed to look like a glowing egg.  The only unusual movements were two ufo&apos;s that were flying straight towards each other, instead of colliding, one of them stopped over the top of the other one, after about 10 seconds? the one on top suddenly backed upwards at a 90 degree angle.  After 30 - 40 minutes, one by one they turned off all the lights (red &amp; white) and then a single glowing orange light came on.They started to &apos;park&apos; over the delaware river.  It looked like a constellation once they had all parked (7 ufo&apos;s)  So after awhile I figured the show was over and that I should go home and tell my wife, well I crossed the river into new york state, and after less than 5 minutes driving I saw another ufo with the same red &amp; white lights as before.  So I pulled over to look at it, and it turned out there was a company located there, as I drove into the parking lot, I stopped my car and called 3 people over, saying do you know what&apos;s flying out here, the one guy with a girl, said it could be an airplane and left, the guy who stayed, I told him it was flying right over us and didn&apos;t make any noise.  Then I told him it was going to &apos;park&apos; where those orange lights were, because now I was on the opposite side of the river from where I was before. The ufo parked with the other orange lights that looked like a constellation, and the guy said &quot;as long as they&apos;re not coming to get me&quot;  He then left abruptly.  This was a Friday night, June 2002.  I could figure out the exact date because the newspaper on the new york side &apos;the times herald record&apos; had a front page story a couple days after my mass sighting.  It was a story about a guy who took 15 minutes of daytime video footage of a ufo. The original spot for the sighting was a self storage business on route 191, just over the border (about 3 minutes) from Hancock, New York.  There are almost no companies on the new york side of the river (route 97) so it was very unusual to pull off the road suddenly and actually be in a company parking lot with people, usually it would just be trees &amp; deer.  This location here is about 50 miles northwest of pinebush new york, which is suppose to be the most popular spot for ufo sightings on the east coast of america.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I learned of this event around June of 1947.  The person who told me was my good friend ((name deleted)). As a background, understand that after WWII, many American Officers brought their families to Europe and Japan as a part of the Dependents of the Occupation Forces.  I was one of these dependents, my age was 10 years old.  We lived in the ((deleted)) Compound on the Bluff, by the horse racing track and POW camp, at the edge of Yocohama, Japan.  We, the ((family name deleted)) lived in House ((deleted)) and the ((family name #2 deleted)) lived in House ((deleted)) Compound.  The houses were two story with flat roofs.  The roofs were made to use, much like a top deck.((name deleted)), son of Colonel ((name deleted)), 8th Army in Occupation, was with his father one morning.  They had a Japanese brass telescope Colonel ((name deleted)) brought home for his son. They also had a 7X binocular.  They were experimenting with the telescope, at the time this occured.   I will paraphrase what ((name deleted)) told me, for it is worth being recorded. They were taking turns looking through the telescope and binocular when ((name deleted)) father noticed a dark shape in the sky.  A perfect target on which to experiment with.  Colonel ((name deleted)) first looked at it through the binoculars, then took the telescope and brought the boject into its field of view and focus.  I was soccer shaped. ((((name deleted)) said he and his dad took turns watching this object through both the binocuar and the telescope.  It was traveling toward them.  It traveled over to and above the race track and paused.  That was about one mile away.  It paused.  ((name deleted)) said it was not high, probably several thousand feet in the air.  This would put it under any cloud cover. I asked what did it look like?  It looked like a soccer, it was &quot;metal-like, but the underside was somewhat darker.  The edge of the soccer was sharp, not rounded.  It had no windows or such. I asked what did it do?  It move around and then stopped in the sky and just hovered.  Then it would move to another locaation and again hover. For the record, at the time (1947) Yocohama showed the full brunt of many B-29 strikes.  The city was 90% burned out with an occasional structure standing amist a totally distroyed area, block after block.  Down toward the harbor, the canals were chocked with sunken wooden junks.  Out in the harbor several large ships were sunken in the harbor. The dock facilities were equally damaged.  The city was totally distroyed.  Many of the people who lived in the hills surrounding Yocahoma were really the only houses spaired by the bombing strikes.  The race track wa also spared, probably because it was a POW camp.((name deleted)) said this &quot;craft&quot; was slowly crossing across the destroyed city.  It looked like it was inspecting the damage. Where did it go?  I asked. It went across us and slowly made it way across the city heading toward the harbor. Did you see it by eye and in the binocular and telescope?  Oh sure, it was easy to follow.  I was in good view, expecially in the telescope. What did it look like?  Like a soccer.  It was round, it was soccer shaped. Did it make a noise?  No, not at all. I was totally perplexed.  This was the first time I ever heard of a flying machine shaped like a soccer.  All flying machines had wings and big motors and they dropped bombs and shot machine guns and made lots of noise.  None hovered!  How long did you watch it?  I asked in perplexed wonder. A long time, we watched it go out toward the harbor.  It moved around, paused and then turned off toward the left(toward Mount Fugiama) It slowly moved off.  we watched it until we could not see it any more, even in the telescope. What was it?  I don&apos;t know.  It wasn&apos;t an airplane. What did your dad say?  He said it wasn&apos;t an airplane.  He didn&apos;t know what it was, but it was real, we could see it.  The binocuar and telescope gave us real good views. With that, we went on to other things that 10 year boys do.  We probably went over to the open field where we played baseball with the Jananese children.  I played right field.   I seem to remember ((name deleted)) was a baseman.  Anyway that was the end of our conversation about the unidenitfied flying object. I left Japan in August of 1947.  I believe ((name deleted)) was still living in House # ((deleted)).  I do remember asking him about this strange soccer.  I asked what his father did. He reported it. I asked, what happened?  He said, &quot;Nothing.   We never heard another thing.&quot;  As far as I know, that is where it ended.  His father being a full bird coloner in the 8th US Army, like mine were pretty VIP.

One night (during late hours) I was awakened because I heard my daughter crying, I sat up on my bed and to my surprise I saw a short being with gray skin and large eyes that fit the description of the beings that people report as alien beings.There were two more at each side of my bed as well (total of three). Being that I am also a martial arts expert it was clear that these small beings were no match, at least physically to me. It all happened in milliseconds...I saw my daughter sitting on her bed as well and in the middle of the commotion my wife would not wake up.I felt numbing vibrations aimed at the lower portion of the back of my head. I had the sensation that the sensation was some form of attempt to restrain me. I did not like the scene at all, I was fully awake and not unders what is known as sleep paralysis.I decided to instantly repell the intruders to protect my family as a triggered instinct. It was clear they could not understand or prevent my initial attack but before even touching the closest one to my bed I was incapacitated by a sharp energy shock. It was aimed to my back and delivered instantly to my spinal cord approximately below my shoulder plate bones.I was immobilized falling back into my own bed as I could still hear my daughter cry.

The object must be flying over the high altitude or possibly outer space.  I could only compare the object with star lights and its dime orange color.   The object seemed to be moving slightly zigzag at times (it might be caused by the atmospheric effect).  The speed was undermined, but it moved faster than conventional airplanes.

This was about 7:30 PM. The Orb had been following our vehicle in what appeared to be a straight course to the far left of me but also moving towards us.  I had a strange feeling it was watching us and following us back home. As we turned some corners and finally getting home I didn&apos;t see the light anymore so I thought it was probably just a plane with bright lights, but I decided to go outside and look up at the sky anyway because I had a feeling that it wasn&apos;t a plane. At about 8:00 PM I saw that the Orb had reached the starlit sky where I was standing. It must have followed our vehicle all the way back. What happened during the next three hours are things I don&apos;t think can ever be explained. It moved very slow, without any sound at all. Imagine a hang-glider gliding over the sky without a sound, all was quiet. By this time however, the object had drastically dimmed to an eery dark glow and I saw what looked like a perfect black triangle. I could make out the entire outline as if the lights of the moon and stars were reflecting off of it. The Triangle was very detailed. In fact it looked similar to that recent Triangle UFO posted on this website from Auston, TX. But there were some big differences with the one I saw. There was a red front light on the tip of the Triangle, and two red stationary lights on the two back tips. None of the lights moved or changed. The lights were dim, like those laser-pen lights, and lit up the image of the Triangle. There were no planes around when this was happening. My backyard was small, and darkened, it was situated in an apartment complex. I stayed there to watch as I didn&apos;t want to go out into the open sidewalk. The movement was very strange, it would drift further away, turn around and then go the other way, as if it was rotating in a long, slow circular pattern. It went on like this for about two hours. Sometimes it would fade off in one direction only to appear at another place in the sky. At one point the Triangle&apos;s red tip shot out a faded yellow light beam through the sky. The beam had no movement and reached a far distance. Then the beam would vanish. I decided to walk around the apartments a bit and it seemed like the object would turn its course and follow my direction. The last hour, the third hour around 11:00 PM, it was in the middle of the sky and did the strangest thing, it shot out a small white orb from the side. The orb slowly went a ways then changing its course flew back inside the Triangle. I had no idea what it was doing but that is what happened! The orb looked like one of the stars but it had no sparkling effect like a star does. Eventually the Triangle drifted off through the sky I don&apos;t know where it went from there, but I could no longer see it.

There were 2 white pulsing lights in tandem and then 1 red light that was fixed in what appeared to be the front of this object. I could not actually see the object but could see the lights and they moved together like they were attached. These lights were low in the sky and below the normal flight line of normal aircraft on approach to ORD ( there were many other aircraft in the sky at the time and this object must have been noticed by other planes ). What really made me stop was the fact that they just stopped and then turned like they were on some sort of swivel. They then started heading east at a rapid speed and made another swivel turn to the south when I lost sight of them behind the tree/building line. When the object turned I never lost sight of the lights ( they were never obscured like a plane banking) and they turned on a level plane...The two white lights got wider apart and the red light actually moved to the middle of the 2 white lights and then the object seemed to move away from me.

The light was a pale shade of white and constant, and it appeared to be traveling in a northerly direction, at irregular speed.

They were both extremely excited and wanted to look through my binoculars, which I turned over to them almost immediately.By this time, the object was still visible with the naked eye, but not as clear as a couple of minutes earlier. After about one minute, I could not see the object, either because it was too far away, or because it had traveled into the somewhat low cloud layer.The two guys and I all agreed on what we had seen, as being something of a triangle with no noise, and again, I cannot even begin to estimate the size of the thing because I could not judge the distance.I hold a Commercial Pilots license with instrument and seaplane/multi=engine ratings and have been flying since 1976, and former CFI and CFI-II.

The object was glowing neon green in color and did not appear to have any tail as a meteor would.  It had to be fairly large or close to the tree tops.  I could see the moon and the object at the same time.  It looked to be 1/3rd the size of the moon. This is an area with few lights (couple of street lights) and on a cloudy black evening.

The only problem was that it was around 12:00 in the afternoon.  The sun is very bright in So. Cal. at 12 noon even during winter.This object did not move like what you think of in a zigzagging craft.  In fact, it moved rather slowly across the sky comparable to the moon&apos;s path across the sky that day which happened to be the only space object i could see that day.  Or, at least, it should have been the only thing i saw that day.This started to lead me to believe that it was a satellite. However, i have been to the desert at night and seen satellites with my own eyes. It appears to me that satellites move across the sky at a good pace.  Am I wrong? Anyways, i observed this craft or object or whatever for about 1 1/2 hrs.  During this time, i was able to go in and out of my house, watch t.v., go out and check on it again...and i took some pictures...What prompted me to write this was the reaction i got from friends and others when i showed them these images.  In the photos, you can see the bright object next to a cloud for perspective.  I have about 5 pictures of the object itself.  I also took a picture of the moon and an airplane during this time to give perspective on the object&apos;s shape.If this object is man-made my guess would be that it is a satellite with a shiny body and two dark panels on the side. The bright middle and dark sides is the characteristic shades/colors of this object.  My camera is only 3.2 megapixels, so i wish i had a more powerful camera that day.  Maybe it is a secret government spying satellite.I honestly have no idea what this object may be...but it is certainly open to debate.  I had never seen the object before and I never have since and it doesn&apos;t keep me awake at night.  just thought others might be interested in my observation.

We drove to north of the airport in my city, where there is a Polish Hall. We parked in the parking lot, put some music on, nothing out of the ordinary was happening. The parking lot is to the east of the building, and it stretches about 4 or 5 rows north with more spaces. North of that is a soccer field, than a small field, just less than the size of the soccer field, and groups of trees where the forest begins to start, I would say two soccer field lengths away from where we were parked. It was around 10:40, or 10:45 PM when I glanced up into the sky above the trees in the distance, to the north east and I saw this glowing small orange light. I though it was a plane at first but it struck me as odd, because it was moving very very slowly. The object appeared to be moving southwest towards the town of Whitby, or Brooklin, which is the north part of the city, but remained at a very low height. As it came more towards the west and directly in front of our view, the shape began to change but because it was closer, not because it was morphing or anything. It became an oval or disc shaped glowing orange. It looked like it was a giant glowing neon orange object at this point. Definetly was not a plane as I have been living beside this airport for a few decades, and all that usually flies out of there are the small DC planes. We have a police copter, but it already flew by about 30 minutes before this happened, and I can tell you this thing didn&apos;t make a sound in the sky at all. It was a clear night, no sound. As it came closer towards whitby, more southwest, the orange seemed like it was the back of the object, as if it was some sort of afterburner like on a jet, but extremely large. You could somewhat see a shadow of the body, in the sky, but again it was nighttime, and very dark so it wa hard to make out the shape. It seemed like a giant egg or oval. Right before it left our viewpoint, at the closest point to us, clearly the orange was the back of the craft. It seemed that it had two giant afterburners of some sort on the back, you could see the outline of the body in the dark and these small flashing lights began to appear, on the top, bottom, the middle around the sides, and at the front. I distinctly remember them being a blue, orange, off white, red, and green. Then it was gone without a sound. The next day at my old job, I overheard a woman i worked with talking about the same thing. I knew what I saw really was an event that cannot be explained. I even called the airport about planes in the area and they are supposed to have a curfew for planes flying at 11PM so there should not have been anything in the sky. I drew a picture in the paint program I will email to you. I have seen strange orange lights over lake ontario in whitby before, but this was much closer and it was a longer duration.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Around the perifery, inside and outside this ring were erratic pulsating flashes of white light.

There were no colors except for white and no sound. We all stared up mystifed and watched this light show display for 30 minutes or more, no one could take their eyes off of it.

The party was actually set to begin around 9 P.M. but I needed to get there early because I was bringing my entire stereo system (which included a then-rare equalizer with spectrum analyzer).  I didn&apos;t have many friends back then, but whenever there were parties, I would bring my whole stereo, and for a while I would be the center of attention as dozens of drunk and stoned teenagers stared at the dancing lights of the equalizer in a dark room while listening to heavy metal music.  I, on the other hand, never drank or smoked or used any drugs in high school, and in 1985 had left high school a year early to go to the local community college in Stone Ridge, NY.  I didn&apos;t see my friends very much that year, so I was willing to put up with their smoking and drinking because otherwise I would never see them.  This meant driving my parent&apos;s car with the windows open even when it was cold so that the smell of marijuana and cigarettes would not stay in the car.  On this particular night I stopped on Tongore Road in Stone Ridge to pick up another freind who had no desire to get a driver&apos;s license even though he was 18.  This friend had a neighbor nearby who suppled him with marijuana and it was expected that he bring some to the party.  As I drove northwest on Tongore Rd. away from Rt. 209, he started smoking some of the marijuana, so we opened our windows.  We got about a mile away, to the flat area down the hill from Thumbprint Antiques, headed towards the Drumlin.  At that point my friend was already acting a little high, and was not paying attention to our conversation.  I saw what appeared to be a large house on a hill to the north with a lot of floodlamps turned on.  I said something to the effect that it must be nice to be that rich to afford such a big house and keep all the lights turned on.  For some reason, I felt like making a point of how he was not listening, so in the middle of the flats, there was a small dirt driveway leading to a field (like the kind farmers use to access their fields with a tractor), and I pulled in a few feet.  Then I pointed out the big house with all the lights on.  But when my friend finally saw it, we both realized it was not a house but a moving object.  Within a few seconds we both realized that the object was huge because it was several miles away and was as big as a house would appear from a quarter-mile.  It was travelling directly towards us.  It took a couple of minutes before it was nearly overhead.  We could both see that it seemed to have a flat bottom with many flashing lights and may have been cube shaped, although it was difficult to see the sides of the object with all the flashing lights on the bottom shining in our faces.  In that flat area there was one large tree, and the object appeared to be getting lower, as if to land, and was not more than a hundred feet above the tree.  I had shut off the car when we pulled in, and we had the windows open to air out the smoke, but we both noticed that there was no noise whatsoever.  Realizing almost silmultaneously that this was no normal aircraft (because it was silent, only 100 feet in the air, travelling very slow, and as big as a football field) we panicked, thinking that this thing was about to land on top of us and crush us. I remember feeling like an ant must feel just before a shoe steps on it on the sidewalk. So I started the car and squealed the tires, backing out of the driveway and drove away at the highest speed a 1973 Pinto could do.  We headed back towards Rt. 209 on Tongore Rd. up a steep hill where the car would not go over 30 m.p.h. and the object was nearly directly overhead.  It was going slightly faster than us and had gained some altitude to clear the trees on the ridge where Rt. 209 runs through Stone Ridge.  We followed it down Cottekill Rd. to Lucas Turnpike where the speed limit increases to 55 m.p.h.. At that point I was driving about 65 or 70 but the object was going a little bit faster.  We followed it for about 20 or 25 minutes before losing sight of it as it cleared the Shawangunk mountain ridge near the Mohonk Mountain House. We had traveled about 15 miles and the object had traveled about 25 miles during those 25 minutes, and it&apos;s speed seemed to go from about 35 m.p.h. to about 75 m.p.h., much slower than any aircraft I have ever seen. We drove over the mountain to see if we could see it over the Hudson valley near New Paltz, but the winding road and steep hills slowed us down.  By the time we got to the Hudson valley, it was gone.  When we finally arrived at the birthday party a couple of hours late, the other people were only concerned about the marijuana.  The keg was already empty, and they seemed a little upset that we were so late.  They accused us both of making up the story so that we could smoke the marijuana ourselves (which I definitely did not do).  My friend, the birthday guy, laughed when we told him the story, and 20 years later still does not believe either of us who saw the object, even though we have stuck to the same story for so many years. The friend who saw it aknowledges that he saw it 20 years ago and remembers chasing it many miles down dark rural roads, but seems content not to question what it was.  Whatever it was, it was big, like the size of a city block of apartment buildings 5 or 10 stories tall, but seemingly solid. This event is one of the biggest reasons I have never been on an airplane, because it seemed that even a jumbo jet could have crashed into this object and only dented it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I saw a flash of light travel past at some what of a flat angle from east to west directly over the contrail. It lasted just about half a second.  I said &quot;hey, I just saw a shooting star&quot;.

I ran to the backyard but by then  I saw that it was disappearing behind the trees. I have no idea how far up this object was.It was not too high or too low.  The only height I can compare it with are the jets coming from Newark Airport about 35 or 40 miles from here.

There were no clouds or aircraft in the sunseting sky.  I looked in the vicinity of where the object was to see if it was an aircraft but then noticed how far off it was and realized it was huge.  The size of it is what got my attention.  By the size and how far off it was it had to have been over Mexico.  It seemed to morph from a cone shape into a circle.   I would not dismiss the possibility of it being a cloud. However the sky was totally clear in all directions and the shapeshifting happened in the course of about 5-7mins.

It was visible directly forward while travelling on the I-15 southbound.I was traveling home from work on thursday, the 8th of December. The time was around 3:50-4:00 pm. I was headed South on the I-15, toward the 215 turnoff to head west (where I live). I saw a large object in the sky, completely circular and grey. It hovered just above the mountain which was facing me (south). At first my eyes did not recognize the object in the air, and then I did a double take. It hovered there for about a minute. During this time of me spotting the object, I was beginning to exit the 15 South, and head down the 215 west. Furing that turnoff, you get taken underneath a section of freeway, temporarily blocking the view of the craft. When I finally completed exiting the freeway, and was finally on the 215, I looked back and the craft was gone.

It didn&apos;t move, make noise, cause any electronic interference I was aware of, and it didn&apos;t emit any light.

After several cups of coffee, I went outside to relieve myself, when I noticed a round or oblong object high in the upper atmosphere. What drew my attention to it was the extremely wide vapor trail or cloud that emanated from the object as it slowly spiraled downward in a long, wide, and very slow spiral. Aside from appearing unusual, what really fascinated me was that the vapor trail or cloud the object produced, was a pale green color and was pulsating. I watched the object for approximately 10-15 minutes, when it finally just stopped.  The cloud continued to pulsate and then slowly faded from pale green to white and looked then like any other cloud in the sky. It was a full moon night and very clear. I watched the cloud then fade to nothing.  I thought it may be a satellite falling to earth after losing it&apos;s orbit, but then I feel it would have been traveling at a much greater speed once it entered earth&apos;s atmosphere.

The light was white and could be seen dimming, and becoming brighter. The object exited the clouds, growing slowly in brightness until it was in the clear starry sky. The slow brightening of the object showed how low the object was. A jet would have instantly appeared. This object was in the low surrounding clouds. The object traversed from west to east, at about a 40-45 degrees above the horizon. We were facing north north west. It had no blinking lights. It was white in color. The brightness remained constant upon exiting the clouds up until it disappeared into another cloud blank to the east. The object made no sound. It was very quiet out. Our property had just flooded and we could hear wate trickling 50 yards away. We waited a few minutes but heard no sounds of a jet or a Cessna. I looked for an exterior structure around the orb as it passed across the many stars. The stars remained constant. It was only a sphere with a slight haze surrounding it. The speed was consistent with a jet at 30,000 feet, and much faster than a Cessna. We live within 3 miles of the local airport, so we are familiar with their night time speeds and flight patterns. Thsi was not a Cessna. The object also had what I call a &quot;bob and weave&quot; motion to it. It did not fly in a completely straight trajectory. It seemed to have a slight bounce to it, though not noticable unless it was in close proximity to nearby stars. I am very happy with this sighting.

As I walked through a large open area between the school and my next customer&apos;s house, I looked up to marvel at the number of stars I could see.  I then noticed two red lights directly above me.  At first I thought I was looking at an airplane, but quickly realized that wasn&apos;t what it was.  There was absolutely no noise, and the red lights were perfectly round.  The light was solid and didn&apos;t blink.  It wasn&apos;t defuse and didn&apos;t radiate which gave me the impression I was looking at bright colored spheres or discs, possibly illuminated from within, and not actual lights. The two discs moved together across the sky, one after the other, slightly staggared, not side-by-side.  They moved very slowly.  I remember thinking they were about the size of dimes.  I could not tell how high up they were, but they were higher than the tree tops.  I do not remember seeing anything solid between the lights.  I saw them as two separate objects and not lights at either end of something else.  They were fairly close together, about twice their individual diameters apart.  What made this memorable for me is I immediately recognized them as something unusual and strange.  It was like nothing I had ever seen or heard about.  I remember the sensation of heaviness, and a strong feeling of anxiety.  I was unable to move, and I believe this was due to fear.

I read a short article in the local news paper that claimed that 2 individuals recently witnessed a UFO event up the local mountain near a forest fire tower. Everyone was familiar with this area, and it was a nice night out, so we decided to go up there for a few beers and who knows, maybe we would see something. We were there for maybe an hour or so, and noticed lights shining upon the fire tower. It kind of looked like a spotlight, or maybe a cars headlights. Nothing unusual, so we weren&apos;t scared and we climbed the fire tower to get a better look. When we got up near the top, we looked over in the nearby valley, and a yellow glowing ball just floated up from down within the valley, no sounds. Just a very erie looking glowing ball. And then it hovered there for a few minutes as me and my friend were amazed by this. I would estimate the object to have been about 3/4 of a mile away, hard to comment on it&apos;s size at that range. It could have been 10 ft across... could have been larger 20-30 ft maybe. The interesting thing was that we knew exactly where it was...Since we know the area so well.  It came up with the mountain behind it, so it was not some very distant plane or star being mistaken.  You could clearly see it hovering there with the mountain behind it, less than a mile away.Down in that valley is an old abandoned strip mine that is flooded with water to the top.  Anyway, after a few minutes we noticed the flashing lights again, coming from behind us.  And in the distance we could see what looked like some sort of plane coming in towards us.. very fast, with blinking lights.  We were directly between the glowing ball &amp; the plane, so it was coming right at us at low altitude.  Within a few seconds what appeared to be a triangular shaped jet passed right overhead maybe 200 ft above us, and towards the glowing sphere, and we ran down the steps of the fire tower scared to hell.  We got into our vehicles and got out of there pronto, a little shaken and amazed at what we just witnessed.

The sky was clear of clouds except for the distant horizon (West) which had clouds only at the base of the sky, and behind us there was a small bank of clouds through which the nearly full moon had just risen. As we scanned the western horizon above remnants of the sunset, two of us saw 4, perhaps 5 repetitions of a light show.  We saw a row (once two separate rows) of very bright yellow-orange lights, large rectanglular &apos;panels&apos; of light perhaps 4 times as tall as they were wide, in a regular horizontal row.  One of these phenomena involved two rows of lights next to each other, but not in the same-dimensional plane -- as if there were two objects giving off light that were not level with each other.  The # of &apos;light panels&apos; we saw at any given time varied from three to seven altogether; the time we saw seven there was a gap or space of darkness which provided a marker and it was as if the lights were slowly rotating out of sight on the right hand edge. The lights were out over the ocean, perhaps 3 to 5 miles, about 15 or 20 degrees above the horizon from our vantage point.  There were no other lights visible before, during or after we saw these lights (no running lights).  No Sound we could hear above the surf.  The lights were on, very bright light like looking through ports into a blast furnace, for 20 to 30 seconds, and they did not move, remained stationary in the sky, and then they would all turn off at once.  The second set of lights was WNW or so, then the two sets of lights next to each other again due West, then one at WNW again, and finally one light due West down closer to the surface of the water that I saw with peripheral vision, only briefly.  From one sighting to the next, the lights appeared in a different part of the sky, but at the same height, and after a 30 second to 1 minute pause.  We never saw the outlines of craft, or saw the lights move at all when they were on.  One of those times, my partner saw the lights reflect off the surface of the ocean, not as if searchlights, but just that the light was so strong and bright it clearly reached the water and bounced back up. All of this happened within a span of 5-7 minutes, then it stopped.  From that distance, we estimate these lights were something like 4 feet wide and 10 feet tall @ 2-3 miles away: they were huge and very bright.

Somwhere over Los Angeles. It then makes a straight beeline towards the north, stops at approximately over La Canada or 10-15 degrees north of my horizontal and then heads east to the original point.  It will often stop and repeat the pattern or will execute a right turn and head straight south and out of sight.  Other times when it turns to the North it keeps on going until out of sight.  When there are two lights, they fly in irregular patterns and sometimes seem to go around in circles like they are chasing each other.  Then, one will stop and the other goes off to the South West.  Very seldom, a pulse trail appears when the light starts to move from a stopped position and it will also change to a dull orange or red color when it comes to a stop. The time of tracking is normally seconds ie. 5-10.  Sometimes, they move in straight lines, but most of the time, they travel in a slight waving pattern at a high rate of speed.

My wife and I saw the exact, and I mean exact same object over 20 years ago in Georgetown, Texas, 25 miles north of Austin. We were freshmen in college and dating at the time - we were standing outside in my parents driveway at about 11pm when we saw what appeared to be a very large, delta-shaped object with lights below it and a bright light shining out in front (similar to a helicopter). This object was coming from the North and passed directly over our heads at an altitude of about 500 feet. We were sure at first it was a very quiet military plane until it passed over and it made absolutely no sound whatsoever. I joked as it came towards us that it was a UFO and my wife laughed until it passed quietly overhead - she then burst into tears. It passed over fairly slowly, the whole episode took about 45 seconds. We called the Sheriffs department who told us that they had been swamped with calls about the object. They also told us that they thought it was probably an experimental aircraft out of Fort Hood in Killeen, 30 miles north of Georgetown. After reporting it my wife and I pretty much kept it to ourselves unless people were telling UFO stories. It didn&apos;t seem extremely important to me until I saw that drawing and read of the close proximity to where we saw our object. Note: When I asked my wife is she remembered the event she said &quot;of course&quot; but neither of us can remember exactly what month or year it was, it was either 1985 or 86 and it was summer, probably July and it was definitely late, around 11 or 12.

It was a partly cloudy day with mild weather. As I walked facing the north just outside the gate to my residence, what I though was a very bright star suddenly appeared about 50 degrees in front of me.  As I looked at it, it moved quickly to my left and stopped.  It then rose slowly changing from a bright start to clearly a solid inverted saucer shape dark brown in color.It hovered and as I looked at it, I saw out of the corner of my eye a second bright star that moved in the same manner and direction.  It also stopped and rose slowly in the sky to the same altitude/height as the first craft.  As I stood looking at the two of them a third one appeared from the same spot in the sky and moved in the same manner as the other two. The third one, however, hovered without gaining altitude like the first two and remained in appearance like an extremely bright star.  They formed a &quot;V&quot; formation in the sky. I stood in disbelief at what I was seeing and decided to call 911 on my cell phone to report what I was witnessing. The first object moved slighly back and forth leaving straight lines behind it.  I felt that they knew I was watching them.  While I was on the phone with them, all 3 objects simultaneously moved behind clounds.

My partner was standing in the bed of the truck pointing at an object that I can only describe as a ring of blue fire, hollow in the middle, moving up very rapidly. It had a small vapor trail following it. Then it disappeared.", "Small football-shaped  object travels silently over neighborhood in Dickens, Texas.I went outside when I realized that I had forgotten a blanket on our clothes line. Since our neighbor&apos;s dogs were barking I decided to wait outside long enough to see what was disturbing them.  At this point, I was not certain what direction the dogs were barking, and if they might be barking at me or something else.  I sat down on the ground so the dogs could not see me.  When the dogs stopped barking, I continued to listen for about three more minutes.  When I heard nothing unusual, I decided to go back inside the house.  As I started to sit up, I noticed a strange brown-gold light (football-shaped) off to my right (north) side. There is no light source in this area so I wondered where the light had come from. Each property lot is 150 feet wide and the object was above the south quarter of the third lot to the north.  I was in the north half of the first lot to the south, and there was one full lot between us---so the object approximately 300 feet to the north of me.  The object appeared to be moving at an approximate height of about 25-30 feet above the ground.  It was above the roofline of the furthest neighbor&apos;s house north, yet still under the treetops of the trees located in the lot to the west and north-west.  The trees, a mixture of mesquites and elm, range in height from approximately 6-50 or so feet tall. The object traveled very slowly, and without any sound, from east to the west.  The brown-gold light appeared to be some form of contained light source, as thought the light was reflecting inside a semi-transparent barrier with very little exterior illumination. The object did not light up the neighboring houses, the sky above it, or the ground below it. The light from my vantage point, appeared to be about half the size of a football held at arms length of 30 inches. [My closest night time &ldquo;guestimation&rdquo; is that the object was under ten feet in diameter.]  The object continued to travel horizontally and did fluctuate in height, speed, or direction of travel. I watched the light for approximately 5 seconds before it blinked out. As it blinked out, from light to totally dark, I noticed a slightly yellowish colored light at the east (back) side of the object like an arc of electricity sparking in a line from the middle south (left) side to the middle north (right) side. There was still no sound. I continued to watch to see if the object had continued to travel along the same path but it never passed in front of the trees to the west or north-west. Since it was dark outside and lightly overcast, I was not able to determine if the object had ascended up and out of my line of sight, or if it was still in the same spot and just not visible in the dark. Shortly before sighting this object, it sprinkled a few drops of rain and several bits of sleet. I had reached out to catch a piece of sleet to see how dense the ice was and to my surprise I drew back pieces of a reddish-orange particle that looked like tiny dried tree buds. The objects were not cold to the touch nor were they moist. They were crisp when rolled between the fingers and brittle. I was unable to see if there were similar objects falling further into the yard. We were due to receive scattered rain showers mixed with sleet and snow some time after midnight. There was no lightening in the area during this incident and there was no perceptible electricity in the air. It was partly cloudy and had sprinkled earlier but there was no precipitation at the time of the incident. There was a light wind from the ENE at about 6 mph. The temperature was 44 degrees F and we were expecting a night time low of 32 degrees. The humidity was 49% with a dew point of 25 degrees and a barometric pressure of 30.26 inches steady with a visibility of 10.0 miles. As an end note: The neighbors dogs to the west had been barking as though agitated for nearly a quarter hour before this incident. My dog went outside with me and she usually ingnores the neighbor&apos;s dogs, but she appeared to watch to see what the neighboring dogs were barking at. My dog normally likes to romp in the dark and pick up sticks to encourage me to chase her but she never left my side. She never appeared fearful or agitated but she did not hesitate to come back inside the house with me.", "Fast moving white lightI guess this wasnt as interesting as most sightings and there was no reason to suppose it was some alien spacecraft. I am just trying to figure out what it could be. I was in my car, driving about 30 MPH and I was the only car on the road. I was in the city and it was too cloded to see any stars at all. I just saw this white speck.It looked a lot like a light on a faraway airplane...very bright, white light.I couldnt really tell how far up it was but it traveled in a trajectory from right over my car straight in the direction I was facing and behind the buildings in front of me. It was only visible for a second or two, so it must have been traveling some incredible speed, Id say 10-20 times faster than an airplane. There was no sound and no trail. I second guessed myself that it was some reflection on the window but really I could tell that it was not, I saw it very clearly and its velocity seemed to change perfectly inverse with its distance. Considering downtown was roughly to my left it seems it was traveling west.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was a Correctional Officer on duty, roving the outer perimeter that evening. There was an air field near-by, where the military practice there training.  I do recall the military operating that evening, before I seen the bright lights in the sky. It was approximately 1:30 a.m. when the military completed there training operations.  It remained silent that night, after the jet noise had stopped.  It was approximately 2:00 a.m. when I seen these bright lights hovering in mid-air, over a group of trees, near a open field adjacent from the compound.  The lights went from a dim sparkling light, to a bright strobe light.  The colors around the object where like the marvelous colors of a rainbow, but prettier.  In the center of the object was a white/bright blue light, almost like a welders arc.  These lights where changing colors rapidly! My first reaction when I seen these bright lights, I took it as if it was just a military airplane at first. I said to my self, &quot;Wait a minute, that can&apos;t be an military aircraft because it is not moving at all!&quot;  So I immediately stopped roving, to make sure if what I saw in the sky was still a military jet.  To my knowledge, it did not appear to me as an airplane.  The cluster of lights where hovering in mid-air over the tree line. I immediately put my truck in park, I took out my binoculars so I could get a better view of this object hovering amongst the trees.  As I proceed to look through my binoculars, there was an aura around the floating light.  I got on my radio, and asked the officer in the watch tower to step out onto the catwalk to confirm what I saw.  We both came to the conclusion, that it was not a military aicraft, so it had to have been something else.  The lights remained in the sky for about ten minutes or so, then it disappeared.This is not the first time I&apos;ve seen something like this. I&apos;ve seen green lights from the sky.  It started in 1997 and it still goes on now. (green lights 1) The first time, was when I drove across the Campostella Bridge one night heading into Norfolk, Va. and out of no where this green flash of light lit up the night sky like it was daytime. It knocked out some power in the area. I thought it was just a flash of lightning, but there was no thunder following the powerful flash. I remember the clouds where really low that night, and the rain was misty. (green lights 2) The second time, was when I went to visit my mother in Virginia Beach. The time was 8:00 p.m. it was cloudy that night as well. I remeber that it was raining that night, the rain was misty and the wind was blowing kind-of  mild. I was getting out of my car about to knock on the door, then out of no where this green light flashed for 2-3 seconds over my mothers house. I felt as if the flash of light had frozen me where I  stood and this warm sensation just went through my body. My sister said she seen the same light one night, she asked me what it was.  I couldn&apos;t give her a answer, but I got a good Idea what it may be.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

But I was sorta stuck in shock I couldnt take my eyes off the thing, I was infatuated with it. I wanted to tell my husband to look but I couldnt.

Down the road there is an &quot;S&quot; turn, so when I got to it looked to my left and I could see the lights a lot better.   Here&apos;s the brightness of the lights from left to right:   The first light was dim, the second light was the brightest, the third light was dimmer than the second but not by much, and the forth light was as dim as the first one.

It was a clear night, without moonlight, to illuminate the night sky.  I love to watch the night sky and all the constellations as they shine brightly in northern Maine on a dark night. There was no noise (aircraft or vehicle) breaking the silence.  I was under a tall lodge pole pine tree waiting for my dog to come back.  I walked out from under the tree and looked up into the northeast sky at about 01:00 when I saw a large white light about the size of a full moon.  It was at an altitude of several thouand feet.  I stood there in amazement at the brightness of the light.  I just stood there, watching, wondering, where it came from and where it would move too. After about 2 minutes the light moved upward at a high rate of speed, disappearing within 2 to 3 seconds.  The light has never reappeared since this crisp morning in November 2002. Every time I look up in the sky, I wonder, when the next contact will come.The now closed Loring AFB is about six miles from my home.  The object (light) appeared to be hovering over the old base.

At first I thought it was a really bright star or maybe a planet and I commented on how bright it was because barely any other stars were visible. About 15 minutes later another one of these &apos;stars&apos; that looked exactly the same appeared above and to the right of the first object, at about a 45 degree angle from it. Now, we thought it was really weird and after about 5 minutes of both of the objects staying in place the second object started to dim and all of the sudden flew to the left and shortly after the first object did the same. It dimmed and flew to the left. We watched them until they disappeared behind some trees. I know it couldn&apos;t be a helicoptor or plane because the lights stayed motionless for so long and the glowing of them looked like stars.", "ufo sighting in central nyAt about 5:45 pm eastern time, we witnessed at 1st what looked like 2 large yellow lights in the sky. we thought it was possibly a plane getting ready to either land or just taking off.  we were not anywhere close enough to an airport for a plane to be that low. As i drove up over a bridge we continued to watch it. about 2 minutes later, it became clearer  to see what shape it was.  it was a disk shape and you could see numerous lights going around the craft.  it was exactly what you would see on tv. i pulled over to watch it and it then only showed 2 white lights, with 2 flashing red lights on each end. withen seconds it disappered. i am not a believer in ufo&apos;s or aliens, but what i did see looked exactly like a ufo!!", "A rotating circular and saucer shaped object changing colour with falshing lights and fast coming down towards the earth.There was a sudden cicular moving object in the sky whcih was green in colour and changed colour to blue and then red. The object was making rotational movements and was also having right to left movements. The first of the witnesses (a 8-year old child) asked her brother(10 years) and her cousin (11 years) to look up and watch it. The children got terrified as the object seemed to be fast approaching them and they believed it would strike the earth anytime. The child and the cousin ran inside but the brother thought it was just a flash and he continued playing. However on looking up after a minute or so, he also observed the same thing which was like a saucer with multiple lights flashing from its undersurface. There was a projection from the top surface and he thought a planet is falling down on the earth. It was blue and then changed to red. The lights under the surface were very bright and there was a fast rotational movement of the object going on and it was fast coming down towards him.

I came out the door, lit up and looked at the sky with a lot of stars out. I noticed a large blank spot amongst the stars and noticed the blankness was moving at a very slow pace. It was in the shape of an off &quot;V&quot; shape. It was an non reflective deep black. If someone was to just glance up would not notice it. It had six round white lights on the long side and four on the other side. I would say an estimation of size to be at least 20 blocks from wing tip to wing tip if that was what it was. It made no sound and seemed to just glide moothly through the air. It was about 200 feet about me. I watched and kept backing up to watch it. It passed over until the higher side of the hospital blocked my view. so I stepped to the other side of the patio to see where it went but it was like it vanished.", "Flashing Orange Lights accelerate with each jump and were parallel to each otherI don&apos;t know the exact date or time, but I remember we were walking to go see a movie of Columbus because it was the 500th anniversary of discovering the new world. My friend and I were walking East in Occean Beach, CA around sunset.  I saw 2 orange flashing lights on the Eastern horizon.  I grabbed him by the shoulder and without saying a word I pointed to sky.  These lights flashed and then made a jump towards the South.  They moved parallel to each other and after making an inital jump they appeared to jump back to the spot they had jump from before.  Each jump forward and backward increased their speed until they were moving faster than anything I&apos;ve ever seen.  I don&apos;t think this was an asteroid because it was moving slowly at first and then accelerated.  Plus there were 2 bright pulsing lights that moved parallel from North to South.  After the lights disappeared I asked him what he saw and he smiled and said you know what I saw.  My friend called in the report to some one over the phone, but no one else saw what we saw.  Most people were probably looking West at the sunset.  We see figter jets all the time in san diego, but this was no jet and this was no rocket either.  We were too far away to see the shape of the craft.  I would estimate we were 15 to 20 miles away.

Lights in a triangle pattern.My boyfreind and I were heading to my father&apos;s house where I grew up to celebrate the holidays.  We were traveling south on Mt. Philo Road in Charlotte when he noticed a large bright yellowish light in the sky to the right of Mt. Philo.  He asked me what I thought it was. I wasn&apos;t sure, I told him it might be a planet rising and we would have to ask my father if there were any rising at this time of year. He asked me if it was some kind of radio tower or something of that nature.  It seemed too high in the sky to be a tower like that, and too bright. We began to descend a large hill where the road heads toward the Mt. Philo state park when my boyfreind noticed a very small and dim blue light to left bright one.  At this point he mentioned that he thought it may be a helicopter when all of a sudden the bright yellowish light dimmed out and between where it had been and the dim blue one was, three or four large orange/gold dimmer lights flickered on and off with no rhyme or reason.  We both exclaimed &quot;Whoa, do you see that??.&quot;  As we approached it further, there was no sign of it moving from its original location.  We nearly passed underneath it on the road, about 50 feet from the intersection of the state park rd.  I would say it wasn&apos;t more than 200 feet in the air above us. Once we passed it, I noticed three super bright white lights in an upside down triangle formation.  After that, I lost sight of it because someone was following us closely and it became difficult to see past their headlights. When we arrived at my father&apos;s house, we explained what we had seen.  I returned about 10 minutes later to the spot with my father but it had gone. Last night (Wednesday, January 31, 2006), My father&apos;s girlfriend was traveling down the same road at about the same time and saw similar lights at the same location.", "Big Huge Bright Light Seen Over By My Cousin&apos;s House In Orland ParkI was over at my Cousin&apos;s House for our family Christmas Gathering over in Orland Park.I was waiting for a taxi-cab to take go home that evening.

It stood up there for about 15 minutes.  My taxi-cab had already came, and I was already gone. I was not too sure which way the front of my cousin&apos;s house was facing, because I only go there once a year for Christmas.

I have not told anyone especially my cousins, because they were all to busy getting drunk by being stress out for a future planned wedding.However, I was not drinking, because I am NOT much of a drinker.", "Anomalous light seen above well traveled highway in early morning hoursThis appears to be a recurring  sighting, as I have seen this object twice. It seems to be the same object. Yes, I am an amateur ufologist and that is why I am somewhat hesitant to report what I have been seeing.  I do not want it to be assumed that I am just another wacko.  I have went out into the back yard many times, wanting to see a ufo but have never seen anything that strange-just alot of commercial or military aircraft. Anyway, my first sighting of this object actually occurred on 11/22/05.  My girlfriend works at a local grocery store on midnight shift.  I pick her up from work at 6:00 am everyday that she works.  I usually leave the house around 5:30 am. I was traveling on U.S. Rt. 11 as I usually do from the town of Pulaski, through the town of Dublin, to Radford where my girlfriend works.  On route to pick her up, as I approached the town of Dublin, I noticed a golden colored light in the western sky.  I assumed it was Venus, although it seemed unusually bright and I had never noticed a light in the sky that had a &quot;golden&quot; hue. (Mars usually appears to have an orangeish or reddish hue and does&apos;nt sparkle or twinkle as this object does).  I thought to myself that this could be a star, but it just looked &quot;unusual&quot;. The sky was crystal clear and of course, at this time of morning it was still not yet daylight. The light appeared to be stationary. I got to the parking lot of the grocery store and looked in the general direction that I had seen the &quot;light&quot;, however, the lights in the parking lot were too bright and therefore obscured my view of the sky. I picked my girlfriend up and we proceeded on Rt. 11 toward home. I had told her what I had seen and asked her to look around in the sky. As we approached Dublin, we saw the light again. It looked like it was in the same position. We could not discern a clear &quot;shape&quot;, just a sparkling golden light. As we got closer to the light it looked as if it had iridescent qualities to it. We kept an eye on it and as we were headed in the opposite direction as when I initially saw it on my left, it was now to our right. As I was driving, I could not continually watch the light as my girlfriend could, but I saw what I can best describe as a &quot;white or silvery ball&quot; drop from the object. My girlfriend subsequently saw a total of 3 or 4 of these &quot;balls&quot; or &quot;spheres&quot; drop from the object. Again I was driving and could not continuously view the object. As we got closer, the object seemed to get larger and seemed to be directly overhead (directly above Rt. 11) as if it had moved from being on our right. I still could not discern a defined shape to the object, although my girlfriend said that it indeed seemed to have a &quot;saucer&quot; shape. To me, it seemed that the object had a changing or morphing shape. We eventually passed right under the object and as we did I had somewhat of an uncomfortable, foreboding feeling. As I was afraid I was going to cause a traffic accident trying to observe the object, I pulled over at a grocery store parking lot in the town of Dublin about a couple hundred feet up from where we had passed under the object. I turned the car around so that I was facing the direction where we had just seen the object and to our astonishment, it seemed to have disappeared. Since that time, I have kept my eyes peeled but saw nothing like it until the morning of 12/21/05 at 5:50 am on my way to pick my girlfriend up from work I saw the &quot;golden light&quot; again as I was approaching the town of Dublin. But this time as I got closer to the object the golden appearance of the light dissipated and became two seperate lights, one being white and flashing or strobing. The other light was on the other &quot;end?&quot; of the object and was a steady red color. The sky was super clear and I also noted that the object was to the east, opposite of the position I had seen it on the previous occassion. I proceeded down Rt. 11 to pick my girlfriend up in Radford. I had to wait on her to get off work as she did not get off work at exactly 6:00 am. I attempted to spot the object but as before, the parking lot lights&apos; brightness obscured my view of the sky. We went through the drive-thru at the McDonald&apos;s which is very close to my girlfriend&apos;s work to pick up breakfast to take home. I informed her that I had seen a &quot;UFO&quot; again and asked her to keep her eyes peeled. As we approached the town of Dublin I could see the &quot;golden light&quot;. I asked my girlfriend if she saw it and she confirmed. As we got into the town of Dublin and closer to the object, it again did not appear to be &quot;golden&quot; anymore. Again I saw a white flashing or strobing light on one &quot;end&quot; and a steady red light on the other &quot;end&quot;. However, this time there appeared to be small white lights (steady) in between the strobing light and the steady red light. My girlfriend also confirmed what I was observing. The object was still in an easterly position and was on my left as it had been on my right on the way to Radford. I again pulled over at the same grocery store lot as I had done previously on 11/22/05 and pulled the car back around to point in the general direction of the object. But this time we could still see the object and it once again looked golden in hue. We observed it for only a few seconds before it started to move toward the now rising sun on the eastern horizon. We observed the object moving in this direction until it moved behind a building in front of us and we could no longer see it. The object did not seem to be moving very fast, but was moving nonetheless. I almost forgot to mention that it only seemed to be about 500 feet above the ground both times I have observed this object. I would find it hard to believe that no one else has observed this anomalous light in this general area, as Rt. 11 is a heavily traveled highway, even in early hours of the morning, as people are commuting to work. Possibly no one else is looking toward the skies as they are pre-occupied with their commute to work? Anyhow, thanks for your time---I tried to be as detailed w/descriptions as possible.

While he was climbing up on his fence the object started to fade out. He didnt reach seeing it before it faded out, had probs getting up on his fence to see over his outhouse.

I am rather certin on the size as it&apos;s dianiter was as close as i was able to toll the same as the top of the roof.I have been in the military and it was not a plane or conventional air craft.it made no manoover other than a strate line it made no sound although it had obviously exceaded the sound barier several times.I now work in electronics and know of no way of doing this. It was a solid object below the high tree line it had no markings or visible openings. it was not a reflection and when we aproched it was aparent that it was centered above the house that is still standing. and to the bottom was not over 45 feet off the ground.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

It caught my attention because it was so large and not in the correct position to be the moon although it was white.  I looked at it and realized the edges were blurred and there was some difined shape within ot and then I noticed very faint twinkles of lights on the top flat side.  As I drove, I came to realize what I was seeing wasn&apos;t right.  I turned into a parking lot and lost the object behind trees for a moment, then found it again it what seemed to be a slightly different place in the sky.  At this point I was calling my husband and kids to tell them to go outside and look at the sky.  They were downtown and couldn&apos;t see it.  I sat in the parking lot and looked at it . It seemed to be staying in the same place and was doing nothing. At this point I thought maybe it was a street light off in the distance and that I was having some sort of visual/perseption problem.  Then it changed into a perfect circle and turned slightly orange and got smaller and smaller.  I thought it was disappearing.  I was still on the phone to my son explaining all this to him as I watched it.  I told him it was disappearing.  Then it reshaped itself back into the  shape that it was in the beginning.  I decided to drive and see if I could get closer. I lost it behind buildings and trees.  Found it momentarily again but then lost it all together.  I drove back towards home on Redlands Blvd.  I went to the intersection at which I first noticed the object and actually turned around again (to drive west) to see if I could see it again from that same spot.  It was not there.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witness may have been looking at Venus.  It is very bright, at present, and it is visible during the early evening hours in the southwestern sky.  PD))((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))I am the person whom reported this incident on 12/8.  I feel like I have to comment on the note at the end of my description of the event on the nuforc reports page.  The note said  that I most likely was seeing Venus.  This could not be the case.  I am familiar with what Venus looks like this time of year.  I saw a large glowing (not star like) half circle( with a few twinkles at the top)  that changed shape into a complete circle and changed color from white to orange.  It then shrunk to a pin point and then reversed the process and became a glowing half circle again althoug a little more stretched out (if that makes sense). The object I was looking at was MUCH larger than Venus. Again, Venus looks like a very large star with some orange color to it.  I notice it often.  This is NOT what I saw.  Thanks.  Just thought I should clarify.((END))", "green lights changing to blue floor vibratingno objects were seen but a green light appeared through three windows that are not located on the same wall while this happened the floor began to audibly vibrate (a loud whirring sound) the light then changed to blue then stopped i then looked out the window and observed nothing conversation about what that was started seconds later the lights and vibration started again i admit to being a little apprehensive about looking while the lights were still going but as soon as they stopped i looked out the window and saw nothing at this point i had to know so i went outside it was dead silent no cars on the road no one to be seen it may not sound like much but it was more convincing than any of the strange lights i have seen in the sky i felt the floor vibrate it was close question how do you live a normal day to day life when you know for fact that there is more out there what are you suppoosed to do i guess you just keep on breathing that&apos;s all", "Large carrier escorted by military copters over Puget Sound area.As best as I can recall, this event happened during the summer of 94 or 95. It was only recently that I recalled the event in a rather strange way. On Sunday morning, Dec. 11,05, I awoke suddenly, not from a dream or nightmare, but to a vivid memory of a large, Galaxy Class starship being escorted up Puget Sound by military helicopters. I was trembling and in shock, not from fear, but the thought of how I could forget such an fantastic event. It was then that I realized how &quot;they&quot; can get away with visiting and not getting caught. But this story has many facets to it that I can&apos;t try to explain it all. It was in the evening, I heard the copters flying over my house, which is on the bluff over looking I5 and the Nisqually Valley. There were two copters excorting what I would interpret as a large carrier,mothership, N.E. along the I5 route. They were moving at a slow deliberate pace. The carrier was typical battleship gray,and since it was still suuny out, I did not observe any lights. Since the craft was virtually overhead, I could only see the bottom and side of it. The side was lined with what appeared to be large bay doors. The size of the craft I can only say that 20 football fields may be a concervative estimate. Now why were there two copters excorting it? I can only speculate that it may have mechanical trouble and was being led north to the pole, out of public view. I seem to recall reports that this was observed along the sound and into Canada. Obviuosly, contact with the ship was made, and the military was coopering with them. I believe that through minimal media coverage, and the extraordinary nature of the event, things like this are quickly forgotten in the collective consciuosness. As long as we are distracted by lights in the sky, and unexplained objects, then the truth remains buried. I am seeking help to further clarify what I witnessed that day, since I cannot recall exactly when it happened. I do know it did happen, and there should be thousands of witnesses to this event. But if I am made to forget, then they are too.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was only 16 at the time and about 6-8 mos. pregnant with my daughter. I was with my best girlfriend, at the time, driving home from the Eastwood Mall.  We started joking.  We both seen these HUGE 3 bright lights in the sky. they were not moving at the time. As I was nearing her farm, to drop her off at her home, it became obvious that it was no longer a joke.I pulled into her drive, we both got out, curiosity overcoming us both.  It was the hugest thing I had ever seen, just hovering with no sound at all, over her field.  It was lower than very tall tree tops. We both started walking underneath of it. The metal was unlike anything yet, I have ever seen.  It was as big as a football field, with the three huge round white lights.  I could see all of these little compartments making up the whole bottom, that was coming down diamond shaped also. The only common thing that I have ever read was the same red light that was going around at the top. The overall shape was like the one I seen in the Star Wars Movie that same year. That was just so uncanny. When we finally started yelling for her sister and husband to come out of the house, and they did, it started moving slow, for a second or two, then made noise and sped off faster than anything I had ever seen. I went home and told my mother, who said for me not to say anything for people would call me crazy. The next day, however, it was seen by the workers out on break at Denman Rubber in Leavittsburg, where my husband was working at the time, and they reported it in the Tribune Chronicle of Warren, Ohio.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Visability was very good.I was sitting out, staring up at the sky in one area, and saw a satelite go by, i am assuming.. could have been a plane? Not real sure but it passes the same path every night. With the little dipper above, handle pointing down, a round oval blur, looked a deep gray (maybe)but with a light luminece to it, not at all bright, passed below the lil dipper, making a straight path to pass below Orions belt which was from the direction i was looking, was lower than the lil dipper to my right. I am thinking SE?..  It moved at a very steady, smooth pace.. but was quicker than a plane. No lights or sound. Holding my arm out it was probably the size of my thumb nail? I thought maybe a bird, questioning myself, considering different options, but i dont think a bird could move at that speed. It didnt appear to have a sharp edge.. it appeared blurred, but again with the color and the speed and with the night sky, thats would be hard to detect. I mentioned a luminence, only reason i say that is because i was able to follow it clearly across the sky, until it got around orions belt where i couldnt see it any more. Shooting star? No, again there was no real light, just a kind of very low almost unnoticable glow? If i wasnt looking to see something, i never would have caught its movement i dont think. It came from corner of my field of vision and shot across. I was kinda in awe when i saw it, as this would be the 4th time i have seen something of this nature in my lifetime.

Then my dad changed his mind and said he didn&apos;t know what the craft was . I was very young at this time so my brother and me was getting scared . As we came up this hill the object came over some trees and we saw that it was a saucer shape . I was terrified . My dad stopped the car in the middle of the street . There were no other cars in sight . The craft slowly flauted over our vehicle and into a yard where it floated over the top of a tiny house . I didn&apos;t know what to do . I was screaming telling my dad to go because I didn&apos;t want to get abducted !!! I thought it was going to blow that little house up !!! So as my dad slowly started to move the craft began to come out over the street . A tiny door towards the bottom of the craft began to open . It was behind us now over the street and I was staring out the back window . As the tiny door on the craft opened I saw a very very bright white light . I screamed louder and my dad I think got scared so he began to speed off and as I watched out the back window I saw the craft float off over some trees . We never saw the object after we searched through the skies again .

It is harvest time and the sun set.  You could see most of the stars.  It was a very calm night i felt no breeze and i could hear everything clearly (type of night).   My father come out to relieve from combining corn me so i can eat.  I get in the pickup and he makes 2 rounds.  On his way back from the second round (he is heading north), I get out of the pickup and took a big breath of air.  I like warm calm nights makes me feel alive so to say.  I turn to look north towards our place (1 mile north) cause i wanted to look at the big dipper.  All of the sudden I see a bright light in the sky to the north east,  If you would take a welding arch white type of light that is how white it was just not as intense, though it stood out like a sore thumb (if you held your thumb out in front of you and put it over the light would be about the size of object, If you are into math you can use info later here to estimate size).  I thought nothing of it and looked at where my father was with the combine and he was heading down the hill not quite half way in the field.  I looked back wondering if i could hear any engines thinking it was a helo or a plane.  Heard absolutly nothing except the faint sound of the combine.  It would have been between 5-7 miles away and about 2 miles or 3 miles ubove the ground. I looked back at the light and noticed it was moving erratically.  Now by erratically i mean it moved up and down in the sky really fast but in very short bursts (not far up or down but very fast).  It also did not stop but did move forward fast then slow down in short bursts (not far forward and would slow down).  I had to turn away and blink to actually see what i have been seeing. While watching the movement I was also thinking it either was unmaned or had inertial dampeners.  With how fast it was moving in the short burts no human could stand the movements for a long period of time. All the movement was done on a line so to say (basically draw a straight line and it would move up and down on it and then move forward fast and slow down on it.  When it moved up and down on it it would move the same distance up and down on it). It would move up and down and then move forward on that line and move up and down again. Sometimed it would move forward once slow down and forward again and slow down again, then move up and down 2 times in a row.   It was heading south west.  Needless to say i had seen that object move to the south west and i had watched it for about 3-5 minutes till I could still barely see it and i quickly crawled up the ladder to the combine asked my dad if he could see it in the distance when he got to the end and he couldn&apos;t see it (very bad eye sight).  He thought i was nuts and made it up. Day 2  2 days later.We were done early with the field we were harvesting and we took the rest of the night off.  I got the little 22 rifle and a spot light and went rabbit hunting.  It was an identical night to the first night calm, no wind 70 degrees out or so.  Anyway I had gone out back and got just to the north end of our trees (100 yards of trees) and seen the exact same thing only 1 mile closer.  Moving the exact same way exactly same movements.  I got chills down the spine.  First thing i did is listened for an engine.  Heard nothing.  Looking for anything i could use to identify it.  Saw nothing.  Then i thought to myself shine the spot light on it (1 million candle light power).  I shined it on it for a second as i was looking NW now (the closest I would be to it).  It stopped moving erratically and started moving in a straight line on that line i was telling you about before at a constant speed.  I then shined it on it again and got scared out of my mind.  A flashing light turned on underneath the object (in my mind to fool me or someont to think it was a plane).  I went running back in the house and told my dad and again he thought i made it up.  I use to go hunting all the time and sit for hours patiently waiting for a skunk or something snooping around.  Never went out again after that.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I dont know how long its been there or if it has just gotten there.  But it happened so quickly.  I was facing north at the time. At first, I thought that it was a helicopter but it stood still in place for about a few second. There was also no sound either. I was really distracted with my phone and my cigarette but when i looked up again. It quickly shoots down. And my first thought was, &quot;Oh, Wow that is beautiful&quot;.  I thought it was a shooting star of some sort. But then it gradually slowed down...and went up again kind of like a zig-zag and then it just disapeared.

He said to go outside and see if we could see it, so my brother and I went out on the back patio facing southwest towards Ellenville and we could see it, so we yelled out to my mom who was still on the phone and she told my dad we could see it (and he was still watching it from 12 miles away). My mom quickly came outside and saw it too, but there were some trees blocking the view, so we ran to a large field behind our property to get a better view.Mettacahonts is elevated about 200 feet on the edge of the Catskill mountains with a view of about 50 miles of the Shawangunk ridge from south of Ellenville to north of Rosendale, and Rt. 209 runs parallel to the ridge following the Rondout creek.  We could see that the object was very large and had several white lights all around it.  There was no headlight like a plane or helicopter, and there was no red or blue light like some aircraft, and no flashing lights.  More importantly, there was absolutely no sound.  It was a dark night and calm, but with good visibility.  At that time there was only one light visible at night, from the Granite hotel in Kerhonkson, about 6 miles away.  The object seemed very low in the sky (below the top of the Shawangunk ridge) so it had to be lower than 1000 feet.  It also moved very, very slow.  It passed approximately over the Granite hotel and then took several minutes before it passed north of Mettacahonts road, so it&apos;s approximate speed was about 100 to 150 miles per hour.  We then watched as it went out of view somewhere towards Rosendale about 5 minutes later.We felt calm and it didn&apos;t seem scared at any time during the event.  Few words were said, partially because we were straining our ears to try to hear the object.  Normally, it was possible to hear cars travelling on Rt. 209 about 2 miles away.  But this night, there was no sound at all, so we definitely would have heard airplanes or helicopters if they came within 2 or 3 miles of our house as this object did.  Some news reports at the time indicated that it was only small aircraft flying in formation but there was no sound and the object maintained a steady speed and altitude over about a 10 or 15 minute time frame, so it could not be explained as several small aircraft gliding in formation.About 45 minutes or an hour later my dad returned home (normally a 20 minute drive).  His mom did not want to talk about the event, but he told us that at one point she got very scared and asked him to get them out of the area as they followed the giant object towards a large field near the Eastern Correctional Facility in Napanoch.  At that point the object passed directly overhead and he said he could hear a faint &quot;wooshing&quot; sound.  Then, as he tried to follow the object north on Rt. 209, he lost sight because the road had become completely clogged with cars.  Normally there was very little traffic at night on this rural road, but hundreds of cars had pulled onto the shoulder so they could get out and look.  But, after a while, the shoulders got full of cars and people began stopping their cars right in the highway.  It took nearly a half hour for the traffic to clear out after the object went out of sight.  Apparently the traffic jam was part of the reason it was so quiet that night.The newspaper ran a few small stories both proving and disproving the theory of light aircraft flying in tight formation.  The television news had the story that same night. Sightings were reported to the station from towns all along the Rondout valley and Rt. 209 all the way to Kingston, 20 miles to the north of our home. An episode of the television show Unsolved Mysteries had a similar story out of Poughkeepsie, NY that occurred around the same time, so it may be possible that this was the same object we saw (Poughkeepsie is about 40 miles south of our home).Nobody in my family was drinking or using any drugs at the time of the sighting.  My dad was a manager in a factory, my mom was a secretary, my grandmother was an active 75 year old with a sharp mind who lived by herself until she was 92, my brother was a popular kid in school who liked sports, and I was a high-honor roll student in high school.  There were also many sheriffs and state troopers who had to see the object as they tried to clear the traffic jam.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I worked at Runway Support and was out on the flight line with my binoculars and flare gun for a 4 hour shift at midnight.  It was approx. 2 am when I saw what I thought was an aircraft coming in over the mountain top.  I had a radio that I then called the air tower with and no aircraft was coming in.  I told the tower what direction I was looking in and that was the last correspondence I had with him.  The craft was stationary and darted to the right very quickly and then dropped down to the bay and vanished.  I never saw it fly away in any direction.  It went right above the water.  I never saw any lights until I no longer saw the aircraft.  When it was out of sight I could see a brightness coming from the bay lighting the end of the runway.  I drove to the end of the runway and looked into the bay as the light started to dim and disappear.I talked to my commander the following day about what I saw and he said that they test all kind of things here but he usually has knowledge of the opporation before it takes place and he had not been notified.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

There was a naval air station very close to town, so we were accustomed to see various aircraft flying over the town. On this particular night the sun had set and the last few rays were a purple-orange color high in the clouds.  As we remarked on the nice evening, I caught a glimpse of an orange glimmer off the window of an aircraft. At first I thought it was the sun reflecting off a normal aircraft. It was no ordinary aircraft and we stopped in the first available parking lot to observe more closely. To our wonderment, this saucer-shaped craft was performing maneuvers above us!  At first, it simply hovered about the height that a small aircraft would fly - maybe 1000-2000 feet up. It made no engine noise. There was a row of what appeared to be windows completely encircling the center edge (as if two plates were placed together with the inner sides facing each other). These &quot;windows had vertical supports evenly spaced aroung the craft, like plate glass windows. They glowed a deep orange from inside the craft.The last rays of the sun glinted off the edge of the craft. The body was a dark metallic color, darker than a commercial aircraft. It began to move for a total of three maneuvers. First, it tilted at about 30-40 degrees and hovered. Suddenly it shot away so quickly we thought it was gone, only to find that it had moved across the sky at that same angle. It remained at the angle and then began to angle itself in a different direction. This time it moved in short quick motions, reangling itself toward another portion of the sky. It took off and we again found it by following the line formed by the angle from the leading edge. This was all very startling and my hair stood on end. We began to feel that we were truly watching a spacecraft. Within a few seconds more this craft just shot out into the sky and was gone in an instant. I have never discussed this with anyone other that close friends and family. We did, however, call the naval air station to report what we had seen.  Every time I hear of something like this I get chill bumps remembering the night we saw this incredible sight.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident in 1971 is approximate.

I would also estimate it&apos;s size to be about the same as a small plane. OTHER INFO: I&apos;m pretty sure that this was the same object I had seen in this sky before. I was eating at a fast food place on the same street about a block away. I was able to monitor the object with my naked eyes for the duration of it&apos;s visibility. also in that sighting, it traveled slowly, stopped, changed direction then dissapeared.

It was about 3:00 pm in late afternoon when I was going to drive up to a favourite fresh water spring that is about 6 miles NorthWest from the small coastal community of Musquodoboit Harbour which is situate about 35 miles east of Halifax, Nova Scotia.Not too far away is a major International Airport, known as Halifax International Airport and it would be approximately 12 to 15 miles from where I saw this craft, and it is important to note that I did see other aircraft in the air on this afternoon, which were visible as they broke through the clouds on either landing or takeoff from the airport. The date was on or about October 24, 1997 and as I was about 5 miles northwest of the community of Musquodoboit Harbour, something caught my attention on the North Side of the Highway low in altitude and I would estimate it to be about 200 to 300 ft in the air, although, it very well could have been higher as it is hard to reference size without having two known points to triangulate.  What astonished me is the shape of this craft, it was like two long partly clyndrical, partly square like cylinders with a large round midsection joining the two cylynders, almost like the letter H.  It was metallic with dark colours (possibly shadows away from the sunlight, and the clouds were scattered in otherwise a partly sunny-partly cloudy day.  This craft was very slow moving and moving in a easterly direction and slowly dissappeared beyond the trees that I could see.  There seemed to be some kind of ribbon like things hanging down from this craft, for approximately 30ft +/- near the midsection of this craft.  The actual length again is hard to judge based on what distance the ship was from me.  I would estimate this craft to be about 200 ft in length and the mid section joining the two fuselages to be approximately 50 ft or about one quarter the length of the cylydrical-partially square shapped fuselage.  There was NO SOUND being emitted from this craft and it was just drifting slowly.  I do not know if others may have seen this or not, but I do know there were a rash of reports of people seeing strange objects in the sky along the entire eastern shore that particular month, but what differs in what I saw, it was daytime. I have a background in Land Surveying and often used takl trees, towers, etc, as reference points to triangulate approximate distances or directions, but on that day, I had no theodilite and no way to measure, so my dimensions at best are pure estimation.  This craft was flying in the opposite direction of what an airplane would be flying on approach to the airport. I told immediate family members, but no-one else at the time, as I feared being made fun of and have nothing to collaborate my story, except my very vivid memory of this incident that lasted for approximately 45 seconds +/-.  I tried to make sense of what this was, perhaps a large airplane flying low with some type of mirage or reflection off a low cloud, but it was flying far too slow to even keep an aircraft airborne.  I cannot recall if this craft actually flew out of sight at the treeline, or just vanished as quick as it appeared, but it was moving in an easterly direction. I have attempted to draw what it looks like, and have superimposed it on a tree with clouds in the background to give others perspective of what I have seen.  Is it from another world?  Is it a manmade aircraft being experimented with?

The sun was about 5 to 10 degrees obove the horizon, as viewed from Aurora in late afternoon. A very bright rainbow type light illuminated a short &quot;hanging curtain&quot; cloud to the left of the soon to be setting sun. The light was a brilliant aqua green that shifted to yellow then a pale orange as if you were looking at a short section of a rainbow. I am sure this was a form of sundog, however I noted that the flat luminous cloud reflecting the sun, sort of like a shimmering curtain of a cloud  was totally unlike the other clouds in the sky, which were mostly small round puffs covering most, but not all of the sky. It was only after I had watched the sundog, and it was starting to weaken, that I noted the short curtain cloud causing this effect was directly under what I would call a dark, cigarette shaped cloud from which the curtain cloud descended.  I would not call the dark cloud a cigar shape, but more of a thin, long cigarette.  There were no similar cloud formations in the sky. But there were other apparently higher clouds farther west and thus that might account for the cigarette cloud being darker, as it was in the shadow of other clouds between it and the sun. But again, the sun dog seemed limited to just his halo or hanging curtain of mousture. It might have been verdigri extending down from this long, thin cloud, but normally that is in very long strings whereas this was shorter and more compact.  But the cloud causing the sundog was like a mist cloud, perhaps an effect of the angle of the sunlight. I am fairly certain this was a form of sundog, with the cloud particles in just the right spot to bend and refract the sunlight in my direction.
