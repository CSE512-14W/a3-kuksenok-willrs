I then saw an airplane traveling at normal speeds comming from the east. They were very close in paths and it looked like they could possibly collide. I could see the airplane ascend as if to get more air space. The UFO went straight, it did not ascend or descend. The plane went over the object. The object then stopped and hovered for about 5 to 7 seconds. It then seemed to trail the plane but could not keep up. The plane was no longer in my sight.

The smoke had almost all faded away when this object apeared out of nowhere above our house. It looked close enough you could have thrown a rock up at it and hit it. I assume we were looking up at the bottom of it, it was round and glowing like a full moon, the color was sort of a white or gray, it looked metalic.

I was doing 65 in a 70 mph, and a line of cars was trying to pass me on a small rise, but the lead car in the passing lane was unable to overtake me (it was an older late 60&apos;s rambler) so there were three cars behind the rambler pushing it down the road trying to get passed us. As we are driving neck and neck, with the couple seemingly unable to pass me, off to the left in a field, about 60 yards beyond the fenceline, three shiny diamond shape lights doing erratic swirling motions were visible to me. I notice that the elderly couple next to me is also watching the lights. This caused a noticeable reaction in all four cars as our spped was momentarily reduced to see what was causing it, and then the speed was stepped back up. The passenger was an elderly woman with horn-rimmed spectacles, and an elderly man who I assumed was her husband was driving. I look back at the road and these 3 diamond-shaped lights are now at about 10 o&apos;clock towards the east as we are driving south. The lights would move from a triangular formation, break away and do some fast manuevers, and then regroup. This went on for a few minutes. The next manuever placed them fifty feet off to the left of the roadside, where they regrouped and instead of the diamonds revovling as they had done previously while in formation, they now deliberately and simultaneously reflected our headlights back at us, nearly blinding us. I look to my left, and the elderly couple looks back at me as if pleading me to let them over, but I continue to hold the gas pedal to the floor and maintain my speed. I loo at the cars behind them and I can see that their interiors are lit up so brightly I can make out the drivers blue shirt and red tie in the car behind the elderly couple in the rambler. I turn back and look at the three lights and say to myself, &quot;who are you?&quot; I then had the prescience to think they may be reading mymind, so I beg! an to chant &quot;No, NO, NO!&quot; The elderly couple was obviously scared and wanted over, but I continued forward at the same rate of speed. The lights grew so bright that I was blinded and could no longer see the road at all. This lasted five to ten seconds, after which the lights disappeared, the cars behind me roared by, and I found myself alone, still driving on the highway. I pulled over at the very next exit, maintaining my gaze on the three diamond shaped lights as they sped up into the sky in a rotating circle around each other until they blended into the night sky. At this point I awoke my then girlfriend and asked her if she could see the three lights spinning like a top up in the starfield. She very annoyedly said, &quot;that&apos;s a helicopter, stupid!&quot; and just as she said that it streaked across the entire visible mountain range to the horizon as fast as I could wave my arm. I said to her, &quot;OK, so was THAT a helicopter?&apos; She started yelling at me for waking her up, etc.. I told her to go ahead and go back to sleep, that I just needed her reassurance that I was not seeing things. We made it back home to Tucson, AZ. I tried to tell a few people about it, but they became very uncomfortable, and I quit telling the story. I have since travelled back through the area, and although it has been some time, I still can remember it all like it was yesterday. The most eery feeling I got upon revisiting it was I began to wonder what happened to the elderly couple who was unable to overtake my VW that night, and why they had suddenly left my field of vision so suddenly. I began to have the suspicion that they may have been abducted, because there was no physical way they could have pulled away like that with the pack of cars, otherwise they would have done just that, only much sooner, considering their obvious fright. I know the other cars in the passing lane trying to pass me witnessed the entire event. Like I said, I could see what they were wearing, as there cars interiors were also illuminated from the back reflecti! on of our headlights being shined back at us.It was the summer that 4th of July came out and the people I told this story to thought I was acting out a fantasy from the movie, but I hadn&apos;t even seen the movie.I also did not believe in UFO&apos;s before that experience.", "Shape -changing brown &quot;tarp&quot;I&apos;ve finally decided to send this in after hearing of two other similar UFO descriptions in the last month on Unknowncountry.com.

The one I saw, I at first thought to be a orangish brown tarp or plastic sheet or trash bag that had been blown up into the wind and was just blowing along while slowing undulating or changing shape as though made of a very light material.  And it very steadily traveled in its general direction, from north to south over the Isthmus/Willy St. area. (Unfortunately I did not think to check if it was actually going with the prevailing wind - though I do remember there being only a light wind that day.) It did not radically change shapes or take on any definite common shapes, but just stayed generally oblong (like the &quot;parachute&quot; story). The sky was clear and it was a around sunset so the object was fairly well lit.  However I had hard time focusing on it.  Sound-wise I heard nothing from it and the neighborhood was quiet.  It was about the size of my fingernail at arms length.  Moved right to left about a fist width every second or two.  I watched it for about ten seconds then it became obscured behind tree branches so I walked down the block about 40 ft to a clear view.

It was a off white colored boomerang shaped object passing slowly, directly overhead at about 200 to 300 feet. The color seemed more of a emission of light rather than the color of the object. It was having an effect on the air in front of it as it moved, creating a wake which was visible. Directly behind it was either high heat emissions or it had the capability to mask itself as being transparent, (which is how it seemed to me), because the sky behind it was translucent, except for the leading edge, (thus the boomerang shape).  There was no change in the air around me as far as static charge and no sound. The object continued on ESE at the same rate of speed until I could no longer view it.

The object was a luminous white with the lights as described above and continued to hover...occasionally it would weave slightly to the left or right, but basically returned to the same position above our neighbors house.My husband kept saying that maybe it could be a Christmas ornament that someone strung up above the house, but I said that no one in their right mind would have climbed up that high to string up an ornament that big AFTER Christmas was over.By 10pm, the object was still hovering there, so I went inside and called my best friend up on the phone(who lived at the end of our street)and she came up to our house to be my &quot;witness&quot; and saw the object with us. We all stayed outside in the cold staring at this thing until 11pm.It made absolutely no sound at all. By this time my kids were petrified and so was I. We went into the house and I proceeded to call the Yarmouth Police to ask them if they had gotten any calls about this thing. The answering officer started laughing at me when I described it and said that he had a phone number he was supposed to give out to anyone who called with a &quot;sighting&quot;. I was so humiliated by his laughing that I just hung up.I do, however, remember being the most scared I have ever been in my life. I went around the house locking all the windows and doors and my husband was laughing at me saying that if &quot;they&quot; (meaning whatever was inside this thing) really wanted to get into our house, locked doors and windows weren&apos;t going to stop them. My 9 year old son was so afraid that he had to sleep with us that night.The last time I dared to look out was 11:30pm, and this thing was still in the sky above our neighbor&apos;s house. I and my son (now 26) will never forget this experience.((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witnesses observed, but it is unusual for a genuine UFO to hover in the same spot for two hours.  Moreover, such an event almost certainly would have caused a &quot;pulse&quot; of sightings and activity, which apparently did not occur.  Based on the description of the object, and given that it was a winter sighting, we believe that the first possibility to be ruled out in this case would be a &quot;sighting&quot; of the star, &quot;Sirius,&quot; which is VERY prominent, and VERY chromatic, in the sky.  If the witnesses were looking to the east from their home, that is a possibility.  If it was not Sirius, we do not know what they witnessed.

I&apos;ve seen falling stars and meteors; this was definitely a UFO. I remember I saw a documentary once that showed pictures from the atmosphere of spaceships flying around Earth and then what looked like gunfire from Earth towards them, like we were shooting at them.This is exactly what it looked like.

We had stopped at a rest area on the interstate just before sunset. Vega, TX. is the nearest town, according to the Rand McNally Road Atlas.It was sunset (approx. 20:30 hrs) and the sky was orange in front of us (westbound). and stars were already visible to the east and most of the sky.Our vehichle was a 3/4 ton Ford Ranger pickup truck, with a medium-sized camper shell on the back. My dad was in the camper cleaning up a little and changing clothes, as we had planned on finding a restaurant to get a bite to eat.I was outside of the truck, throwing rocks and such as a nine-year-old would do at a rest area in the middle of the Texas panhandle. A pickup truck with a full-sized over-the-cab camper on the back was parked directly behind us.Upon hearing the screaming of children&apos;s voices, I looked toward the camper. I distinctly remember a girl&apos;s and a boy&apos;s voice seperately telling their parents that a flying saucer is across the highway.At this point, instead of looking across the road, I was compelled to look at the big camper behind us in which the screaming kids were in.As I turned to look at the camper of the frightened children, I saw the parents both closing shades and turning off lights in the pickup camper. The mother said very loudly to be quiet.Now that the campers behind us were all quiet and &quot;blacked out&quot;, I felt a heaviness come over me. Fear as I have never known before (or ever want to know again) came over me. I was frozen in place as I looked across the roadway and saw a disc-shaped object with counter-clockwise &quot;flowing&quot; lights rotating about the top of it. It was in a descent that caused it to come to a &quot;floating&quot; landing behind a small range of rocky hills.Not being able to move, I called for my father by saying, &quot;Daddy! Daddy!&quot; I wanted to yell, but was unable to.When he heard me, he looked out of the camper and as I could not move, he noticed me looking across the highway. He then saw what had caused me to be petrified and jumped out of the back of the truck without his shoes on. He grabbed me and put me in the passenger seat of the cab and we drove off in a hurry.The next morning we were at a pancake house in Santa Fe, NM. and we heard several people talking about the incident. Dad and I remained silent and listless.No conversation of this was brought up between us regarding this until just a few years ago. My dad remembers it as clearly and vividly as I do. That is why I needed to share this with the rest of the &quot;Encounter&quot; community...Whether it is indeed not-of-this-world or a secret gov&apos;t aircraft, the fact remains that my father and my lives have been changed forever in a way that really cannot be explained.

As I drove south on highway 287, between Berthoud and Longmont, Colorado, I noticed a craft quite a distance ahead in the sky. It caught my eye because of its brilliance. Initially I thought it must be the sun reflecting off an airplne. However, though craft moved across the sky; unlike sun reflecting on an airplane, the nature of the brilliant light did not change. It then briefly appeared to glow even brighter and expand to a larger sphere and just disappeared. It never appeared in the sky (the entire sky before me)again.

At just about the half way point of the flight (approx. 18:45 local time) I noticed a bright object above the horizon.  Thinking it was just a planet, I didn&apos;t give it a second glance.  About 10 minutes after I had first noticed the object, I saw my captain adjusting our TCAS (traffic collision avoidance system) to the farthest setting of 80 miles.  I then looked out at the object and it was now below the horizon.  I asked the captain if he was trying to see if the object was an aircraft using our TCAS.  He said yes.  The object which appeared to be approximately 20-40 miles in front of us was now changing colors from it&apos;s original white, to red and green.  At first we thought it was just another aircraft with it&apos;s anti-collision lights on until the color changes.  I was handling the radios and decided to ask air traffic control if we had any aircraft in front of us at a range of 20-40 miles.  His reply was that we didn&apos;t have any traffic within 80 miles of our position.  He asked me to describe the object, which I did, and then he proceeded to contact another aircraft that was at our 9 o&apos;clock position and 80 miles from us, to see if they saw the object that I described.  They (the other aircraft) responded that they saw the same thing.  We never gained any ground on the object and as we started our decent to Memphis, the object in front of us did the same.

I bought a new Cannon ES8600, 8mm camcorder on 1.31.04 and recorded about 30 minutes of these &quot;unidentified flying objects&quot;, Sunday morning between 11:30 am and 12:30pm; just as the sun was coming up. Shooting at the sky and blocking the sun out with the eve of my house and only seeing the rays of the sun,I filmed about 30 minutes of &quot;unidentified flying objects&quot;.It was a clear morning, this past Sunday.

It was about the size of a pea at arms lengh.And lasted til out of the view finder. In this 30 minutes of filming in the front and in the back of my house, up toward the sky and blocking the Sun,there are at least 3-4, maybe more of these in the film. They seem to blend in with the rays of the sun, but if you shoot away from the Sun, you can catch them on film, and they appear to be what I would call it, invisable; but,you can make out their shape and see them go across the sky, make turns and motion in their movements. You see the saucer or disk shapes and as they move, and as the Sun reflects off them. It looks like a white spot going across the sky when, I guess the Sun shines directly on them. Then at the correct angle you can see the saucer shapes. They move in and out of the film and are definatly saucer or disk shaped and in motion.((NUFORC Note:  We receive many reports of &quot;UFO&apos;s near the Sun,&quot; but the phenomenon does not make an ounce of sense to us, and we have never seen credible evidence in support of the the reports.  If the &quot;UFO&apos;s&quot; were in fact in proximity to the Sun from the vantage point of one witness, from another vantage point, they would be in an area of the sky farther away from the Sun, and therefore clearly visible in the daytime sky.

I noticed it at about 6:45 and it is still very bright and unmoving in the sky. It surely must be a planet, like Venus, but I am not able to verify that yet.

To better understand the stoty I have to describe the bedroom. It was the entire 2nd floor. About 12&apos;x24&apos; with windows at either end lengthwise, 2 in the main &quot;room&quot; and one at the end withthe stiarcase. My brother and I were staying up late one summer night watching tv, playing video games etc. in our room. I remember that a box fan was running in the lone window near the stairs to cool the room down, so that may account for the humming noise I remember but I&apos;m pretty sure the ufo we saw was humming. Anyway we were up late and fianally going to bed. Our beds we on either side of the double windows. As I was falling asleep I noticed colored lights outside. I got up and looked outside the open windows and saw what I thought was a helicopter hovering about 10 feet above and between our house and the next door neighbors. I woke up my brother and told him to check out this cool helicopter because we were both really into anything that flew. As we watched this thing I realized right away that it was not a chopper because there was no rotor wind and it wasn&apos;t making noise except for the humming (could&apos;ve been the fan). Then I started to get a feel for the size of this thing. It looked as though it was only 10-15 feet above the house but it covered an area at least 30&apos; in diameter maybe more. I also noticed two rings of lights on the craft. The inner circle of lights were a very dim white or yellowish color, and the outer ring had different colors that seemed to shift in sequence. The lights were very dim all over the craft. We watched it for nearly a 1min. before I noticed Chris our neighbor, looking out his window at the ufo. Right then the craft took off. Slowly at first it turned about 180 degrees and then it was gone. I&apos;ve told a few of my friends about this and have been laughed at. I figured that I was nuts. But two Christmas&apos;s ago, my brother brought it up after dinner. I! was in shock! But he remembers it the same.

My wife-to-be (let&rsquo;s call her Jan) and myself were out taking an evening walk by Lincoln High School (on Lincoln Way).  We both sighted a UFO within 150 feet of our position.  These are the details. Environmental conditions: The evening was clear with very few, if any clouds.  The sun had set about 15 minutes previously.  Only the brightest stars were beginning to show.  There was no wind that I can recall; it was very still. The story: Jan and I walked by the high school and noticed that it had a fountain in the center of the group of buildings which were in a &quot;U&quot; shape, open to the street.  We went to the fountain and were looking into it.  I was saying something to Jan and she interrupted me by simultaneously nudging me in the ribs with her elbow and saying &quot;look at this.&quot;  I looked up and saw a large white triangular shape shoot over the roof of the west wing of the building traveling at a slightly upward angle (the ship was travelling southeast, almost parallel to Lincoln Way).  Almost immediately the ship nosed downward at about a 20 degree angle and looked like it was going to dive into the street.  As it passed the corner of the High School&rsquo;s west wing, a very large &quot;spark&quot; shot out of the back and almost immediately dissipated, the way plasma dissipates.  The ship left a light (perhaps even slightly bright) well-defined vaporous trail as it moved through the air which dissipated almost immediately as it came out the back.  At it&rsquo;s lowest point I estimate that the craft was flying about 40 to 50 feet above street.  As the ship continued to move on its path, I could see the back side of it. There was a diamond-shaped opening from where the vapor trail was coming and it was brilliant.  A moment later and the ship dissappeared behind a large tree. With the sky dark enough to see a few stars, I knew that I would be able to see anything bright.  I ran quickly to a place where I could get an unobstructed view of the horizon or at least as unobstructed as I could manage, and I still saw nothing moving in the sky. The ship had vanished.  See diagrams below. Final details.&middot;The &quot;fly-by&quot; of the ship took about 2 to 3 seconds.&middot;The ship was white but not glowing.&middot;It flew in a &quot;wobbley&quot; manner as if it was almost out of control &middot;This craft was TOTALLY silent.&middot;I was vaguely aware of seeing small details on the hull; my impression was that it was like the lines formed by plates fitting together on the fuselage of an aircraft but I could be wrong on that description. I was not focussed on such small details at the time.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))", "i am only 16 but i am into ufo aircraft, so me and a few freiends went out bush to look through the teliscope, we were out for a whilewhen my friend said &quot;hey whats them things floating around, we wre watching them for a while and i managed to get it on the teliscope, this gave us a clear veiw of them, the were like saucers but there were 4 of them, they had a green colour to them, and were hovering around near the ground, about 15-20 metres from the ground, i didnt see any sort of alian lifeforms, although there were trees in the way so we didnt get clear view of the ground just the ski, but i did hear weired and bazzar noises coming from the derection of the saucers, we were watching them for a while for atleast 2 minutes or even more, and when they left there was more than 4 of them mayby about 6-7 of them, so i think that maybe there were some of them on the ground just sitting there on the ground, when they left it would have been an instant and they were out of sight, after they left, we went and looked over were they were, and there was 2 patches on the ground, and some footprints, only faint footprints but you could notice them, there wasnt any bodie around, but we stayed there for a while, just looking at the marks, and were totely amazed by it, we were a bit freaked out but who wouldnt be i say, my friends are older than me one is 20, and the other 22, we all seen it well with the naked eye, and i also got the telescope on them, they looked unreal!", "I listened to Mr Davenport and Art Bell this past saturday, a witness for Mr Davenport related an experience  while attending the hydroplane races on the Columbia River at Richland, Washington, this past summer. The description of the UFO made me sit up straight out of bed and for a brief moment I relived my only UFO encounter. It was 1974 or 1975, can&apos;t remember for sure without doing some research, I was working on a dredging project  on the Snake River, just below Ice Harbor Dam, a few miles northeast of Richland, Washington, five miles from the confluence of the Snake and Columbia Rivers. A large, disc shaped object, black on the bottom and silver grayish on the top, moved slowly across the Snake River, north to south, directly across my field of vision. I was sitting in an operator&apos;s cab about forty feet above the river and watched the object float silently across my field of vision. No noise, no lights, no erratic motion. Sixty to eighty feet long, fifteen feet high, moving at 10 mph, I got on my Motorola Radio and asked all vessels in the area did they see what I just saw, of course everyone that answered made fun of me. It wasn&apos;t a plane, it wasn&apos;t a blimp, it wasn&apos;t a helicopter. The Hanford Nuclear tank farms are about twenty miles south, huge electro transmission towers run down the east side of the river from Ice Harbor Dam. When I heard the UFO&apos;s description on the radio last night a huge weight was lifted from my shoulders, it was the same object I&apos;d seen two and a half decades ago. Thank you very much, I&apos;m not as crazy as I thought I was.", "BRIGHT CLEAR DAY SEVERAL OF US WERE WALKING BEACH AND WE LOOKED OUT TO SEA, AND GOING ALONG OVER THE OCEAN WAS A LARGE RETANGULAR SHAPED OBJECT. IT WAS GOING SLOWLY AND IT WAS APROX 200 FT FROM SHORE LINE AND ABOUT 400 FT HIGH, AND IT CHANGED DIRECTIONS AND STARTED OUT TO SEA.  IT HAD NO DEPTH. WHEN IT WAS ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE OUT IT PAUSED AND THEN WENT STRAIGHT UP UNTIL IT WAS OUT OF SIGHT. A FISHERMAN NEXT TO ME SAID HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT IT WAS AND MY BROTHER IN LAW AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER SAID THE SAME THING. I ASKED IF ANY KITES WERE IN AREA AND MAN WHO FLIES KITES SAID HE WAS NOT FLYING ANY THAT DAY. RED AND GREEN LIGHT ON LEFT SIDE.", "Two oval shaped, firefly-like, yellow glowing craft, flew overhead at great speeds with erratic movement.Myself and three friends observed a mostly stationary light over the bay from a second floor apartment window.  The light seemed to stay basically in one spot over the bay, but moved slightly, enought to interest us in just why it seemed to not be approaching or moving away, up, down, left or right.  This light appeared to be at least 3/4 of a mile away.  My close friend (age 24) and myself (age 19) decided to investigate from a closer vantage point.  Leaving our other two friends in the apartment, we walked across the street, and over toward the bay, about four city blocks, into a semi-industrial area of downtown Olympia.  This happened on a Friday night, plenty of teenagers cruising the strip in cars and trucks, and at 9:00pm, when most people would still be awake.  These two factors seemed strange to my friend and I later.  Anyway, keeping our eyes on the original light over the bay, we walked into a part of town which has since been made into a new public transit station.  The area was not well lit, but we could still see the main one-way street, the basic downtown area, as well as the apartment from which we had just walked.  We stopped walking toward the bay and watched the light as it began to approach our area, seeming to come straight toward us.  It soon became apparent that it was two lights, both white, blinking lights.  We made a couple humorous and skeptical verbal observations in an attempt to make each other nervous, or poke fun at ourselves, I suppose, for investigating what seemed to be a small airplane.  The lights came directly overhead, and it did in fact appear to be the lights on the end of a small airplane&apos;s wings, blinking in unison.  Although we could not make out the shape of the assumed airplane, the speed at which it (the lights) was moving seemed that of an average small plane.  When the airplane was just passing directly over our heads, two craft appeared above, behind (going the same direction but not quite caught up to it yet), and slightly north of it.  These objects were identical in size, shape, and color.  They appeared seemingly out of nowhere.  They moved at an astonishing rate of speed compared to the airplane.  They moved in the same basic direction of the plane, but in a manner that neither of us had ever seen before.  They seemed to &quot;wiggle&quot; almost, like watching a coin fall down through water, erratic, almost like the atmosphere around them was being manipulated, quite literally looking like stones skipped on the surface of water, like the air they moved through was bumpy, yet they negotiated it so quickly and with such fluid motion (which I know sounds contradictory to &quot;bumpy&quot; or &quot;wiggling&quot; movement).  They were basically side by side, but appeared to move independently of each other.  God, I haven&apos;t had to recall this in such detail since the few days following the event, telling it to my mother.  My body feels nervous again.  Anyway, the two objects shot past the airplane and out of sight to the east quite suddenly.  The total time we viewed the objects was 8 to 10 seconds, which seemed like plenty to us.  As far as appearance goes, like I said, they were identical.  They were oval shaped; that&apos;s the easy part of the physical description.  The part I find hard to describe is the color and, well, how they seemed to glow.  Yellow.  Color is simple I suppose.  But it wasn&apos;t just yellow, they seemed &quot;alive&quot;, I guess, like a firefly, and even in the short time we viewed them, we could see that they glowed not like a traditional light bulb, not like a filament (sp?) inside or like flourescent (sp?) bulbs, but the WHOLE craft glowed that yellow, and not at a constant brightness.  They seemed to &quot;warm&quot; or something, I don&apos;t know.  Like a firefly, that yellow glow seemed to be produced from inside in an almost organic looking way.  I have since become interested in UFO research and have always looked for photographs or descriptions that match the objects me and my friend saw that night.  I have seen somewhat similar looking pictures, but I don&apos;t reca! ll seeing video footage of the exact movement and glowing qualities we saw.  Anyway, the two of us were skeptics before this incident, and I suppose I still am.  My friend has since moved to NYC and I haven&apos;t spoken to him for a few years.  Last time I saw him, in 2000, after our &quot;how&apos;ve you been&quot;s and &quot;nice to see ya&quot;s were out of the way, the conversation went straight for our experience back in 1994.  Neither of us have had a sighting like that one since, and I remain a skeptic, but in the year following our experience, I did see two yellow objects skipping through the sky at night again, and again, DOWNTOWN Olympia, which isn&apos;t a huge metropolis or anything, but there are plenty of people walking around.  I began to assume that people must just not look up or something.  I began to worry that I was MEANT to see these things, among a few other quickly passing thoughts that made me feel insane for a minute.  I phoned the local AM radio station, which is located right on the bay mentioned (we would have walked right to the station had we kept going in the direction we were walking when we went to get a closer look at the original light we saw) the next morning.  I asked whoever answered the phone if they had received any calls mentioning anything &quot;odd&quot; or having anything to do with seeing anything &quot;abnormal&quot; in the sky above the bay, and asked if anyone at the station had seen anything or heard about any strange things in the sky above their station.  I tried to avoid the word &quot;UFO&quot; as I always assume that most average Americans won&apos;t take me seriously.  Nothing.  They said they hadn&apos;t heard of or seen anything, hadn&apos;t had a single phone call about anything at all.  The guy&apos;s voice seemed skeptical; I suppose he thought I was pranking him or something.  This is the first time I have officially reported or claimed this event in any way.  I have told a select handfull of friends over the past nine years, as well as my mother.  I told my mother first, because she knows I don&apos;t lie to her, and I was such a ! wreck for a few days following the incident, I NEEDED to tell someone that I knew would believe me.  I felt crazy and my mind wandered into such new and frightening territory.  That night altered not only my skeptical and analytical mind, but also my perception of REALITY, PERMANENTLY.  I have never been the same since.  I look up with a different appreciation, not only for the sky, but for my place on this planet, my species, and I think most of all, I wonder about all the other possibilities, facts, and realities that our government knows of and won&apos;t tell us about.  If those things I saw were not of this world, then I imagine that our government knows they are there at the least.  If they ARE of this world, then I imagine that our government has technology quite beyond things I&apos;ve seen in movies, and that frightens me a bit more than the prospect of being &quot;secretly&quot; observed by another species.  Overall, I would mostly like to state that this has not been a positive experience for me.  My dreams following this event were not pleasant and restfull ones.  My thoughts are filled with frightening images and questions.  A general feeling of anxiety and uneasiness takes over my mind and body at times.  As I get older, I wish so much that I could be filled with the excitement and wonder and curiosity I&apos;ve read about others feeling when they speak of their own experiences.  I was traumatized by this event.  I shook until the next morning.  While I am interested intensely in this area, I AM quite troubled by the mystery of it all.  I DO want to KNOW.  I used to scoff at this crap.  I don&apos;t even know who you people are or why I&apos;m telling you all this.  Maybe I felt some hope when I heard you on Coast to Coast the other night.  I heard you say something about reporting sightings and then &quot;easy to remember web address, UFO center dot com.  All you have to remember is UFO Center.&quot;  Well, I wrote it down.  Here is my hope:  If there is any chance of me making contact with anyone else that might have seen what I saw! that night, I would like to talk to them or write e-mails or ANYTHING.  I have lost contact with the friend that I saw these things with and haven&apos;t talked to him for about three years.  I feel very alone when it comes to this subject in my life.  If feels pointless and silly to try to talk to even my fiance about it because she is such a skeptic herself that even though she knows (I think) that I&apos;m telling her the truth, she can&apos;t really FEEL it.  I don&apos;t know why I&apos;ve rambled so long.  This is my first attempt at contacting others like me if they&apos;re even out there.  Thanks, I think, if you are who I hope you are.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Flashes of lightI didn&apos;t actually see it, my husband and his brother did.

I turned on to a side road we used for a shortcut home. As I slowed more to keep an eye on the object, it seemed to grow in size. I stopped the car but did not get out. We kept watching as it grew bigger and bigger. It finally split into two distinct balls of bright orange fiery lights about 1000 feet above and ahead of us. It made no noise as it glided directly over the roof of our car. However, the car and ground shook as it passed and there was a slight rumbling as it passed.

What looked like a large ball of fire (10x the size of largest nearby star), pulsating from red to orange, danced like a firefly 34-40 degrees above the NE horizon for 2-3 minutes.  Then the object stopped flashing red-orange, turned solid reddish-orange and remained somewhat stationary for another maybe 2 minutes, during which time much smaller (small-star-sized) red-orange object(s) appeared from within and below the large fiery object and proceeded to approach the horizon, forming a completely vertical dotted line of small fiery lights extending from the larger object.  As the line of smaller lights proceeded towards the horizon, the distance between the smaller fiery lights and the larger original object grew greater until the smaller objects were within a couple of degrees from the horizon and then disappeared one by one.  The large fireball remained stationary for about another minute after the smaller ones disappeared, then it began flashing red-orange and started dancing again, still in the same location.  Then the light dimmed and the object danced off to the north, remaining 35-40 degrees above the horizon.  It traveled in this manner for 45 seconds or so, through a distance of air space that usually takes a satellite 3-4 times longer to pass through, and then it just disappeared.", "Three lights, perfectly spaced apart, moving irratically through the trees and then disappearing.My wife viewed 3 unusual lights, through a window at our home.

Oddly, when I got to the front porch, the lights were now horizontal, heading back across the center of the mountain well above a neighbors house. They appeared to be going through the trees. {The lights were always spaced about 30 ft. apart throughout the sighting}. I witnessed these lights for about 5 seconds and then they went out instantly.

I found one sattelite following it&apos;s normal West to East path, when I spotted another much fainter sattelite directly above it heading in the opposite direction. Only much much faster and farther out. I followed it for a moment, and then noticed it split into two. I shook my head and refocused the lense, and saw it again, still two. Now following parallel to each other at a speed I have never seen a satelite fly. Then it did something strange, it would come back into one, then split out into two, heading about a 45 degree angle away from each other, then come back to parallel each other. But sometimes they would jump backwards, as if my vision jumped. Only, they did it a few times. I would keep my eyes off center, and keep a major star in focus and steady to jude the movement of the objects. They were definately jerkish and would shoot out fast then come back a little then join together and head out. I followed them until out of sight, about 3 minutes in all. They made the other sattelite seem slow like an airplane, but I have been watching sattelites long enough to know the difference. Plus I fly. This thing was in my estimation about twice the distance of the sattelite I was watching, very faint, but clear enough to see it&apos;s movements. This was no sattelite. Moving at 90 degree angles, 45 degree angles in a split second. It was quite amazing. I truely hope some day, I see them again. It was remarkable.

The sky was crystal clear  which made it wierd, starry and a 2/3 waxing moon was up. It was about 8pm. We got on the Northway heading south at Exit 30 and a minute or 2 down the road I was the first to notice a well lighted Object hanging about 500 feet off ther ground and just east of the road. At first I thought it was a helicopter and mentioned this to my secretary, and we both said no. Then it suddenly dawned on the both of us that it was a UFO. It was so close that we see could see its complete outline and details of its structure. Its perimeter was outlined with red lights, One bright red at each 90 degrees with two smaller red lights in between. There was a huge flood light at its bottom center pointing to the ground. And the top turret system had multiple lights aimed in many directions. It was approximately 50 to 60 yards in diameter. It was dead silent. It slowly floated just barely of center as it hung, something like a gyroscope gently wabbles as it spins ever so slightly. The moon was at just the right angle to illuminate its upper surface. The finish was flat or buff, metallic grey, and there were no markings on the hull or fusilage. We had had trouble with our car earlier, so I didn&apos;t stop, but we did pull over to the shoulder and slow down to a crawl while we observed it.

My ownb personal theory is that there may be a landing port somewhere in the depths of the Adirondacks for one large reason- Ther are some heavy iron deposits in the Adirondacks that will even throw off a compass. What a great area under which to conceal a UFO landing port! That&apos;s it. That&apos;s my story.

He radioed officers Greg Hedrick and Randy Hoover, who saw it too. Olinger says it wasn&apos;t like a 1950&apos;s type flying saucer. He says it was big, but didn&apos;t have a hump in the middle. The three policemen say the object drifted toward a church steeple, then shot away without a sound.

It looked like my other car which my wife drives. Same make, color and year. The opening came and I started to turn but decided to look at the Licence plate. It was my Licence plate!  In the two seconds I spent there making the turn and trying to slow down to take a look at the driver (cars honking behind me) I thought someone had stollen my car. I looked at the driver and I was startled. He saw me looking and he was startled. It was me in my other car! Wearing the same coat, hat and sunglasses as I was!  I was forced to complete the turn but franticly tried to make a right in the first driveway. Keeping my other self in view in the rearview mirror. I saw him/me halfway turned into the street.

I dashed back onto the street but did not see him to the left. Looked to the right and no cars were in sight. So I figured he must have straightened out the car and not turned but went straight ahead. So I went back in that direction driving extremly fast for two intersections and could not find him. I pulled over at a payphone and called my wife asking her where she parked the car. She told me she left it at the subway station as she takes the train downtown to work.

I clearly saw it move toward me and came within @ 100ft of my truck. I was shocked by the Size and Depth of this Formation. I have studied ufo&apos;s over the years and never seen anything remotely close to what this appeared as. The Size is what is Especially interesting. Having lived in a Farming area I&apos;m clear on distances. Even though this was at Night and it was Dark I know exactly where I was. The object was @ 50ft&gt; high and 1/4 mile long. There was an Airplane Hanger at the location and the Glow of  Light overcame the Hanger so it was not visible. The Hanger was @300 ft. from the road.  This Energy Wave followed me about I mile before disappearing. I remember being very scared as the size was Amazing. I was alone and very aware of the situation.

We were in midtown, around 54th Street and traffic was very heavy so we were basically crawling along. I was driving. So we spot this &apos;plane&apos; flying east to west and then appearing to hover and just acting in a way we&apos;d never seen a plane act before. My partner was in the military service and he&apos;s familiar with planes but he was just as dumbfounded as i was at the way it was acting. So as we were driving south on 9th Avenue, we are keeping our eyes on this &apos;plane&apos; and suddenly it started to fly straight in our direction. We said &apos;Great, now we can see what kind of plane this is&apos;...it must have moved really fast because suddenly it just seemed to glide right over us and that was when we saw it wasn&apos;t a plane but this HUGE triangle thing with many, many round lights underneath. The lights were arranged in triangular rows and there were three rows of them in the shape of the craft if you can picture that. They were very bright but did not give off any glare. This was just before sunset. We hung out the window as we were stopped at the light. Next to us was a woman in a jeep and she looked to see what we were staring at wide mouthed and she got a little hysterical, pretty much as dumbfounded as we were.

Great speed, seen from 1/4 mile away.I don&apos;t recall what day, or exactly what year, however it occurred in January. Whatever the year was, it was the year of comet Hyukutaki, and the date of the occurance was the night that the comet was to be most visible, for our area and weather.I was driving home from work that evening, and in casual observance I was looking to see if I could spot the comet; not realizing that the comet was to be seen in the eastern night sky, and I was travelling west on hwy. 60. As I rounded the corner by Crysteel Manufacturing, I saw a luminescent sphere the color of silver, appear from the northern horizon proceeding to the southern horizon and disappering in the distance. At first sight I thought it was the comet, yet in a split second I realized that it was something else. As I wathced; this object flew &quot;nap of the earth&quot;, as it crossed over the expressway it appeared to be 100&apos; above the ground, and was about the size of a quarter in perspective from my distance to it.(1/4 mile). As it continued its flight south, it crossed over a grove of cottonwood, just grazing the tops and silohueting the branches as it passed each succesive grove of trees. The length of time that I observed this was about 6 maybe 7 seconds, and the distance that it travelled from one horizon to the other is about 6+ miles.Naturally I was in disbeleif of what I saw, even though I knew I saw &quot;something&quot;, when about 3 seconds later the second object dropped out of the sky in a very steep angle, as if it had been waiting for the other, and proceeded in the same direction, but with greater speed; the bottom of the second object was at the same tree top height above the ground. This second object was a sphere as well, only of greater magnitude, about football field in diameter. The color of the second sphere was this amazingly emerald green.To this day, I am still amused by the fact that I saw these two objects that were purposefully flying towards some objective, and that they definetly were not some natural phenomenom that were just ambling throught the air!  I also cannot get over how pristine and intense the colors of these objects were; that the colors were not necesarily a surface coloration, but rather a luminuous glow emminating from a reflective metalic surface, like the color you get from anodized metal.((NUFORC Note:  We believe the comet was visible in the spring of 1997.

The whole affair with the fog / haze was about 1/4th of an inch at arms lenght. If it was a meterorite than someone should try to retrive it as it must be relativly large.

My family and I (wife, daughter age 5, son age 2 almost 3) were on our way home from lunch and shopping. We had turned off of I985 onto Spout Springs Road (heading east) and I guess we were around 1.5 to 2 miles from the Interstate when my wife said &quot;what is that?&quot;. It appeared to be several hundred feet up and my first thought was that it was a child&apos;s balloon--one of those reflective foil-like ones but the sun&apos;s reflection from the object was so bright and the objects surface appeared to be so smooth (like finely polished silver) that I got real curious. Also, though it was hard to tell, my wife and I both got the impression that the object was 4 to 6 feet in diameter. We passed the object by and turned around and came back. We actually turned into a side street to get closer and parked. From this vantage point we could clearly see it (not trying to drive and look). The object was moving slowing away from us (like the wind was blowing it though there was no wind at ground level) and it was moving on its axis. This is hard to explain...it would flip and roll sort of like it was tumbling but not consistently in any given direction. From this movement we could make out that the object was an almost flat disc. When it would roll to its thin side it looked black and there was no reflection. When it would roll and reveal its flat side it would appear to be silver and the sun&apos;s reflection was strong. It looked like polished silver in the sun. Also, in the middle of the object was a red color--a circle--my wife said it looked like a big silver button in the sky with a red dot in the middle. This middle dot area did not reflect the sun like the rest of the area around it. Also, I might ad that when looking at the flat side of the object, I mentioned before how it was smooth and silver...but it also looked solid. I mean it did not look like something filled with helium. I understand that in this we could have been mistaken but to us it honestly looked &apos;hard&apos;. That along with the way it was moving on its axis (tumbling) made the object &apos;not fit&apos;--what I am trying to say is that it is unexplainable to my wife and I. We observed it for several minutes as it was moving westward away from us (I am assuming it was West because it was heading back towards the Interstate). I decided to try and drive to another subdivision off of Spout Springs road to see if we could get under it. My wife was looking at it as we were driving away, she turned away and when she turned back, it was gone. &quot;It&apos;s gone&quot; she said. I looked all over the sky and it was just gone. This was the most baffling part to us. Our eyes were off of it only for a few seconds. Another odd thing...When we first saw the object, it appeared to be moving to the north-east. When we were at the place we stopped to watch, it was clearly moving more westward (which from the pace we had stopped was directly away from us). Afterwards, I asked my 5 year old daughter what she thought it was, she said that it was a CD (Compact Disc).  As far as she is concerned that is exactly what it was (a 4 foot wide, floating Compact Disc). As far as witnesses, there was light traffic moving along the road. Also, right across the street from the area we parked was two men walking up and down the side of the road looking looking as if they were looking for something on the road side that had fallen out of their vehicle. Neither of these people seemed to be looking at the object as their attention seemed to be on finding something in the ditch. There may have been trees in the way that obstructed the view for these guys. The area that this happened in is filled with thousands of homes from closely packed subdivisions. Someone else had to have seen it. There is just too many people living in this area for us to have been the only ones. To conclude...I do not buy the aliens from another world bit. However, I can&apos;t account for the object we saw. It appeared to literally defy the law of gravity. If this was a hoax or some strange toy some kid got for Christmas, the joke is really on us.

Suddenly, I saw this bright star and I watched it for a couple of minutes. Then it darted right overhead and within half a minute shot southwards towards the Wicklow Hills. I would say it travelled about 30/40 miles in less than two seconds.&rsquo; &lsquo;I knew people working in the tower at Dublin Airport and I rang them but they didn&rsquo;t have any record of what it was. I have never been able to figure it out to this day.&rsquo; Mystery still surrounds an incident last September when a garda helicopter was called out to investigate an unidentified flying object over Dublin Airport which resembled a paraglider.When asked if that was possible the Irish Paragliding Association stated that &lsquo;no one in their right mind would paraglide around the airport.&rsquo;", "white/blue sphere hovers above boat while fishing for sharks at Hardwrick Bay, Yourk Peninsula, Australiame and a friend were yout fishing for sharks about 100-500m off shore when we noticed a strage object hovering above our boat it was a bright white/blue sphere, there were magnetical affects such as metal hooks floating in the air, after about 10-20 seconds it seemend to just vanish in a flash of light.", "Basball size ball of light moves 6 inches over car and up windshield.Parked near a lake in a park.

The report was of 20+ objects circling one another in a funnel until they disappeared into the atmosphere. Well, again today I was outside on the trampoline with my two sons.

As we watched it, a craft came out of the west heading east and passed over us. It was white and I was able to discern that it had no wings and was sort of half-moon shaped. What struck me was the speed of this object. In the 20 seconds I observed it went from one horizon to the other and out of sight.The airliner wasn&apos;t even over our heads by the time this thing was gone.It made no sound and left no trail. I couldn&apos;t tell how high it was. It was a good distance up, but not as high as the airliner. A couple of minutes later we saw a jet or two fly over. They were going faster than the airliner, but couldn&apos;t hold a candle to the speed the UFO displayed. They were also leaving condensation trails (not chem-trails). Overall the speed, shape, silence, and no trail made this object stick out like a sore thumb to me. Again I was in no position to run inside the house and retrieve my video camera.I think I&apos;ll make a habit of taking it outside with me from now on. P.S.

It seemed bigger than a plane, circular and it changed colour;  white to red then green then backThis was not a plane, but I don&apos;t know what it was.  It was travelling from west to east and it was going very very slowly.  It just took forever to move across the sky.  I observed it for about 15 minutes, I estimate.  It seemed to be bigger than a plane, circular, and either it was rotating or the lights were rotating around it, it was hard to tell.  It changed colour.  It was a blinding white solid, a steady globe.  Then it began to spin, and became brilliantly coloured, red, green, and back to white.  Sometimes a ring of smaller lights flickered and danced all around it but in a type of orbit pattern, not erratic.  When it stopped spinning it went back to a brilliant white colour.  It was very cold that night at least -30 degrees celcius, so it was too risky to set up my telescope, and I was worried that if I went back into the house, I would lose sight of it.  So I just stood there on my front porch watching it.  I know it was not a plane.  I know the way lights behave on a plane and the noise planes make.  It was a quiet night, and this object emitted no noise.  I called my local airport, but no answer.  I called my local police the next day and they said no one had reported anything, and to which I answered, &quot;Well I am&quot;.

It was the proximity of the &quot;lights&quot; that initially caught my eye, as airplanes do not usually fly so close.  -It should also be noted that I work in an area of our small city slightly away from the &quot;main&quot; town, and thusly it is usually relatively dark (except for some scattered facility lighting).  Also, it was a very clear night, except for some very distant (high) clouds, the night was clear and crisp.  Visability was excellent and without fog, etc.  The lights were travelling approx. north-east and, as mentioned, seemed to be brighter white than conventional aircraft---almost on a level par with aircraft landing lights.  Particularly strange to me was the fact that:  (1)  These (2) white lights were travelling one-behind-another (separated by a distance of approx. 4-fingers (held-out at arms-length).  -It struck me as too wide of a space for the lights to be on the same craft and yet too tight of a space for their to be two craft following one another.  (2)  The lights did not blink initially, but were steady and bright white.  (3)  Although I am not definitive about the exact shape of the craft, as it was a clear night and the craft passed almost overhead, I judged the shape to be a cigar or cylinder (without wings!!) by the black &quot;space&quot; that the craft made as it passed over me (i.e. lack of star light in one area).  I definately did not see any wings.  (4)  The lack of sound was unusual, as the craft passed relatively close overhead.  I did hear an almost cyclic &quot;hum&quot; though, but this was very low-pitched.  (5)  The SPEED of the craft was VERY slow.  The object almost seemed to be stationery at one point, although in retrospect I believe that it was travelling so slow away from me that it appeared at a standstill.  It was witnessed by myself for at least 5-! minutes, even as I headed home in my car I could see one of the two lights off in the distance.  -The &quot;leading&quot; light always appeared to be slightly brighter.  (6)  As I watched it overhead, it was very disconcerting because it almost felt as if it knew I was there (I know that sounds silly) because at that point the &quot;trailing&quot; light started to come towards the &quot;leading&quot; light as if if they were about to collide or merge.  My initial reaction was, &quot;Well, if they are airplanes or helicopters I am going to find out because they will crash!&quot;  These two lights came within less than 1-finger apart from one another and then spread out again to their original 4-finger distance.  It was at about that time that the &quot;leading&quot; light changed to RED and sometimes would blink...sometimes (not all the time---It was an irregular pattern).  The &quot;trailing&quot; light remained white.  Notably, we do have Vandenberg AFB approx. 18-miles from this location; however, the lights appeared to travel more towards Santa Maria than Lompoc and, again, moved VERY slowly.  I did not see any other aircraft (planes, etc.) in the sky, but did (as I headed home) see in my rear-vision mirror (in the light of the full or almost-full moon)see several white contrail lines.  FYI:  I am college-educated and in the medical field.  I am very curious to see how many people report this sighting, as it lasted so long and seemed so unusual.((NUFORC Note:  This witness is well known to us, and we consider her to be exceptionally reliable.

Over Negros Island, Philippines, by amateur astronomer working on Observatory domeBACOLOD CITY (10-deg/50-min N-lat; 122-deg/51-min E-long;) Province of Occidental Negros PHILIPPINES  It was a clear sunny mid-afternoon day, and I was on our rooftop supervising the construction of the Observatory dome.  At the time, the other witness was doing the welding job on the dome while I was seated (on the roof)facing due east.Then this &quot;light&quot; which I would estimate to be of magnitude (brightness) of about -2 or -3.0 (or about the brightness of Venus at the time of its greatest brilliancy or a little brighter), caught my attention. (But Venus could never be more than 48 degrees in angular distance from the sun during the times of its greatest elongation,so Venus is definitely ruled out as a possibility).If my memory serves me right, I think I also called the attention of the welder/laborer to this bright object. It was moving too slow, but not slow enough compared to an aircraft (viewed flying from a far distance).  My initial comprehension was that it was an aircraft somehow reflecting the afternoon sun which was at my back, due west, at the time.Looking at it, however, I could not discern any noticeable appendage(s)that would indicate its nature as an aircraft- and that the object simply appeared as a bright (starlike) object against the (blue of the) daytime sky. What caught my interest was the fact that the light (from my perspective and viewpoint) did not appear to be reflected sunlight in a way. It was about 40 degrees altitude when first seen, and its rather slow movement in the sky towards a northernly direction took it inside some cloud cover after which it was not seen again (though it was still visible through portions of cloud breaks).A few seconds after it was first sighted, the intense (starlike) lighting seemed to have faded to a dull metallic (greyish) color, but I could still not discern any noticeable appendages or structures to indicate that it was an aircraft. From its apparent distance, no sound was heard (although no sound may be expected even from a passing aircraft at that distance which I have no way of estimating). It is common for me to watch a commercial airliner from Australia passing through the sky at about this time of the afternoon, but it was at a different date than its usual flight schedule.  Also, the commercial jet aircraft leaves contrails. That object did not. All these/ the sighting took no less than 2 minutes- but could not have been more than 3-minutes, in duration. It could not have been a balloon or blimp since we don&apos;t have (normally) these things flying around in a country like the Philippines.As a non-professional (amateur) astronomer and formerly a Field Investigator for CUFOS, I am inclined to believe it may have been a mis-identified man-made aircraft of some kind, UNLESS it was indeed something OTHERWISE.

When I first saw these back in August, I stayed outside (it as 2 - 3 a.m.) for a LONG time watching, and what seemed to be the largest and brightest at one point descended to about streetlight level, at the top of the hill from my back yard about 60 yards away.  (I high-tailed it into the house at that point!)  I&apos;ve seen them multiple times since, but not as clearly nor as many as tonight, when again there are 7, spread out in an oval pattern.

The light was slightly to the west when I first noticed it. It looked like a bluish white large planet (I don&apos;t know anything about astronomy, I just like to look at the sky), but I noticed that it was moving to the east. It appeared to be quite high, and was moving quite a bit faster than a commercial aircraft, but definitely slower than a meteor. The light continued going east, and I watched it until it disappeared behind some trees in the distance (almost to the eastern horizon.) The light did not flash or flicker like an exhaust or reflected light, it seemed to be self-luminous. It did not leave a trail behind like a missile or meteor. I did not see any red or green navigation lights as it departed to the east, which I would have expected it it were an aircraft. It is unusual to see any air traffic going directly west to east from this location. Riverside is under the approach for LA and Orange County airports, and there were numerous jetliners in the sky at the same time, all going from east to west, or from NE to SW for Orange County. All had easily seen red and green navigation lights and strobing white lights in addition to their landing lights. The object was noticeably different that the jetliners in appearance.

I have video documentation of both sightings. I was breast feeding my 4 month old daughter, sitting in a chair facing our large picture window, (north) there were no lights on in the house.  I noticed A strange ball of light suspended in the sky. (We lived in the country, no neighbors or city lights for many, many, many miles). As I stared into the sky I saw the object change from one large bright white ball of light into two balls of light.  The &quot;lights&quot; changed in size, density and color, from bright white into a pinkish/orange hue that would become opaque, over and over and over.  The objects rejoined and it began to move in a jerky, zig zag motion, then it stopped and hovered, over and over it did this. I kept telling myself that I was seeing things... and, that my eyes were &quot;doing&quot; this. I grabbed the video recorder and began filming.  During the six minutes of filming the &quot;other&quot; or &quot;another&quot; object amazingly bright and oblong shaped streaked across the sky right above the object I was filming, it was not a falling star, either! It was un-nerving and scared me terribly. So I quickly picked up my baby and ran into my bedroom!  After putting my baby in her layette, I layed down in bed, a minute later I decided that I needed to view the tape I just shot, I think to &quot;prove&quot; to myself I just what I saw!  Well, it wasn&apos;t my eyes playing tricks on me...there it all was on tape, but this part of the tape, where I filmed the &quot;objects&quot; were full of static.  (We had filmed in total darkness before and never had static in the film. So I did another dark sky &quot;test&quot; and taped the night sky in the back yard. The playback on this contained no static which  makes me believe that the object created the static). It should also be noted that my 7 yr. old dog, Sassie, 1/2 wolf 1/2 german shepard, was with me the entire time this was going on. She became very agitated and nervous, panting and drooling.  (the only time she ever acted close to this was 15 minutes before a hot air balloon came into our view--her senses could pick them up miles away--and her behavior was never as amplified as it was with the UFO).  After all this happened, including the &quot;sighting&quot; the following morning, 05/20/03. (that sightings explanation will follow herein), Sassie would not leave my side, she was afraid and could no longer be left in the house alone because she would try to get out, by chewing, digging or whatever.  The next morning I left for a quick run to the local party store, I was gone maybe 20 minutes, during that time frame Sassie had dug all of the flooring away from our sliding glass door, my refrigerator which was next to the slider, was moved out from the wall on an angle and the vertical blinds were in shreds. Her front paws were a bloody mess!  I left her one other time after this and Sassie had chewed all of the trim from around a window, chewed the wood around one of the panes of glass, and broke through glass jumping out of the window. She was shaking in the yard when I returned from that brief errand.  That is when I truly &quot;put two and two together&quot; so to speak, connecting the sightings with her change in personality; a once easy going, relaxed, confident dog,was screwed fearful of being left alone in the house, something we had done with her for 7 years without incident prior!  It broke my heart because she was never the same after all of this. Well, breastfed babies are pretty consistent in their feeding times, so the following morning at 12:15 AM, I again, was sitting in the living room chair looking out of the picture window breast feeding my baby.  Sassy, my dog, began pacing the room, panting and drooling, she was whining and nervous, and I could not calm her.  At 12:29 AM, to my amazement, the &quot;object&quot; from the night before reappeared in the sky.  (I know now that my dog, Sassy knew it was coming, even though we couldn&apos;t see it yet). I grabbed my video recorder right away and ran outside and started filming.  Again, this will sound strange, I know, but, I truly felt that the object knew I was filming because it started &quot;performing&quot; for me.  This night it would change it&apos;s shape from a large, bright ball of white light into a small ball of bright light, and, again, it would change in color from bright white to pinkish/orange.  After a four minutes of filming, and, this is going to sound really wierd, all of a sudden there seemed to be an darkish shadowey type of eye looking back into my eye that was on the video camera&apos;s eye piece! I felt like the object was coming closer and closer to me,too, I got very afraid and ran back into the house and to my bedroom.  I stayed there the rest of the night. Both of these nights there were no clouds whatsoever in the sky.  These objects appeared over hundreds and hundreds of acres of nothing but farm land.  The only thing out that way is a unmaned powering station owned by Consumer&apos;s Energy Company. I found a video expert who made 2 copies of my video for me, which I have placed in other secure locations, as well as made me photos of several video frames that he froze. After seeing the object two consecutive nights like I did, I rearranged my living room and never looked out into the sky that way again...I was too scared to even look into the night sky for months after this for fear that I would see &quot;it&quot; again. Please know that I have filmed the area of the sighting during broad daylight, too, and retained copies of the weather reports for those days of the sighting. I would be happy to forward a copy of my tape, a map of the area and copies of my photos if it&apos;s desired. Thank you for time and if you have any insight or explanations to what I saw, it would be appreciated.

It quickly went from one place in the sky to another and then stopped. The route it traveled was like a large U. There were no flames, no noise, no brightening or dimming of its light, no blinking. It just moved. It was definitely not a plane, helicopter or other type of aircraft. Even at 9 years old, I was very familiar with and had ridden in most types of aircraft, I spent many Saturday afternoons at the airport just watching and bugging the private pilots for a ride. I&apos;ve seen shooting stars and it was definitely not one of those. It was definitely not a meteor, they do not make U turns. The movement only took one or two seconds. The object had not moved before then and did not move a second time. It looked like just a star that moved. Remember, this is 1952. There were no satellites, space vehicles, space stations or space junk for years after I saw what I saw.

A simple search on the above mentioned corporations will reveal the obvious connection.The ships mission was submarine defense warfare related, whether it was hydrographic surveys(mapping of ocean floor) or the launching and towing of many various types of sleds, bullets, and other &quot;secret&quot; equipment. First, the winches on board were equipped with miles of high tech optical embedded cable that was connected to the various devises so we actually launched and retrieved to the deepest depths, I know of several occasions while we were on ops we would have equipment in 13000 feet of water.The ship was divided in two areas of personnel, the crew, approx. 35 including deck and engine dept., and around 30 scientists who were employed by NAVO, the US Navys Oceanographic Office. There was a big division between these two, the crew and the scientists. Man, were they ever tight- lipped...and their labs and quarters took up 2/3 of the ship, and all the labs were secure, no entry what so ever to the crew.I served as primary crane operator, and the scientists became partial to me launching with the crane and operation of winches. In 1995 I served 336 days aboard the Kane- The night of the sighting we were in the Indian Ocean, and were pulling this rather large sled, whatever it did- when an unusual circumstance arose, The Senior Navo Scientist came to the bridge. Remember the division factor...and I was on the port bridge wing, my watch partner AB was on the wheel ( actually in the bridge, as we were on gyro) and the Second Mate had the watch. When the Senior came to the bridge he was actually being social, and he came out to the port wing to converse with me-Cool, I thought, this is unusual...and as we were speaking, I saw it.Coming up from the depths was what appeared to be a small point of light, and was quickly becoming larger as it arose from the depths.When I said &quot;LOOK&quot; and every one on the bridge was watching the Senior did a most curious thing. He ran for the squwak box (here i have to add a note, as the scientists had their own &quot;conn&quot; or bridge, if you will, down below they were capable of steering and controlling course of the ship, however the command to turn or change course would always be relayed to us on the real bridge via this squawk box) and he said to his cohorts, and I quote his words &quot;Gentleman, we have INTERESTING NATURAL PHENOMENA off the port bow&quot; with heavy emphasis on the words I itailisized. As he ran back out to the port wing the object, which was round and I would guess 75 feet in diameter, was at this time I estimate was about 100 feet below our ship...it was so bright- the color of a green glow stick...and I also have to add that the seas were glass, dead calm. Seeing was easy. At this moment, How do I put it...The object went back down in the opposite direction it came from- at a very steep angle and whoa...it was haulin***, with a blur... it was gone.Was it coincidental we stayed in this area for three days, going back and forth, around and around? I am convinced of alien presense in our oceans. For I SAW.It is my hope that maybe one day we will know the TRUTH- our government knows, that&apos;s for sure. Any NAVO Scientists lurking here? Maybe we all will hear from one who is willing the speak.I would be curious of any similiar expierences. I have seen pyro plankton, bio luminesence, glow jely fish, etc. What we saw was a craft of some unknown type, and not any of these natural sources stated above.", "I saw two large, rectangle objects, moving silently outlined with small lights at 3 and 5 hundred feet in air.On my way home alone from a church service I rounded a steep curve and looked to my left across a river and up to the top of a steep hill. It was a crystal clear night and suddenly noticed a large object outlined in red lights with a flashing amber light at the center of the object.  It appeared to be at least 150 ft. long.  I first thought it was a large military helicopter.  I stopped my Chevy Blazer in the road, cut off my stereo and rolled down the window. The object was close to 300 ft. away.  I suddenly realized there was no noise at all. It was roughly 20-30 ft above the tree tops,yet the trees were motionless.  The craft was moving about 10-15 m.p.h. I drove quickly about 200 ft and pulled off to the left side of the road.  I got out of my vehicle and stood looking at it when I suddenly noticed an identical craft around 500 ft above the first one and slightly ahead.  I have lived here all of my life and I could tell by the direction they were heading they would pass over the crest of a hill about 1 and a half miles on down the road.  I figured I would be a lot higher and I would be able to see a lot more so I started for the crest of the hill as fast as I could get there.  It took around a minute to get there and as soon as I arrived I spun my vehicle around so I could see the crafts approach, but to my amazement they were gone.  I tuned my cb radio into a channel a local coal Strip mine was working because i knew, due to their location on the hill, they had to have see the crafts. They were working as usual and did not indicate any sighting at all.  I strangly was not afraid, but after I arrived home, I started to think about what I had seen and realized in what danger i could have possibly been.", "A green ball of light in the north west sky moving in an arc shape as if it was falling, then it dissapeared.I was coming home from work and noticed a green ball of light moving across the north west sky, it almost looked like it was falling, it moved in kind of an arc shape.  It moved for a few seconds then just went out.", "Double Ovoid object photographed NE of Deming, NMDecember 19th, 2003, my wife and I were eastbound on I-10, having just rolled through Deming, New Mexico. Around Mile 60, I noticed an object in the sky to the South (To the right of what my research shows is Black Mountain). Watching it as we drove, I asked my wife what she thought is was, we agreed it might be a hot-air balloon at long range. However, further examination yielded the fact that it was slowly rotating in a perpendicular fashion to my sight line. It appeared to be moving generally in our direction, East. I resolved to pull over take a digital snapshot using an HP Photoshot 435 (3.1 MP max), I put it on high quality, pulled over, and exited the vehicle for the shot. We rolled, and observed this thing pass behind Black Mountain, be briefly visible between the two peaks, and by the time we cleared the mountain, it was lost from view. After getting home from the holiday trip to Texas, I DL&apos;ed the image from the cam into the Mac, was amazed that the photo bore very little resemblance to what we had seen with the naked eye...thought some sense of the double ovoid shape was discernible in the image. I did some image post to bring the object out a bit, and submit a composite of those shots with this report. The camera&apos;s unifocus is frustrating, because the object was larger to the naked eye...and looked hazy around the edges.", "Sightings in Crosby in the 80&apos;sA time in I believe 1983, my mother and I were coming home about 8pm and turned off Hwy 90 just east of Crosby and noticed something thru the trees over a field of a local grass farm. We drove and cleared the trees and saw what I described as an orange football shaped object, maybe 20 ft across, just hanging in the air above the field, perhaps 100 yards above the field.  There were no other lights or sounds, just there. I should note that Mom described the object as red.  There was a white Vega that had stopped in the road ahead of us and the driver had stopped his car, got out and was standing by his car just looking at it.  I pulled in behind him and did the same, stopping the car and turning our lights out, just looking at the object.  As if someone had turned off a switch, the object disappeared, again no sound or movement.  The guy in the Vega stood there for a minute and came back to my car and asked if I had seen the object, I said yes, he said &quot;good&quot;, then left.  Mom claimed to have heard and seen wind after the object vanished but to be honest I didn&apos;t. There were quite a few &quot;sightings&quot; of things we couldn&apos;t explain by family and friends during about a 3 year period during those early 1980&apos;s, then they suddenly stopped and we never saw anything unusual.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

After about four minutes of watching it, a door like thing on the back of it opened up and a much smaller rock textured craft came out of the big one.  The smaller one had only one large black window on the front of it.  They slowly flew together for about twenty seconds and then zipped off extremely fast.

It was apparant to me and my roommate (who was driving) that it was not a star due to it&apos;s brightness.  At first we thought it was a standard civilian aircraft but there were no flashing lights and it was not moving.  As we drove closer we saw that it was clearly a floating object in the sky.  We got closer and we could clearly see the craft from the underside, it was a rounded triangular shape with three very distinct pure white lights forming from the center out to the points of the craft with one blinking red light between back two lights.  The lights had no halo as you would see on any other lights that we would know of, I could clearly see the edges of the craft beyond the lights.  It was close enough to the car that we had to strain our necks to get a good enough angle to look up at it.  The only point of reference that we had to the height that it was flying was a near by radio tower that had one light at the top. My best estimate for how high it was flying was anywhere from 50 to 300 feet above ground.  As soon as we passed the object we decided to pull the car over and see what was happening.  We got out of the car and no more than two second after we exited the vehicle we looked at the craft when it hovered for less than a second and sped away from a dead stop covering a span of many miles in a very short amount of time.  We were outside of the car for (our most generous estimate)no more than ten seconds when we got back in the car.  There were commercial aircraft in the area, most likely in approach to Des Moines.  The object caught up with one of the aircraft almost instantaneously then turned and headed away. My roommate informed me that he looked at the clock in his car before we stopped the vehicle and it read 10:30 p.m., when we got back in the car after ten seconds of being out of it we both looked at the clock! and it read 10:50 p.m. My roommate is a college graduate currently looking into ((deleted)) schools and holding a supervisory position at a local ((deleted)).

On 1/20/04 I witnessed two ufo sightings. I witnessed the same looking ufo that I saw on 1/7/04 and another ufo that was also circular except it had many colors. I went out to dinner and when I got home we were pulling in our driveway and I was telling my mom about how I saw this big buck near the woods on our property and all of a sudden this object off in the night sky instantly grabbed my attention. My mom noticed how suddenly I went quite and she responded by saying &quot;What is it&quot;? I quickly said &quot;mom I think its a ufo&quot;. Once inside, I went up into my room and grabbed my binoculars as fast as I possibly could. I ran back outside with my binoculars in hand and I looked through my binoculars at the object. The object was positioned to the southeast, high in the night sky. At this time it was just me and my stepbrother and we where both trying to see whether this was an actual ufo or not. Without a doubt, through the binoculars, we both saw the multiple colors and the circular shape. The colors of the ufo were the colors of the rainbow and were pulsating at a rapid speed through the binoculars. The object stayed to the east and cycled up and down constantly, at a slow rate. Without looking through the binoculars you could still make out a pulsating object with many colors. Though through the binoculars you could make out every color in the rainbow which could easily be seen. While I was in disbelief, that I was witnessing another ufo in the same month, my stepbrother was looking at a bright white object in the northern night sky. He asked me whether or not I thought that it could be another ufo and I really kind of ignored him. I easily passed it by as a star without giving it a chance even through the binoculars. While still very intrigued by the bright, colorful ufo that was slowly moving in the high, southeastern sky, my stepbrother seemed to not be able to keep his eyes off the bright white ob! ject to the north. He told me that he thought he saw it move and he also said that it was odd how it was pulsating.I gave a quick look at it once again and I thought to myself once again know thats just an extremely bright white star. Though at that exact time, it did look like it had moved and I think thats what made me give it a chance to prove it wasnt a star. I guess I really thought it was impossible to see two ufos let alone one in the same night. I really didn&apos;t start paying any attention to it until I slowed down my excitement of the first ufo I saw and then I really tryed to concentrate on the bright white object to the north. At this point, I realized that without looking through the binoculars the object was in almost the identical spot to the north with the same bright whiteness as the one I saw in the begginning of January. I looked through the binoculars and I instantly noticed that it was a circular shape and that it was pulsating bright white light. Though the only differences with the object were was the shape it changed to and its movement. It moved slowly up and down but still stayed to the northern night sky. The bright white ufo changed shape but not into a triangle but into a shape without any distinct qualitys. The bright white ufo started up in the sky and then ended up looking as if it was in my woods. We both watched each ufo equaly and we stayed outside for about an hour and twenty minutes. The bright, white, circular ufo was much brighter than the circular colorful one in the southeastern sky. Though both moved very similar and at the same speed. They both also made absolutely no sound.

A country road through logging lands, just north of the bottom of the Suwannee River at the Gulf of Mexico. Children in the back seat of my car, noticed a &quot;shadow&quot; moving paralel to our vehicle on the left and just ahead.

On this deserted road, I stopped the vehicle and turned off the lights to try to get a better look at what it was. The object stopped, pivoted, and began slowly coming in our direction. There was no sound that could be heard coming from it. The mother in the passenger front seat became very scared and demanded I get in and &quot;get us out of here&quot;. Somewhat unnerved myself, I complied. I continued to observe this object pace us all the way back to Cross City. The children were slightly scared, and being calmed by their mother. Once in Cross City, I chose not to go directly home not wanting &quot;it&quot; to see us pull into the driveway. I watched as the object slowly took a southerly route away from our location. All movement was very slow and some of it&apos;s turns where at almost a complete stop and in pivotal fashion. In the star lit country sky, we watched this triangular shaped object cover stars and then see the stars reappear behind it as it moved. It had no lights on, and didn&apos;t seem to have any paticular direction to go, sort of as though it were just moving about merely to observe....The next day, I reluctanly approached a freind with the expirience because I was concerned with being thought badly about, since at the time I was in law enforcement.

At first I thought it may be a flock of Geese, but then realized it was solid black against the sky, with dark grey or brown leading edges, there were no distinguishable lights.  I yelled and pointed to my two friends, but they could not locate it before it flew over the ridge of clouds.  It took approximately 15 seconds to fly from horizon to clouds, making absolutely no sound.  I considered that it may be a Stealth aircraft(such as F-117 nighthawk), travelling extremely slow, until I realized that the ceiling was at least 1000 ft. high, and the craft must have been considerably larger than I first estimated.

With amazement, we saw a brilliant spot on the sky at about 35 degrees elevation about 245 degrees direction - the sun was now behind our backs. It was impossible to judge the distance of the spot, but it exhibited strong flickering light from it assumed to be the result of the air mass turbulence, similarly to star watching, indicating several miles. There were no aircraft of any kind in the vicinity. The size of the spot was approximately 2-3 times the diameter of Jupiter as can be seen from Earth. We do not know, how long the object was there before we noticed it, but it was stationary, no movement detected when we spotted it. It hung there for about 30 seconds or so, then very slowly drifted to the right from our vantage point - to the Westerly direction, and stopped for several seconds. After about 15 seconds, it started out in the same westerly direction, accelerating very rapidly, after moving about 15 degrees at an extremely high speed now, it took an abrupt turn 90 degrees to the North (from our position), kept moving with extreme speed, then slowly faded out.It was a Communist system in command at that time in Hungary, but apparently it overlooked the press report, because it reported that 200 thosand people called in about this phenomenon. That was the first and last official report on the subject.The most advanced aircraft at that time in that region were the Mig series (15, and up) Russian vehicles, somewhat later. The only rockets at that time were the German V1 and the V2 rockets. At any rate, the extrmely high speed right angle turn (could not see any turning radius whatsoever) would have torn apart any conventional earthly craft by the lateral vector.

That evening I was listening to activity on a local northern California ham repeater. One of the guys came up and announced that there was a station on the air from a rare african country.I was interested in working that station, so I needed to go out to the back yard to crank up my tower all the way to the 50 foot level.When not being used, I normally left my tower cranked all the way down to the 20 foot level. That is because if strong winds came, I wouldn&apos;t have to worry about the possibility of the tower and antennas coming down on my roof- or the neighbors.When I got outside, I cranked the tower all the way up. It took a couple of minutes to do it. As I had finished the cranking, I stood there with my hand on the crank, catching my breath and looking up at the antenna and sky.One thing I noticed was that for an April night, it was unusually warm outside; it seemed like it wasn&apos;t that early in the year, it was so warm.Also I noticed how clear the sky was, it was a completely clear and starry night and it was calm.As I was looking up at the antenna and sky, suddenly I saw from the corner of my left eye a very bright light up in the sky approach from a northerly direction.(I was standing there facing in an easterly direction.) It came so fast, in a fraction of a second, that I didn&apos;t know what was happening.The best way that I can describe it, from the brief instant that it was there, was that it was an extremely bright flash of white light, coming from the north.The next thing I knew, I was looking straight up again, now shocked and in awe with what I was seeing.Above my antenna at an unknown height, there was a hovering object! It was difficult to judge the altitude of the object. It could have been at least several hundred feet above the ground or much more, because I could see the whole object including the aura around it between the space of two of the aluminum elements which my antenna was made of, without being blocked by the antenna elements- the view of it was completely unobstructed by the antenna elements.The object was a crisscross grid of 8 or 10 bars that were glowing an intense, extremely dark red color. I tried to look between the red bars of the grid to see more, the area looked opaque and was a less dark red. The light that emanated from this object was not blinding- I could look up and see it very clearly. Around the outside edge of the dark red grid there was a shimmering orange aura, of which I also took note. The orange aura around the grid was fairly narrow, maybe one fifth or so the size of the grid itself.The hazy aura shimmered in waves, akin to the way you see heat waves on the highway ahead when driving on a very hot day. The waves of the aura were shimmering at a slow, uniform rate. After I looked up at this thing for about 10 seconds, I closed my eyes tightly, faced down to the ground and shook my head in disbelief. Then I opened my eyes and looked up again.It was still there! Around this time, the thought crossed my mind- &quot;I wonder what the expression on my face looked like to them if something up there was in fact watching, if they saw the look of dread that must have been on my face&quot;.I studied it some more, and after 15 seconds or so, it suddenly vanished. I looked all around the sky above, but it was in vain. It left no trace of what had become of it, where it had gone, that I could see.During the time that this all happened, I detected no sounds at all.It is my assumption that this all came about because of the fact that I was quickly cranking up my tower with antenna from the 20 foot nested level to the 50 foot fully extended level and the activity and movement called its attention to this location. However, I get the impression that it was possibly not of any consequence to it whether or not I was standing by the base of the tower to see its approach. I only happened to be standing there, still catching my breath. It seems to me that the focus of attention was most likely directed at the antenna and tower and their movement upwards.Possibly the deep red-colored grid was the mode that they were in to take readings or observations. I had this feeling, anyway.I was very shocked by what had happened, and most any time that I think of what I saw, chills usually come up my back.Some months later on a visit to my parents, I told them about what had happened.Mom asked if I had been able to look at it standing clear of the antenna.I wish that it had been possible to do that, but there was not enough time.I can hardly believe that it happened myself, it was so strange.I have an added afterthought- When going back inside, I went into the radio room. I tried to operate the equipment, but I felt disoriented and stupefied. When I figured out I couldn&apos;t clearly tell what I was doing, I gave it up for the night.", "Mysterious Red Blinking light of San DiegoI was having a New Years celebration (2004) at my home. A few close friends had gathered. At the stroke of midnight we went back to light a Roman candle and some firecrackers. My yard faces north. On the hillside across from me a firework lit the sky drawing my attention up. I noticed a glowing red light, high in the sky. A first I thought it was a red flare, far away. Similar in intesity, pulsating, flickering. However, to my astonishment, It remained stationary. After several minutes I commented to my friends who looked at it with disbelief. We observed it for a few more minutes, when they exclaimed it must be a plane, or a flare that caught an updraft. Hoever to my eye it appeared far away, almost star like, however it pulsed and flickered much greater that any star I have seen. I watched for a while and grabbed my video camera. It was extremely difficult to view, except in night vision mode on my camera. It appeared to gain elevation slowly and to drift slightly to the east. after another 15min+ it flickered brightly and just dissapeared. 2 guests at my party commented they had seen the same thing a few years back, 3 of them (red lights) together in fact, even closer and to the south. I myself had seen something similar, 10 years ago over mission bay, with a yellow however I will have to make another report, I I just discovered this site. I have read up on the reports here, and I am dying for somekind of expaination. It seems to be a common phenomena in the San Diego region, and in fact an almost identical report came from a few years back in Spring Valley, even in the sam direction. Is it possible for a flare to do this?...It is hard for me to believe.Like everyone else, I guess I just want an answer", "Refractive  mirror like Sphere observed in isolated NE Arizona :Via Jeff RenseThis morning I was burning of some debris wood in front of my place. At about 9 AM I saw about 100 yards away a perfect sphere about 5 or 6 foot across hovering 75 yards off the ground that was moving very slow. It appeared as if observing from a distance. I walked towards it and it changed direction and as I compensated it changed direction again. Here is the important point, the sphere, I don&apos;t think I was supposed to see it because it was almost cloaked with the background. The closest I could come to describing this was that it refracted the light almost as if you were looking at a mirror ball in water. When it became obvious that I could see it in contrast to the sky by walking directly at it. It made several slow evasive moves, and then dropped away and down towards the ground and bush where I could not distinguish it in contrast to the ground and bush. Was unable to discern it at that point and lost my eyesight view to follow it. This event lasted about five minutes.", "3 Amber Circles enclosed in Rectangle - Healing requested.On November 20, 2003 I had been taking a nap and at 6:00 p.m. &quot;something&quot; told me to wake up and open my eyes.  As I did, the first thing I saw was a big white light in the sky across the street.  It was so big and nearby, it could have only been coming from a helicopter.  But it was an unusually warm day in WI and I still had my windows open.  Had it been a helicopter, there would have been loud noise coming from it.  There was no noise whatsoever.  I watched it for about 15 seconds and it went behind the house across the street so I lost sight of it.  It just silently glided out of my view. About 15 minutes later again &quot;something&quot; told me to take the dogs outside.  My dogs never go out at that time (they&apos;re on a regular pattern and had gone out a little earlier already).  As I took the second dog outside, I looked up in the sky and telepathically said: &quot;Are you still in the area?&quot;  Right then I noticed a plane going overhead.  I said out loud: &quot;Oh, that&apos;s just a stupid plane again!&quot;  And before I finished that sentence, I saw something else and said: &quot;THAT&apos;s not a plane!&quot;  Not too far behind the plane was a configuration of three amber circles enclosed in a amber rectangle. It glowed amber as if it was pure energy and a sentient being in and of itself.  As it glided through the atmosphere, it didn&apos;t fly straight like human made planes do, rather it traveled on an angle.  I watched it only for a few seconds before it just disappeared. For character reference: I am a Disclosure Project Representative, have worked directly with Golden Eagle, have investigated the two WI Crop Circles this summer, been healed from PID from an ET in 1995, am a Natural Healer and Metaphysical Teacher/Student.  Among many other things I am directly connected to Aztalan and Rock Lake, WI. I was born at 11:11 a.m. during a Grand Cross / Planetary Alignment. Something to watch: In December my mother was diagnosed with Advanced Breast Cancer.  Since I myself was healed by an ET, I have strongly requested those same ETs to heal my Mother.  Beginning in December, the Phoenix area (within WALKING or WORKING distance from my family) has had a UFO Sighting / Flap.  And in that time, a mysterious white &quot;UFO&quot; van has been spotted numerous times right near where they live. So I have Faith that they are going to heal her.  It will be a Miracle that will be widely talked about with documentation.", "Pool Rack formation seen over an Army Base in Brooklyn, NY during a meteor showerSome time in the early 1990&apos;s, probably around &apos;90 or 91, there was a heavy meteor shower clearly visible over the NYC area. I was located inisde the Fort Hamilton Army Base in Brooklyn, NY. We observed the shower, just over the horizon, through the center and upper level of the Verrazzano Bridge. It was an amazing sight. But when we looked directly overhead, we saw about twelve unknown craft, all bottom-lit and flying in what I could only describe as a group of pool balls in a triangle formation, moving at a high rate of speed. These craft were definitely over the &quot;ceiling&quot; and were moving much faster than a passnger jet would fly at the same altitude. The most amazing thing about this sighting was that the UFO&apos;s switched positions rapidly, in like an &quot;X&quot; fashion, just as they were flying over my head. all of them did it at the same time, quite rapidly and precisely - it was then that I knew that the only group capable of doing such aerial arobics at that speed would be the Blue Angels. But why would they be flying over the city on an average day and at night - and in such a formation? And why were the fighters bottom-lit? Alot about this encounter did not make any sense to me. My natural assumption is that the craft must have been extra-terrestrial. I&apos;m just hoping that I wasn&apos;t the only one, aside my cousin, who had my eye on the sky that night.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have assigned an artificial date, allowing for the possibility that the witnesses may have been looking at the Leonid (??)

I was walking along the lake, going southbound on the walk right next to the lake, a few hundred feet before the buckingham fountain pathway.  From my perspective it looked as if it were hoovering over the shed aquerium and the observatory.  It moved VERY quickly and manuvered around as if it were a toy plane being flown.  The lights on the UFO seemed to blink like a normal plane but it was deffinitly not a plane.  There were broken up clouds across the sky, as if they were providing protection from being seen.  When i made it back into my appartment, on michigan ave., i noticed a plane, or jet going very fast across the sky, toward the lake.  At approxamently 11:15 A.M., December 29th 2003, there was a hellicopter that flew JUST over the buildings, which is VERY low and very unorthadox considering the terrorist threats.

Object was low enough to see it well and it was procceding Southeast at a low rate of speed towards the Sandia Mountains. Upon arriving at my destination about a mile away I looked for the object that was now about the size of a dime and noticed 3 other silver objects the size of the head of a pin west of the Sandias very high about two to three oclock from me.I watched these four objects for about five minutes and they continued due west. The first object was gaining altitude and was decreasing in size. Two of the highest silver objects dis-appeared out of site at about 10 oclock from my vantage point and the one I originaly spotted kept climbing and was about 11 oclock from my vantage point. The objects were heading west and higher at a goodly rate of speed. At about one oclock the third object dis-appeared from view at about 10 oclock from my vantage point. The original object kept climbing until it was out of my eyesight at about 11 oclock but further south than the other three dis-appeared.This was a bright shiny day here with visibility unlimited.", "color changing spherical object, moving slowly over the night horizonI noticed a spherical light just over the horizon and told my friend to look at it, so he did.  At first I thought the object was Mars, but it was fluctuating in different colors, though it stayed mostly red.  We drove closer to the object and as we did, it seemed to move further away.  As we got closer, i noticed that it was changing between red, blue, orange, yellow, and green colors, almost as if the colors were moving around it.  We went back to my friends house which was only a few blocks away(we were at the outskirts of town) and got a pair of binoculars, i told him to hurry for fear of the object leaving.  After we got the binoculars, we drove back to our spot and i turned off my car.  My friend had trouble finding the object, so I took the binoculars and watched the object through the binoculars.  As i did, I could see the object clearly.  It was fluctuating like before, but as i watched it started to fade out.  Then it came back, the colors more intense, and it started blinking.  It did this one more time and then moved slowly across the sky, eventualy disapearing under the horizon.", "Low flying disc shaped UFOWhen I was approx. 12 years old we lived in an 2nd floor apartment that was above a store in Portsmouth, NH on Route 1. One night it was dark out. I was taking a shower. In the shower there was a small window that was open with a curtain covering it. As I was taking my shower I heard this strange low humming sound coming from outside the window. I was curious as to what it was. I pulled back the curtain to look out the window and floating next to the house above the tree line was a UFO. It was metallic, grey and disc shaped with moving lights around it&apos;s edge. The UFO was very smooth with no signs of seams, doors or windows. I do not know the size of the UFO because I could not see the whole thing. As soon as I saw the UFO it went straight up like nothing I have seen before. As soon as it was gone the low humming noise that was present the whole time was gone. I ran out of the shower and into the living room where my mother was and started screaming I saw a UFO. We have since moved from there. I don&apos;t think that I hallucinated the incident. My mothere remembers me coming out a telling her I saw it. The one thing that sticks in my mind is the noise that the UFO made that I will never forget.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

When we downloaded the pictures I commented that something must have been on my lens, but looking at the pictures, I realized this object was only in one photo of the set (taken within 10 second duration).

It was dark, cold out and very clear. As we rushed the sleeping child in the house from the car she took him upstairs and I went to kitchen sink to get a drink of water.To my right we have a pantry about ten feet deep and a window at the end facing the east and a flat corn field that rises about two hundred yards out.

Just as I raise the binoculars up my wife stepped in the dark pantry and asked what I was doing. I asked her to look at the bright star it could be a planet. She did as I looked throught the glasses. She commented on how bright it was just as I got focused. I could actually see two lights that appeared as one with the naked eye. between the lights you could make out a silver looking saucer shaped body.

I went outside and stared at the sky again and saw what could only be ;  a) the same object that had returned to almost the same spot but much higher,or b) a different object that was near the same spot, and was either smaller or higher,  this time it did&apos;nt hover, it moved slowly, and then zoomed away to the south east. end of story.

I was in training at Fort Gordon (military base) in the 31-R course (Tactical Multi-Channel Transmission Systems Operator Maintainer). We were on a very large open field that we called &quot;The antenna field&quot; thats right behind the PX at Fort Gordon, there&apos;s also some old barracks that are no longer used (more useless information: These old barracks were used [as the barracks] in the Clint Eastwood movie &quot;Heart Break Ridge&quot;). We were learning how to install the 9 meter antenna mast (used with a Radio Access Unit). It requires a minimum of 3 soldiers to install (although I&apos;ve figured out a way that ONE troop could do it), we had four soldiers and one of our two civilian instructors (GTE employees - working for the GTE Resident School, Now called the General Dynamics Resident School). I was holding the Kevlar anchor cable, getting ready to lock it down - we were almost done making adjustments, when I heard the soldier to my right (Private Shaw) SCREAM at the top of his lungs &quot;LOOK AT THAT %#*(^%  UFO!!&quot; (thats exactly what he said). I looked up and saw a HUGE light streaking across the sky at incredible speeds. I dont know what I could compare it to since it was like nothing I&apos;ve ever seen in my life. The civilian instructor didn&apos;t even look up, and he yelled at ME for taking my eyes off the anchor cable! (he yelled &quot;((name deleted)) pay attention to what your doing!&quot;). So I looked down just long enough to lock the cable down (less than one second) and when I looked back up it was gone. Several nights later we were putting up a 30 meter mast and not every team would end up working because it took the entire duration of a class to do (and not enough masts for each group) so on this night my team was in a large white tent watching movies (most of which sucked) and eating crappy chinese food. I was bored with the movie so I went outside &amp; looked up (still freaking out because of the previous sighting several days ago). I saw a bright lig! ht in the sky far off in the distance. One would have mistaken it for a star if not familiar with the constelations (which I am). It was sitting inside of Orion - I knew it didn&apos;t belong there (there&apos;s only supposed to be SEVEN stars in the Orion constelation). It didn&apos;t move for about 5 hours - even as the stars moved away from it through out the night (I kept going back out &amp; kept track of it) it stayed in the same spot - it&apos;s position in relation to the constelations continued to change as the stars moved through the sky. I only stared at it for about 15 minutes each time (how long can you stare at ANYTHING before you get bored?). Towards the end of the night I went back outside &amp; noticed that the light was no longer there - but there were about 6 Black Hawk helicopters flying all the way AROUND the spot where it was. They were NOT passing THROUGH the area where the light was! (even though it was no longer there) But going ALL THE WAY AROUND that area!

It did not seem to accelerate it just went from sitting still to speeding across the sky.

Then it disappeared again but it appeared again RIGHT ahead of us (we were on a straight road) but lower to the ground about 500 feet and a mile ahead on top of a hill, by this time we were all getting scared even alannah jumped in front with us cause it was ahead of us but it kept moving forward blinking different lights and getting lower to the ground when we reached the hill it was gone. So we all looked around again and it appeared about a mile ahead of us the red and blue lights brighter than before all of us got really excited and we kept our eye on it till we got into town we then turned onto Heart Butte road and stopped to look, it looked to have landed on the hill by East Glacier road we could still see the lights flashing on it.

A lady had gone to the internet in search of a Canadian UFO Investigator so she could file a report on some strange on-going sightings which had been taking place in her area. At one point the objects seen were so frightening to her and the family, that the RCMP was called to the witnesses residence to investigate. The witness did state that she was not going to call this a UFO, meaning something from another world because she really did not firmly believe in this. The lady went on to say that what she and her family have been observing was something they could not explain. Be it military or something else, whatever these objects are, they do some very bizarre things in the sky. On December 26, 2003 the dispatcher for the  Sicamous, British Columbia RCMP detachment took a call from an excited woman who requested the RCMP  come to her home and look into the unusual sights that had been taking place over a period of time. Whilst making the report she felt that she wasn&apos;t being taken seriously ... and that maybe they thought her to be a little crazy.. however when an hour passed and the RCMP officer arrived in her yard it was a different story.  As soon as he saw the object he stood and looked in amazement.  He had no idea what it was. I was told that the officer left the families home and drove towards the mountain where the object was sitting to get a closer and better look. (HBCC UFO Note: So far I have left two messages with the Sicamous RCMP detachment to have the constable call me back using my toll free number and as of yet he has not returned my call. I am not giving up on him, and I will keep trying until I get a hold of him even if it means becoming a pest). &quot;An important part to this case is that excellent video footage has been shot by the family&quot;. As the tape is rolling you can hear the children in the background commenting on how quickly the object was moving all over the sky. It appears to be moving rather quickly, zig zagging, etc.. I asked the witness about how she was holding the camera, knowing that any slight movement while video taping can make &quot;something&quot; appear to move. In the footage it shows the object moving erratically around the sky. The other members of her family who stood watching this event unfold saw the very same thing with the naked eye..... something flying all around the sky. The witness said  these objects (plural as there are more than one at different times) ..... was also seen by her husband whilst he was up in the mountains which is around their area.  He described one of the objects as being as big as a house and covered in lights.  At the time, he was waiting for his daughter and her cousin to return with the snowmobile.  He watched the object with his naked eye and estimated it to be approximately a mile away from his location. He was so excited and frightened at what he saw whilst he waited...  that he immediately drove back home, ran into the house and told his wife of his adventure.  She thought he had been drinking as he was acting strange and obviously was very scared.  Knowing they had to go back out to that location where the object was seen because they had to pick up the kids, the gentleman said he was not going back out there alone !  The husband&apos;s sighting took place before December 26, 2003, and what the family caught on tape on December 26, 2003 was the same object.  It had returned.They also saw the object through their binoculars and described it as being in the shape of an acorn or a diamond. It was an extraordinary sighting because not only did the object shine brightly and move around erratically ... but at one point when it was stationary ... it shot out a large red fireball, then six bright orange lights appeared in the sky around it.  Each of the orange lights had another two white lights on them.    These white lights shot a beam of light towards the ground.  Approximately  half an hour later four more of the large acorn/diamond shaped objects showed up and sat either stationary or moved around the sky. The witnesses said the objects appeared to have hundreds of lights on each of them. These folks have recently moved into this home, but the previous owners said they used to watch in the daylight hours ... on many occasions silver disk shaped objects flying over and around the mountains behind the house. This case is under investigation and this is only raw data at present. Video tape is currently being examined. A foot note to this. The lady who reported the sighting and who rang the RCMP told me that when the constable arrived and saw the object .. he commented to her that he knew of nothing that moved that quickly ... nor of anything that could stop like it did on a dime. This story proved interesting enough that the television station (CHBC TV out of Kelowna, British Columbia) sent a news crew to interview  the family and to get a copy of the footage. CHBC TV is a part of the Global TV network which is one of Canada&apos;s giants in the media business. The story ended up airing not just on that station, but aired all over British Columbia on Global BCTV. They ran the story at least three times as a part of their news. Once at 6:00 p.m. Friday night, again at 11:00 p.m. and again on the Saturday morning news.  As I was the investigator on the case they also called me a number of times and interviewed me about the story. The news gave this story a good length of time to play out on TV which was really great to see. Something else of interest prior to these sightings but in the same area was when an RCMP officer who was out on his usual rounds in his patrol car ... noticed an object in the sky and was instantly hit with a beam of light from it.   After his shift was over and upon his return to his detachment he informed his co-workers of what he had seen.  They thought he was seeing things.   Now perhaps they have a different interpretation of the event. On a separate note, sightings are still coming in.Reports from Nova Scotia back from the 1970s, Vernon, Kelowna, Kitimat, Terrace, Comox, British Columbia and from Alberta etc.. Plus other reports from aound the world.

It was early evening and I was looking out the window.  I saw some lights that started rising up and I said, &quot;Oh my God, there&apos;s something out there!&quot; and my sister and mother rushed to the window to see.  It was shaped like two pie plates inverted together with lights around the edge of various colors and a red light on the top.  It had openings that looked almost like small, round windows that were between the lights on the edge.  The surface was smooth and metallic looking.  It just hovered above the ground without a sound for a few minutes and then took off straight up into the sky in the blink of an eye.  I don&apos;t think it was more than 50 yards from the house; it was really close. The really strange thing about it is that all of us have different memories of what we saw.  I remember my brother and uncle being there but neither of them remember it or think they were there.  My mother remembers it going over the house and then hovering and my sister remembers being outside and watching it go over the house, hover and then take off in the sky.  It seems like it was still a little light when I first saw it, but when it just took off straight up, it was dark.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "One very bright light in one location moving from slightly from side to side for about an hour then faded outI walked outside my front door at 7:30 pm on friday night to get something from my car, I looked up and noticed a very bright star shaped object hovering in the western sky but this object was much too close to be a star, it seemd to be about 5 miles away at about a 45 degree angle. I watched it for about 1 minute to see if it would change locations it did not, but I did notice it move slightly from side to side then I went back inside my house and asked my 15 year old daughter to look at it and see if I was mistaken.She watched for 30 seconds and noticed it move, she was very frightened by it and went back inside to call her friend. At this point I had to call my friend to tell him because I new he would be verry interested. I told him what i was seeing and instantly he and his wife got in their car and drove down to the beach to get a close up view of the light. The area they drove to was west of my house and below the light. When they arrived at the beach they could see the same light I was watching. At this point my wife and 12 year old daughter returned home from picking up dinner she asked what was going on and I told her, they stopped and looked at it and also noticed its movements and agreed it was not a star. My 12 year old daughter ran inside the house frightened, my wife was speechless. The bright light did not change locations for 40 minutes. During this time we watched the light fade in and out as if it were traveling away from us and returning but after talking with my friend at the beach we agreed the light was revolving around the object, It soon faded out((NUFORC Note:  Venus is very prominent in the western sky, currently.  NUFORC receives many reports about it.  PD))", "It looks like a very brightly illuminated star.  But there are no stars visible in the sky except for this star.  It appears to Have a red ring in one direction and possible a green ring.  It is totally stationery or at least it appears so  It is visible in the Western Sky approximately at 10 o&apos;clock possition in the sky  Can anyone tell me what we are viewing ?", "UFO shased off by fighter jetsA friend sent this to me, he is not the type to lie. I thought his story should be shared  Friday, October 15,1999  My first UFO,  I finally have seen a UFO tonight at approx. 8:30 PM CDT. 10-15-99. We ( friend #1, friend #2 and I ) were taking Friend #3 home this evening and on the way there, we stopped on a country road West of Ellis to chat, listen to tunes and watch the traffic go by on Interstate 70. Me being a star hound and watching the skys alot, had my head out the window looking around at the sky and Jupiter and watching for Saturn to rise above the horizon. There was a thin haze of clouds going over but thin enough to tell where Jupiter was and I could barely see Saturn through the clouds, just above the horizon. It was cool and windy so no one was getting out of the van. As I scanned the sky I saw what started to look like a meteor heading South and it got very bright and I started to have a thought that it was heading straight towards us because the flame of it looked peculiar and flared to an odd shape, just in one place and didn&apos;t look like it was heading in any one direction, then it dimmed and started heading South. When I first saw it, I told the guys something like, OOH YOU GUYS, like I was seeing an odd sort of slow motion meteor hitting the atmosphere and then as I saw it looking like a satellite and heading in a straight line South. I told them that I thought it was a satellite that had just turned or I had just caught the glimpse of sunlight shining off a panel on the craft and grabed my binoculars and started to watch it race along the way satellites do when, I swear to my honor and Gods, that it turned 180% and came back to the North for a short distance and turn back South again and stopped. I was telling my friends about this as it happened. It sat there motionless for several minutes and then as suddenly as it stopped, it started off to the West and stopped and turned and went back and forth in several different directions, going only short distances and then would move a short distance more, stopping at points and turning the other way and I watched it do that for at least five or six minutes when it quit moving. It was blended into the sky just as a star and didn&apos;t move ! at all so I had to prop my head up with one hand so I could hold still on the object with my binoculars and did that for several more minutes. I would approximate that after five to eight minutes of spotting this object, three jets then came from the West, of the first two, one banked and seemed to take the heading towards Great Bend direction and stayed low, the other turned and flew straight toward the direction I was watching this object and the third jet also coming from the West seemed to turn and go up toward that area of sky I had been watching. By this time friend #1 and friend #3 had got out of the van and saw the jets flying in there directions and I pointed to the one that was flying toward the area I was looking at. We watched as the two jets looked like they were climbing very quickly and then made a loop and started heading back to the West when the cool got the better of us and we got back in the van. I stuck my head out the window a few more times that evening before we left the place we were sitting and will continue to watch the skies for all the celestrial events, the stars, constellations, and satellites and hopefully more UFO type objects in the sky. I have always said, &quot;I will believe it when I see it,&quot; and tonight is the night that I can say that I have seen it. So help me God !", "Strange light emmitting shpere in Africa with bright flashes.First of all, I was one of 4 mormon missionaries that witnessed this.  We had hiked out to a village.  The trail was about a 2 hour hike down into a valley and across a stream and back up the otherside to a ridge where many villages tend to be built because of flooding issues.  We got to the village approxiamety 5:30ish that evening, dark sets in at that lattitude around 6:30, and honestly, we were a bit nervous about the hike back in the dark, with absolutely no lights of any electric kind visible anywhere, and being in Africa, with animals.  However, at about 9:30 p.m. we left the village and at approxiatemley 10:30 p.m. we reached the river.   To the south of the crossing the valley really broadens out into grassland and 10 to 15 miles away there is another mountain range.  That is when one of the missionaries said, hey look at the moon, it looks strange, and I already had noticed the moon earlier, and noted to him that the moon was in the opposite direction.  We stopped and stared at this large spherical glowing mass, that seemed to be translucent with mostly oranges and a hint of blue coming from it.  There was absolutely no sound.  Then suddenly, it emitted like lightning bright white, and the whole valley was alluminated, for a split second like we were part of a huge camera flash.  At this point, we were getting very nervous, we could feel static electricity in the air, litterally.  The sphere was still there, and again, about a minute later, another flash.  And then it was gone.  And the night was again to us and the half moon and clear skys.  I don&apos;t have any explanation for this, except that we all saw it and wonder to this day what it was.  I have never seen weather do this.  And it dissapeared so quickly I doubt that it could have been any aircraft, such as a helicopter hovering.  The size which would be difficult do to distance had to be large.  We could see the glow of it on that ridge that was 10 to 15 miles away, the flash seemed to come from the center of the object.  A! t this point due to my career, and being in contact with large amounts of people, I prefer to remain anonymous, with no contact, just felt this might be interesting.", "2 very unusual possibly related events correspond  in time with no explanantion in Connecticut.there was a mysterious power blowout affecting thousands in the Manchester CT area last night. I, in Hartford, witnessed an arcing sensation outside and the lights/ tv and computer dimmed briefly/ a pop noise and appliances/lights kind of fizzled. It was exceptional in that I felt that something big had happened.That night on coast to coast, a caller from the another corner of the state(Westport, CT) related to George Noory on coast to coast that he witnessed an incredibly huge craft thousands of feet in the air with blinking lights and an antenna coming down from its underside. It was over US95 in Westport. the local utilities and newstation claim today they are puzzled byt the electrical failure.", "Fast Moving Bright LightTemperature was 29 degrees F., sky clear.  My wife and I were outside in the spa.  I spotted an object moving from the NE to the SW.  First appearance was at about 1030 (with 0900 being the east horizon, 1500 the west).  It was round and about as bright as the brightest star visible in the southeastern sky.  My wife saw it immediately, as I said something like &quot;meteor&quot; when I first saw it.  But it moved slower than a meteor and didn&apos;t disintegrate.  I followed it until it disappeared behind the roof of the house (I stood up to extend my viewing time).  Its highest point was just to the south of us. I then asked my wife about what she saw.  How large?  About six times as large as the brightest star (which was the EXACT figure I had in mind).  Color?  Slightly orange (I agreed).  Nature of the light?  A bit diffuse, as though an intense light was shined on a cloud.  Agreement again. The track never varied.  There was no noise.  There was nothing visible around the light.  Its intensity never changed. A satellite?  No, it was too late in the evening to see satellites, and the track would be quite unusual for it to be either a satellite or space debris.  A meteor?  Possibly, but given its speed, constancy and duration, unlikely.  It was definitely not an airplane (no sound, no flashing lights).", "Chevron shape on side and very shiny but not blinding.The sun was low and I was watching contrails that were very high up.  There were 6 indicating a plane with six distinct trails.  Seemingly well below those I spotted a very shiny, silvery object which appeared as a boomerang or chevron shape on its side.  It was a very cold day and I saw no contrails.  It appeared motionless.  All I could think was that it looked beautiful against the blue sky.  I looked from several positions through a large window to see if it was a reflection.  It wasn&apos;t. The side away from the sun, in the shadow appeared to have a bluish cast.   If I held my hand at arms length and used my thumb and forefinger to get a size my fingers would have been approximately 1/8th of an inch apart.  It was at an elevation of 45 degrees above the horizon.I was a trained oberver as a Naval lookout aboard ship.", "Weird Light fading out then brilliantly bright again.I just recently moved to AZ from NH about 3 months ago and am fascinated by the stars I can see here unlike the big city that I came from, the sky at night here is breath taking. On this particular evening I noticed an extremely bright star.  From all the nights I&apos;ve been gazing, I&apos;ve never seen this particular one before.  I was a little stunned at how BIG it was. Big and very very bright! It didn&apos;t twinkle, like some of the other stars did and for a brief moment got really spooked.  I ran inside and did an Instant Message to my mother (who is in Nantucket, MA) and told her what I was seeing. She asked if I could take a digital picture of it.  So I attempted to.  I took a picture of the regular stars directly above me, of the little dipper and Orion&apos;s belt, but couldn&apos;t actually see it through the view finder. I took the picture anyway. I then faced that bright star and actually saw it through my view finder.  That&apos;s gotta tell you right there how bright it was. I downloaded it to my computer and it showed up, blurred, as I couldn&apos;t keep a steady hand.  I proceeded to try and take several steadier pictures but couldn&apos;t.  I concluded that maybe it&apos;s the planet Venus but I&apos;m not Astronomically inclined and don&apos;t know it&apos;s position. I figure I&apos;ll check back after an hour or so and see if it moves with the rest of the constellations. My friend showed up to watch a movie with me but before we did, I pointed it out to him and he was just as baffled.  He said he thought it was too low to be a star. Then thought it was a plane.  But I said it&apos;s been stationery like that for the past 1/2 hour or so, it can&apos;t be a plane. We watched the movie and about an hour later (9:30 pm), I stepped back outside to check on it.  It had faded to a smaller redder shape and much lower to the horizon.  Next thing I knew I was holloring for my friend to come see it.  It got extremely bright again, I mean BRIGHT then would fade out then bright again, then fade etc... I asked him if there was a lighthouse around here and he said no.  Then the faded light slowly moved to the right and lit up bright again. ... It&apos;s gone now..... I don&apos;t see it anymore. For a brief description of my point of view....From my back patio, I see the western sky. I am in the higher part of Lake Havasu City and can see the lake and the Indian Resort Casino in Havasu City, Ca.  I can see the lights of the Casino. These are small pin points of lights and the one I saw had to be about 10 times brighter than the casino lights.  Not being able to estimate miles, All I can do is guess that the bright light I saw was about 5 or 6 miles East of the casino lights which is probably desert. I am really baffled by this and really want to know what I saw. In the meantime, I&apos;m gonna research Venus&apos;s location.  :)", "The round, white object move in a zig, zag fashion: aircraft nearby was smaller in comparisonMy sister and I were about to go for a hike. I remarked how blue the sky was today and that there were no chemtrails. ( seems like an everyday occurance) We saw an airplane to the left which was flying west to east. To the east of the airplane, we both saw a circular, white shape that was at first flying east , but then seemed to zig-zag side to side , then move vertical as well. We had to keep moving to keep it in our sight, as when we moved , trees would hamper our sight. We observed this object for about 1 minute, and both remarked how we wished we had brought our cameras today, since the snow that had fallen yesterday had made everything look so pretty. In comparison to the airplane it had to have been larger, because it was higher in elevation. We kept moving to keep it in veiw, but either disappeared from our sight or vanished in an instant because after approximately 1 minuter we no longer saw it any where in the sky.", "The object was long and straight, it was dark colored and moved in a forward motion.I was standing outside on my porch with a friend. I saw this long dark color object in the sky, it was not moving at first then it moved slowly, that is when my friend saw it. Then it moved quicker in a forward motion, and we didn&apos;t see it again after that.", "I photographed 3 planets lined up but my digital camera came back with a strange &quot;constellation&quot;??Coming in around 9 pm one night in November [not sure of exact date] I noticed 3 &quot;planets&quot; lined up high in the eastern sky. There was no moon and few stars that I could see. I came inside to get my camera [a simple Kodak CX4200] and snapped a picture of them.  [I remember having to hold the camera high to get the shot]. I didn&apos;t get a good shot, as the 3 lights were very faint in the photo so I saved it in my files to check out later. [Planets &quot;line up&quot; all the time]. I found this picture the other day when cleaning out my files, cropped it some, and used my &quot;brighten/contrast&quot; feature from the camera software to bring out the 3 lights, deleting the original almost &quot;black&quot; photo. The 3 horizontal lights at the bottom now looked bright red, and then there were horizontal &quot;Y&quot;s that seemed to be linked by the tails, and 4 red lights at the top right side of the formation lined up at an angle that I didn&apos;t see that night. Also, on the right inside light there seems to be a red dot next to it. [I don&apos;t think we can photograph &quot;moons&quot; of distant planets with cheap digital cameras!].  Just an interesting shot, though, and wish I&apos;d gone back out later to check on it but didn&apos;t think it was anything spectacular. Maybe my software changed the colors unjustly; but there&apos;s no doubting the odd formation, even in a legitmate constellation.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  The constellation, &quot;Orion,&quot; whose &quot;Belt&quot; appears to be three stars in a row, is in the eastern sky, at present.  We suspect the witness means a date in 2003, but we will check.  PD))", "I observed an bright object on a clear night streak across Tulsa,Okla. from east to west. It lit up as it entered the atmosphere, leaving red smoke behind it. It seem to appear right around the Arkasas river as it entered the atmosphere, then became unobservable in about 3 seconds. It could have been a meteor.", "An large orange disk hovered quietly over a park a few blocks away to the northwest.I was about 12 yrs. old.  My friends and I were playing on Ashland Ave. in Evanston, when we all noticed an orange disk hovering to the northwest.  At arms length it would have been about the size of a football, and it seemed to be only a few blocks away, perhaps over a large park from the look of it.  It simply hovered there for a long time.  Eventually, all of the children became afraid and everyone ran to there homes.  I&apos;m fuzzy on dates, but I remember it was late afternoon/early evening.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "A fast moving red orange light flew in a straight line for about 3 or 4 seconds, then dissapearedIt was around 5:00 pm in Vail, Colorado when I saw a bright red circular shaped light moving for about 4 seconds through the sky. I could recognize the exact shape since it was all light. The color was a red with just a little orange. I was with my brother the moment I saw it and rapidly told him to look, but the craft had already dissapeared. It moved at a speed which was never as slow as a plane, it was also moving at a faster speed than a jet. I could say its speed was around half the speed of a shooting star. It moved in a straight line from left to right (from my point of view). It didn&apos;t make any sound.", "Two low-flying triangular craft with three bright lightsOn Thursday, January 29th 2003, I was driving home in a rural part of my hometown. It was almost 10 o&rsquo;clock, and by that time of night, the roads in the northern part of Howell Township loose most of the pulsating traffic that defines them during the day. I was heading South on Brickyard Road, and as I came to the junction at State Highway 33 (business) I could see these bright lights (six of them, three on top of three) just above the overpass of State Highway 33 (bypass; I was just near where 33 splits into the bypass and the business routes) to the south of where I was. As I crossed through the light and under the bypass, I did not really think twice about the lights. Brickyard Road becomes Fairfield road through the light. I was continuing along that way, heading south, when I noticed up ahead, through the trees, the same six lights. They were now closer, obviously. Before, I had noticed that they were in sight just over the overpass, though much further in the distance then they were now. I realized how low the lights were. As I continued to drive south, it struck me that they were heading north, straight towards me. I stopped my car and got out to look on that cold night. Again, at first I thought it was one craft with two levels of three forward facing white lights. I soon realized instead that each &quot;level&quot; as I had described it, was actually one craft. I stood and watched as they came closer, seemingly right at me. I noticed, however, that the night was extremely quiet and clear, except for the occasional cold breeze. No sound, no jet engines, no chop-chop of a helicopter. I watched as the two craft turned west as they were almost over me, gained altitude and flew parallel to route 33. It isn&rsquo;t really like they flew. It was more like they drifted, slowly and quietly. From behind, I could barely see them. The light seemed to be directed mostly straight ahead of the two craft. I never got a very good look at the structure of the craft themselves.", "round, silver-colored, shiny, saucer-shaped object flew at a high rate of speed horizon to horizon - taking about 45 secondsOn Coast to Coast, I heard your request for sightings past.First of all, I am unsure of the date - I put in the above date as a guesstimate since it wouldn&apos;t let me submit w/o an exact date.  I do know it was early summer in the early 1950s.  I was approx 10 years old at the time.  I was outside on the front lawn of our home below the foothills in western Wenatchee, Washington.  My mother was doing yard work and both of my sisters (one younger/one older) were outside as well.  We looked up and saw a shiny, silver-colored saucer-shaped object zoom across the sky at a high speed, southeast to northwest. (It was CLEARLY visible.  It must have been fairly close or large - hard to estimate now.) I remember that we all stopped and watched it.  One of us asked my mother, &quot;What is that?&quot;  She responded, &quot;Oh, that must be one of those flying saucers we&apos;ve been hearing so much about.&quot;  A few seconds after the object disappeared over the horizon, a jet plane zoomed over in the same direction.  That&apos;s it.  It&apos;s a VERY clear memory for me and my sisters.  (Our mother passed in 1962.)((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "As we looked for the helicoptor that was raddling our windows, we saw the &quot;star&quot; that was seemingly being chased.My husband and I were sitting in our living room when we heard a helicoptor flying very low, so we jumped up to see if there was a search light, maybe it was a police helicoptor.  Then we saw what looked alot like a bright star moving rather quickly accross the sky, but it&apos;s motions were mechanical, not like a shooting star and there was no tail, and it did not aim down and the chopper seemed to be following it.  We ran out to the front and barely saw the chopper in the distance.", "Bright, Color Changing Fast ObjectAt approximately 4:00 AM Central Time, out of habit I looked outside at the courtyard and looked at the sky.  As I looked I saw in the clear night sky a stationary object that was changing colors from white to red to blue.  It was stationary but as I kept watching it, it got brighter as it got down in the atmosphere until it looked like a very very bright object changing colors in the western sky.  It was approximately 30,000-40,000 feet up in the sky (comparing to an airplane at that height in the daytime sky)and it would move quickly from left to right, up then down, then it would return to a stationary position.  I watched it for about 45 minutes then it began going up in the sky at a fast rate.  It would first go northward, then it would shift position and go west making a sharp 90 degree angle as it went up.  It was moving at a very fast speed and within about 10 minutes it went from the brightest light in the sky to a very dim light like a far away star.  I kept my eye on it as it moved away, then it disappeared.((NUFORC Note:  Possible &quot;twinkling&quot; star, perhaps Sirius.  PD))", "BLACK CIRCULAR DISCWe were looking up at the moon because we always do from time to time, and my boyfriend wanted me to see how nice it looked tonight, and as we are looking at it, a plane is flying past and a HUGE BLACK CIRCULAR OBJECT SHOT past the plane and the moon faster than a blink of an eye!!!!  I am absolutely amazed!  IT was definitely NOT an animal at all.  I don&apos;t know what it was but it was fascinating!  Please call me to let me know if ANYONE else saw it.  Thank you!

Late one afternoon I looked into the western sky and became aware of an aircraft that looked just like a glider - cigar shaped with long narrow wings, a vertical tail fin, ailerons, and a white blinking light at the bottom of it which was flying across the top of a western mountain range. Suddenly it quickly moved South over, and probably beyond Santa Barbara (about 45 mile South) in a matter of seconds. We all became intrigued as we watched it further. It turned East, looped around and began coming closer to the ground and heading straight for us. After a few seconds I remember watching this craft floating about 25 feet off the ground right between our house and the neighbors in a large subdivision. It was painted black - like the stealth craft of today. It was so close we could have thrown a stone at it, but it made no sound at all - it was completely defying gravity. It was also dark out by that time - which now doesn&apos;t make much sense. The sun doesn&apos;t set that fast from the time we first saw it. It seemed to know we were looking at it and picked us out. I looked up and saw a pilot who was dressed all in black and wearing a black helmet. There was an orangish-pinkish glow that seemed to come from the instrument gauges and was glinting off of his helmet and gloves. He looked over at us, then looked back down at his gauges, then turned to wave to us as the craft started to slowly move away gaining speed as it moved. I never discussed it with anyone in the family until recently. Nobody else in my family remembers this event except my little sister who was 8 at the time. I was 10. I remember more of us in the back yard though, so I&apos;m not sure why they don&apos;t remember.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))", "bright light falling from sky, southwest to northeast. descending at 90 degree angleAs I traveled north on highway 41 on the northern edge of the city, I noticed a bright light streaking downward, toward the ground. My first thought was a shooting star, but it was much larger. So large in fact, I waited for what I thought would be some type of impact or explosion. But there was none. The object fell from the sky at approximately a ninety degree angle. As the object raced toward the ground, I pointed it out to my passenger. When the event was over, I asked the person with me if they had seen what I had, just to make sure I had not seen a reflection or something similar. we both agreed it was something falling from the sky.

So I&apos;ll try again, just so that folks don&apos;t mistake what I saw (and still see occasionally) for a UFO as I did. There&apos;s an advertising blimp-shaped balloon that appears to be tethered to a tower in the Kearney/Elizabeth/Jersey City area (hard to pin point exactly where it is)that&apos;s visible for many miles around because it&apos;s floating very high--about the height of a 15-story building in an area with no large structures to obstruct the view. I first spotted it driving home with husband late one night, while traveling south on the NJ Turnpike in the area of Exit 18 and could still see it when we left at Exit 13. Had my eye on it the whole time because it really had me going. It hovers, of course, but sways and turns with the breeze giving the appearance of something shape-changing. Most odd is it&apos;s lighting, which appears to emanate from within the balloon, if that&apos;s possible, and gives off a very bright, eerie, blue/white glow. I travel that route fairly often but have never been able to spot it during the day. At night, however, when it&apos;s lit--which isn&apos;t often--it&apos;s quite startling to see.

PD))A silver disk with a bulge on one face, maybe 30 feet across, reflected sunlight and bobbed around at 3-5000 feet.We saw an airborne silvery disk-shaped object, maybe about 30 feet across, highly reflective, at about several thousand feet in the sky (just below some clouds in a clear blue sky, 80 degrees F., easterly breeze, I believe)  It appeared almost the size of the full moon to our relative view. It was very clear, razor sharp in our view. When it turned sideways it was very thin, and as it turned, it&apos;s &quot;bottom&quot; surface appeared shaded, and it&apos;s highly reflective upper surface showed a wide, low bulge nearly filling the diameter. It was definitely a disk, and definitely nearly flat on it&apos;s &quot;upper&quot; and &quot;lower&quot; surfaces. It was seen above McGregor and Summerlin Avenues, Fort Myers Florida, at about 2:30 PM, and we watched it for about a minute. It behaved like a balloon, drifting and turning, climbing and dipping, bobbing weightlessly, in a more or less easterly direction, for several hundred feet problably, and did not appear to be under &quot;control&quot; or &quot;doing&quot; anything. It was big. It was absolutely a disk. Our view of it was very clear, and it was definitely &quot;hardware,&quot; not a cloud, etc. It was not a round weather balloon or a party balloon. I was not alone. I did not notice any other motorists watching it, and traffic moved on, and we lost our view of it. Nearby air fields are: Paige Field, and SW Florida International Airport. This occurred in or near the landing path for some of the air traffic.((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with this witness on approximately six occasions, and we consider him to be an exceptionally well-qualified witness.

PD))UPGRADE TO PRIOR FORT MYERS FLORIDA REPORT - Peter D., Please see e-mail of todayThe object appeared to be of rigid construction, and did not flex or otherwise deform as it gyrated through pitch, roll, yaw, etc.. There was no visible &quot;weather balloon&quot; radiosonde package or parachute attached. It did not rise up to a higher altitude or disappear from sight. A subsequent lightly conducted search of internet sites selling professional weather balloons, and large advertising balloons (national and international) and other possibly related items, found nothing similar, so far. Actually, it appeared during this lightly conducted search that weather balloons might not even come in &quot;hard&quot; silver, or at least I have not yet found any. Weather balloons Do come with telemetry packages and parachutes which are strund below the balloon on longish cable. This object has none visible.", "Stationary Triangular Shaped Object with red lights on its edges.The only reason I reported this, because I was not sure if it was a craft, since it was dark, but the second I noticed someone posting very similar report and not very far away from here. Here is this person&apos;s quote &quot;Tirangular-shaped object hovered over New York State Thruway on September 27  I was driving home from a friend&apos;s house on the night of Saturday, September 27,2003. I took the N.Y.State Thruway home. I was traveling alone. Somewhere between the Catskill and Coxsackie exits I saw a triangular-shaped object approaching from the north-west. It moved very slowly and hovered over the lane I was in. It had 3 red lights along it&apos;s points that did not flash. As it moved over my car I looked up through my windshield and saw the body of the craft. It was a matte gray. My windows were closed so I could not discern if there was sound or not. A mile or two before this occured, I noticed a police car along along the left side of the Thruway. All traffic slowed down because of this. Once this object appeared, all cars accelerated to speeds of 80-85mph. I know others saw this and I want to find out if anyone else has reported a sighting on this night. I am a public school teacher in New York.&quot;  http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32150.html  While we were going home on a local road, I saw a stationary triangular object (black) over the trees. Interestingly this exactly matches the description of the person I quoted what I saw. It was triangular (perfect triangle), and had red lights along its points (did not blink). Thought it appeared black to me, probably because it was dark, however gray color that was reported would be close enough to my witness since it was daylight for the other person. I can bet 100% a gray object would appear black in the dark. Also this object did not make any sound.", "silver metallic wing less cigar rapidly moved north while presenting side on view and dissapeared.Bright sunlight.  Driving north on Brainard road, just before Mayfield.  Noticed a long, silver object to left center, about 50 degrees above horizon.  Stopped at traffic light.  Object had no wings or tail assembly.  it was 1/2 inch in length at arms length.  High reflectivity.  One dark spot midway on the body.  Object kept a constant side on view, rapidly receeded away to the north in less than 5 seconds and dissapeared.  It did not bank and turn, there was no vapor trail, I heard no sound.", "UFO? spoted chasing cattleLast year around October my girl friend and I were fighting petty bad. We had just got to her place and instead of swallowing my pride and haveing her take me back home, I decided to walk. My home was about 12 miles away, it was a dark over-cast night with the moon breaking out now and again. I knew the gravel road very well from my childhood days of walking to town to go to a friends house, so it wasn&apos;t a big deal. Anyways, about 3 miles out I came to this, not sure how to describe it, Double 90-degree corner in the road. As soon as I came around the first 90 I herd a rummble, turned to look and saw a soft white light. At first I thought nothing of it. I just assumed it was my girl friend giveing in and searching for me along the county road. I didnt feel like being found so I hopped over the Barb wired fence and into the Cattle pasture. I knew there to be cattle in the field but, being around cattle all my life, had&apos;nt gave it any thought. I stayed focused on the oncomeing light so I could try and tell what sort of head lights they were and so know if it was her. But the light dimmed. The rummble grew louder. I followed the sound and as it crossed a small stream in the pasture and saw a flash of light, as if the moon light had struck a smooth metalic surface of something flying not over 5 feet above the ground and only 30 yrds from me. It could&apos;nt have been doing over 10 mph which ruled out an Air plane. So I&apos;m thinking a Wisper, a common sight that the people of the area has seen often enough to give it a name. I get into the reason for the name in a second. Anyways, I watch the triangular object slowly fly away down the pasture when I notice the rummble still grows louder. So I turn just in time to see 50 head of cattle stampeding directly for me. Now if you have grown up around cattle you have seen cows run. I have chased cattle on a Four wheeler. They will run but it isnt like there in a big hurry to get anywhere. These cattle were running for their life. They ran strait for me, ! stoped, ran away from me, stoped turned and ran right through the fence. So naturally, I jumped the fence and got as far away from them as I could. Not a quarter of a mile on down the road I caught sight of the object again. This time it turned, gained some altitude and flew over me several times. The whole time fading in and out as the moon broke and the low cloud cover. The wind would pick up right as it would pass overhead and die as it went. It made a sound, not sure how to describe it other than radar....as if you could hear the sound a Bat emmitts to capture a bug. Another way would be to say it sounded like squeaky breaks on a car at the level of a whisper. It wasnt a plane...was flying to slow. Unless they have recently created a helicopter that could just barely seat one person but other wise incapable of lifting him off the ground due to its size and is almost totaly silent...it could&apos;nt have been a Helicopter. Could you maybe give me some info on what this could have been? I have played it over and again in my mind for a year now and I am stumped. Please feel free to contact me by email.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

As my mother looked at it suddenly faded out like a dimmer light. then suddenly it lit back up as if someone had turned the dimmer back on. It was about 2 inched above the treeline and not moving. I even saw a plane cross underneath. ( the blinking lights)It faded in and out and then started moving into trees. We went to another location by the house to see if we could see it better. The light seemed to have vanished. But then I looked up at a little star in the sky away from the first area and  that star got real bright just like the other one and dimmed out.The really strange thing happened the next morning,while passing the bathroom mirror I noticed a drop of a brown substance right on the tip of my nose. I tried to wash it off ( thinking I might have had a nose bleed) but it only came off after I scrubbed. Then sitting at the table I notice my left hand, the palm, was discolored with a brown substance,like self tanning lotion, rivlets running down my first finger.

It was South-west in the sky and about half again as high above the downtown buildings as the planes after they level off from Sky Harbor. In fact we watched several commercial liners and a helicopter fly in the approximate area of the sky only lower during this &quot;sighting&quot;.Basically it was caught our eye because it was so big and so bright-it grew dimmer very gradually till it just faded out from view about 10 minutes after I left the car to go into the store-on my way in-I showed a clerk to look up at it-and she tried to figure out what she was seeing as well.  There were no blinking lights, just one bright white light about 10 times brighter and larger than any typical star in the sjy-but there were no other stars in the sky at the this time. The light never appeared to move-just faded out. It seemed to just &quot;hang&quot; there.((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness intended a date in 2004, not 2003.

We wondered why an automobile would be in the middle of a field.  Shortly after spotting the lights, the lights rose straight up in the air.  Then the red lights went off and other colored lights came on.  The lights were blue, green, and white.  The craft moved slowly to the left and came out of the area of the field and moved toward the road where our car was.  At this point my father stopped the car and told me to lean out and see if it was making any noise.  The craft was at this point directly over our car.  I opened the car door and leaned out of the car and looked up and saw the craft was a triangular shape with rounded points.  It appeared to be grey and was moving so slowly over the car is was almost floating.  It made no noise what so ever and it was only approximately 30 feet above our car.  I closed the door and my father drove off I&apos;m sure from fear.

My friend Dave, and I, were sitting on a fruit shade...which is a sheet of corrigated tin on four wooden posts.  We were observeing a steady glow that was comeing from the interior of a nearby wooded area, when everything went completely quiet...no crickets..no breeze..no sound at all.  I noticed a deep red light...similar at first, to an aircraft light, moveing from right to left..in the sky ..in front of us.  I pointd it out to him.  He said...&quot;awww...thats just an airplane.&quot; I said..I don&apos;t think so.  Then he said your right!  It isn&apos;t an airlpane!  Its movement from right to left wasnt slow..or fast..but rather..somewhat..well..hypnotic.  Then..the red light changed into two small white lights...which grew larger..as they moved up ..and away from each other..in these elongated archs..as they were doing this..they were gettin LARGER..then pauseing in the air...two spheres of a very pure..white light...appearing to be ABOUT 3 1/2 to 4 feet in diameter...illuminateing the tree tops.  Dave said.&quot;I&apos;m gettin outta here!&quot;..I grabbed him by his shirt..and said..Wait! Look!  The two spheres of light then followed the identical archs..back dowm...getting smaller and smaller..and merged ..and turned back into the original red light...which then departed our field of vision..in the same manner as it had entered.  The two spheres of light at thier largest...looked to be about 40 or 50 yards away..and seemed to be about 5 yards apart. We then said to each other..no ones ever gonna believe this!  We described what we had seen to each other.  We both jumped down to the ground, and started walking tward the farm house.

That evening..(actually the next morning) at what seemed to be about 3 AM...I was sleepin in a fold out bed..(from a couch)..in the liveing room...when in my sleep..I became aware of the room..and from a certain area of the room an awareness ..or intelligence..which asked me if I wanted to know what was in the balls of light.  I immediately realized that I could not decieve this ..whatever it was..so I replied YES..I have been wondering about that. My reply was non-verbal. Then I was lookin down at my body still sleeping on the bed...and wondered how I could &quot;see&quot; if my eyes were in my body...I also wondered why I was not afraid.  Instantly..without physically turning around..I was &quot;looking&quot; at the wall opposite the foot of the bed..where &quot;I&quot; &quot;saw&quot; a sphere of very pure white light light ...that was about 3 3/4 feet in diameter..stationary by the wall.  I then moved across the room..and entered the ball of light. It was very bright inside ..with what seemed to be human souls...no identites..or genders...blending together..then briefly some would kinda &quot;spin off&quot; from the main brightness, then rejoin again.  Also I was saturated by a love that I had never experienced before...also I noticed there was a tim! eless element...like a hundred years could pass..seemingly..in seconds.  The love had a very secure...serene feeling about it. At this time the same &quot;voice&quot; that was initially in my room... asked if I wanted to stay...or return.  I thought that if I had said I wanted to stay..that my physical body would ...well...die. I figured my mom might be really upset by this...so I replied that I wanted to return...I left the ball of light...went back across the room..and re-entered my physical body.  I woke up &quot;all together&quot; again at about 12 noon....Sorry about the length of this report. I still don&apos;t understand how it seemed to be a UFO..or UAO thing AND a spiritual experience..in the SAME experience..I do know it was spiritual.

I had to turn my car around and follow it and it turned from one bright object into a triangular shaped form with three white lights on each corner of the triangle and a few blinking red lights on it.  I pulled my car over to the side of the road, as did a bunch of other people to try to get a better look.  I rolled my window down to see if I could hear anything, but it was completely silent.  If it was a plane or helicopter, it was close enough where I would have definitely heard something.  At this point it was much lower, probably 75-100 feet off the ground.  It hovered and moved slowly and I continued to watch it for another couple minutes until it disappeared behind the tree line and I lost sight of it.  Because of the lighting on the ground, I had a bit of a difficult time trying to decipher the dimensions, but I would have to guess that it was about 20 to 25 feet in length and about 10 feet in height.  It looked like it was black, but being dark, I&apos;m not completely sure.", "Saw huge object less than 500 feet from ground started to emerge from overcast of cloudsWe were smoking cigarettes on the back porch.  One of us stood up and we all noticed it and turned.  The sky is overcast.  It was enormous.  It made the entire block seem darker with its shadow.  No lights or colors to it.  Just a big black shadow.  It seemed to be hovering slowly down to earth and then it flew up so fast it practically dissapeared.  It had rounded edges but wasnt a saucer.  It seemed to change shape but some of us disagree and think that it was rotating.", "Please don`t think I am paranoic or lier.I just yesterday left report about UFO, and today strange thing happened again.

I was a student at Public School 54, an elementary school. At around lunch time I and hundreds of other students and some of the school faculty saw a silver-colored object shaped like a pyramid, about 100 feet up in the air above the school yard, spinning in its place in the same manner as the Earth spins on its axis. I&apos;d say the object was the size of a small school bus. There is no doubt that it was a solid object because the sun&apos;s rays reflected off its surface. I was standing next to the assistant principal, who made a comment about UFOs. This was the first time I heard the term ufo. A few minutes into my viewing, a helicopter appeared, which proceeded to fly around the spinning pyramid. Once again this was a solid object that was being &quot;investigated&quot; by a helicopter. The bell sounded signaling the end of the lunch period. I went back in. By the time school was out the object and the helicopter were gone. The school changed its name to CS 54, and was torned down by the mid 1970s. I have done extensive web searches for articles/news stories about this event but have come up empty. It is as if I was the only one to watch this phenomenon. But there were at least 50 eyewitnesses! The school&apos;s vice principal (middle aged then, now perhaps dead) also witness it, along with other staff members. I would like to provide his last name, if this web site&apos;s host will allow it. This needs to be followed up. There can not be an unconfirmed UFO report when there are scores of people who witness it! Other witnesses out there, come forward!((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We usually don&apos;t allow use of the names of witnesses, although any student at CS54 in 1970 probably would know the name of his/her principal.

It was not moving at all.  We tried to catch it by taking some back roads south, but as we got close, it moved away.  We went back to the highway and continued to Manchester.  The object stayed to our south the whole time, but sometimes was even with us, went ahead and even in back of us.  When we got to Epping area, a small flashing red light appeared to the right and another in front of us.  They would appear and reappear randomly.  At one point, the flashing reds changed their flash pattern and the bright white light to the south dimmed to almost nothing, changed to an orange color, changed to a flashing red itself, disappeared and then reappeared as bright as before,  We lost track of the flashing reds, but the bright white continued to dim and rebright and looked to be positioned over Massabesic Lake in Manchester, where we have seen ufos hover before.  We gave up the chase at this point, wishing we had a vidcam or binoculars with us. All three looked like they could have been stars, but they moved.

In the distance, above the horizon/buildings, a very bright white light appeared, the bright white light seemed to be rising very very slowly, or maybe it was moving forward north, towards my area.  This light looked like a really really big star, or a helicopter search light, or a car headlight in the sky.  I assumed it was a plane or helicopter at first, then it was apparent that it was travelling north.  as the object was above the small lake, i could now see the underside of the craft and I am positive that It was triangular in appearance, black/stealth in colour.  the lights that i remember seeing are red/greens, there might have been blue.  at this point, the craft had been travelling in a straight line, but after it had passed the lake and was almost straight above me, it veered left (east) and I am positive that a regular passenger plane would not act in this manner.  I chased the object a few blocks and the triangular nature was evident still.  the object was now hidden behind trees and i gave up the chase.", "This was more of an audible sighting instead of a visual. At approx. 3:00 in the morning, my backyard suddenly lit up with a brilliant bright, white light.  The light came from above the trees because the shadows looked like shadows at noon.  There was no wind to disturb any of the trees or shrubbery.  Above the trees were yellow and red strobing lights.  Accompaning the bright lights was a very high pitch warbling sound (think typical sci-fi sound effect).I pulled on some pants and ran outside with my dad but by this time the object had turned on what sounded like a jet engine and headed toward the east.  The warbling continued but the primary sound was one of a jet.With the departure of the object, everything returned to quiet.We have rarely spoken about this incident.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Sighting in Chelsea, triangular craft with very bright light in middle and smaller lights, no sound, very fast.Ok, how to start... It was 17:50, and it was in Chelsea, a small town of the Pontiac region, right beside the Ottawa region, on the other side of the Outaouais River, in Qu&eacute;bec. The precise location was above the clean separation of the &quot;Basses-Terres du Saint-Laurent&quot; and the &quot;Bouclier Canadien&quot; (I apologize, I don&apos;t know the english version of these geographical regions). I was on my way to work, it was my mother who was driving, when we noticed what we thought was an extremely bright star. We kept on discussing as we watched the star dissapate slowly and by then, we could clearly see three a triangular form. The best way to describe it would be, if you take a perfect triangle, and draw three lines from every corner of the triangle to the center, those three lines would define the shape of the object seen in the dark skies. When it shone brightly, we could see nothing out of the ordinary, it really looked like a simple bright star. But then, once the light had faded, not only could we clearly see the form, but we can notice a total of about 6 lights that stayed on the shape. One at every corner, and one in the middle of all three lines. I remember, we rolled down the window, and we could hear no sound emanating from the craft. Knowing that there are mountains near, we only had about 2 minutes to gaze at it until it flew out of sight, past the mountains. We were all amazed at that time, but then, when my mother and I came back from work, I was looking at the stars again, hoping to see my UFO once more, and then, one of the bright stars faded again, and the form could clearly be seen once again. I was simply amazed. This time though, the craft was flying in the opposite direction and was heading, well, seemed to be heading for Hull, a town next to Ottawa, on the other side of the River. I was flying lower than before and much faster, it was about 23:33. The 6 lights were also less visible and once the brightness had faded, it was very difficul to follow its trajectory. Our hypothesis wa! s that it was (and I must specify that this was my mother&apos;s idea) that maybe it was a plane that forgot to take off its &quot;brights&quot; as it took off. But after a short debate, and my explanation that planes do not have &quot;brights&quot; in front, like a car, she changed her opinion to mine, that is that it was a UFO. But I still think it could&apos;ve been a space shuttle. The line that was vertical could be the vertical wing on a space shuttle and the two other lines could be the wings, with the lights as any flying craft would have. And the brightness could&apos;ve came from the gigantic reservoirs of fuel that ignite and propulse the shuttle up into the atmosphere. The only thing wrong with this is that there are no space shuttle launching pad around, and not for miles and miles around. Also, the chance of seeing the same shape twice, and so low in the air would make out to be quite a waste of time and a very weird space shuttle trajectory. Might I also add that very few planes ever do fly above this town, and one last detail: the craft was not moving vertically nor was it very high in the sky, nor was it loud. Silent. Silent, and moving horizontally and extremely fast. I can only come to the exhaustive conclusion that it was and remains a UFO, that is and Unidentified Flying Object. Might I also add that it would not be the first time that there are sightings in this town. Personally, this is my second sighting here, and I know other people that have seen just as much.", "The object just hovered for a few minutes without making sound.  There was no movement in the trees and the silence was deafening.It was early September (date is approximate), and I was 15 at the time.  I had my bedroom shades down about 3/4 of the way, and the two windows in my room opened to meet the bottom of the shades.  We lived on the second floor of a two family house that was set back off the street about 100 yards and on a hill.  My bedroom was in the front of the house and the windows overlooked the front yard, driveway, and the street.  There was also a street light on the other side of the street.I was woken up around 2:30 in the morning because of a loud rustling in the trees.  When I opened my eyes, I noticed blinking red lights outside my window.  At first I thought it was a fire engine out on the street, but realized that I didn&apos;t hear the loud idleing engine that a fire engine has.  So, I got up out of bed to look out the window.  When I got to the window, I wasn&apos;t able to see the street, the street light, or the houses across the street.  I was met with a row of lights that were slowly blinking red then changing to white and red again, on the side of a gray object, that was level with the window.  I saw what seemed to be the bottom edge of the object, and it appeard to be oval.  The object just hovered there for a few minutes without making a sound.  There was no movement in the trees; and the silence was deafening.I backed away from the window, scared, and went back to my bed; never taking my eyes off the window.  When I was back in bed, I noticed that the lights were also visable in my other bedroom window which was on the same wall and approxiimately five or six feet right of the first window.  After a few minutes, the lights stopped, and I noticed the glow of the street light coming in the window again.  There was no noise of any kind when the lights stopped.I never went back to sleep that night, and as soon as it was light outside, I went out into the yard and street to look around.  Nothing seemed disturbed or out of place.  I asked my parents and neighbors if anyone heard or saw anything during the night, noone did.  I explained to my parents what I saw, and they brushed it off as just being a fire engine; but I know that it wasn&apos;t.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It appeared to be between 9 and 28 thousand feet.It moved very little from where I first saw it, and then appeared to stay in the same relative area. At times it would &quot;split up&quot; although the second light never moved very far from the initial one. It would then rejoin and then hover.

PD))", "At around 1 or 1:15 pm I was walking north along Spadina, just north of Queen Street, when I noticed a bright metallic object moving slowly from east to west. There was very little cloud cover and the sky was quite clear.There was a slight breeze, and cloud motion was generally from the north-east. I saw a jet plane pass quickly from north-west to south-east, leaving a con trail that passed through a wisp of cloud. The relatively slow speed of the object caught my attention. There was no exhaust and it&apos;s shape was round or globular - it was too small to be sure. There also appeared to be a very slight fluctuation in its brightness, as if it was rotating or wobbling. As I watched, it gradually slowed down until it was stationary. It remained in the clear sky for several minutes - I saw 3 other commercial jets fly by at different altitudes while I observed the object. It then began to drift very slowly to the west, and after a few minutes it stopping again. It was hard to determine size, but I think it appeared slightly smaller. Then it began slowly moving back towards the east, and over the next several minutes became a tiny bright dot. It was obviously rising as it was drifting. I began walking north, glancing upwards to see if it was still visible (it was), until I was nearly at Dundas. I was convinced that I had seen a UFO. No plane or helicopter could have that shape or behave in the way this object had. Nor could a balloon have hovered or changed direction as the object had. The first object was still faintly visible when I noticed a bright red spherical object, about the same size and altitude, drifting in the same east-to-west direction. The appearance of this new object did not fluctuate, and it moved slowly and steadily without slowing or stopping. It looked like a balloon, almost making me doubt what I had seen before. Then I saw a low-flying jet pass quickly beneath and to the west of the red sphere, following a curved path from north-west to south-west. It was too low for a commercial jet, and it had the swept-back wings and twin fuselage engines of a fighter. It was also perfectly silent, and its underside had no markings and was painted so as to be almost invisible against the sky. Since all this took place over Spadina, I had a clear view. However, buildings prevented me from seeing where the plane came from or where it went, and I soon lost sight of the red sphere also. I vowed to never again go out without my camera!", "A saucer-shaped UFO hovered at eye-level about fifty feet away for five minutes, then took off at great speed.I was attending boarding school run by Episcopalian (Anglican Catholic) nuns in Mendham, New Jersey.  It was situated on a large, rather remote piece of property.  My dorm room was on the top floor of the main building on the back side under the eaves. The building, itself, was on a hill, so that the back rooms were four floors above ground level.It was just after lights out and I was lying in bed with the windows open.  The room was tiny and the bed was about four feet from the windows, which came down to about two and a half feet above the floor.  I heard a sudden very, very low thrumming noise which appeared to be right over the roof.  It lasted for about three seconds and faded.  I had never heard a sound quite like it and wondered what it had been.  I decided to get up and have a look out the window.  I kneeled down and looked out and saw a saucer-shaped object hovering at my eye level over the tennis courts about fifty feet away.  UFO&apos;s were not really in my consciousness at that time, so I didn&apos;t comprehend what I was seeing at first. The craft seemed to be shaped like a round clam shell.  It had approximately four or five large colored lights (or lights that changed color - white, red, green) spaced around its rim and it appeared to be revolving slowly because I could see the  lights moving to the back and then reappearing around the other side.  I kept asking myself what on earth this thing was and then suddenly realized with horror that it was a UFO.  I was terrified.  I silently begged it over and over again not to land.  While I watched it, it slowly descended toward the ground.  It stopped and hovered about ten feet above the ground (I couldn&apos;t hear the thrumming noise from that distance), then it rose a few feet, it tilted a little one way, then tilted a little another way, then descended again, then rose again.  All of a sudden, without any prior warning movement, it took off from the hovering position at enormous speed and disappeared over the very far off horizon in about two to three seconds. It looked like a star as it disappeared. The horizon was many, many miles away (I was high up on the hill and could see a great distance).The next morning, I went to my Physics teacher and told her what I had seen.  She believed me but told me not to say anything to anyone because I would be labeled a nut, at best, and maybe thrown out of school at worst.  She then confided that she and her husband had recently seen something while they were driving at night, but she dared not tell anyone for fear of losing her job and she swore me to secrecy.My family all said I was hallucinating and I just decided that it must have been some military experimental aircraft that I would soon be seeing flying the skies.  But the years went on and I didn&apos;t see it manufactured.  Years later, I was sitting beside a top-level air force officer at a conference, told him what I had seen, and asked him why this experimental craft had never made it into production and use.  He looked at me and said, &quot;That wasn&apos;t a military prototype.  You saw a UFO. We see them all the time.  We have no idea what they are, but they are commonplace.&quot;  I have to say that it was a relief to have my experience authenticated like that.  Later on, I read accounts by other people who saw almost exactly what I saw and who described the same take-off speed of the craft.  I have since seen several other UFO&apos;s, the most recent in January in Georgia, which I reported on this site.  It was very different from the first one I saw.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

PD))Extremely bright lights in the sky flashing sequece of white, red, and greenAt about 2:20 - 3:00 a.m., I was loading wood into the fireplace.  This  requires me to sit on the floor.  From this position I am able to see up into the night sky without any effort.  Out of the corner of my eye I noticed an unusually bright light directly over the neighbors house.   (My neighbors house was brightly light up for the holiday season, so I found it partcularly strange that I could even see a star with so much light over there., but I sat down to read and forgot about it. About 4:00 a.m., a log I had loaded fell against the fireplace door and started leaking smoke into the house, so I got down on the floor to adjust the fire and once again the light caught my eye.    I remembered thinking &quot;That is a bright star.   I have lived here 13 years and never noticed a star there before, and is it that thing flashing&quot;.   So I grabbed a pair of binoculars and was astonished to see it was in deed flashing in a sequence of white, red, and green.   Its flashes were so definitive that they brightly light up the sky around them. I sat there on the floor in the dark and watched it for about 10 minutes and decided to call my husband at work and tell him about the weird thing that was over the neighbors house.   We joked about me signaling the aliens so if I disappeared he would know where I went and he told me to keep him posted.     After I hung up from talking to him I started looking around the sky to see if there was anything else &quot;strange&quot; out there I had never noticed before and I saw another similar object directly across the sky from the firsts one.    I am no good at distances, but I could say from one mountain top to the other. I once again called my husband and noticed at that time the first light was very much lower in the sky and much closer to my neighbors house.    That really interested me so I sat there and watched it move until it disappeared behind the mountain.  I then took my attention back to the other object and it had gone behind the grove of pine trees and was no longer visible to me. Well you better believe I have checked the same spot every night since.  The object was there again on New Years Eve at roughly the same times and pretty much experienced the same series of events.  Have been watching every night since, but it has been cloudy here at night, so haven&apos;t seen anything. There were lights on the object Not sure if you could consider the colored flashes reflecting off the sky an auora or haze? Thought I may have caught something that looked like a red flare type thing shooting out of the second object on the first night, but wasn&apos;t directly looking at it with the binoculars so didn&apos;t mention it, but when I read the question thought I better mention it.   Couldn&apos;t swear to it though it was just like a short red line for a second.Don&apos;t known exactly what I saw come out of it, just something flare like and red.Light flashed white red green Actually there was a plane that flew under the second object shortly before it disappeared.   We are sorrounded by hills and pine trees so it is difficult to say exactly where the plane came from.", "Huge, perfectly square, bright white object leaves with out the sound of a take off or splash.My father, brother, step mother, and myself were on a camping trip. We had taken a boat to the far side of the island that the city of Ketchikan is on. It is very remote out there except for a few forest service cabins, most of which are unocupied.In the evening around 5:30PM my father, step mother and I went to go collect the crab pots we had set earlier in the day.One of the crab pots was in a small bay, the beach went up from the water for about 30 yards and then turned into dense forest. We did not notice anything when we first entered the bay and stopped at the crab pot.After we started pulling up the crab pot me and my father both looked up at the same time, I am not sure why we did as we did not hear anything unusual and we were occupied with the crab pot at that time. What we saw when we looked up was very odd but did not scare us. We saw a large rectangular shaped thing sitting about 10 yards up on the beach. It was about 20ft high 20ft wide and 30 ft long. It had perfectly square corners. It was also more brightly white then anything I have ever seen. And as this was South East Alaska during the summer there was no chance it was snow, not that we ever get that much snow even in winter and never that close to the water.Im not sure why but we both went back to pulling up the crab pot. It took us about 45 seconds to finish pulling it up. When we looked back to the beach the object had gone, but we had not heard a take off or splach, and the object was much to large to have made its way in to the dense forest.My step mother claims to not have seen anything, but she also addmitted that she had not looked at the beach in the first place.", "Very large hovering object that appeared to be lighted from within as well as flashing lights on the outsideAbout 1900 on 01/04/2004 I observed a bright light behind my home in the sky I thought it was the moon. I realized that what I was seeing was in the northern sky. I looke east and saw the moon. I came in the house and got the binoculars and looked out of the kitchen window. What I was was extremely large. It was a gold-silver color. It was saucer shaped with a definite dome on the top. It was hovering in the sky. It had flashing lights at the top,bottom and on the left side. I went outside to get a better look. after looking through the binoculars for a few seconds, I ran back inside and got a video camera and telephone to call for others to come out and see the object. I was able to get the object on videotape. After a few minutes of watching the object, it began to move very slowly to the east where it went behind some trees and out of sight. I would say that the object was at least five miles from where we were located.", "The object was triangular, totally silent and observed for 20 min and moved slowly with red &amp; green lights and 1 white light.My son and I were at the Accord laundra-mat, just off US Hwy-209, in the appoximate evening of June 16, 1977.  It was warm and the night was very clear with lots of stars out.  We went outside to look at the constellations and spotted a very bright star which we thought was Venus as the last glow of the setting sun lit the horizon a bright but dark blue which made the &quot;star&quot; stand out.  As we watched, the star got brighter and bigger.  It was moving slowly towards us.  As it came closer, there was not a sound to be heard.  The shape was triangular and it was low enough we could see lights across the bottom in a V shape, red on one side and green on the other.  There were no flashing lights, all were steady and the bigh white light on the front of the V shape.  There were several other people at the laundra-mat as well as some residents across the street that witnessed the event.  We were all puzzled at what we were looking at.  The main item being that it did not make a sound but just sort of glided slowly across the sky.  It was traveling from west to east in a straight line.  Accord NY is about 30 or so miles from what was at that time Newburgh Air Force base.  The thought of it being a new military craft crossed my mind, but at that time we did not have anything &apos;known&apos; that would resemble the craft.

It was a gloomy day in southern Cal. with low clouds and drizzle when in the mid afternoon I heard strange sounding thunder and lighting. I went outside amd thats when I saw &quot;it&quot;! I can&apos;t be exactly sure on the amount because it happened over 10 years ago but I believe there were &quot;9&quot; ,I saw nine glowing balls of light in the clouds. They were all in a gemomectric pattern equally spaced apart from each other. When a type of thunder sounded off these objects would begin to grow and get brighter. They also produced this strange loud electrical  sound like a buzzing that would keep getting louder untill one ball kind of exploded. When this happened the ball that exploded sent a lazer like line of electricity at one of the other nine,that one would then do the same with perhaps one opposite it .This continued in a pin ball like fashion as all balls got hit with this lazer thing. Everytime one would recieve it&apos;s hit it grew in size and brightness.The balls fired the lazers so fast back and forth at each other it was hard to follow. When the thunder stopped or slowed so did light showthough it would start the next series of &quot;zaps&quot; 30 seconds or more later.They seemed to generate their own energy after the initial kick start from the clouds. These balls never moved and them being in the clouds I never saw any more then bright glowing round lights in the low clouds.I went inside our hotel and got my co-worker who was Chinese to see this for him self. On seeing the balls in the sky he ran back inside and tried to pull me in to. &quot;this is very bad you must get in&quot; I thought maybe he saw something like this in China so I asked him what it was but of course he had no idea.I have researched many UFO books and have well surfed the internet and have found only two sighting that were a bit similar though not the same.This was very hard to put on paper ,you must have been there to understand how strange yet powerfull it all seemed.

They then stopped decending and slowly got in a V formation. The Jet, which they appeared to be avoiding, was out of hearing range at that time. Then they started moving in a southerly direction. The Jet plane was going north. They flickered as they moved and turned to the East toward a large Black rain cloud. They quickly accelerated to a very high speed still in V formation. Estimated speed was about 450 MPH. They were unstable and took turns shooting up or down (90 deg.turns) and then returning to their position in the fast moving V formation. These dull metallic colored disks then disappeared into the dark rain cloud. No lights or sounds were noted. They were at approx. 4000 ft elevation and appeared to me to be about 4 to 6 ft. in diameter.

I am not sure if this was 1 aircraft or multiple, as I was unable to pick out a shape.  The noise faded out quicker than it appeared.  Total experience time was approximately 30 seconds. My initial thought was that it was one gigantic helicopter that I have never heard before.  My second thought was that it was a group of smaller helicopters very close together.  After thinking about it further, the sound made me change my mind and refer to it as &quot;experimental aircraft&quot; because the sound was incredibly unique, the direction of travel was inconsistant with the usual aircraft overhead, altitude was very low and speed was very high compared to usual aircraft overhead.

The only physical way that this could happen is that a feature inside the crater must at least crest the crater to be hit by the light.  I can&apos;t think of anything that high inside of a moon crater.  My humble conclusion is that it is generating its own light.  My regret is not having a powerful enough telescope to investigate it.

When we stepped off the bus, we saw a shining craft in the sky, an elongated cigar-shaped craft with no wings or contrail or anything. It was flying in strange way, going up and down like a sine wave or something, straight ahead the whole time but in an up-and-down way, like it was riding on waves or like when you skip a rock across a river or something. We could tell that it wasn&apos;t a regular airplane. Joel ran into his house to get his mom and her camera, but by the time they got back out there the craft had flown off past a bunch of trees and houses and we just weren&apos;t able to see it any more. We went in their house and called the local airport to see if they had any unusual airplanes in the area or something but the guy who answered said no, asked us where we seeing it from and acted nervous and hung up pretty quickly.

I followed it until it went over my sister in laws house and I couldnt see it anymore. I was about to go inside and then I saw 3 lights chasing it. These lights seemed extremely high and moving extremely fast. They looked like stars they were so high. They followed the shape changing objects exact path. The original object is hard to explain. I can only explain it as cloud like or gas like with a self emitting light? It seemed to change shape and color. It started low to the ground and rose slowly.

However there were multi-colored lights ringing the craft. We were all of the opinion that it was at a fairly low altitude and there was absolutely no noise emenating from the craft.  It was traveling from the Northeast to the Southwest at a rather slow speed and eventually it disappeared behind trees.

I got a good fifteen minutes of what I saw in the sky. What I saw in the sky were objects spaced apart from each other that looked like stars. Some were up high in the sky and others were moving by the horizon. Of course, where I live I could not see the moon and that made it better. Now these UFO&apos;s, when looking into the camera at them had a circular look to them and one was white another was blue, and the others were pulsating different colors. The white one was just white and it would move to the left and then to the right when my back was turned. It was a very extreme movement in the sky. The blue one was pulsating and it moved very slowly and again only when my back was turned.  Later on in the film I noticed some by the horizon and when I mean some I mean a few. At first I only saw two moving East, and these lights were very bright but faraway. When you look at them through the camera they were white like a ship or pulsating with multiple colors. I then saw one or two more by the horizon moving East. These were to my farther left but were moving East. They weren&apos;t moving fast, and the oddest thing about these UFO&apos;s is that they looked like very small planets but they also were white when zoomed in upon and looked like they had a black spot in the center of the UFO but to the far right of the center but not close enough to touch the end of the circular objects. I know it wasn&apos;t my camera because I saw this on all the bright UFO oblects that I saw. It almost seemed like an invasion! The reason why I say this is because this is the first time I have witnessed UFO&apos;s and I saw five to six of them in one night, and mind you these were perfect circles. These were awesome and I got fifteen minutes on tape. I hope I see more tomorrow night, and the funny thing was that after I saw these objects I still saw the first one when the others were gone and I filmed them all in order of how I saw them, and my Grandpa also! witnessed it but he believes it was satellites but these were bigger then satellites. My camera also stopped zooming in or out at times but I don&apos;t know if that had anything to do with the UFO&apos;s.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have been looking at stars or planets, but we will request a copy of the tape.

It was first seen by my younger brother (9 at the time) and his two friends from the house across the street. They started at it for about one minute before bringing it to our attention. By the time I was told about it and ran outside approximately two minutes had passed. I went outside thinking it was a joke my brother and his friends were trying to pull on me. But when I looked straight up I knew I was never going to see anything like this for the rest of my life. I called out for everyone in the house to come out and see. It was a circular shaped object with a very light triangle shaped ring around it. The bottom section of the sphere glowed to a bright orange like the color of the sun, and then it would dim down again. It continude to do this for the whole time we were looking at it. We all got a perfect view of it, the sky was perfectly clear and the object was only about 500 ft above us. It made no noise, and we were all in such aw that we made no noise either.

Sometimes the object would look black next to the brightness of the background sky and as it moved it would appear metalic. The object was silent and didn&apos;t appear to be moving from side to side although i think it was but very slowly indeed if at all it was. The most interesting thing was the other movements it made. The object seemed to be very slowly moving in a circular way as if piveted in the middle. It&apos;s hard to explain really, because of the shape sometimes it would appear like a rod but as it moved round you could only see one end of the rod so then it would appear small and circular. It wasn&apos;t changing shape but it seemed that way due to the smooth movements it was making. It seemed big ang close but as there was only sky around it was hard to determine the size and distance away from me. I live in a busy town so i&apos;m sure somebody must have seen it. The object then seemed to become very small very quickly but I still wouldn&apos;t say it changed shape but moved very high in the sky with undescribable speed giving the illusion that it had become smaller. When it was moving as if on a pivet it would move slowly in a circular movement but only for about 90 degrees then it would move back the opposite direction. It wasn&apos;t a balloon.

Other sightings here similiar to this have been reported several times in the past several years.  This time there was also a female witness besides me, and she too observed the same object, at the same time, as I did.  This is a TRUE story, and we were both surprised to say the least.  This object was really strange.  Anyway, I had been out for a dinner date with a friend, and was driving home when I just happened to look up out the front windshield of my automoble and saw a bright white light with something blinking on it.  At first, I thought it was probably an airplane or helicopter, because Bowling Green has a small airport located there.  Aircraft from our military bases at Fort Campbell and Fort Knox, Kentucky routinely refuel there.  But when I really looked at the object it remained stationary, and was not moving any at all.  The light was round, large, bright, and looked to be about the size of a large bus. A second large, bright, and round red &quot;strobing&quot; light was blinking on and off in the center of the object, and at times there also appeared to be smaller red lights in a row all along the outer edges of the object.  They too were blinking on and off, but not as rapidly as the center light.  The red light in the center seemed to be &quot;pulsating&quot; as it blinked on and off.  As I continued to observe the object, a female neighbor of mine drove up to park her car.  I asked her if she would take a look at what I was observing, and to tell me that I wasn&apos;t &quot;seeing&quot; things.  She did so and told me that she was seeing it too, and that it looked really weird.  We both continued to observe the strange object for close to thirty minutes.  This object, we both agreed, was truly something unusual, and not something conventional.  After more than forty minutes watching this craft, it slowly began to move sli! ghtly lower, but not landing.  We then went our separate ways because it was getting late.  This object appeared in the direction going toward Franklin, Kentucky/Portland Tennessee, leaving Bowling Green.  I have seen this thing before, and what it is I have no idea.  But it is strange and bizarre.  I do know that it is not a tower, star, airplane, helicopter, or satellite etc.  We both DID see this, and we are not making this story up.  Should this not be investigated?  Thank you for your time.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the report is of a sighting of the planet, Venus.

How he expects us to respond to his question is not clear to us.((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION, APPARENTLY FROM SAME WITNESS))I am writing back to you as a follow-up report on the object I reported to your center.  First, I do not believe that this object we saw was the planet Venus.  I should have provided more information to you, and I apologize for that.  Me, and many others have seen this object before the night reported above.  Some have reported it on your web site.  It sometimes appears as a huge fireball, and it does move and zig-zag about too.  Sometimes smaller objects can be clearly seen underneath the larger object flying back and fourth.  At times the red lights are clearly visable on the object, and one time we even observed the craft through binoculars, and it appeared  diamond shaped glowing purple.  This thing even flew directly over my automobile late one night years ago.  I am not making this story up or anything like that.  We have had several strange sightings of triangular objects in this area before too.

The object was at least the size of 10 houses with a tail of about 100-200 yards long. The ball passed behind a mountain range that was in the valley where I was located.

My wife &amp; kids were out of the car, I was gathering up our stuff. My wife suddenly yelled &quot;look up what&apos;s that in the sky?&quot; I walked over to where she was standing and saw 3 lights in a triangle formation moving rapidly overhead.

While they were making these seemingly impossible manuvers they also continued their forward motion until we couldn&apos;t see them anymore. They made no sound. The 4 of us were stunned and we had an eerie feeling I can&apos;t explain. My wife said when she first saw them they were lower (or larger). She thought they were planes that were going to crash. The way she describes them they seem about the size of a 1 inch finger space held at arms length. By the time my sons and I looked they were about a quarter that size. So they appeared to be moving away as well. We seem to differ a little on the color. I &amp; one son thought they were silver grey. My wife &amp; my other son thought they were slighty yellow then became silvery. The sky overhead was pretty clear.

I saw what appeared to be an extremely bright object traversing the sky in a north to south direction. I thought at first it was an extremely low satellite as it had no flashing lights whatsoever, just a continuous bright light like a streetlight again at about 100 yards or so. But it was so bright I wasn&apos;t really sure what it was. There was no noticeable noise. All of a sudden after watching for about 8-10 seconds, the object seemed to stop about halfway across the open sky, and either slowly went out - just like turning off a TV that is heated up - the light/picture goes very rapidly smaller, or it just took off at an extreme speed in the opposite direction.

I pulled off onto a side road and turned the vehicle off and rolled down my window. at this time and for the duration of the sighting no sound was apparent. I watched for about a minute. I looked around to see if there were any more and did not see any. When I looked back the second object had reappeared. I observed both objects hovering for about five more minutes. Suddenly the first object dissapeared followed a couple of seconds later by the second. I waited for about five more minutes and they did not reappear. They seemed to be hovering like fireflys as best as I can describe it. They would go slowly up and down and side to side in no set pattern. I did not observe any sudden movements or anything else. I live in NW Pennsylvania in a very rural area about a mile south of lake erie. I did a little research and found similar objects being seen in this area before. I am about 30 miles east of the Perry Nuclear power plant and objects of this or similar nature have been observed there since the 80&apos;s. On a side note, about a week ago I saw what appeared to me to be one of those small airplanes they were using in Iraq. The un piloted white ones. I only caught a glimpse of it but what I did notice was that it was white with no visable markings. It was also flying very low in an area about a half mile from the 2 objects I saw today.", "the same thing happened to me in green township/ERIE PA in june of 1979 was babysitting for my moms friend. was awake and next thing i know the state police bloodhounds my parents the people i was babysitting for.... had a manhunt out for me....i found myself across the street at the neighbors,i awoke to unfamiliar surroundings, but i couldn&apos;t get out EVERY DOOR WAS LOCKED!!!

The family has a very good view of the city of Calgary. One evening the family watched a craft over top of Calgary back in 2001. They reported observing an object for approximately two hours. The lady told me the family got a new telescope for Christmas and this evening in February was the first time they really tried it out. It was cold outside so they set the telescope up indoors and viewed the skies from the comfort of their home looking through one of their large living room windows. The lights were turned off as they did not want to have their view obscured. The family noticed a bright object high in the sky and first thought it may have been the planet Venus. So they turned the telescope slightly to have a peek at it. (At this point I should tell you that the weather conditions were good and the skies clear and the temperature down to about minus 29). As they lined up the telescope using the view finder and then looked through the scope they were surprised to see an object which was shrouded in clouds. There were no other clouds visible in the sky that they noticed. The object that was witnessed had an elliptical shape to it. One end of it was poking out of the cloud cover and they were surprised to see windows on the craft. She said she could clearly see through the telescope that the object had windows which ran down along its side. The lady said it looked as if whatever this was, was trying to impersonate a star. The object would move around the sky very slowly and if anyone on the ground would have seen it, they may have just thought it to be a star or planet. She said it was very high up in altitude. After taking roughly a five minute break from looking through their telescope she came back and now viewed two bright objects. One was stationary over top of the other and offset by half the length of one of the crafts. Both objects still wrapped in a cloud cover and she saw a long tube which was connecting the two objects at roughly a forty five degree angle. The woman said it was a beautiful, cylindrical shaped tube wrapped in cloud. Also it was reported that the cloud cover stuck very close to the shape of the objects and not spread out across the sky. It was the bottom object, or the end which was sticking out of the cloud cover that she could see had windows, which were the same shape of the objects or roundish. When the objects moved directly overhead of Calgary all of the electricity went out. When the objects moved to the outskirts of the city the power came back on and eventually the crafts moved out of sight. The lady said it was a very exciting night and one they would never forget.

The sky in Portland was clear and dry except for the jet trails overhead which had obscured parts of the clear blue with some agglomerating cloud cover. I hardly go anywhere without a digital camera these days. I snapped lots of sky pictures as aircraft trails intrigue me, especially on a rare otherwise clear day. Several pictures were quite interesting. The one attached here had a plane approaching passing to my right which I remember seeing, and a green spot, possibly a lens flare, which I don&apos;t remember seeing. So I decided to look a bit closer at it to discover what may have caused the green spot. Also, this picture is under exposed to highlight the sky details, a trick I learned a while back. The clouded parts of the sky on that day had some weird shaped circular or oval tracers cut into them, some quite clear which I have other pictures of from 2-20-2004. This intrigued me further to see what I could learn about the green spot. After all, it&apos;s not every day you are dealt a green spot in a photo (or maybe it is, you decide). I made a copy of it (-2) and cropped out an area, because in the original image I thought I saw what could be a circular or oval tracer near the green spot. I then solarized a copy (-3) and you can plainly see the green spot (now turned magenta) appears to be leaving some kind of trail &quot;behind&quot; itself, coming off of a circular tracer. If you look closer, it appears there may be even more objects and circular tracers. Maybe, maybe not. They may just be artifacts of the enhancement program. There appear to be in close proximity two other similar, or the same, objects flanking the circular tracer. Of course, that is my guess, and they may just be spots in the clouds. Or maybe not. The green spot is making me think &quot;adolescent showing off to its buddies&quot; for some reason. I mean, what with impending springtime and all. The spot in the upper left is the sun illuminated cloud cover. Just thought I would brighten your day a wee bit. I am a novice at this and don&apos;t know how to get more out of this photo.

Weird and wonderful.", "V shaped tubular object .I have been involved with amatuer astronomy for 40 years, and am a member of the Association of Lunar and Planetary Observers. Having observed the sky for that length of time, I am fully aware of those objects and natural phenomenon that are often misreported as UFOs by observers who are unfamiliar with the sky...ie objects such as Venus, Iridium flares, sundogs, balloons, meteors etc.On several occasions over those 40 years I have observed objects in the sky that I could not identify. A few years back, while observing the First Quarter moon in a 90mm refractor, I noticed a tiny object subtending about 5 arc sec transit the moon from E to W in about 30 seconds. The object was dark and well defined as oval shaped. As the object moved it was clearly seen to be changing shape slightly. My guess is that the object was probably a high altitude research balloon that was partially deflated, being pushed along by the jetstream. I mention this observation to illustrate that I am not the type of observer that is quick to label any unknown object a &quot;UFO&quot;.However, there is one observation that I made on May 17 of 1988 from my backyard on Chicago&apos;s NW side, that I would definately classify as a &quot;UFO&quot;. At the time I was scanning the western sky with 10x50 binoculars, attempting to locate the planet Mercury, in preparation to an observing run using my 8 inch Newtonian. While scanning in the lower Western sky, a small dark boomerang shaped object came into the field of view of the binocs. The arms of the V were inverted toward the horizon and the object was seen to yaw slightly. I immediately thought the object was a kite that some kid a few blocks away was flying, and didn&apos;t pay any attention to it, and continued scanning for the illusive planet. After a few minutes I located the planet, and prepared to swing the telescope toward it when I noticed that the &quot;kite&quot; had moved to a considerably higher elevation above the western horizon, and could in fact be clearly seen to be moving without optical aid. The V shape was still clearly visable in the binoculars, but not with naked eye. At this time I became curious about what the object could be, so I and went indoors to retreive a 60mm altazimuth refractor, since the 8 inch equatorial Newtonian would be to clumsy and difficult to use for tracking a moving object. I was able to aquire the object in the field of the scope at 28x and 78x. Let me just say that it wasn&apos;t a kite or any object I have ever seen or can explain. It had a tubular cross section almost worm-like in appearance. It was an odd flat blackish color that I can only describe as ash-like. I could also percieve faint reddish linaments encircling the body like the segmented sections of a worms body. The object filled about 1/4th of the field of view of the telescope eyepiece at 78x or an actual angular size of about 8.5 minutes of arc. The object continued climbing to a higher elevation until it passed overhead in a southeastern direction. While the object was climbing in the sky it passed about 1 1/2 degrees above the planet Venus, which was hig! h in the west. I lost sight of the object in the darkening dusk sky after about 15 minutes of observation. When last seen it was still headed in a SE direction about 25 degrees from zenith. When the object was overhead it took about 2 1/2 seconds to cross the 78x field of view of the stationary telescope, or a rate of movement for the object of about 14 minutes of arc per second.In addition to myself, my son and sister in law witnessed the object.I am probably going out on a limb even mentioning this observation, as I realize the subject of &quot;UFOs&quot; leaves one open to ridicule because of the fair number of wackos that get all the attention in the media. Hence credible witnesses to unexplained phenomenon tend to keep it to themselves. According to the debunkers ,few amatuer astonomers report UFO&apos;s because they know what they are seeing. This may be true. Most UFO reports are explainable as known objects that are misidentified by inexperienced observers. By definition this is not a ufo but an identifiable object.The small number of really baffling cases are often times reported by trained observers. These are the cases that should be scientifically investigated, rather than merely lumped in with &quot;Cosmic Nonsence&quot; by the debunkers. Amatuer astronomers DO see UFO,s, and I know I am not alone in this.", "We were taking pictures of the moon as there was a large white circle around it, and we tried to get that on film.

We do not know who to inform about this.I will not send the picture at the present time until I hear from someone that it is important.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the &quot;circle&quot; may have been an ice ring around the Moon, but that is only a guess.  PD))", "Green light falling in distanceI was travelling northbound on In-5 (Indiana Highway 5) just entering the small town of Majenica, Indiana.  (I know this because right after the sighting, the car a little ways in front of me applied its brakes;  I thought they had seen it too, but it is more likely that they were slowing down to the 45 mph speed limit outside the town).  What I saw was a light green light fall from the sky in the north, slightly to the east.  At first I thought it must be a shooting/falling star, but it left no trail behind, like the shooting/falling stars that I have seen.  It also looked nothing like any aircraft I have seen in the night sky, and I have seen many and pocess a decent knowledge of aeronatics. It fell from approximately 75 degrees above the horizon to 55 degrees above the horizon, and then it disappeared just as it appeared.  I must note that either the object fell, or it flew across the sky, following the earths contour, much like a sattelite.  It looked almost as if it could be falling (if in fact it were) toward the Huntington Resoviour, which is located 5-10 miles north and slightly east of where I was when I had the sighting.  There is also an airport located right beside this resoviour, but I have never seen a beacon from the (or any other) airport that looked like this, nor as I have stated, an airplane.When we visited the park by the dam that holds back the resivour 5 to 10 minutes later there were several flocks of geese (50 total geese perhaps)  in the run off (spillway) of the dam.  They seemed to be nervous and more vocal then normal.  Not only did it seem slightly odd to see geese in the middle of the Indiana winter, but also I have visited this park at least once a month for the past 6 months and have never seen geese there before.  My mind and imagination could have been running away with me on this issue of the geese, but I thought I would mention it.Besides the other witness who was with me, 2 other people witnessed something in the sky around Huntington, Indiana earlier that night.  One of them is a pilot.  Although I know all of the witnesses well, we decieded that we would not talk about our sightings until we reported them properly.  Hopefully they will post on here as well.This is my first reported sighting, although I may have had a sighting in grade school.  i do have an interest in the unexplained, although my strongly held religous views make this sighting disturbing.", "rolling, changing color &amp; shape,silent,blueskyI was parked in my car on a side street waiting to go to work, the sky was very clear &amp; blue. there was no motion on this street at the time. I look at the sky alot .. I looked up &amp; to my left &amp; noticed what appeared to be a crumpled piece of white paper moving along at a moderate( and steady) speed heading almost directly away from me. it held my intrest. as this thing moved away I noticed it was going at a steady speed and in a directly strait line, I then noticed there was NO wind at all so my flying garbage theory was shot. when I first saw it it was bright white&amp; about the size of a big crumpled newspaper @ 40FT. as it moved away I saw that it was becoming more of a metalic shiny color. this is when I noticed it seemed to be... (no, it WAS)  CHANGING SHAPE. it was a multi sided object the shape is nothing i can discribe.. it had corners &amp; flat spots &amp; appeared to be rolling forward.  the course it took was straight &amp; methodical. as it got farther away it looked very shiny &amp; metalic it continued to &quot;roll&quot; forward untill it was out of sight. there was no one else around to witness it, &amp; it was completley silent. sure wish I&apos;d had my camera. I am interested to know if anyone else has seen similar.", "Date:  July 2001 Time:  3:00 a.m. Number of witnesses: 3 Number of objects: 1 Shape of objects: light  Full Description of event/sighting: We were walking along and noticed a spotlight around 40-50m up in the air, no sound just a light. Watched this for half a minute or so until it took off high and southward. It still creeps me out and I finally get to tell it to someone. This was before the new skytrain line was finished being built. Additional Information Below:  About 50m from the street hovering over the ravine where the skytrain tracks were being built. The light itself was 2-3 meters long and acted more like a spotlight but seemed to be a clear object behind the light. It headed on an angle up and southward incredibly fast once we got close to it. One witness lives just a few blocks away and I haven&apos;t heard from him in a couple days. The girl he was with who also witnessed this light I haven&apos;t seen since last year and the number I tried of hers didn&apos;t work. This would seem to me a small unmanned craft observing us or recording construction/infrastructure information as it happens.

The area where the sighting took place has been a very active location for numerous sightings over 2002 and 2003. The farm I visited today (February 4, 2003) sits high above the Bulkley Valley and these folks and their neighbors have a terrific view of all the surroundings. A witness called me on the morning of February 4, 2004 to report that she and her husband both saw something that didn&apos;t look right. The woman gets up early to get her husband and children ready for the day&apos;s work and school. As she made her way through her home at 7:06 a.m. she walked by the kitchen sink, stopped, backed up and gave a call out for her husband to come and have a look at what she was watching. Both stood inside their home looking out the window at a moon sized object. It&apos;s color was very bright, (a good example would be if you were sitting looking into a camp fire watching the bright colored flames shooting up). This object was &quot;bright&quot;! The witness only could guess as to the shape of it, but thought it was circular. She reported to me the top of the object was domed shaped for sure. (also what is very important in this story is that it was completely dark outside, the sun had not started to rise). The farm the family owns is very large, and there is a great deal of pasture. From the kitchen where they observed the object, there is a clump of poplar and spruce trees. Then behind that is another opening of pasture area, then another row or clump of trees. In-between these rows of trees, is where the object was seen moving about. Not in an erratic fashion at all, it just dropped down slowly and &quot;stopped&quot;!  Since the orange glowing object was staying stationary at the time, the lady grabbed her video camera and started to shoot some film from the kitchen window. Because what she and her husband were watching was certainly strange looking, she thought about making a move to the outside onto the patio. She ran quickly to the front door, opened it and went outside with video camera in hand. When she looked over to the area where the object was sitting, or had been ....it had vanished. The woman ran back inside to the kitchen window again, and there it was, sitting stationary and shining very brightly. So she shot a little more footage until it just blinked out. After I took the call about the sighting, I asked was she going to be at home for a while, and if so, I would like to come out to have a look around. I also wanted to take a look at the footage and do the report of the sighting. The witness said it would be fine if I wanted to come up to their home right away, so I grabbed my keys and headed out. I was greeted by the witnesses when I arrived and she explained exactly what they saw, showed me where the object was located and where she was standing when filming. The lady then showed me into the kitchen and told me that this is where she first noticed it. She then took me outside and pointed to where the object was when she tried to capture it on film. I said you are kidding, because it would not have mattered from either location the lady was filming from, the object should have been visible. With winter here the popular trees had already dropped their leaves months ago. There were not many spruce trees in the area to block out such a large object. Why the witness could not see it when she went outdoors is a mystery to me, there was nothing to block out this large orange glowing object. I could see clearly through the first set of trees to the second row. So why the light disappeared has me baffled. We went back into the house so she could let me view the footage she shot. What I viewed was a totally blackened area, there was no light from an approaching sunrise. The object as the witness described to me was sitting exactly where she told me it was. It was a brilliant orange light and extremely large in size. Something else I found interesting was one of the larger popular trees which was in front of the light, (closest to their home and at the edge of the open field) there is what looks like a string of lights which is running down the tree. When I first looked at this part in the footage it reminded me as if one was looking at a set of Christmas lights running from the top branches downward to about half the length of the tree. The lights also spread out over a few of the larger branches as well. These streamers of light were also very bright. I eventually left the witnesses home and drove up the road to look around away from the site where the object had been seen. But from the vantage point I was at now, I was able to look over all the fields and the valley below. I did not see anything out of the norm. I also drove back down the road and stopped at the side of the road and looked around the area where the large object was spotted, again I saw no signs of any kind of disturbance in the snow or around and on any of the trees. So what the husband and wife witnessed is an unknown for now. I was also given a copy of the tape to have it looked at.

I turned  and watched them for a couple of minutes.  They were a group of 6 or so orange/ amber colored lights moving in a south westerly direction. Immediately following the orange lights, were two smaller red lights that moved in odd directtions. I also saw at least two military aircraft chasing the objects. I could recognize the red and green lights that are common on planes.  I could see no other lights on the group of orange lights, or the two smaller red lights. I watched  the lighs until the went beyond my means of viewing.

The witnesses are to shy to call you about this but I know that they are very credible people from the region. They actually called one another and witnessed the same thing simultaneously .

It appears every night at the same time (around 7 pm) in the eastern sky, then moves into the western sky (around 8 pm) and leaves at the same time (around 10 pm). I noticed the first one in the sky in the year 2000, it appeared to be shooting red beams of light straight out from it, at times.

I was facing my boyfriend laying in his arms in the front seat when he grabed my arms and just turned my body around in the car and said quietly to me, look over there. My heart raced when in the field through some small little trees we saw this very round and shiny object like surgical steel  in a circle shape but had a flat bottom and top. We all got out of the car so scared as we were young,we thought no one would believe us. We stood there watching this object glowing for as long as 10 mins.and then watched how it took off. It used a hugh beam of light to push itself up off of the ground by the light comming down and moving the craft up and then it would shoot another beam of light down to push itself up again higher and higher until it had gotten high enough to start the lights around the indented center to glow around it and then we watched this ufo jolt faster than we could keep our eyes on it with no noise whatsoever. We were so shocked or in shock at what we all we had observed that we all decided it was not the place to be. We do however have what they called the Nike Site which is a Government Base which was around 1 1/2 miles away from that field. That field was owned by some people in Providence who let the pigs live there in old buses and live off the land and they used them for pig roasts. We never reported this but I told my brother whom was in the Air Force and he told me we should have reported it. At that time I guess they were looking into ufo&apos;s at that time. He flew so he didn&apos;t take what I had told him lightly. However shortly after telling my mom and  my brother my mom saw an object one night hovering over our neighbors hugh front yard, they had cows and farm animals and lots of land.She told me the nest day about it because as she watched it she said for a half hour or more, wh! ich she said seemed like hours, she said she was frozen stiff and couldn&apos;t move. She told her friend and her friend showed her the Pawtuxet Valley Times front page which showed a news article or picture about the night before. My mom is not alive now or I would ask her but she told her friend that she thought she had lost her mind and or was dreaming while standing up looking through our bathroom window that night. She didn&apos;t report it as she thought everyone would think she was nuts. Back then in those small towns which aren&apos;t small any more, no one believed you unless it was gossip. But to this day I still remember it so well as it was so fascinating and I know what my friends and I saw and we often talk about it. But there is only 3 of us left. I only wish I could see one now. I would have the guts to go back the next day or maybe while it was still there and try and find out all I could about it. We had no idea how long it had been there before us because we parked there before it was dark and when that craft started to leave and push it self up with the beam of light from underneath it was dark, so it lit all the field up. We could see the buses that sat a few 100 feet away in the back of the field. The light from underneath also started to come out form under the craft as a hugh circle of light and then as it ascended upward it sort of came down like a cone shape of light. Like a flash light would do if you started with the flashlight beam face down on the floor.  Well I could talk forever on this subject but enough is enough. But if anyone in Coventry wants to talk online with me just put something on the web here if you can or put a small ad in the Reminder and I&apos;d love to talk to you on the web.

I pointed it out to my friend in the back seat.  We started to discuss what it could be.  The driver suggested 2 cruise missles of some sort.  The lights appeared to be hovering up and down and a steady rate going the opposite way down on the north bound highway.  Almost as if observing us in vehicles, poosible taking scans of some sort. As we got closer we noticed the lights were comeing from 2 ufo&apos;s going south in the north bound lane.  There was other traffic on the highway at the time, so im sure there were other witnesses other then ourselves.  Even the car infront of us stop abruplty.  I also noticed a semi truck pulled over to the left side of the highway going northbound.

When we noticed a 3rd craft going east passing over the highway.  This vessicle was triangle shaped, dark green with red and yellow tubing that was intergrated into the bottom of the vesslicle.  Possibly some type of piping with fuel being fed to the engines. This triangle shaped ship was moving a bit faster and was noiser then the other 2 seen previously.

On the date/time above, we were on our front porch, enjoying the relatively warm (for this time of year)air. Our porch faces west-northwest and we have a fairly unobstucted view in that direction, free of light pollution. My wife noticed the 1st set of lights coming in from due west. I left the porch and went out into our front yard. Through the bare branches of the trees I could see several sets of very bright lights, heading roughly from west to east. The sky was very clear that night. The lights were primarily bright red, with smaller white lights interspersed. As we both loolked around, we noticed aproximately 12-15 of these aircraft, moving in level flight, all roughly in the same direction. They were not huddled together in a close formation, but I got the distinct impression that they were traveling together. 2 of the craft came directly over our house/property. I would estimate that they were aproximately 2-3 thousand feet up, much lower than the commercial (and military)aircraft that we are used to seeing. They were moving quickly, but I was able to discern an aircraft shape and the speed was in line with that of a jet. No sudden movements were seen. What was striking, however, was the almost complete lack of sound. I strained to hear anything and was able finally to catch a very soft jet engine sound. As a comparison, several nights later, I was out walking our dog and heard a jet sound. I discovered the source of this sound at a height that was at least 3 times that of the craft that I am reporting. While this may not sound especially remarkable, the lack of noise, combined with the odd and very bright light pattern was very disconcerting. However, that isn&apos;t the end of the story. As we were observing the numerous craft coming in from the west, but prior to their overflight of our house, my wife suddenly noticed (and drew my attention to)what we took to be a meteor at a very low altitude. It also came in from the west, but at treetop level. Coming across our road, it bifurcated. It was intensely burning and the 2nd piece continued on along my southern property line, appearing to descend thru the trees. It very well may have landed in my back woods, which extend for about 2 acres before coming to an interstate highway. In any event, the &apos;meteor&apos; was very, very close and very, very bright.

The sky was crystal clear.  I was 14 years of age and my friend was 17.  Looking up into the sky above Beach Blvd was West, slightly North.  I was an astronomy buff, and looked up immediately into the unusually clear night; there were only a few streetlights contributing to light pollution every few blocks,  Beach Blvd was much higher than the shoreline in places.I immediately noticed that there was an extra &quot;star&quot; in the constellation Pleiades, slightly brighter than its very dim stars.  As we walked back and forth between the sand bars, going steadily toward town, past it,  and then back to Washington St., this extra star got brighter and brighter, gradually becoming a 4th, 3rd, 2nd, then 1st, 0+ magnitude &quot;star&quot;. On our return to Washington Street, we stopped at the railroad bridge, at approximately 2:00 AM (I looked at my watch repeatedly) July 3rd and this &quot;star&quot; was then as bright as a 200 watt light bulb. 200 W bulbs existed then, and I was often in a building owned by my family that used them.  It then began dripping what appeared to be a silvery liquid metal, like a foundry pouring molten lead.The &quot;star&quot; took off over Henderson Point i e to the NorthEast, at extremely high speed, completely silent, leaving 2 red-orange glowing trails in the sky , which remained visible for over 30 minutes.  I estimate the speed at thousands of miles per hour.  I have no idea of the altitude, as I thought initially thought it a star, but it was obviously in the atmosphere.  I never felt fear of any kind, although my companion was very scared.  There was no missing time or any strange after effects.Because of the the length of this event, I remember it vividly, over 50 years later.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

While the reconstruction of a UFO sighting that occurred two years ago poses obvious problems for the investigator, it should be noted that the witness made a written account of the incident within days of the its occurrence. The information contained in this report corroborates remarkably well with the account of two years ago.Mr.((name deleted)) web site is: http://rockc.tripod.com. Subsequent to our first meeting, Mr. Rock accompanied me to the Westminster campus where we reviewed the sighting on location and made measurements to establish the distance to the UFO from the witness when first and last seen during the course of the sighting.There are ample points of geographic reference on the campus to establish, with a high degree of confidence, thedistance to the object; however, the estimation of the apperent size of the object is made with leddcertainty. The narrative that follows reflects calculations of size and distance based on these measurements that, while stated in exact figures, should be regarded as the best approximations obtainable without the aid of special equipment. At 4:00AM on the morning of September 15 1998, Mr. Rock was working at Westminster College located at 1840 South, 1300 East, in Salt Lake City. He had stepped outside to throw away trash and sip some coffee. The witness stated that the night was cool, around 65 degrees; visibility was clear without any clouds.While facing west, sipping coffee, he fired his laser pointer, which is used at work to identify areas that require cleaning, into the sky in the general direction of Jupiter+. Within a minute or two of firing the laser, a gray, spherical object, calculated to be 70 feet in diameter*, appeared, in the western sky, hovering over an adjacent building at a distance of 260 feet from the witness at an altitude of 40 feet above the ground. The appearance of the object was sudden and was not preceded by movement from some other location.It simply appeared. Upon seeing the object, the witness turned off the laser pointer.Mr.Rock stated that at that moment he was quite awed by what he was seeing and doesn&apos;t recall feeling or thinking much in the ensuing moment. The object sat completely motionless for 2 to 3 seconds then moved north toward the witness at a speed estimated to be 60 mph**. Witness stated that the object had no apparent period of acceleration; i.e. the object was motionless one instant and then moving at 60 mph the next, without any incremental increase in speed. He watched the object pass over him, headong northeast when lost from view as the object passed behind a building. The moment before the sphere moved out of view was when it was in closest proximity to the witness: 60 feet away at an altitude of 40 feet, with a calculated diameter of 58 feet*.During these last few moments, the witness observed the underside of the sphere, which he described as &quot;Reddish, pinkish with pits and pings and very much crater-like&quot;.  He added that, apart from the bottom, the object was smooth,gray and featureless.  Witness also said he felt as if the object was aware of him. As the object passed over the witness it went behind some trees and continued east behind a building.  The witness pursued the object on foot but before he could clear the tree cover he heard a bang and when he came into a clearing the object was nowhere to be seen.Witness stated that he then returned to work and was very excited but was not able to relate the story to any of his co-workers because he doesn&apos;t speak much Spanish and they do not speak English. Witness said that he was not able to sleep more than a couple of hours during the next two days because he was so excited and impressed with what he had seen.  After a couple days the witness contacted Peter Davenport, at the National UFO Reporting Center, who was given permission to tape the conversation.  That conver- sation was aired about a week later on the Art Bell&apos;s &quot;Coast to Coast&quot; radio program and should be made available when archive conversation, at that web site, is completed. Witness stated that during the entire event no sound was heard coming from the sphere nor was there any perceptible emission of any kind.  There was no disturbance to the immediate surroundings caused by the object. Astronomical data for the date and time of sighting:  Moon: 18 degrees altitude; 84 degrees azimuth, 16% waning crescent  Jupiter: 23 degrees altitude; 241 degrees azimuth   +Data confirm the witness&apos;s statement regarding Jupiter&apos;s position in the sky.  The moon, while low in the sky, would have been behind the witness in the east. *Calculated diameter of the object is made for when the object was first and last seen.  There is a difference of 12 feet between the two perspectives that probably reflect an uncertainty of the actual size rather than to suggest the object changed its size. **Based on a total distance of 310 feet traveled by the UFO from initial sighting to when last observed, the calculated speed is 70mph if the time required was 3 seconds or 53mph if 4 seconds had elapsed.", "Bright yellow sphere of light, changing to white and swiftly moving away.I was driving north on South Tomlin Hill Road.  After making the 90&ordm; left turn in the road, I was headed west at about 7 miles per hour when I saw a luminous yellow sphere. It was about 45&ordm; above my line of sight in front of me and slightly to my right, or north of me, plunging swiftly downward for approximately 1 second, north to south, on about a 30&ordm; angle. I thought it was a meteorite. I expected it to burn out, but then it became a bright white light and headed west/northwest. I continued to drive west, speeding up to about 30 miles per hour as the light sped away from me. At this point it resembled a star moving away. It diminished in size until I lost sight of it in the still red glow along the western horizon. I thought perhaps it was a plane but I did not see any blinking lights. There was a jet headed east overhead to my left. The light moving west did not seem to be at the same altitude as the jet. My guess would be that it was perhaps at half the altitude of the jet. Tomlin Hill is higher than the surrounding area making it is possible to see a wide expanse of sky in all directions so I never lost sight of it until it reached the western horizon. I watched it for perhaps 90 seconds. I live in this area and the Columbia Regional Airport is to the southeast of my home. I am very used to seeing lots of aircraft in the area. I am very familiar with what aircraft look light at night. This did not seem like any craft I&rsquo;m use to seeing pass overhead at night. It moved west much too fast for a small plane. Even a jetliner passing over head would take about twice as long to cover that same distance. For the brief moment it was plunging down it seemed perfectly round with no distortion around its circumference. Even though I momentarily thought it to be meteorite, there was no smoke trail or streak of light. My impression of its color and shape at this point would be like that of the sun high overhead on a hot hazy day, but not that size and more spherical in shape. It initially appeared about the same size as Venus, still clearly visible in the western sky that evening. It did not twinkle or have any blinking lights. The night was perfectly clear with lots of stars and aircraft visible in the area. I don&rsquo;t rule out that it may have been a smaller jet of some kind flying at a much lower altitude than that of a jetliner except for its swift downward motion when I first noticed it.", "This object was immobile and looks like to watching or waiting for something.I DON&apos;T REALLY SPEAK ENGLISH, SO YOU CAN FIND SOMEONE TO TRADUCE. :  Cette lumi&egrave;re est apparue vers 20:50, heure du Qu&eacute;bec.

I was only 11 when in 1980 (?) something really wonderful was about to be experienced...a UFO sighting.  It&apos;s as clear to me now as it was 22 years ago.  Was I dreaming? Seeing an illusion? Was it a meteor or a meteorological event?  I&apos;m certain it was not!  How can I be so certain?  I was with a friend who also saw everything.  We ran home to our parents to tell the story.  The next day, Edmonton radio and newspapers claiming the phone lines were choked with similar testimony gave us credibility.  Representatives from the University, (who never witnessed the event), explained it as a possible meteor. So here is what really happened... Armed with a pair of binoculars, it was a clear summer starry night when my friend ((name deleted)) and I set out to star gaze.  While &quot;break and enters&quot; where the hobbies of kids our age, we enjoyed astronomy. We actually wrote papers on the planets and studied the constellations. Call us geeks, but we found it exciting.  Facing the northern sky, we settled into the side of a hill not far from my house where lights could be dodged. My parents were stationed in Edmonton for a 5 year term. Life on the Greisbach army base was, to say the least, boring, so the patience we had learned was about to be rewarded. After about 40 minutes of just laying there, I happened to take interest at a red star in the east. I pointed it out to ((2nd witness)) to get his opinion. Although we both agreed it was just a star, I still kept a wary eye on it. It wasn&apos;t long before I was asking ((2nd witness)) to confirm if the star was moving.  It seemed to be growing!  Awww...just a plane we decided.  He went back to gazing at other objects. A few moments passed and I nudged him asserting that it was no plane.  Now we were both watching intently.  Then the most peculiar thing happened.  A beam of light grew from it.  Our mouths were fixed open in awe.  I fumbled with my click camera, but was more interested in taking in the event.  The beam of light grew long across the sky as it moved at a constant rate from east to west, well above the horizon, but not overhead. The distance was difficult to judge, but it seemed far yet near.  Kind of like a Las Vegas building. They look near because they are so big. As it stretched across the north in front of us, stranger things appeared.  Two stars appeared on each side of the beam, and then another two, and then another two. Then all stars did the same thing the original beam did.  They stretched out thinner beams in front of them.  The beams had bright lights at each end.  They were positioned perfectly symmetrical.  The middle beam was bigger than the surrounding beams. When the event was directly in front of us, again each of the smaller beams were surrounded by stars which then shot out their own beams. Now as the event passed into the west, (which still had a bit of twilight), it did the exact reverse!  Small beams collapsed into stars and into single beams and then the last big beam collapsed back down to a star which eventually winked out.  The main event had lasted for only a minute, but it seemed longer. Chris and I looked at each other in excitement. We stayed there for another half hour hoping for more. Our excitement got the better of us and we ran home to tell all!  If anyone else has seen and remembers this, please contact me (email address below).  I would like to compare notes.  Also, I can&apos;t remember the exact date but I would love to search the newspaper archives for this event. Its possible the army was experimenting with some sort of transportation device; But as I let my imagination take over, I think we witnessed an alien space probe passing by our planet on a planned mapping of our solar system.  Think of it like a car coming down the road. At first you see a small dot, then it grows into a front and then as it passes you see the long side of it and then the backside and finally a receding dot.  In this case the front was like looking at the end of a fiber optic cable and as it passed it looked like the whole fiber. Its so hard to put into words, but it was an incredibly FANTASTIC event to witness. Whatever it was, it was VERY BIG!  If you ask ((2nd witness)) today, he thinks it was just a meteor.  I saw some very cool big meteors with a long sparkly death, and nothing in that shower could even come remotely close to what we saw. It was NOT a meteor. Meteors do NOT have symmetry! Nor do they fill up the sky.  But there was no doubt that it was NOT a meteor.  I had seen them before, this in contrast looked alien, moved slowly across the entire sky, and behaved mechanical. I also forgot to add that there was supposedly a very low engine rumble.  I can&apos;t remember if I experienced this or if I got this from the reports the next day.  Like I said, we were too transfixed, all other non-visual senses seemed to be halted. I should also state that we were NOT under the influence of anything... we were eleven!  I have better things to do then tell wild stories.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with this witness, and he seemed exceptionally lucid and objective to us.

Then, all that changed. Carrie Martin told The Chronicle Monday that she was afraid at first that &quot;people would think we&apos;re crazy&quot;, but she said she and her husband had just passed the Corinth Fire Department when they first saw it. They were approaching the new home of their neighbors, Bryce and Michelle Moss on Corinth Road, when they saw something in the sky to their left. Sparks which appeared to be several inches long were coming from the unknown object in the sky. Carrie Martin said it was just high enough to cross over utility lines. It crossed the road and struck a tree on the Moss property. &quot;There was a car directly behind us so we couldn&apos;t just stop,&quot; she said. They turned around after a short distance and returned to the scene. &quot;It was in the tree,&quot; Mrs. Martin said. They could still see the sparks and the &quot;ground was catching fire.&quot;  They drove to Bryce and Michelle Moss&apos;s present home and reported the situation to them. Mrs. Martin dialed 911 and got Union County Communications Department who advised they call on a &quot;land line.&quot; Mrs. Moss called Cherokee Communications who said they had already been notified by Union County. The incident occurred about 6:15 Sunday night, Mrs. Martin says. The Corinth Volunteer Fire Department answered the call and extinguished the fire. Chief Doug Bowers said that after a conversation with the eyewitnesses, fire department personnel shined a light into the top of a tree where the object crashed. Chief Bowers said departmental personnel spotted a shiney object about 20 feet off the ground in the tree. The object appeared to be about six inches wide, Chief Bowers said. Cherokee Communications Department contacted the Federal Aviation Administration who said they had had no reports of any plane in the area having any difficulty. Bowers said FAA officials said they had no idea what had been spotted in the skies of rural Cherokee County. &quot;They called it a &apos;headscratcher&apos;,&quot; Bowers said. Carrie Martin said she and her husband went back to the scene on Monday but could not find the shiney object in the tree. Too, they checked the brush area which had burned and found nothing suspicious. Mrs. Martin said she wondered if what fell could not have been some piece of the experimental objects that are placed in the atmosphere by the United States or some other government.

This happened in complete daylight with clear visabilty about 10 miles from LAX. I was born and raised in this area and I&apos;m very familiar with aircraft, helocopters and small aircraft landing or flying near LAX. The very fast movement across the sky behind the airplanes which I had been observing all morning is what caught my attention in the first place. I was observerving contract linemen install an 80 foot power pole near an energized line for the power company that I work for. It was my job to shout out constant reminders of thier proximty to the energized lines on which they were working on.I was aware of thier presence the whole time, aproximately 10 hours. This practice is very common among electric workers and is a very useful and traditional way of keeping linemen safe and aware of danger. I had to keep my glance on them constantly because they were working adjacent to a &quot;hot&quot; line.Off in the distance while observing the linemen,is when I saw a white &quot;star&quot; moving across the sky in a pattern that reminded me of an insect.

My nephew and I  were driving on a remote hightway in the mountains of Colorado between Durango and Pagosa Srings, Coloradoat 11:45 PM.  This is a secluded stretch of highway where the mountains come down to the road on both sides.  My 23 year old nephew who is an areonautical engineer was driving while I was keeping a lookout for elk on the highway.  All of a sudden, the highway above and ahead of us for several hundred yards was lit like with street lights, although the light was indescribably soft and misty.  It did not alarm us.  Knowing this stretch of the road I knew there were no highway lights but accepted them and then looked up through the windshield to see their source.  There was a car coming from the opposite direction about a quarter mile away.  As I looked up through the windshield, I saw a huge round disc like soft light with grey metalic material surrounding it.  Then, I looked down the road above us and was able to count seven similiar lights.  They seemed to be approximately 40-50 ft. in diameter and about 100 feet above us.  I had just finished counting the lights when the object disappeared in a beautiful curving motion.  I then looked up in the clear dark sky and saw the object which in a split second went from something that seemed 400-500 yards long to a tiny two inch object way up in the sky where all we could see were the row of lights.  Then it disappeared. I told my nephew not to discuss what we experienced until we got home 15 minutes later and wrote down our observations.  Our observations were identical with the exception that my nephew thought the object was only about 75 feet above our car. The next morning we went to the local Pagosa Springs airport and talked with the airport manager.

Then a second later saw another one then again, and again two more times then they disappeared. There were no clouds out that night and the moon was not out. I have never seen anything like it. Then at about 10:00pm I with my three children were sitting in the t.v. room. When all of a sudden my daughter started yelling staring out the window. I got up and looked out the window to see this time a big yellow light in the sky facing the window. It then started to back up and then disappeared. The tv is right next to the window and there is nothing covering the top of the window. I called my two other children to come. I turned the lights out to see if i could see them again. About 5 minutes later  in the back field I saw 2 more big yellow lights.They stayed there for about 1 minute then disappeared. They didn&apos;t move and they stayed in one place. Also around the  objects we saw ALOT of airplanes around it. Behind my house there is a big field and in the 11 years I lived here I have seen several UFO objects.

I waited and stared at the night sky hoping to see something. I must say that when I saw it, I kept waiting to hear a big boom. I got this overwhelming feeling that the ghostly sight with rainbow colored, soft, round orbs with in it, was some sort of attack. My friend who had picked me up from work, caught something she describes as angelic. She froze. I ran. We compared what it was we experienced by not explaining it to one another, but, by writting it down and letting each other read it. So as if not to allow our emotions to find a bond. The only thing about this that made me decide to share it, is that it flew to the north across us. Towards Burbank Airport.

A short time later a friend and co-worker mentioned that he had seen this C-17 over the Beaver Creek ski area some miles away. As we talked in the parking lot I looked up to see another C-17 coming from the east at a much higher altitude than the first. I pointed the transport out to my friend and we watched it when suddenly we both saw a round object pass close by the C-17 heading north at a high rate of speed. We both were surprised and shocked by this as they appeared from the ground to have come in close proximity to each other. We watched the UFO head off to the north for about a minute before losing sight of it. The C-17 seemed to vanish too, as I looked for it again after the UFO disappeared from sight.

I was just outside of Black River Falls, WI. when I noticed what appeared at first to be a forrest ranger tower in the horizon. Then I noticed that it was coming closer and closer. It didn&apos;t make any sense. I then thought perhaps a helicopter or something. Seeing as we had a airforce base just maybe 45 miles away.

It followed me for approximately 4 to 5 miles when I started to enter a one horse small town and it disapeared. I pull over at a the only business open in town, it was a tavern and asked if I could use there phone in order to call for a sheriff. I called the county sheriffs office who then patched me through to a officer on patrol back in Black River Falls. I explained my delima and said I wish to have an escort back to the interstate because my girl friend and I felt threatened. He said that I had a 15 mile trip back and that I should meet him at the truck stop called the Oasis. So reluctantly I did and on the way back we encountered the same object. My girl friend started screaming and I started praying, I slowed to a halt and rolled down the window to look at what was hovering over the road about 100 yards in front of me and I heard absolutely nothing. I then started the vehicle back up and continued driving towards the light. It hovered up and over the back of my vehicle and followed for about 5 miles or so and then vanished. When I made my way into the Oasis truck stop, I immediately ran into the truck stop restaurant and spotted two sheriffs. They invited me to sit down and tell my story, all along I could see they were both nervous as hell. When I finished they took my name and phone number and told me that they seen this same ufo in a farmers field with the family that called it in two days earlier.

It traveled parallel to the beach and was seen for about 35 seconds from the point first seen and it moved from right to left. It was brilliant and as I had been taking pictures of some night birds I had an opportunity to take a quick picture just as it started to recede from our view to the left from where we were standing on the beach.

The object suddenly changed speed (Faster) then appeared to stop in mid air. It slowly moved back north for about 2 or 3 seconds then south again. It was a beautiful sunny morning with clear blue sky. The object stayed suspended in the sky for 10 - 15 seconds then either turned or changed its shape into a cylinder type tube. The sun was reflecting more of its surface as the object appeared to turn. It was definately a metalic surface as it reflected the sun brightly, but its darker form was also visible as if it were illuminated from another light source (A darker metallic grey). It was at this time that the object accelerated out of sight heading due east. The speed at which the object dissapeared was astounding!

My girlfriend, Her two brothers and I had come back to her home about 8.30 pm after swimming at the club pool. We joined her parents and an older sister on their front lawn drinking lemonade. Her Dad was a retired LT.Col from the Indian Army and a Japanese prisoner of war. At about 9.00pm one of her brothers points out &quot;Look at that funny shaped cloud forming&quot;. We all looked up and over their house at an angle of about 45deg a Church bell shaped cloud was forming. It would have been about 2-3000 ft altitude and lit by the city lights. There was no other cloud in the sky. WE would have been looking south and the final size of the bell shaped cloud would have been 3-4cm across at arms lenght. The domestic Airport would have been south west and as the crow flies about 10km away. IT did not move or appear to be effected by high wind as clouds are. We all soon caried on with our conversation till a few minutes later the brother breaks in saying &quot;look what the cloud is doing now&quot;. WE all look up again and just below the bell shaped cloud three smaller clouds form, all bell shabed, evenly spaced, and about half the size of the origional.They formed a equilateral triangle shape in the sky. Soon the three smaller clouds merged with the large one, formed a bright orange ball, bright enough to throw a shadow of the roof near us. IT shot off at great speed downwards towards the Airport with no sound and when it seemed above the Airport to us it excelerated up wards splitting into four smaller orange balls of light vanishing into the night sky.

The light stayed. We drove away down a dirt road out to the main highway. About 2 miles down the road we saw in the rearview mirror a circular ball of light. I figured it was a car but when we turned around the ball of light was hovering in the bed of our truck. We stopped immediately.The ball of light was about a soccerball size and it hovered in a short circular motion about 2 ft.above the bed of the truck for about ten seconds. Then it stopped it&apos;s short circular motion, froze for about 2 seconds and then darted away. This location is far from any artificial light source such as street lights and there were no cars behind or in front of us.I am fully convinced that the light that was lighting up the tops of the trees was of the same light source that followed us down the dark highway because when we returned to the campsite out of curiosity there was no light anywhere,including the light that was lighting the tops of the 100 ft. tall trees.", "7-9 Amber colored, zig-zag patern. I CANNOT be the only one that saw these! I took pix too.At the time listed above it was partly cloudy. I just finished warming up my car and leaving the parking lot when I saw about 5 up-right rectangles (cylinders), amber (like street lamps) in color, slowly come out of the clouds. I was facing West, they were heading East. First 5 then 6,7... I stoped counting. I franticlly grabed my old Nikkon SLR in the dark and put the telephoto lens on the best I could without seeing much of what I was doing. I managed to get off 3 pictures then ran out of film. I continued tring to take the best mental notes I could; they were in a zig-zag pattern (horizontally),then broke formation. The Northern-most one vanished in the clouds, another went North, a couple southern ones went South, the middle one was the most interesting because I could watch it with out any possible abstrution from clouds. I watched it go up, up, up through the clearing eventually vanishing.I later called PDX (airport) and told them my story. They said that it was reflactions of a jet in the clouds (I saw no jets,blinking lights, or heard sound). She was unable to help, so she directed me to this site.

A few seconds later a second boom hit and rattled the windows about the same. I wondered if there was some sort of huge metal dumpster or something that fell off a truck near the house but couldn&apos;t believe that would rattle the windows like that. Less than a minute later my father who lives about 8-9 miles west of me called me on the phone. He asked if I heard the sonic booms. I said yeah but I didn&apos;t know what they were. I had not heard a sonic boom in over 30 years and wondered about that. I immediately hung the phone up and ran outside to look in the sky. I observed at least 7 or 8 contrails going across the sky mostly from east to west or west to east, as I could not see the end of them. But I noticed that to the North Northwest there was one contrail that made a hairpin turn and headed back north. I thought that might have been the source since it would probably be a military craft that made that maneuver. Then about 25 to 30 minutes later I was in my car about to start it when my cell phone rang. As I was answering it I heard a smaller boom but it was distinctly the same as early just much quieter. At that moment I said hello and it was my father again, he asked if I heard the sonic boom again. I said I just heard it as I was answering the phone. I then asked him how long ago he heard it and he said about 30 seconds before I answered the phone. So since he lives about 8 miles west of me we figured that the sound was also west of me since it took at least 30-40 seconds for the sound to travel to me. Then later that evening I took my son to meet with the Boy Scouts to go camping. While the boys were all loading up their gear I told the story to one of the boy&apos;s fathers who is retired air force and now works for the air force in civil service. He was in Dallas at the time and did not hear it but a mother of another boy said she heard 3 booms like me and another boys father said he heard it ! and though somebody must have been dynamiting something. The lady lived about half way between me and my father while the other boy&apos;s father lives right on Lake Grapevine about 12 miles west of me and about 3-4 miles southwest of my father. When I got home that night after dropping my son off with the scouts, I called my father to tell him what I had heard from others. He then told me that my mother had heard the sonic booms also. She was in the front yard at my brother&apos;s house about 12 miles north northwest of me and about 7 to 8 miles north of my father. She said she heard the first two booms that were close together but was probably driving in the car when the third one hit so she did not hear it. I just now called her to ask her if she saw anything and she said she did not but thought that the sound was north of them but could not be certain. She also said that a neighbor asked if she heard the sonic booms and she said she did. He said he heard them and called DFW airport to report them and the airport said they did not hear them.", "Very calm night, saw an orange light from underneath, and on the sides of it. . It made no sound.One night, in the township of Footbridge WI,(just outside of Kewaunee) a friend of mine and I were planning to go fishing in the Kewaunee River. The spot we picked to go is very dark, no lights from houses or street lights. It&apos;s basically a dead end parking lot. We were sitting by our cars talking and it was one of those calm nights where you could hear a dog barking from a mile away.The sky was very very clear, all the stars you could see were visable. Minutes prior a jet had flown over us and it was VERY high up in the air, and we could hear it because it was so calm outside. Not more than 20 minutes later, another flying object came through, only, we never saw anything like it. It had an orange glow underneath and to the sides. This craft was no more than an eighth mile high, and unlike the jet, no sound was coming from it. We were probably 1/2 mile from it and we watched it fly over the trees from the east to the west, slowly for about 2 minutes. My friend had then called his brother on his cellphone and asked him to look outside at it. (His brother lived about 2 miles from there). He was already outside watching it and said he could not tell what it was. The way it would jerk around and how close to the trees it flew. From where my friend and I were sitting, the craft went over the treeline and we couldnt see it anymore. His brother watched and he said half a minute later, it completely vanished.

I have other shots of the same area which I took at various times of the day when we went for a hike and all of them were nice clean prints. (I tend to collect a batch of films and then send them all together to Clark Color Lab. Today, I now have an Olympus 750 which would have given even better images of this sunset over Katahdin, I suspect.)  Thinking it&apos;s just dirty print, I looked for the negs so I could send them back to the lab and have them do these 2 shots over again. I was very surprised to find these shapes in the negatives!

I was about to leave my girlfriends house, when I noticed what appeared to be a neon orange doughnut slowly approaching from the south.  This object looked like a doughnut, round with a black center and made no noise at first.    As it got closer, it dropped a small blue ball of light that fell approx. 30-40 feet then went out.  It did this four times by the time it was overhead.  By now I had become quite excited (my girlfriend was crying like a wuss) and produced my lighter and began to flash it at the object which looked like it was less than 1000 ft above us.  After flashing my lighter a bunch of times, this thing stops. it didn&apos;t slow to a stop, it just stopped.  I stopped flashing my lighter and waited for something to happen.  It dropped another blue light, so I flashed my lighter again.  When I flashed my lighter at it, it moved pretty damn fast to the left and then to the right, then changed it&apos;s shape to a thin horizontal line and with a bang just like a car backfire, it shot away at an amazing speed and left a small cloud of white smoke that faded as fast as it appeared.  The bang that was heard woke my girl&apos;s dad up.  We told him what we saw and what it did.  He told us we probably saw a military aircraft that was dropping flares.  What a crock of you know what!  I am very military oriented, and I know that was no damn plane or jet we saw.  I also saw this same craft with ny mother about a year later.  Did the same thing (dropped blue balls of light) but this time it was cloudy and it made a sharp angled left turn into a cloud before anyone else got to see it.

We observed these lights for over a span of 10 to 15 minutes, I happened to look up into the night sky and saw more than a couple of stars move, like when you see falling stars, except that these did perfect circular movements and just disappear afterwards.  After witnessing this we noticed that over the horizon of the pacific, quickly a kind of mist or clouds covered these lights and we could no longer see them.  After getting to our destination, as we got out of the car and as I looked up into the night sky, I saw behind the hills a kind of lightning or flash, this was on a clear starry night.

The witness also said he knows what a satellite, star, planet, etc is, what it was the man saw was no star, at least in his mind. The fellow said he stood speechless there for a while after witnessing this strange event. The man called a close friend who resides in Prince George who also belongs to an astronomy club. His friend had no idea and suggested he contact me, which he did.

I was wrapping up my year end reports for 2003 when a telephone call came in on December 31, 2003. A lady had gone to the internet in search of a Canadian UFO Investigator so she could file a report on some strange on-going sightings which had been taking place in her area. At one point the objects seen were so frightening to her and the family, that the RCMP was called to the witnesses residence to investigate. The witness did state that she was not going to call this a UFO, meaning something from another world because she really did not firmly believe in this.

Sicamous, British Columbia Date: December 26, 2003 Time: approx: 11:30 p.m. Sightings continue in this area.

The lady went on to say that what she and her family have been observing was something they could not explain. Be it military or something else, whatever these objects are, they do some very bizarre things in the sky. On December 26, 2003 the dispatcher for the Sicamous, British Columbia RCMP detachment took a call from an excited woman who requested the RCMP come to her home and look into the unusual sights that had been taking place over a period of time. Whilst making the report she felt that she wasn&apos;t being taken seriously ... and that maybe they thought her to be a little crazy.. however when an hour passed and the RCMP officer arrived in her yard it was a different story. As soon as he saw the object he stood and looked in amazement. He had no idea what it was. I was told that the officer left the families home and drove towards the mountain where the object was sitting to get a closer and better look. (HBCC UFO Note: So far I have left two messages with the Sicamous RCMP detachment to have the constable call me back using my toll free number and as of yet he has not returned my call. I am not giving up on him, and I will keep trying until I get a hold of him even if it means becoming a pest). &quot;An important part to this case is that excellent video footage has been shot by the family&quot;. As the tape is rolling you can hear the children in the background commenting on how quickly the object was moving all over the sky. It appears to be moving rather quickly, zig zagging, etc.. I asked the witness about how she was holding the camera, knowing that any slight movement while video taping can make &quot;something&quot; appear to move. In the footage it shows the object moving erratically around the sky. The other members of her family who stood watching this event unfold saw the very same thing with the naked eye..... something flying all around the sky. The witness said these objects (plural as there are more than one at different times) ..... was also seen by her husband whilst he was up in the mountains which is around their area. He described one of the objects as being as big as a house and covered in lights. At the time, he was waiting for his daughter and her cousin to return with the snowmobile. He watched the object with his naked eye and estimated it to be approximately a mile away from his location. He was so excited and frightened at what he saw whilst he waited... that he immediately drove back home, ran into the house and told his wife of his adventure. She thought he had been drinking as he was acting strange and obviously was very scared. Knowing they had to go back out to that location where the object was seen because they had to pick up the kids, the gentleman said he was not going back out there alone ! The husband&apos;s sighting took place before December 26, 2003, and what the family caught on tape on December 26, 2003 was the same object. It had returned. They also saw the object through their binoculars and described it as being in the shape of an acorn or a diamond. It was an extraordinary sighting because not only did the object shine brightly and move around erratically ... but at one point when it was stationary ... it shot out a large red fireball, then six bright orange lights appeared in the sky around it. Each of the orange lights had another two white lights on them. These white lights shot a beam of light towards the ground. Approximately half an hour later four more of the large acorn/diamond shaped objects showed up and sat either stationary or moved around the sky. The witnesses said the objects appeared to have hundreds of lights on each of them. These folks have recently moved into this home, but the previous owners said they used to watch in the daylight hours ... on many occasions silver disk shaped objects flying over and around the mountains behind the house. This case is under investigation and this is only raw data at present. Video tape is currently being examined. A foot note to this. The lady who reported the sighting and who rang the RCMP told me that when the constable arrived and saw the object .. he commented to her that he knew of nothing that moved that quickly ... nor of anything that could stop like it did on a dime. This story proved interesting enough that the television station (CHBC TV out of Kelowna, British Columbia) sent a news crew to interview the family and to get a copy of the footage. CHBC TV is a part of the Global TV network which is one of Canada&apos;s giants in the media business. The story ended up airing not just on that station, but aired all over British Columbia on Global BCTV. They ran the story at least three times as a part of their news. Once at 6:00 p.m. Friday night, again at 11:00 p.m. and again on the Saturday morning news. As I was the investigator on the case they also called me a number of times and interviewed me about the story. The news gave this story a good length of time to play out on TV which was really great to see. Something else of interest prior to these sightings but in the same area was when an RCMP officer who was out on his usual rounds in his patrol car ... noticed an object in the sky and was instantly hit with a beam of light from it. After his shift was over and upon his return to his detachment he informed his co-workers of what he had seen. They thought he was seeing things. Now perhaps they have a different interpretation of the event. HBCC UFO is requesting if anyone else has been witness to this object at the date and time given above I would certainly like to hear from you. Also if anyone from around the surrounding communities have witnessed a strange object in the month of December 2003 I again would enjoy hearing from you.

I saw overhead what caught my eye as a flash of bright light that appeared to be at first directly above my house.  (Standing on the porch it was directly overhead when it came it&apos;s stopping/ reversing point at that side of it&apos;s pattern.)  Looking up, i saw that the object was actually moving in a kind of back and forth motion over head, so that it looked like it was making a zig-zaging pattern, appearing to be very close overhead above the treetops. It was moving quickly, coming to a stop then making very sharp reversals above so that it seemed to appear and disspear as it moved out of sight beyound what I could see over the roof.  (Hence the &quot;flash&quot; impression that caught my eye).  The object above the lights was dark and hard to see because the lights  were clustered on the bottom that were very bright.  The lights themselves were green, blue white and red in a cluster pattern appearing to be underneath the object. I was not able to see above the lights other than an impression of a shadow, above the lights but I was not able to tell the shape of it.   Mr Davenport asked for a comparision to the full moon in size and I believe that though there was not a full moon here tonight, this would have obscured it if it has passed in front.  There was absolutely no sound from the object.  It appeared to me to be much lower than a normal aircraft would be, appearing to be not much higher than the tops of the elm trees along the edge of the fence.  The object appeared to be moving back and forth quickly and would disappear from view beyond the roof of the house and then reappear because of it&rsquo;s flight pattern.  This went on for a few minutes.  I lost the object when I went inside to get my camera; when I came back outdoors the object was not visible. In terms of other conditions, here it was about  20 F outside, and quite clear with many stars visible.  After watching for a few minutes to see if the object would reappear I returned to the house and found my 3 cats VERY excited and agitated though I couldn&rsquo;t see anything inside that would have caused them to be.

It moved erratically, turning and dipping, then sped off a little to the right and stayed stationary. It stayed in this position another 10-15 seconds, then disappeared. I don&apos;t know how to judge the distance, but with my arm extended, I measured the distance that it filled between my thumb and forefinger (about a quarter inch.)

The craft had blue lights at each corner (as far as I can remember) and a srobe light directly in the middle of the this craft that was always shining on me. I may have had this dream more than 10 times through out my childhood from 7-15 years old.

I don&apos;t know why I was giving those dreams, and could never find any source of dream sightings. I must clearify that I never physically seen this object while awake, only in my dreams when I was a kid. I&apos;m now 27 years old and still can remember them clearly. I was told by a family memeber whom also had these dream sightings that he feels that these objects are monitoring us. I feel something sinister is present every time of those dreams. Please help me to understand them, even if it means a hyptnosis session. I&apos;m ready to know the truth. Thank You for this opportunity.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

As they moved I saw more and more 20, then about 50 then about 100.  They looked like white fireworks in the sky.  They would appear and then dissaper in 2 different sets.

We saw a chevron shaped (that&apos;s v shaped) object moving slowly across the sky.  It was about two or three inches across in my visual spectrum and seemed to be very high, at least 10,000 ft if not more.  it looked like 7 dim lights in a v formation with one more in the center.  the lights were just bright enough to see but not bright enough to really catch your attention. i just happened to catch the movement.  It was so big that I&apos;m sure it was not a jet, and it was completely silent. it seemed to be leaving a wake of  light trails behind it that resembled heat inversion or the waviness you see when pumping gas on a hot day.  it moved very slow as if it were &quot;floating&quot; rather than flying.  one of my girlfriends co-workers saw the same thing from across town so I can safely say that my friend and I were not just &quot;seeing things&quot;.  it looked exactly like the &quot;phoenix lights&quot; phenomena that was witnessed in colorado springs and arizona in 1997.", "5-6 Black Diamond shaped Silent ObjectsWhat I saw in the sky was 5-6 Black diamond shaped floating objects. They were flying in a syncronized fashion with a centralized some-what larger  black diamond shaped one in the middle. They were floating south south-west,north-north east right at the top of the tree tops. They were close enough to hear if they made a sound but they were silent. It was a clear blue sky and it just so happened that when it flew by at about 35-40 miles an hour no one else was on the road where I witnessed them. The smaller ones were about the size of about 3 full size vans. The larger one was about 2-3 times bigger then the smaller ones.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

On sunday, 28 March at 7:45 PM I was returning from a walk on the Cedar River trail in Renton. While crossing the softball field at the Renton community center I was taken aback to see two lights in the northern sky which I immediately recognized to be anomalous. They were in color and brightness very much like Jupiter. They were one directly below the other hanging motionless in the sky in an area a couple of degrees east of polaris and perhaps five degrees below polaris. They were separated by one or two degrees. After observing the lights for ten or fifteen seconds the lower light dimmed and disappeared  in three or four seconds then the upper one did the same. I don&apos;t think that these were flares - they did not resemble any flares that I&apos;ve ever seen. I&apos;m certain that they were not lights on an aircraft. Did anyone else see these things?", "A huge craft that appeared to be attempting to cloak itself soundlessly flew from the west to the east and blended into the night sky.Today 8 March, a clear night in Alexandria, what appeared to be a craft of some sort had over 100 individual lights that appeard to be stars under it.  The lights did not blink.  The craft appeared to be only stars initially but as it moved the outline appeared to be a gigantic wing except it was rectangular.  It appeared to have the shape of a large single winged craft.  As the craft moved toward the moon it completely disappeared as if it was cloaked it could not see it as it went toward the moon. The craft moved slowly from the west to the east on a clear night.  It appeared to be huge compared to the usual normal aircraft I see at night flying overhead.  However, none of these lights blinked.  It was something other than the usual craft I am very accustom. Some one else had to see this, please correlate my description with others.  It was real as I don&rsquo;t look for these.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.  PD))", "&apos;Fflying saucer&apos; shaped craft sighted over farm, with occupant emerging, flying to ground and &apos;freezing&apos; witnessMy older brother believes he was about 5 at the time of this occupant sighting, so I have chosen the date of his fifth birthday as the event date. What has always fascinated me about his story is that he made my parents and grandparents aware of the sighting at the time, and it has been mentioned intermittently (albeit with embarassment/disbelief by the adults) ever since. In other words, he reported what he saw to them AT THE TIME, and in detail, so this is not some false memory of childhood recalled/invented many years later. Recently I broached the subject with him to get a definitive account of what I believe is a genuine ufo occupant encounter. At the age of 5, my brother was playing near the gate of our dairy farm, which is located approximately 100km south east of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. He remembers my father and grandfather were still milking the cows, and it was approaching dusk. Suddenly to the west he saw what he described as a &apos;big bright star&apos; in the sky between our property and a particular neighbour&apos;s property (knowing the distance across the paddocks between our farmhouse and theirs, a midway point would be approximately 200 metres away. He watched the &apos;star&apos; abruptly shoot to various positions in the western sky several times and become stationary again. After a while it began to &apos;fly closer&apos; towards and to the north west and he could see that it wasn&apos;t a star but a &apos;spaceship&apos;. Its interesting that the words he gave me to describe it recently, at the age of 34, were childhood words, which re-inforced my impression that he was definitely recollecting something he saw at that age. Descriptive words for the craft he gave me were &apos;metal machine&apos;, &apos;shiny&apos;, and &apos;spaceship&apos;. When I asked the shape, he said &apos;a flying saucer. Like the flying saucers you see.&apos; He vividly recalls that the &apos;spaceship&apos; hovered at what we now estimate to be about 50 metres away (based on his recollection of its position in relation to landmarks below) and a &apos;hatch, like a gangplank&apos; opened up and a man in a silver suit with a jetpack flew out. He variously this figure as a &apos;man with a  jetpack&apos;, and a &apos;spaceman&apos;. The &apos;spaceman&apos; performed a number of manouevers in the sky, occassionally coming very close and then flying off at a distance, before approaching and landing on the dirt road near our gate, approximately 10 metres from my brother. He told me he became terrified at this point and tried to turn and run, but was frozen to the spot. &quot;You can&apos;t run, even if you want to, you can&apos;t run&quot; was all he would tell me about the incident from that point on, apart from being adamant that our grandmother, standing at the door to her farmhouse, about 10 metres beh! ind him &apos;saw it too. She saw it. She just wouldn&apos;t talk about it.&quot; What intrigues me to this day is that as long as I can remember the story has remained consistent amongst our family, including this detail about my grandmother, who according to my father may have originally confirmed my brothers story but subsequently dismissed it from her mind and denied it.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It is a clear night with lots of stars out - this was about 10 x larger and much brighter than any star, also very colorful. It moved up and down and seemed to be spinning around very fast.

The others are still very clear, they look the same, except they are too far away to see any red dots.

My girlfriend and I were sitting on my bed in my dorm room watching a movie. I took a glance out of the window and saw a strange star. I told my girlfriend to look at it and she said, I know I&apos;ve been looking at it too. We studied it for a while and ruled out that it was not a star or a plane or a satellite. We were only able to look at the object through binoculars, but it was still very clear that this was no known object. The object was blinking red, white, and, blue. It looked orange at times possibly because it was blinking, or moving, extremely fast. After about a half hour of studying the object, it began to move upwards towards the right. It was moving quite fast because within an hour of wathing the object it was no longer visible. My girlfriend and I pondered on the sititng for a long time.

It was flat and it was silent and swift. It was like it came into the range of sight and went right out or the lights were suddenly turned off.  It was so big that if I put my arms up into a wide V that was how much space it took up in the sky when you looked up at it.

I was facing almost due west, looking almost straight up to 45 degrees- scanning the sky.  Something, coming into my peripheral vision from my left, caught my eye and I turned to focus on it.  I could not make it out clearly.  I could tell it was chevron to bow shaped, clear to orange-ish, but very faint colored.  There was either another, but smaller, or a same sized but higher object to the left of it, both were chevron/bow shaped.  My first thought was that it was a flock of geese, but before I could tell my son to &quot;look at the geese&quot;, I realized it was traveling entirely too fast for birds and there was no &quot;honking&quot; or sound what so ever normally associated with geese.  The only thing that I could say was,&quot;son, tell me you see that.&quot; and his response was &quot;that is awesome.&quot;  From the time I first spotted it to losing sight of it over some trees in the neighbors yard was 5-8 seconds.  It was almost directly overhead.  It was somewhere in the neighborhood of 2000-2500 feet off the ground.  Size of the object??  All that I can honestly say was that it was big.  It was not just a dot or a line.   For lack of scale, looking up in the sky, it was 10&quot; to 12&quot; in the sky and the smaller one was 6&quot; to 8&quot;.

It was a clear morning and when I sat down to take a load off my feet I looked up to stretch my neck. I stayed like that for a bit until I realized that I was seeing something really strange. I would say that at over 60,000 feet or higher there were three spheres separating and then criss-crossing each other. I then called to my wife and Mom to see if they could see the same thing, and they did. I wasn&apos;t imagining it, it was so spectacular that I phoned the university of British Columbia and reported it but I never heard back from them so you are the second person that knows about it now. Thanks for listening to me. Additional Information:  I telephoned the witness back as I wanted to gather more information on the sighting these folks had back in July of 2003. What I was told was certainly interesting. In the original report which is above, the date was left out at the time the sighting report was filed, mainly because the witness was not sure when the event took place. The fellow did ask his mother as she kept a diary of some of the interesting things which take place in her life and the sighting they all had was one of these important dates to write down. Video footage was taken of the objects. He said that there were three spheres, silver, red and green all traveling together. As the colored spheres passed by the silver object it was reflected, or the silver colored sphere changed color briefly to the color of the passing sphere. The witness said it was like a mirror image to whatever was happening around it. He said after a while the objects separated, heading off in different directions. One headed in a north-easterly direction, the other towards the west and the final sphere heading south-east. I then talked with the gentleman&apos;s wife who gave me a good description of what she saw. The lady said she was taking her mother out when her husband called to her to come and look at the strange objects he was observing. Her first thoughts when she noticed them, was of a jet aircraft, but after watching them, she soon decided it couldn&apos;t be aircraft she was seeing. The woman said they watched the spheres for approximately 30 minutes before they finally disappeared. She said the first sphere was silver. It looked like a shiny surface with the sun reflecting off it. Also it was noted that the silver sphere was the largest of the three. The second sphere had a reddish hue to it and the third was greenish in colour. They were unable to look at the objects for any length of time due to the brightness of the day. The lady told me she could clearly see the red sphere move towards the silver one and went behind it and disappeared. The green one also did the same thing. Eventually both of the colored spheres came out from behind the larger silver sphere and moved around the sky. The silver sphere did at times sit stationary in the sky and the colored object did the moving around. This witness said the colored spheres would at times travel down on an angle both apart from one another and that move back up towards the silver sphere. The colored spheres traveled back and forth many times to the silver object and from different directions. What puzzled the witness, was when the objects moved off in different directions as they left their sight. They figured the wind would have carried them all in the same direction. When the objects finally were leaving the area they did so quickly.

The next thing it did was a 180&quot; barrel roll really quick with the smoke trails off the &quot;wing tips&quot; following them like you would see an airplane in a air show do. Then the smoke comeing off the thing changed to a light rusty brown for the last 1/5th of the total length of the smoke trail it was leaving (about 2000&apos; to 3000&apos; in lenght).

Just as we were gathering our stuff, my dad said &quot;Wow! Look at that!&quot; And my mom and I turned to look northward over a penninsula and about 45 degrees upward we saw a small orange &quot;meteor&quot; coming at a diagonal, then it seemed to curve eastward and get gradually bigger and bigger until it didn&apos;t look like a meteor at all anymore. We could see it in great detail: rounded, disk-shaped with three whitish lights on it and had an orange trail and haze around it. It moved at a moderate pace east and we ran out further on the beach to try to follow it, but it went past the trees and we lost sight of it.

This continued and we counted nine lights that appeared from beyond the hill at regular intervals and headed out to sea in a North Westerly direction. It was difficult to estimate the size of the light as its distance from us was unclear. The lights stayed the same orange colour while we watched them. Eventually we could see all nine outlined against the stars as  they began to get fainter and eventually disappeared from sight. There was no sound associated with the lights.", "White streaks, angled down as if landingSaw lights slowly streaking across the sky.  Not an ordinary plane jet. First, the &quot;tail&quot; or &quot;trail&quot; if that is what it was, was perfectly straight on a very very windy day.  It was not drawn out by the wind or made fuzzy or anything.  It looked like a white needle against the sky.  Second, it took about 15 minutes to move across the horizon.  If what I saw was an exhaust tail, the tail was big enough to indicate the plane was moving very very fast, yet it could not have been, since it took 15-20 minutes to move across the sky.  Third, unless the object was very far away, but in that case I should not have been able to see it with the naked eye unless it was huge.  Also, if they were moving that fast I should have heard some sort of sonic booming - I heard nothing.  Fourth, they were flying over mountains, and were angled down 20 degrees as if landing.  This is odd.  Fifth, there were 3-4 (at least, the first one was already in the sky when I started and the last was still in the sky when I left), which is also strange.  Sixth, the crafts were flying right underneath the sun, which could mean absolutely nothing, or could fit in to something else. At the same time and day, in the same mountainous area, I also saw a wingless plane flying overhead.  It was red/ silverish in color (not illuminated - but like paint), had no wings, and was sort of hover flying.  It was down so low I could make out its shape, yet it wasn&apos;t moving very fast overhead.", "a little nervious about this but here it goes,from leaning aganist the back of my house overlooking the Kinsington expressway from my rear came three cigar shaped objects without any sound whatsoever,flew stright in front of me headed north twards Niagara Falls and disapered into a cold front. all I expected to see was some sort of planet alinememt.", "Craft was hovering over an area at the edge of Eglin Air Force base runway.

It was about 7:00 p.m. and overcast - no visible stars, in March. My wife and my daughter noticed a very, very bright light flying very low coming along from the passenger side at high speed. In a few seconds it came into view in front of us. It looked about the size and brightness of a streetlight at about 100-150 yards away. There was just one bright white light, not strobing or flashing. We were approaching a hill, and the light definitely went over the hill. We arrived at the crest within about 10 seconds. When we arrived at the crest we all looked for the light, but there was no evidence of the it, even though the hill overlooks a fairly large valley.

I live on a hill so i was able to see the object and viewed it through binoculars and then with a video camera. The object was lensatic in shape but too far away to make out any details except for shape and color. The object had an aspect ratio of  about 6-1 and was highly reflective on one surface and flat black on the other, or so it appeared. I watched and filmed the object for about 5 minutes as it ascended at a 45 degree angle until it was out of sight.Video has been submitted to MUFON for analysis.((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Mr. Kim Shaffer, MUFON Assistant State Director for Tennessee, for this report with NUFORC.

PD))", "Five Unknown Aircraft in Battle Formation Over KansasOn the evening of Friday, 20 February 2004, 1930 hrs, I observed five air ships/crafts, in the western sky.  The sun had gone down; however, the sky was still fairly light.  As I sat on my front steps looking west, I began to examine the dark clouds that were just hovering above the homes a few miles away. Initially, I didn&apos;t think anything about it.  Since we had mild thunderstorms the night prior, I thought the objects were lingering storm clouds. As I continued to look in their direction (as the sky became grandually darker), the objects began to lose their cloud-like appearance.  The became metalic.  The new appearance was dark grey (very dark); however, they were not black.  I could tell that they were just a few shades lighter than a solid black color. Their appearance was similar to that of our U.S. Military/Airforce&apos;s flat grey paint.  There were no reflective surfaces. As I have indicated below, the crafts were in a five degree spread formation.  I will use the X to depict how they were positioned in the sky:  x     XXXXX      xxxxxxXXXXVXXXXxxxxxx      XXXXX      xxxxxxXXXXVXXXXxxxxxx  The single X represents what appeared to be a cubed like craft--it was the smallest of the five.  The five X&apos;s represent what appeared to be a tubular craft.  The most interesting, were the larger crafts.  These were shaped (from my vantage point) similar to that of a hawk or eagle as it floats in the sky awaiting prey.  If you were to take a head-on shot of either bird prior to its dive, that is what this larger craft looked like. These larger craft was positioned firmly in the sky, traveling about 5-6 mph.  The wings of the craft were flapping slowly, much like a bird of prey.  The wings were several hundred yards long (tip to tip). As I called my wife to help me identify these crafts, each craft began to slowly fade. When my wife walked to the steps, the smaller craft took-off.  From the nearly motionless position, to several thousand miles per hour (much like a shooting star).  My wife screamed. The tubular craft on the far right, began to slowly fade.  Then, the larger craft on the far right began to fade.  The transition was slow and deliberate. The tubular craft on the far left, began to fade once the larger craft on the right faded. The last remaining craft (one of the bird like crafts), just seem to sit there.  I got the impression that it knew we were stairing at it.  We could feel something staring back at us. I wanted to get a better look, since we couldn&apos;t find a camera.  We jumped in our vehicle, and drop up the hill toward where the final craft was positioned.  Once we got there, it began to fade as well.  We saw the final transition.  It went from an extremely large bulky craft to a transparent (which isn&apos;t a adequate expression).  The craft appeared to blend into the sky.  We could now see a camouflaged craft that had lights/dim orange lights completely surrounding the outline of its shape. The lights were very orange. What was once a bulky bird-like craft, became fluid limber well camouflaged craft that seemed to glide much like a stingray in the ocean. It was like watcing fluid in motion as this craft twirled (as if it were displaying its prowess) in the sky.  Within a second, it went straight up, and was gone. Needless to say, my wife and I could not do anything else for the rest of the night.  We just sat there watching the sky. One interesting point, when we were jumping into the vehicle to chase the craft, we decided to take the family dog.  The dog didn&apos;t want to go outside (this is a dog that runs to the door when it hears the lock click--he&apos;s always game for the outdoors).  He was scared of something. My background is military, two science degrees, own businesses, and consider myself normal (both mentally and pysically).  My wife has a science background, and is an executive with a prominent medical corporation.  We are a grounded family. These things were real, and there was a threat present.", "My daughter and granddaughter were were letting me out of the car in my driveway.  As I got out I glanced at the mountain about 3/4 mile away. My house is also on a mountain, so I was level with the top of the other mountain.  There was a light, that looked like a very low plane.  As we watched, it bounced off the mountain and back in the air.  It was going very slow and made no noise.  We watched it bounce until we lost sight of it.  It was very strange.", "weird light in the morning skyI was loading a pick-up truck with a friend early (9:15)wednesday morning. I looked into the Northern sky and saw a very bright star. I asked my friend what it was and he was stunned. after 10 seconds of no movement it stopped glowing and looked silver and shiny. Ilooked at my friend and asked if he could really see it. I looked back and it was gone.

Four light gray egg-shaped objects moving in formation across prevailing winds from North West to South East no noticeable sound.", "fast moving objectOn March 3, 2004 at 9:30PM, I saw an object flying much higher than normal aircraft toward the moon.  It was directly overhead and was heading toward the moon at a very high rate of speed.  It came from the west and was heading east.  There was some high, thin cloud cover but moon and some stars were visible.  As it neared the moon, it banked a turn toward the northwest quite rapidly.  There were some planes visible from where I was sitting, but the object appeared to be out of our atmosphere--suggesting that the object might have been quite large in reality.  It left no trail or tail and did not act as though it was a satellite or shooting star nor did it act like any aircraft I&apos;ve ever seen!  To bank a turn as this object did and traveling at a high rate of speed only leads me to one thing...it had to be a UFO!  A few seconds after banking the turn, it shot away.  There&apos;s nothing I know of that can travel like that and cover so much sky in only about 25 seconds!  I have been a sky watcher for a number of years and I have never seen anything like this before.  I have observed other crafts and twice I&apos;ve had cases of missing time.  But this sighting proves to be the most fascinating one yet!((FOLLOW-UP REPORT FROM SAME WITNESS))Too much distance covered in such a short timeOn the sepcified time and date, I witnessed an object flying at a very high rate of speed.  I was outside having a cigarette and was admiring the night sky as I often do.  I&apos;ve been a sky-watcher for a number of years since my first sighting in Aug. 1991.  There were some very high, thin clouds and some airplanes visible at the time.  The object appeared from the west and moving toward the east in the direction of the moon.  After about 15 seconds, it was quite near the moon.  Then it banked a turn and moved toward the northwest.  The object appeared as though it was out of our atmosphere.  It appeared to be as high as some of the stars.  After banking toward the northwest, it slowed down considerably and then shot away after about 10 seconds.  It left no trail and there was no visible tail.  It did not appear to have the characteristics of a satellite or any known aircraft that I&apos;ve ever seen!!  I have been watching the heavens since my first sighting in 1991 when my car was approached by a solid white orb and I was left with 1.5 hours of missing time...as was the passenger in my vehicle that night.  To have seen something flying that high and appearing only slightly larger than any of the other stars that were visible through the coud cover, it suggests that the object may have been quite large.  It did not twinkle like other stars and to have covered such a large area of the skies, I am inclined to believe that this was a UFO.  I am wondering if anyone in the area saw the same thing I did?((END))", "Fireballs performing amazing feats.Around 8 p.m.  I was alerted to check out the UFO&apos;s outside the house. There were 4 round orbs and they were basically the color of fire. One moved over the neighborhood and seemed fairly close, perhaps as low as 2000 feet, but it did not seem  to be terribly high over the rooftops in the neighborhood. Rather than acting shocked or suprised, I tried to observe carefully along with the other witnesses. These objects made absolutely NO sound. No helicopter sounds. No sounds of a plane or jet. No sound whatsoever. They would hover and then move in linear directions, occasionally gaining in elevation. But they would not &quot;bob&quot; or &quot;bounce&quot; as they moved. They traveled a slow but still manner. They seemed to exercise control in their movement. At one point the other three traveled further away and up into the night sky becoming smaller and presumably more distant. At this point two of these orbs dissapeared. They did not fade out, but simply disappeared. The effect was like holding a lit match and then blowing it out. That quick. The third object continued to travel away off into space until it was no longer visible to us. Then the last remaining one which at one point seemed so close appeared to drop three little balls of light while it was moving.  Yet as these little orbs were released they would dissapear maybe 1 to 1 and1/2 seconds after being dropped. Finally this last object  took off up into the night sky and was gone in barely second. According to one of the witnesses who is one of my family members, there were other people along the street watching this event take place. We all agreed it was very strange and that the objects appeared to be under some sort of control. In my opinion, if these were man made then our technology has definitely jumped into the 25th century.", "Slow moving &quot;falling satr&quot; at 30 degree angle west to eastwhile waking my dog at aprox. 7:27 pm I saw what I first thought was a meteor.

PD))", "Georgia MUFON Investigation-Large Dark TriangleOn 8Jan04 Tom Sheets, the State Director for MUFON of Georgia, received a report regarding the below described event that occurred the previous night.  The witness is a 57 YOA female resident of Duluth Georgia, employed by an internationally famous Atlanta area university. Witness is from a &quot;scientific&quot; family, her father being involved in atomic research during the WW II era.  On 7Jan04 at about 7:30PM, witness was enroute home, driving through her neighborhood. The witness indicated she had been enjoying the beautiful weather and full moon and as she prepared to turn onto her street she noticed overhead a set of bright lights beginning to glide past. She added that she was caught off guard by this, and upon looking closer noticed that the lights were attached to the bottom of a LARGE DARK TRIANGULAR CRAFT (WUFOD &quot;Actual Size&quot; data field entry indicating 101-300 feet).  She continued watching, then turned onto her street, keeping it in sight. Witness&apos; stated that her first impression was a LARGE &quot;stealth type&quot; craft. She described the craft as being VERY LOW in altitude (treetop), with no sound noticed (vehicle windows rolled up). Witness indicated that it was low enough that she had no trouble observing a &quot;suction cup&quot; like configuration around the steady white lights, one in the middle and also one on each corner, totalling four. At that point, it was traveling parallel to her and a little bit ahead (appx. 40mph). She sped up, but it appeared to be going a bit faster than her vehicle. The craft then began to ascend, it banked slightly to the left, and departed the scene. Simultaneous to the above, the witness was attempting to get out her cell phone in order to summon her friend to run outside and look skyward, but the phone was dropped onto the floorboard. She noticed two neighbors outside at the end of the street and intends on speaking with them ASAP. Within a few minutes, the witness arrived home and called the local police, Atlanta&apos;s Channel 11 (NBC) and Atlanta&apos;s Fernbank Science Center........all to no avail, as they had no information or additional reports.  As with all such preliminary reports carried in &quot;MUFONGA Updates&quot;, this case requires additional scrutiny in order to vet the witness and attempt to determine the cause. This witness has agreed to a sit-down with our investigators and the case is in the process of being assigned to SSD/FI David Brown of Norcross.  David Brown, MUFONGA&apos;s State Section for the NE area of the greater metro Atlanta area, did in fact contact this witness.  She agreed to meet with him on 10Jan04 to complete the paperwork, make a statement, and provide a sketch of what was observed.  David found the witness was indeed employed in a managerial position on the staff of a world renowned Atlanta area university. Said facility having a history of close association and participation in technical government projects and various scientific disciplines. Witness was ascertained to be a well educated person, and seemed to be very concise and observant. She repeated her account in person to David and during this detailed debriefing, added additional details as to what occurred.  The duration of the event was about 5 minutes, occurring as the witness drove through her neighborhood, made a few turns, and all the while keeping the object in view.  It dissappeared for a  brief few moments, but the terrain and direction of travel brought it back into clear view.  She added that it was just over the treetops, which was determined by FI Brown to be flying at about 150 feet in altitude. Shortly before it banked and departed the area, she got a good view of the underside.  The witness stated to David Brown that there was a LARGE ROUND white light at each corner and one in the center, seemingly like FLOURESCENT TUBES, with a surrounding structure that made them appear like &quot;SUCTION CUPS&quot;.  While the triangle was dark, it did seem to be of the gray shade (it was that close and well lighted).  She noticed no sound, but her windows were up and the radio  playing. Weather was clear, about 35 degrees, calm, CAVU.  FI Brown&apos;s follow-up included contacting the Police Department which verified that she had called to report the event, but that no officer was dispatched.Atlanta&apos;s Channel 11 (NBC) did not refer any other witnesses to MUFONGA during that time frame, nor were any concurrent similar events reported directly to this SD.  FI Brown also spoke with PIO personnel at Dobbins AFB which is about 25 miles west of the event location, also authorities at Atlanta&apos;s Hartsfield Airport. They provided no information.  MUFONGA has considered in this case, a fly-over of the much discussed/rumored experimental government &quot;lighter than air&quot; craft. No blazing speed or incredible manuevers were reported in this event.......BUT......why would such a &quot;legitimate&quot; (though possibly experimental) aircraft be flying at treetop level over a densely populated area at night?  Crew training?  Equipment testing? Operational/navigation training?  After reviewing FI Brown&apos;s investigation, this writer is of the opinion that this craft was yet another of the mysterious triangles as reported from all over the USA and Georgia (See NUFORC reports sorted by craft shape).  Please note that the witness in this case was found to be VERY CREDIBLE, requesting to remain anonymous due to the  sensitive nature of her position and occupation.  We&apos;ve classified this craft as an official &quot;UNKNOWN&quot; in MUFON&apos;s WUFOD (World UFO Database).  This writer and the rest of MUFON of Georgia wish to take this opportunity to thank Peter Davenport and the NUFORC for continuing to provide this additional database for use by the Georgia chapter (and others) in it&apos;s continuing investigation and research.

As I told you in my last e-mail back in the 1970s I think it was 1978 or 1979 I had just turned 18 years old as well as many of my friends that I grew up with in Dorchester, Massachusetts. When we all got of age we decided to take a cross country road trip to California, so 4 of us went cross country on a Greyhound bus to San Diego California to see just what the west coast was all about. It took us about 5 days to reach California from Boston and before we ever heard anything about UFO&apos;s we found out after being in San Diego for only 2 days. We all shared a motel room and on our second night in California we were watching the local news in San Diego. The news reporter said that thousands of calls were coming into the news station as people were reporting sightings over the area of Palo Alto, California. The strange thing was no T.V. footage was shown and it must have been the government trying to cover it all up. The people reporting the sightings said they saw huge discs hovering over Palo Alto in the middle of the day and it was starting to cause panic for some people. I do remember the news people saying that it was not a good idea for people to travel up to Palo Alto because of too much traffic from all of the on lookers. All of us at the motel just thought it was strange and never gave it any thought after hearing the report on TV. Well we stayed in San Diego for about 3 weeks before we all decided to head back to Massachusetts, so we did. We pooled our money together and bought a 1968 Dodge Charger for the big trip home so we could have more freedom than being stuck on a bus for the next 5 days. We left California during the late night hours so the car would not overheat during the day as we crossed through the areas of desert. Well all was fine until we crossed into the area of Arizona known as the Black Hills. We had to drive over a mountain range that seemed to take hours to get over, once we were headed down hill to the desert areas and level highway we noticed something very strange indeed. We saw 3 blue beautiful lights ahead of us, they were the color of cobalt blue like the old vicks salve jars. It seemed that no matter how far we drove the lights were always in the same location in the sky ahead of us. We decided to pull over and get out to see if these lights were aircraft or radio towers as it was hard to tell moving at 70 miles per hour in a car. Once we pulled over we got out for a closer look and noticed that these blue lights did not make a sound at all and they were in the same exact spot as an hour before when we first spotted them in the sky. Another strange fact is that we were the only car on the highway at the time and not even a truck or anything was spotted during this time. So we got back in the car and drove for almost another hour before pulling over once again because the lights were still in the sky in the same location as before. We started getting a little nervous and wondered if this was what the people in Palo Alto have been seeing. We decided to turn on the car radio to find out if anybody had called in anything about what we were seeing in the Arizona desert but as fate would have it the radio was nothing but static on all stations. We just thought we were so far away from the nearest radio station and that was why we could not get any music or news on the radio. We all looked at each other in shock asking one other if we all saw the same blue lights and if we could still see them, we all said yes to that. After a few minutes my friend who was driving decided to turn off the car head lights and shut off the engine and as soon as he did we then became instant believers of UFO&apos;s because when he turned off the lights the 3 cobalt blue lights that looked as if they were at least 500 feet apart from each other began to move towards each other until the 3 lights became one large blue light that headed away from us and then went upwards at the speed of a shooting star. My many thanks to the witness for the sighting report.

This siting was over 50 years ago and I had one other UFO siting of a disk shape ship flying over Tacoma in 1957 which is posted elsewhere. Since that time I have not seen a UFO. The date is an estimate. I was in junior high and it was a summer softball program.My friend and I stayed after practice to hit balls. After hitting the ball and looking up while watching it I noticed the spheres and told my friend to do the same.We first thought that it was a military exercise but when we arrived home and listened to a local radio station there were a lot of people calling in about this siting so we also did and they told us that there were more than 100 people that called in.((NUFORC Note:  One of two good reports from the same witness.

The object was about 1/2 mile from us. We thought it was an airplane coming at us but as we got closer we noticed it was not moving. Why I did this is beyond me now, but I pulled up next to it and stopped. It was hovering above the ditch in the exact location where the main entrance to Carl Sandburg College is located now. The college campus didn&apos;t exist there in 1967. My fiancee opened her door and stood on the pavement looking at it. I leaned towards her open door then got out my side also. A beam of light like a spotlight came on and shown at an angle down on the ground to the west then it slowly moved off tinto that direction.  The object was approximately ten feet to our right and 20 feet in the air so we were very close to it. It  sounded like a huge vacum cleaner. There was no air movement, like blade wash liike from a helicopter, nor was it an airplane. We drove down to a corner and turned south just in time to see it accelerate then shoot straight up into the air in southwesternly direction, and at an incredible speed. A police report was filed and an officer went back to the area later that night with me. There had been a few  strange lights observed in and around Galesburg a few days before, and one hoax where a few guys floated a large balloon with a light attached to it, over town. This was no balloon., airplane, helicopter, or experimental aircraft...not in 1967.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I said to my two friends do you see that? They didn&apos;t at first untill I pointed right at it as it past by us.Then they said yes we see it.We could see the stars in the sky in between them, they apeard to be three seperet objects but they moved at the exact same time &amp; speed as they turned &amp; they keped the same distance from each other.As they headed North they apeared to pick up speed to what looked like over 300 kts &amp; faded as they got farther away.That night it was calm and clear skies.They again made no sound,no wind from passing us &amp; no exsaust of any kind.It was not something we could explain &amp; it gave me goose bumps. I found it to be more fastinating then scary.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))", "I really didn&apos;t think much of my nephew saying he wanted to use the telescope to view what someone had told him might be a satellite. That is until I went to put the garbage can out by the edge of the road. Off to the north west was a very bright circular object, 2 to 3 times brighter a larger than the north star. As I watched this object it slowly moved to the north. All of a sudden, it took off like a rocket for about a half a second. It slowed down, then it started moving south. It slowly moved south for a few seconds then it turned moving back towards the north again. At times it would be like it was hanging in the night sky swinging like a pendulum. It would go in all directions, like someone scribbling on a piece of paper. It also had faint blinking colors such as you would see with the stars. Occasionally you could see what looked liked a tail from a comet. At about 9:45 Eastern time I walked back outside and the object was nowhere in sight. Another thing I should point out is that my nephew said he has seen it for the last couple of days. Even first thing in the morning when they were heading to school. I don&apos;t know If anybody else has seen such an object. Additional information:  The object was low in the sky, taking a guess would say at a level of approx. 25 to 30 deg. This morn. I woke up about 4:45 to get ready for work. And the object is back in the sky. This time at a more easterly direction and at an approx. angle of about 60 deg. There was no indication of any type of craft, even through our telescope it only looked like a circular bright, white light with blinking colors(red, green, and blue.) The tail I was speaking of was not visible at all times. It would just appear randomly. Even through the telescope you could just make out the tail occasionally.

I&apos;m 43 and have had three encounters I can recall very clearly . Two were in the middle of the night both at tree top level. Number two of my three sightings was a red-orange glowing ball that passed slow and soundless overhead . The third and last was at 3am on a warm and clear florida night . As I pulled into my driveway ,getting back from work, I noticed a bright 5-foot ball of light weaving through the sky over my house. I lived out in the country in Florida this was in 2001 at the time.As I got out of my van I continued to keep my eye on this &quot;thing&quot;. It seemed to be alive as it flew over my home and then over the trees zigging and zagging the whole time(it was having a good time I felt).This sphere was a dense ultra white ball,completly soundless with obvious itelligence.  Soon it must of noticed I was watching it because it darted quickly away flying straight over the Australian pines surrounding my home out in Jupiter Farms(the inland rural quiet stacks, Burt Reynolds and Lonnie lived down the street a while back...for what its worth!)as it and sped away it&apos;s body got brighter and left a tail or trail that streghthed a extra few feet.Oh yes , it also grew in size a foot or two as soon as it began to leave...I clearly startled it is what it appeared to me!I stood there shocked and amazed of course and hoped it would return. Perhaps 5-10 minutes later this bright ball of intelligent light now came slowly over the same  trees it had dissapeared over before and then dropped down so it was now only 20-50 ft above my head !!!  I froze...slowly it passed right over my head and then in what seemed like slow motion began to cloak it self before my eyes. I was able to get a good look at it floated by me and did see a outline from it for a couple seconds before it was completly gone! Soon I had the feeling I was being watched so for the next twenty or so minutes I just stood outside looking at the stars. Sure enough over head I saw a white light the size of a medium star traveling at impossible speeds pass ! right over me high in the sky.It flew west to east then and before while it was partying over my home it took off south and returnedto me heading north. Fantastic, the better of the three I have seen to date.

At first it was motionless then very quickly it went left and stopped with precision. At this time is when a second similar object moved very fast next to it. They both were motionless then after a few seconds the first object went upwards very fast, while the second one went left then straight upwards. These objects were very precise and fast.

It looked like going down to earth in a South-West direction, I lost it behind the houses, awaiting a big crashing noise but nothing at all. I first saw It at about the same altitude as commercial planes usually fly when they are on approach to the Airport, it happened so quickly that it is really hard to be precise with the altitude but this is what I remember. I decided to go to the backroad of Ottawa Airport since the ball was seen going toward it. No sign of the event but a few cars driving around the airport in the same direction. I&apos;m sure lot of people saw it, this is a very clear night, cristal clear with a few light clouds floating quickly pushed by the strong wind. I&apos;m sure the Airport radar caught it and the Canadian Forces station Letrim too, these two being very close from the place we were at the moment. Two big commercial airplanes size of a Airbus 320 arrived at the moment I was on the airport backroad Letrim and there were some more on approach from a distance.((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of the fireball seen over Canada.

I could not see what the lights were attached to. I would guess the craft was about 200 yards wide from my vantagepoint.The 6 orbs seemed to rotate through colors from left to right, shimmering.They remained in formation, stationary, and (one to another) for 5min. 13sec.Until they vanished out of sight, as quickly as they had appeared.The lights never changed their position in the sky, to each other or the area.I have taken thousands of photos, with the same camera, from the same hill, for over 5 years, and have never seen anything like it before. I have lived in North County more than 31 years and have never seen Camp Pendleton (Marine Corps Base) produce any similar visual displays while commencing military exercises. I also grew up next to Oceanside Airport, in addition to spending many hours at Miramar Top Gun School watching all the various types of planes. So I know what different craft look like in the night sky. In my opinion, these 6 lights are not ours!((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the several photographs, provided by the witness, and they show 5-6 unidentifiable lights, oriented horizontally.  We do not know what the lights are, although we believe that military flares may be a possibility.  However, the witness indicates that he thinks that flares are not a possibility, since the lights remained stationary, and they didn&apos;t exhibit any smoke.

It soared across our view very fast and then disappeared. There was no trail like those you would see after a meteor. Afterwards I got out of the car and heard a jet fly over head.  We were in the car video taping my friend and telling jokes because he just broke his shoulder in a snowboarding accident. The camera was angled down too far to see the object unfortunately however he did catch our reactions on tape which is pretty funny. I received a voicemail from a friend the next morning that she had left for me the night before. She was traveling around Virginia and leaving me a long message, in the middle of her message she stopped suddenly and said &quot;Oh my God something just flew through the sky really fast.  I think I just saw my first UFO! But maybe it was a shooting star, I can&apos;t really be sure...&quot;  Then in the midst of another message she had left minutes later she stopped again and said &quot;What the hell this is freaky I just saw something fly across the sky again really really fast!&quot;  When we spoke the next day she had no idea that I had a sighting the same night in a totally different state. I questioned her objectively without leading her to answer any question any specific way. She said the object had no trail, when she first saw it, it flew downwards, then the next time was horizontal.  She said it was a yellowish light.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))", "Speeding Ball of LightI just finished witnessing something I have never seen before. I was outside having a cigarette when I noticed a satelite going by from South travelling north. Then I noticed a really bright light coming from the West heading East.

(which parallels the ocean shore) from Chestnut St. at approx 5 pm looking due west over the Pacific Ocean about 60 degrees in the sky I observed a horizontal thin light with 4 barely visible light streaks emanating up from it. At arms length the length of the light was about 1 inch. I looked for strobe lights or other indications that it was a plane or other terrestrial craft, but saw none. I stopped and got out of my car and asked a couple walking along the street what they thought and they said they had noticed it but didn&apos;t know what it could be. As I turned and drove north on Carlsbad Bl., the object moved north as well. It seemed to stay at about the same angle to/from me. After a mile I stopped again, completely awestruck at this obvious UFO (wht else could it be?) in broad daylight. At a Starbuck&apos;s near where I stopped, I approached a guy drinking coffee and pointed to the object. He said sometimes there is a kind of light blimp that goes along trhe coast but it doesn&apos;t look like that. He said he thought it might be a comet, but I mentioned there was no tail and it seemed to move at irregular speeds/intervals. Anyway, I got back in the car, drove north a few more miles, observing the object. I stopped one more time and pulled out a pair of binoculars (7X50) that I have in the car. Through the bonoculars it was hard to focus and it didn&apos;t give much of a better view, which leaves me to speculate that it was a huge cigar shaped or rectangular ship, way far away. I&apos;ve heard of ships supposedly hundreds and even thousands of miles long and this could one of those that was hundreds of thousands or even millions of miles away.", "yesterday night i was having a ciggarette it was a clear cold night when i noticed a very bright light which i thought must have been a low flying plane, it looked like it was getting closer then it quickly turned, and i saw what looked like a diamond shape with the bright light at the front, at the top was a green light but that was not flashing. then at the bottom a orangelight which was also not flashing. the back light was flashing that was white but not as bright as the front light.the lights on it must have been bright because i saw the wings of the craft outlined by the light the wings were a very sharp traingle with a haze around it. as i saw it go behind trees i noticed another light which i thought was simply a plane, but it couldnt have been because with out slowing down it suddenly stopped and hovered for about 20 minutes. i wouldnt have noticed it if it hadnt been moving because once it stopped it just looked like a star.the movements were just too fast to have been any of our aircraft. i must of seen something i wasnt supposed to have.", "whitish neon-green orb of light with a tailDay/Night: Nighttime Duration: 2-3 seconds No. of Objects: Single No. of Witnesses, including self: 1  Was walking down Pacific Street toward Flatbush Ave in Brooklyn, NY.

At about 8pm I was approximately 15 miles north of Buffalo, TX. Ahead, at what I would guess to be 2-3 miles south of me, I saw a bright green light appear out of nowhere, at what appeared to be a few hundred feet above the treeline. Immediately it dropped down at a moderate pace behind the trees. Slow enough that I saw it drop for 2-3 seconds before disappearing. Size is difficult to estimate, but it appeared to be about 3x the size of the headlights of the northbound vehicles directly across the median from me. What was most unusual is that the green color was lime green and very florescent. Additionally, when I got to the area where I could see where I believed the light to have disappeared, there was only open field, no houses or roads or signs of people in the area.", "Did I see an Aurora contrail?there were several people that saw it, a dental team out of Conchias (San Ysidro), Honduras. It was well after dark, c.10:00 PM on a very clear night.  I was on a balcony contemplating the days activities trying to plan the day ahead. I was the leader of the team so they knew my voice and the inflections, and they responded immediately even though they were tired and trying to go to sleep.

I don&apos;t know the length of time, but it was a long enough time to watch it for a moment and recognize that it was out of place for a jungle environment, call out for people to come a see, for them to get up off of mat on a floor (they were tired and beat up from the days activities), and get out to the balcony to see what a lunatic was hollering about, and get tired eyes to focus.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Observed crop circles while being made........Well this is a story that happened a while back I am now 33 and was 14 when this happened,I have never told this story due to the ridicule I would have recieved.  I was walking with my dog as we did this every morning at about 7:00 AM,we always walked around the edge of the field because we did not want to get wet from the dew in the field that early in the morning,...well it just so happened that on the way back,my dog Whiskers, ran a little forward with his ears perked up, I had seen him do this lots of times before whenever he saw or smelled something, then I heard it too.  It was a vibrating whistling sound not very loud but loud enough that you could hear it at about 20 yards or so, so trying to see where this noise was coming from I headed in the direction of the sound and there to my amazement was a blue see-through sphere about a foot in diameter and I remember thinking how beautiful this light was, (if this would have happened in the dark I could only imagine how much of the area it would have lit up as its brightness was astounding)it was about 6 inches below the top of the wheat field,looking like it was going crazy flying in an amazing pattern seeming like it was doing something with reason, it took all of about 3 minutes, I couldn&apos;t tell what it was doing.  Then after what was about the most bizarre flying I have ever seen it went up to a level of about ten to fifteen feet in the air and just hovered there for what seemed about 10 to 15 minutes, it then flew along the top of the field in a northern direction not very fast until it was about 200 yards away then with amazing speed it went straight up until you could not see it any more.  Whiskers and I and ran over to the spot where this blue sphere had been and I was totally surprized at what I seen and smelled, it was two perfectly round circles joined together at the sides, the wierd thing was that the wheat around us was totally soaking wet and the wheat inside the circles was completely dry,not warm or anything but still ! none the less completely dry,and to top that off there was this sour tingy smell that even when Whiskers was smelling he would jerk his head backwards as if the smell had burnt his nose. I went and got my Father and told him my story and I think he thought I was crazy until I took him to the sight where it actually happened, I think he was more amazed than I was,he said he had heard of it before but never believed it either..... then he had to get away from the circles though because he said the smell was choking him I remember him telling me to measure them out with his tape measure which I did and found each to be 26 feet in circumfrence right on the nose. I was told not to talk about this incident because dad didn&apos;t want people thinking we were crazy..I have never seen this again until I had recently seen this t.v show about crop circles so there you have it I really don&apos;t care what people think because I know what I saw and so does my father and my dog Whiskers , so thank you for taking the time to read this and enjoy.", "Phoenix/Anthem AZ Lights March 25, 2004.It was just after dark on Thursday, March 25, 2004, when my husband and I were sitting in our back yard watching the stars when we observed a long, cigar shaped, tubular object with colored lights - many colors,not just a couple like a plane - and it was traveling slowly over the horizon in a Northeast trajectory. It was extremely large, possibly as large as a football field. It was definitely much too large to be an airplane. Neither of us have ever seen a UFO before and we both were shocked at how big this flying object was. We observed it flying fairly low, just over a residential area near Phoenix and then disappeared behind some mountains. We did not make a report to authorities but still we are in awe over what we saw. We are both educated individuals and not the type of people to make something like this up. My husband did observe the object through binoculars but I just observed it with the naked eye. It was enormous and had many colors changig on it from red, blue, yellow, green etc. We know there have been lights reported in the Phoenix area that were V shaped, but this was a long tube of colored lights. Fascinating!", "VERY bright, diamond shapeMy husband and I were leaving my parents house a few miles east of Lynchburg, VA. at about 9:30p.m. tonight.  We noticed a VERY bright light, very close to the back of my parents home, not too high in the air but larger and brighter than any other thing in the sky.  At first, I thought it was just an air plane, but then my husband noticed it as we were backing out of the driveway and asked me if I saw that strange light in the sky.  We then noticed it was a diamond shape with small beams of light shining out of it from both sides.  As we traveled towards our home in Lynchburg, about 14 miles, it got even brighter then we noticed it started to travel away from us as it got dimmer.  I also noticed a small puff of smoke just when it started to move away. We watched it even after we got home for about 5 more minutes as it traveled further away from us.  Then about 10 minutes later we looked out at it again and it was as small as the other stars in the sky but it was very red at that point.  Then about 15 minutes later, it was just gone.  We are not sure what exactly it was, but it was definitely a diamond, very bright, unlike anything either of us has ever seen in the sky before.((NUFORC Note:  The witness does not indicate the direction they were looking, but her description is not inconsistent with a sighting of Venus, we observe.

She was heading north in her car and looked up and saw in the blue sky a shiny metallic looking object. It was round and moving in a straight path. She said it appeared to be large and far off in the distance. She wondered why she was seeing this and took her eyes off it... when she looked back up it was gone or had moved behind some trees. Probably of no coincidence... she was also as the time just starting to have some emotional problems as she got dumped by her boyfriend. So she was in a different state of mind that what you would consider normal.", "V Shaped Lights.Photos can be viewed at: http://www.hbccufo.com/index.php  I have continued to see various assorted craft off and on for well, years. Tonights craft was particulary interesting because of the apparent shape. Which was different to me. I noticed a bright flash and went for my camera. The lights hovered in the eastern sky for about 5 minutes and then diappeared by imploding or shutting off all at once. Let me know what enhancements might show on this. Additional Information Below&quot;  In describing the brilliant flash - I would say an electric white/blue, as lightening. In describing movement &ndash; It would be best to say it was like something that had been moving very fast and suddenly stopping. It had a hanging sense to it as if an unstable slight spin. The turning was slow and it gave an appearance of adjusting the actual lights. The lights appeared to have a sequencing effect. To say they went from odd positions to a more uniform alignment. After they came into &lsquo;straight line&rsquo; forming a V with an odd nose. A &lsquo;W&rsquo; type of nose. Then they just faded down and a quick white/blue flash and it was gone. I do not know what direction it came from. I can only say it &lsquo;materialised&rsquo; in the eastern sky. With the exception of maneuvering the lights it made no drastic moves. I do not know which way it went because it seemed to implode or leave in the manner in which it appeared. Flash and gone. The sky was clear. All other natural and satellite features were in normal placement. The temperature was in the 20&rsquo;sF. Slight breeze. To take a wild guess as to elevation of object I would say just above small craft path. The placement was toward the lake. I think it was above the lake. The lake is 7 blocks east downhill from my home. To describe structure I would call it a very interesting bit of &lsquo;piecework&rsquo;. I mean to say it was not in alignment when it first &lsquo;appeared&rsquo;. It performed some kind of structuring act. It may be best to call it W shaped. I say that because though it was V in overall shape, at least by the manipulating of the lights it also formed an indent like the W or a ^ at the V center. I did not detect any sound other then a humming sensation at the top of my head. Myself and my dog and cat were the witnesses for this that I am aware of. The cat a HUGE Orange Tom Tabby went to the west in the bit of thicket to hunt. The dog a miniature Schnauzer/Lhasa (Benji) was mildly distressed. He could hear something and wanted to go into the house. He growled for sometime but that could be because he does not like his cat to be hunting in the dark! We have sighted strange black dogs&hellip;they look like hienna&rsquo;s in stature, they stalk the deer trail through the west hillside. Thank you for your time. I bring this one up because its shape was new to me. I see allot of oval shaped objects and Spheres. Orbs abound! I stand contrary to ALL digital orbs being Blurfos. I have seen hundreds of orbs pass through this part of the world. They can be seen with the naked eye. They are not an aftershot. Another words they are there before a picture is even taken. I have seen &lsquo;cloud&rsquo; forms in a number of locations in this area. They appear to be intelligent and have a set purpose what that purpose is&hellip;I do not profess to know!  Hope all is well or as well as can be for you and yours Brian. Thank you to the witness for the report. HBCC UFO Is following up on this report.

It moved in a linear, smooth, rapid motion -- faster than a small plane. It was estimated to be 1-3 miles from the observers, traveling towards the southeast, and seemingly moving lower in altitude. It was &quot;fairly covered&quot; with a number of white lights, uniformly positioned. Most lights were not blinking; a few were pulsing on and off.

I was about 7 or 8 at the time my parents and i were traveling home one night and when we were close to home my father noticed some lights in a field ahead of us. as we got closer we could see a very large craft hovering above a field. We stopped and my dad says i am getting out to get closer and i said im going with you dad. we walked toward the object and got within 50 feet of it it was huge. I would say it measured about 300 feet in length and height wise was about80 to 100 feet. It was saucer shaped with windows going all around the middle.  I remember looking up through the windows and the inside was just the purest white i have ever seen as far as lighting goes. the outside was pure silver and underneath was a light that glowed. then i noticed figures coming up to the windows.  I started to get frightened and walked back to the car and stood by the passenger side by my mom and it appeared as though she was frozen i tried talking to her but she said nothing. i said come on dad lets go and he never answered me just stood in one place staring. then it took off made no sound but i heard like a rush of air as it moved at an unbelievable amount of speed and disappeared.  Then we got back in the truck and drove to our house on elk lake. After getting home we went into our basement and looked out over the lake and witnessed the craft hovering in the same spot , it had red and green lights emulating from the bottom. I remember looking at the clock and seeing that it was 12:00 midnight excactly.  My dad said he was going back and i said i was tired and going to bed.  We never talked about it the next day and went about our business as though nothing ever happened. Within the last 8 years it has been increasingly been on my mind and now being 32 i am curious as to what happened that night. I asked my mom about it and she says that i was in the car the whole time.  Thinking about the time i dont think it was that late, i mean my parents usually had me home in bed by 9 or 10 at the latest all the time .  I have since have repeated nightmares of being taken and am not sure what is going on.  I haven&apos;t really told anyone about this other than a very few close friends and fiance.  I cant say for sure that i am a recipient of an abduction but i know what we saw that day and i believe we had some serious missing time.  I would like to go under hypnosis but am scared of what i may recover from that day.((NUFORC Note:  We have written the witness, requesting that his parents submit reports of their recollections, as well.

The area howver does have heavy aircraft traffic with Pgh. Int. airport to the north and Morgantown, WV regional airport to the south, but the aircraft are easily identifiable in our location. The object we suspect to be Venus was not an aircraft as we know them.", "While I was driving on interstate 270, right at the intersection of 25 and 270, I saw in the distance a large very black object that looked square. Its location seemed to be some distance east of the intersection of parker and 270 ( 5 miles away). It rotated as I looked at it and seemed to have a brown edge to it. I went under a bridge and then looked again and there was a small cloud where to object was(?).

PD))", "A weeks reports, one witnesses sightings.Received Report: February 14, 2004 The Week of February from the 8 to the 12  The following report has been difficult to put into description. I have never seen this before and it is hard to describe something to others without comparing it to familiar things. I have very little to compare it to except science fiction and special effects that have been in popular movies. I live Vernon facing west. My view has a ridge of hills about 900 to 1200 ft on either side. In the centre is the airport and moving west further is a small inlet leading to Okanagan Lake. On the other side of Okanagan lake are mountains. The current events are taking place on the north ridge of the airport in the western direction. Monday  Tonight at 8:10 pm a &quot;star&quot; rose vertically over the ridge. The &quot;star&quot; was a bright white and golden light surrounded by a bubble (aura) reflecting the inner swirling colors, of green, blue, orange and pink. This light moved vertically to about an angle of 30 degrees in the sky. It moved horizontally south to hover over the down slope of the hill. Inside of the bubble the &quot;light&quot; expanded to a large spinning ball of flame orange color. It then changed into what appeared to resemble a vehicle with two headlights, changed back to the ball and then to the vehicle. After the changes the bubble disappeared. The size of the bubble is of a pencil eraser held at arms length and the distance from me is about 7 k. This happened in the time it takes to blink three times. The two large headlights had one green flashing light on one side and two flashing red lights on the other suggesting a shape of a vehicle. I do not get enough time to get a shape of the body but it does not reflect any light as does the body of an airplane. The vehicle hovered then the headlights turned away from me and headed south slower than an airplane can fly at landing. Wednesday  Tonight at 6:30 pm in the same area as the other sighting a large cloud lit up like a patio lantern with white light. The two lights appeared coming out of the cloud near the top of the cloud. The headlights moved slowly over the same area as the other and then the lights were switched off. The lights were switched on and the vehicle turned south. As I watched the flashing red lights head south, the flashers were switched off. Thursday  Tonight at 6:30 pm, two headlights crested the hill. Tonight it was different as the &quot;vehicle&quot; seemed to be outlined in a webbing of strung golden yellow lights reminding me of Christmas lights. There was still no detail of the vehicle but it was covered in this netting effect. It rose to about 40 degrees in the sky, moved south into the valley and stopped. The golden glow dimmed and three large circular lights in triangular formation came on underneath the vehicle. I watched it slowly head south and could see it until it dissappeared over the top of the hill and highway 97 to Kelowna. It was followed by alot of flashing red and green lights,suggesting something huge or several of the smaller ones described above. Thank you to the witness for the report.

They were a slate color and very smooth in appearance.  The atmosphere around them sort of &quot;shimmered,&quot; but it was definitely not exhaust. This whirring noise stopped and my wife&apos;s hair became statically charged and she turned a bit pale.  I immediately ran into the store and dialed 911 where I was immediately treated with disbelief.  Amazing . . .  I told the attendant and she ran out with me, but the objects had gone.

It appeared to be travelling at a phenomenal speed but it was difficult to tell how far away it was. It seemed to be travelling in an arc like it may have been following the earth&apos;s curvature.

As they traveled along Highway # 16 east and passed a well known tourist spot called Bednesti Lake, the passenger, the husband&apos;s wife, commented to her husband about where a light was coming from? A white light seemed to be reflecting off the hood of their car. When she first took notice of the light it wasn&apos;t all that bright, but what got her wondering was they were traveling in a totally darkened out area along the highway. As they drove along the light grew brighter and brighter. It was engulfing the vehicle. The husband started slowing down because the bright light was actually making it difficult to continue. The passenger got up the nerve to lean forward and look out and up to see where the light source was coming from. All the lady was able to see was a beam of light, or just a brightenss which had engulfed the whole vehicle at this point. She said it was blinding to her eyes and it stayed right with them. The witness said whatever it was followed them for a number of kilometers down the highway. Finally, because it was exceedingly difficult to see where they were headed, the husband pulled the car over to the side of the road, got out and as soon as he did the light went out. They did not hear any sound at all. They even thought it was a helicopter when it first appeared, but got very frightened as it paced with them for so long. When the couple finally arrived home safely, they got up the next morning, the wife turned on the radio and while listening in she heard a news story about a man who called the radio station to report seeing an unusual beam of light shining down onto the highway the night before. Of course, the man who had made the report had no idea what the couple had experienced. This incident happened a number of years ago, but it was still very fresh in the ladies mind when she was telling me the story. The woman mentioned it was very overcast that evening. Even when the passenger looked up through the front windshield the light was so bright it was to hard to see anything. It was extremely difficult to know if there was a craft of some sort above them, if it was below or above the cloud ceiling. I was told it must have been a narrow beam as it did not light up much of the surrounding area, but mainly lit up the outside, and inside of the car.

At arms length the length of the light was about 1 inch. I looked for strobe lights or other indications that it was a plane or other terrestrial craft, but saw none. I stopped and got out of my car and asked a couple walking along the street what they thought and they said they had noticed it but didn&apos;t know what it could be. As I turned and drove north on Carlsbad Bl., the object moved north as well. It seemed to stay at about the same angle to/from me. After a mile I stopped again, completely awestruck at this obvious UFO (wht else could it be?) in broad daylight. At a Starbuck&apos;s near where I stopped, I approached a guy drinking coffee and pointed to the object. He said sometimes there is a kind of light blimp that goes along trhe coast but it doesn&apos;t look like that. He said he thought it might be a comet, but I mentioned there was no tail and it seemed to move at irregular speeds/intervals. Anyway, I got back in the car, drove north a few more miles, observing the object. I stopped one more time and pulled out a pair of binoculars (7X50) that I have in the car. Through the bonoculars it was hard to focus and it didn&apos;t give much of a better view, which leaves me to speculate that it was a huge cigar shaped or rectangular ship, way far away.

I never broke my gaze, from the moment it caught my eye. It grew very bright (almost pure white...brilliant) and then arced-off, for lack of a better description.  It looked as though it &apos;rolled around&apos; and I lost complete sight of the object.  My best attempt at describing how it disappeared was that it looked like a very small eclipse.  I verified that there were very few clouds in the area, if at all.  The nearby &apos;star&apos; on the left didn&apos;t change much throughout the whole ordeal (I suppose it was a true star). After it &apos;turned off&apos;, I quickly scanned the sky for reference points.  From my best guess (sorry I&apos;m not more specific) I would say that this observance was in the NW sky area.  I saw the open &apos;scoop&apos; of the Big Dipper point up toward the North Star and noticed that the light I clearly saw, was off-alignment, over toward the NW (as the scoop-alignment pointed off toward my upper left).  This event happened off to my upper right. When we returned, and all during our driving time to and from our destination, I kept scanning the sky for any oddities.  I saw none. Perhaps someone else in the middle TN area saw something similar?((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "While I realize this is reaching a bit far back, I believe this is an important sighting, and should be reported. It was around 11:00 PM on a fall night in 1970.  I lived in an apartment house in New York City&apos;s Lower East Side.  A number of friends in the building had dropped in, and it seemed that a casual party was taking place.  It was a tiny apartment, and quickly filled up with cigarette smoke.  I suggested that we all go up to the roof to chat, where there was more oxygen available.  We all grabbed our drinks and smokes and paraded up three flights to the roof.  Everyone was talking at once, having a good time.  I noticed that the sky had a very dark, high overcast, and there were no stars visible at all.  In a few minutes, I saw that the moon had risen, and was near the horizon behind a little storm cloud with lightning going on in it, which was odd since no other clouds were visible. I remember nothing else until I became aware of the fact that all of the people I was with were silent, staring blankly at the rooftop, and I was the only one who seemed conscious. Then, all at once everyone began talking as if there had been no break in the conversation at all.  I saw that the moon was much higher, and on the opposite side of the sky, but that it still had the little storm around it, with lightning.  Suddenly everyone had to get to bed, even though we&apos;d only been there for a few minutes.  It was two AM when I got back to my apartment. The next day I recalled the odd appearance of the moon, so I checked a calendar with the Moon&apos;s phases, and it had been a New Moon, with no visible Moon at all.  Needless to say, the event left my eyebrows raised for quite some time. Thanks again for your work at keeping this magnificent repository available for the sharing of all our strange sightings.  Reading about others&apos; experiences makes the strangeness seem a bit less frightening.", "I went back to bed.Cleveland Tennessee is a small town approximately thirty five miles from Chattanooga, North on Interstate 75. The house that I resised, when this happened, was across the street from Cleveland Hardwick Air Field. A small General Aviation Air Port. On the night of 23 May, 2000, My, then, wife woke me by climbing out of bed saying,&quot;Their here!&quot; I awoke to the entire roon bathed in a lite blue light. There was no light sorce in the room to create the light. On her side of the bed there was a small metal framed window. I got up and walked around the end of the bed. I was amazed at the amount of lightin the room. The double pane glazing was of a cheap design and moisture had seeped in. This caused the window to be less than transparient. A common in that part of the couontry. To see what was causing the light she opened the window. The slide wasn&apos;t exactly smooth, and the window banged open when she forced it. I scolded her for making noise, and possibly compromising our position. Wanting to remain anonymous. I had to bend down to look out of the lower protion of the window. Hovering over an airplane hanger not twenty five yards away, completely mationless and noiseless was a craft. Five brilliantly lit, half spheres, in a circular pattern where protruding from the bottom. The illumination was so bright it was difficult to see much of the craft. However, I could just make out the triangular shape. The sides were verticaly flat, with ridges running horizontally. It appeared to be black. However, dure to the brightness I can&apos;t be sure. I looked at the craft long enough to make these observations. Then the most extraordinary thig happened. I closed the window and went back to bed.I say this was extraordinary because I just saw something I&apos;ve wondered about all my life and I just turned my back and went back to bed! I didn&apos;t take a picture. I didn&apos;t call anyone. I didn&apos;t go out side to get a better look. I just closed the window, walked around the bed, got in, and went to sleep.It wasn&apos;t until the next evening that I mentioned it to my wife. Atfirst she just looked at me like I had lost my mind. Then she said that she had a dream just like that. The window being banged open is what she remembered. She also said that she remembered a person standing across the street looking at our house. I didn&apos;t see anyone.This is true as I remember it. I have no reason to fabricate this story.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Saucer came into front view and went behind a hilltop where I lost sight of it.  My two companions could not be roused from a trance-like state, so they never observed what I did.", "Two  orbs and 1 humanoidish figure.Full Description of event/sighting: Around 11-13 March 1988, I was woken by what sounded like a metal ball being thrown from one side of my house (downstairs) to another.  I was frightened to say the least and hid my head under the duvet on the bed.  The sounds continued, and I remember thinking that if someone had broken in, I would have heard glass breaking!  I looked at the clock - it was about ten past one in the morning.  I decided I was being stupid and that I must go to see what was going on.  When I sat on the edge of the bed I became aware of a small figure, that seemed to glow, hovering inside my bedroom by the window.  It was ochre coloured, with a small round head on a flexible neck emerging from an ochre-coloured leather-like cylinder.  I remember being surprised by very large flat &quot;feet&quot; at the base.  There was nothing frightening about it - just a feeling of niceness and fun.  It stretched out two long flexible &quot;arms&quot; towards me, and that was the last thing I remembered. I would have dismissed this &quot;sighting&quot; as just a dream if it had not been for the fact that the previous evening there was a lot of ribbon lightning - but no rain.  I went outside to get a better look, when suddenly two glowing orbs flashed in front of my balcony.  The impression was of two kittens chasing each another - fun. Sometime later I read a letter in a magazine reporting the sighting of a large shiny object which appeared to be a space ship near the Jura mountains, close to where I live.  I have always regretted not contacting the writer nor keeping a copy of the letter. Since I have not come across any similar reports, the possibility remains that the figure could have been a dream or all  in the mind.  But it could also have been a &quot;sighting.&quot;  I like to think of alien kids!  Thank you to the witness for the report.

I dont know if it was a UFO but it was definitely something I have never seen in the sky before.I live in a rural area in northeast Nebraska so it gets real dark and quiet at night. One evening I was doing some work in my shop and I heard a faint rumbling noise outside. I decided to step outside and see what it was. Its pretty normal for me to hear the rumble of high altitude commercial airplanes or the occasional &quot;thump thump&quot; of medical helicoptors traveling to hospitals between towns. When I looked outside to see where the sound was comming from i saw a large boxy/rectangular shaped craft flying approximately 500-1500 feet above the ground a little to the south of me. It came from the east and traveled west. There were several lights on this craft, some in front some in back and some on top, more than a typical plane or helicoptor.I stood there a minute or so looking at this thing trying to figure out what it was. It moved about the speed of a helicoptor but without the normal &quot;thump thump&quot; sound. The best way for me to describe this craft was that it resembled a semi tractor with its boxy shape and lights. I went inside and grabbed my binoculars. When I came out I followed it to the west for about 5 minutes with my binoculars until it was out of sight. I tried to see if it had wings or helicoptor blades or some kind of recognizable outline. All I could make out of the shape was the form of the lights. A boxy shape. I thought to myself that the whole incident was quite odd so I went back to work in my shop.About an hour later I heard another rumble sound and went outside to check it out. To my surprise it was the same craft traveling from the west to the east. Again I followed it with my binoculars as far as I could see to the east this time. There were no other aircraft in the air at that time, especially at that low altitude. That was the only time I have seen this thing. I figured it had to be something military but there arent any military installations that would be doing manuvers in my area that I know of. But then again who knows?((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  PD))", "68 Grey Squares in Sky, I&apos;ll take you with me cuz you&apos;re my friend, 9 o&apos;clock past bozo circus noon, scary man, doll burningI was four years old in the Springtime of 1968.  I was allowed to go half way around the block and play with my 3 year old girlfriend &quot;Fluffy&quot; after 9 AM...her brothers and sisters would be off in school and that is the time my mother said I could go over to Fluffy&apos;s house to play. As I walked around the block to her house, I looked in the sky for cloud pictures and there were no clouds, a cloudless sunny day. I went down the driveway as usual to the back of her house and already found her outside in her backyard. Fluffy was wearing a new white blouce with rick-rack stitching across it...I asked her if it was new and she said yes and I told her how pretty it was. I asked her what game she wanted to begin playing and she said hide-and-go-seek!  Then it became very, very windy and I was laughing trying to part my long hair out of my face...I noticed the grass was long and blowing strongly too and had not been cut or mowed...I looked over to my girlfriend &quot;Fluffy&quot; and she was already crouched in the corner of an &quot;L&quot; shaped hedge by the side of her house...I said I hadn&apos;t even counted to ten yet and you&apos;re hiding! The wind was so strong and I was reaching toward her and she looked very pale and scared. She was shouting at me, &quot;What is it? What is it?&quot; and I looked up and saw large square grey tile shapes (metallic, yet I didn&apos;t know the word back then) it was low and hovering near the height of the tall tree and high enough up right above the neighbor&apos;s garage and I said, &quot;I don&apos;t know...I don&apos;t know!&quot;  She was begging me, &quot;Don&apos;t go! Don&apos;t go!&quot; I reached my hand out and said, &quot;I&apos;ll take you with me cuz you&apos;re my friend, cuz you&apos;re my friend.&quot;  The next memories I have are: Her mother is standing at the back door swinging it open and yelling angry at us, &quot;I&apos;ve been looking for you children, where have you been playing, get in here, lunch is ready now!&quot; (the house has an added on back edition with large picture window facing the backyard and window that looks out to the side of the house by the hedge area, neighbor&apos;s driveway.) We were at the side of the house together and it was as if we had become unfrozen from time and were now walking toward her mother upon hearing this to go inside the house. I am confused because I know I just got over there past 9 AM and how can it be lunch time now? Why is her mother seem upset and angry with us? We walk in the house and Chicago WGN Channel 9 is on TV with popular kid&apos;s show that comes on at noon called &quot;Bozo&apos;s Circus&quot; The ping-pong toss into buckets one thru six are happening in the show...which means it is almost over, at the end. I sit down at the kitchen table and look at the clock on the wall and it reads 12:25 PM and I am counting from 9 AM to Noon trying to figure out how it can already be that time...we hadn&apos;t even played hide-n-go-seek...why is her mom mad, has she baked a lunch casserole or fancy dish. She serves us folded over half sandwiches of peanut butter and jelly.After lunch, Fluffy and I go down in her basement with crayons (we know we can not draw on the walls of the house)  and put some chairs against the wall underneath the see thru stair steps where we draw with a big spooky man who with an orange,  bright green, and red crayons...he looks scarey like a monster and we put him there on the basement wall that day under the stairs down to the basement laundry room.  Fluffy&apos;s five brothers and sisters come  home from school in the afternoon and discover the drawing teasing each other and asking one another who put that on the wall to scare us. They don&apos;t believe us when we tell them we drew it, we explained we stood on chairs to draw him tall and big.  The picture remained on the wall till the mid 1990tys before her parents decided to paint the basement with two coats of paint.  I go home that day before 6 PM dinner time to tell my mommy and dadddy that I saw something in the sky.I tell them how windy it was and my mom says you must have seen a helicopter and I say no, it didn&apos;t make any sound. My father asks me what it looked like and I say big square grey shapes and he says you must have seen a blimp! I don&apos;t know or realize what a blimp looks like until I am six years old and I see one in the night sky. My folks remember this day because I would not stop talking about going over to Fluffy&apos;s house to play and seeing something in the sky. I remember the feeling of not feeling safe. Her mother did not know where we were and we went away somewhere all morning and came back after 12 o&apos;clock noon time. Fluffy and I both had 3 foot tall manequin dolls and she took her doll out to where the autumn leaf pile is burned in the back yard behind her house and lit a match and burnt her doll. I watch and her mom comes out asking her why she did such a thing to her doll and she says, &quot;I don&apos;t know&quot;  I am afraid of my doll getting me that I keep shut in my bedroom closet.((NUFORC Note:  One of six, seemingly credible, reports submitted by same witness.

On the corner of 55th and Genesee there is a lookout that looks toward Vashon Island. My father lives just below the KOMO radio towers, on Vashon, on the beach at Glen Acres. On this particular morning I noticed what appeared to be a bright fire on the beach near the location of his home. It was large enough that, from this distance, it looked to encompass an entire block of houses. I watched it for about 20 seconds before I continued through the turn to the East. It was still there as I cleared the next block and didn&apos;t disappear until I reached the next viewable location to the East. It was obvious, from the level of illumination, that the people who lived on the beach near Glen Acres had to have been awakened by the light. It was brilliant orange / yellow and the sun was still at a low elevation. On Saturday, February 14th, I decided to call my father to determine if he had seen anything. To my surprise he was already excited with information that he was trying to relate along the same line.  This conversation occured at approximately 11:20 am.What he described was an unusual zig-zag contrail that traveled from above his house to a location near Snoqualmie Pass.  He was quite enthralled with the unique nature of the contrail as it didn&apos;t resemble anything he has seen in the past.

The porch faced almost due west.  I went out to see what he was looking at.  It was your classic &quot;saucer shape&quot; with two lights hanging underneath.  It was floating low over the creek about 400 yards west of the house.  About 300-400 feet up.  The moon was about 3/4ths full and was shining brightly off the craft.  It had an almost polished aluminum color.  The lights hanging underneath slowly changed colors though the entire spectrum.  They remind me of some kind of stage light.  Clear quiet night, no noise whatsoever came from this craft.  My dad and I watched it for about 10 minutes, then he told me to go inside.

I cannot even describe how black it was-it was like a black I&apos;ve never seen-there was no reflection in it at all-it almost like it was a oval shaped hole in the sky.  As it moved it would tilt to the side and as the sun shined on it  I saw sort of a brownish metallic color on the side and seemed to change to more of a pill shape in that it wasn&apos;t completely a 3d oval.

I was driving down main street in Ellensburg Washington as i saw 2 sets of 4 lights in a dimond shape sitting completly still, there where to lights changing from red to blue and back that where spaced dirrectly in the middle of the 2 dimonds.  When i first saw them I passed them off as 2 radio towers I had never noticed.

I apologize for the lack of info regarding the exact date, but I was 10 years of age at the time and not aware of your work or where (other than the local police), I could possibly report such an incident.It was about 10pm, and I was on the third floor of a two-family house, owned by my grandparents since the mid to late 1960&apos;s. The part of the house I was in was inhabited by my aunt L (my mother&apos;s sister) and her son, my cousin, F. He was three years of age, almost four, and I was babysitting.My mother lived directly below, which pertinent to this story, and I will relate to it later.We were both in the bedroom which has one window facing Northeast (in approximation to the way I was sitting). We were on the bed, watching television, and the window was open.From the corner of my eye, I noticed a light that suddenly flashed on, or appeared out of nowhere and seemed to be moving. I turned toward the window and that is when I noticed an oval object sitting directly above the moon.The moon was full and exceptionally bright (perhaps the fact that the moon was full will make it easier to deduce what day it was..., and this object sat above it and did not move. It just sat there.However, everytime I looked away this object would move and go from one end of the window to the next and then stop once again, to rest above the moon. If I hold my hand out in front of me, at arms length, I can assess that the moon was the size of my fist and the object was the size of the pad of my thumb! It was HUGE and it was LUMINOUS.I told my cousin to take a look, to confirm that I was indeed seeing this object and he reacted with genuine fear to which I too became increasingly frightened.I grew up on sci-fi, was an outcast amongst my peers and was even nicknamed E.T., so I was fully aware of the UFO and EXTRATERRESTRIAL phenomena, seeing as at that time I believed I was an abductee, and I think this is the reason why I was so frightened.THe object stayed there for over an hour to which I called my mother and told her. I was frightened and asked her to locate my aunt and to tell her to return home because I did not want to be there anymore.Now, when I asked my mother to check for the object, she did originally deduce that I was just looking at a satellite, however she did agree that there was indeed something there and that it was far too big to be sitting above the moon that way.When my Aunt did return, some two and a half hours after the object first appeared, I had already had the shades down so as not to agitate my young cousin any more. However, when I opened the shades to show her...it was gone! I have since seen satellites in the sky, and I am an amateur astronomer, and I can honestly deduce from my current knowledge of the night sky, that what I saw that day was intelligent, perhaps even mocking me, but it was not a satellite nor was it Venus...it was something else entirely.Thanks for listening!

My name and my sisters {we are maternal twins}, from here on will be,mine-  s  hers-  d .This is what happened to her and I to the best we can recall .She and I where camping out at a friends trailer a few lots down. Around 2:30am My sister D got sick to her stomach and woke me up wanting to go home.I got up and we started walking home,about halfway.I noticed a dim spotlight on us coming from above.We both looked up. I saw a silver disk with lights circling around it.D saw A silver disk that was balled on the bottom .The disk was low about tree top level.D at that moment says she heard a robotic sound like talking but could not understand it.I heard a dull static like humming sound kind of like a TV sounds when it first kicks on .We both got scared and took off running to our trailers front door and began beating the door hard. No one answered,In the house where three people and one was a very light sleeper.No one woke up.So then we ran around to the other side.Our side yard was very close to Rickenbacker property.We then began beating on the light sleepers window.At that moment D says she heard a commotion coming from Rickenbacker men yelling truck motors running,racing.At that moment an apple fell out of our mid-sized apple tree in the yard.D and I turned around and looked up in the tree.This is what I saw in the tree.A very small man hunched, crotched down with his very long arms hanging out in front of him,his body was half in the light His color was bluish grey his legs where silky smooth like a womens and his hands where funny looking not sure why.I got the impression he meant us no harm and I got the impression we where interrupting  something.D saw this from her view point she saw a very small man in a gargoyle like stance with his long arms hanging out off his knees.D says his color was dark she did not see him in the light.D says his head was elongated in the back.That is all she can recall of him.We both saw him not move at all he was very motionless. Now we where freaking out we ran to the front again and this time D went to the corner of the deck and started crying.I beat on the door and started yelling for dad.This time  I could see him through the glass  He was asleep in his recliner and did not move.Then I remember nothing .D and I only remember waking up the next day in our beds.My mother recalls us talking about it but insisted we must have dreamt it all. If that is so then how come no one that night ever recalls letting us in the trailer.Also I have had a birth mark on my thigh all my life it was barely noticeable until that night.Even my mother says the next day is was much more plain to see.Also i have a weird creepy fear of black shark eyes or a bulls eyes.D has no such mark.D has no such fear.We are not insane we are very close twins and what happened was real. I just hope someone else can gain from what we are sharing here.We have no desire to recall anymore than we have.This has taking some courage to do and fear of being made fun of and laughed at has kept us quite till now.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Both vanish within a couple of minutes...It was around sunset, the sky was clear, and we were all sitting around on the beach talking when we noticed two very bright lights (like a star, but around sunset) moving slowly across the sky. They were a small distance apart, one slightly lower than the other. They were there for a few minutes, then one suddenly disapeared, followed closely by the second, which lingered for about 20 more seconds, than disapeared as well. Now I&apos;ve heard many cover up stories to prove that this was no ufo, but I am prepared to give facts towards what I saw. These lights were too high to be airplanes, and they weren&apos;t fireworks, missiles from submarines, rockets from Cape Canaveral, or fighter jets issued by Patrick Airforce Base (which is down the road) because it was too high for any of these objects to be. The two lights were brighter than anything I had ever seen in the sky, not to mention there was absolutely no sound whatsoever coming from the objects. They just appeared, moved slowly across the sky, then vanished within a blink of an eye.

It was faint and hard to see.  I could not tell if it was low enough to be picking up ambient lighting from the city streets here where I live, or if it was emiting a faint glow of it&apos;s own.  It looked very .....well it&apos;s hard to describe how it appeared....it looked like a made object, not an animal flying.  It took a very straight path in the sky and traversed the whole sky in around 15 seconds. No sound.  So if it was some kind of craft or plane,  and it had conventional (earthly) engines that we are used to,  it was way too high for me to hear,  meaning that it was indeed flying at some crazy speed akin to 2000 mph.  Weird.  I have never ever seen anything like that before.  The faintness of this object made it even eerier.  I am dumbfounded.  This object traveled in what looked like a nearly perfect north heading. 45 seconds after this,  as I scanned the sky wanting to catch sight of this object again,  a second object came into view.  Looking to my north, this object faded into view and appeared to be a shooting star.  It came from the direction that the first object was headed towards.  At first I really thought it was a shooting star and noticed the coincidence of it happening right after me seeing that first object.  The second object seemed to move at the same speed as the first...which was really fast.  The way it faded into view really lended to my thinking that it was a shooting star coming into the atmosphere.  This object looked as such for about 2 seconds,  but then as it got nearly overhead of me it turned red in color and changed course with what looked like a 90 degree turn towards the east.  It then continued east for about 1 second and then faded quickly from view.  I have never ever seen a meteor make a turn before,  I have seen them come into the atmosphere and slow down, turn colors, explode leaving trails of sparkles,  but never eber change course, especially a 90 degree turn. This is the first time I have ever seen anything like this in the sky.  I look up to the sky all the time because I enjoy seeing the stars,  I like astronomy and science.

This light traveled from the west north west side of the highway towards the southeast until it was out of my sight in about 10 to 12 seconds. I&apos;ve never seen anything fly so fast it&apos;s speed was comparable to a meteorite and I first thought that was what it was, but it had no tail and did not burn out.

It was a perfectly clear, windless day, and as I was walking my dog I looked up and scanned the sky. Almost directly overhead I spotted a round gray object moving to the northeast at a fairly high speed. My first thought was a balloon, but it was moving far too fast. At arms length it was the size of a BB, and as it moved away to the northeast my eyes focused in on 5 similar objects following the first. They were silent and flying in a loose formation, and appeared like the 1950 Great Falls UFO film as they faded away in the distance. The pilot of a light plane flying south might have seen these craft if he were looking up. I believe the objects were under 5,000 feet. I scanned the sky and saw a helicopter to the north that was probably over the area of Federal and I-70.At 4:45 PM I was again looking at the sky, and to the north where I had seen the helicopter I spotted what at first appeared to be a black cylindrical object with a white tail below it hanging motionless about 30 degrees in the sky. My first thought was a kite, but when I looked at it through my binoculars it appeared like a cluster of orange balloons with red lights on them. The white tail was not moving and appeared rigid. I watched it for about 5 minutes, eventually it began to rise higher in the sky, to about 50 degrees.

Number of witnesses: 2 Number of objects: 1 Shape of objects: Round  Full Description of event/sighting: a very large, bright white object in the northwestern sky, stayed in one place for about ten minutes, then appeared to fade in brightness slowly, then it gradually moved north over the period of about 15 minutes. it then slowly disappeared from view, it was far to bright to be a star, and did not move in the fashion of any satellite that I have ever seen. I&apos;m sure that other people must have seen it, as it was to bright and long to miss    Additional Information Below:  I will answer your questions in order. (1) The movement appeared to stay in one place for about ten minutes, then very slowly moved north until moving out leaving my view. It was a very clear night except for a low cloud line, about the altitude of the object. (2) the altitude , if it was in the atmosphere, was about the same as the Grouse mountain range if being viewed from Vancouver. (3) The color was bright white, just like a very bright star, although it was about twice to three times the size of Venus to the naked . Very big and very bright. The brightness faded slightly as if it were moving away when it appeared to be stationary. (4) I did see one plane fly right in line with the object, although the plane appeared to be very far away, probably a commercial line,( the blinking red light) was faint. (5) No trail of any kind  (6) the second witness only viewed the object for about 5 min. but I can assure you that her interpretation would be similar as we discussed the object. I am very interested an fairly well informed on these matters as I have been the witness to several sightings and in occurrences throughout my life, please let me know if you find anything out.

About half way down the road was a little shanty they called their &quot;gardenhouse&quot; where they cleaned and prepared their produce for market.As we approached the shanty, we met the elderly woman coming up the road, heading for her home on the edge of town. We stopped to talk, she wanted to express her sympathies ad to ask about the funeral.My husband and I were facing north, the woman facing us, as we talked. We noticed a small bright light coming toward us out of the north. It was moving very slowly, but coming down, growing larger and brighter as it decended. The old woman saw the look on our faces, so she turned and looked up. By this time it was very large and a very brilliant blue-white. The old woman fell to her knees, muttering something in her native tongue, Italian, and &quot;crossing&quot; herself. We were paralyzed with fear! Suddenly, after hovering for a few minutes, motionless, it began to go around in wide circles, then shot straight up into the sky and disappeared.The woman ran up the road to her home. My husband and I ran to my parents&apos; home, where my husband called the Observatory in Pittsburgh to ask what this &quot;thing&quot; was. They could not give an explanation, but that it &quot;could not have been a plane or weather balloon, nor any invention existing at that time that could have done what this object did.&quot;A few weeks later, reports started coming in on radio news about people in the west seeing strange things in the sky. Some were calling them &quot;flying saucers&quot; and &quot;UFO&apos;s,&quot; and some were wondering if some other country had invented some kind of new scientific weapon.We never completely got over our fright and have watched the sky ever since. My husband had been in the Navy in the war. We have see many natural things, such as meteorites, northern lights and man- made objects, but never have seen anything to compare to what we saw that evening.Note: The week before we saw the strange object, we were on our way to North Carolina to attend my Grandmother&apos;s funeral, traveling Route 11 through the Shenandoah Valley. We were traveling staight through, without stopping for the night. During the night we had a flat tire. Th five of us, my parents, my brother, and my husband and I got out of the car while the tire was fixed. While we were standing on the dark road, a very bright meteorite sailed across the sky, leaving a greenish trail and a &quot;swishing&quot; sound.The object we saw in Pennsylvania a week later did not resemble this meteorite in any way. It traveled slower, at first, then much faster than the meteorite, was a different color, and made no sound even though it got much closer than the meteorite did. The meteorite streaked across the sky, but the strange object moved slowly and then hovered over us before shooting straight up, lightening fast!((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

After watching a couple of minutes, I wondered why I couldn&apos;t see the wings. I&apos;m slightly nearsighted (20/40) so I put on my glasses to see it better. It looked the same - still no wings. I watched about another 30 seconds or so; then it disappeared as I watched. It didn&apos;t get smaller like it was going away, nor did it go behind a cloud. It just kind of clicked off. I told my husband that I think I just saw a UFO. We got home about 5 minutes later. After a couple of minutes, I heard military jets overhead. I don&apos;t know if the two events were connected.

We watched it for a while and wondered if it was a sightseeing helicopter as it had been moving slowly back and forth high over the water along the coast off Esquimalt harbour. The more we stared at it the more we thought it was strange. Light seemed to be emanating from it. It didn&apos;t seem so far away that details wouldn&apos;t be visable yet we could make none out.

I have experienced things like this before where I have seen objects move in unworldly directions at undisclosed speeds. Through out the phone conversation I look strait ahead, taking note of an abnormally bright light. At this time I think absolutely nothing of this and continue my phone call. As I continue to look around I see that this light can be associated with celestial objects in the sky around me. I.E. the moon, &amp; stars. Not only is the object I am looking at extremely close to the water, it seams extremely distant. Ignoring my self and thoughts based on things I have seen before I continue on. Its now 12:06, the clock is extremely bright in my car and clearly readable.

It caught my eye because it was such a &quot;frothy&quot; plume coming out the back of the plane. I took a shot and put the camera down.  As I did so, I noticed the &quot;contrail-shadow&quot; effect I have wanted to get a picture of for a long time.  I grabbed my camera and took another shot, when the black line was dark.  The line lasted about 30 seconds, then began to fade.  I took another shot to show it fading, then put the camera down. I went about my business for the next ten or so minutes, and then decided to takes a shot, showing the contrail beginning to &quot;fan&quot; out, spreading into the sky. That evening, after I downloaded these images to a computer, I noticed an &quot;foreign&quot; object in at least three of my pictures.  The first shows it as more luminous than the surrounding sky.  The second shot, the one of the &quot;black-line&quot;, shown the object has moved, is much lower in altitude, and has turned black also.

My reporting this incident to family and friends when it happened, was met with ridicule. Have been silent ever since. Friday, Sept 28, 1973, came off the Ohio Turnpike exit at route 42 in Strongsville, Ohio. Noted looking south in traversing the long circular exit ramp, that there was an aircraft descending. Thought that very unusual.I was a trained US Customs Officer, familiar with all types of aircraft and helicopters....this one mystified me....and what was it doing in this place?...then a semi rural suburban area of Cleveland. As I got to the bottom of the ramp, saw though my driver&apos;s side window that the object was about 500 feet in the air, and had a circular bottom. Turned right onto route 42, Pearl Rd. The object passed overhead. It was then about 100 feet up. No sound emitted from it. I was behind it, moving about 35mph and it was still descending and moving not much faster than my car.Then at the intersection of Webster rd. and Pearl rd., it stopped and hovered over the intersection, in front of me. I came up to the crossroad and stopped for the red signal. The object was in front of me and hung in the air about 25 feet up. I estimated the diameter of its base at 30 feet and it was bell shaped, about 15 feet tall...the top of it like a dome. It&apos;s color was like gray gunmetal. It had no visible apertures or openings on it, nor any identification symbols. It rather scared me that this thing was stopped in front of me. My radio was crackling badly and unintelligible. Two cars had come up behind me and both had pulled to the side of the road. I pulled over too as I did not to go under it. I pulled over, got out of the passenger side of my car and looked up....but THE OBJECT WAS GONE-VANISHED!!!! WAS Dumbfounded. The two cars that had been behind me were also gone. Thought I must have hallucinated. Felt nauseated and sick. Got back in my car and drove another 10 minutes or so home. My family was put out with me that I had missed dinner and was an hour late. Was shocked at that. Went out to my car and looked at the clock which read 5 minutes after seven. My usual trip home from Akron, normally an hour&apos;s drive, had taken 2 hours. I could never explain where that hour went. There were subsequent events in my life that proved strange and not explicable, but my purpose here is just to report what I saw, and let it go at that.

At first we thought it was a boat, but the light got closer and brighter, moving very fast in the air. Then it stopped level with our deck, about 1/2 mile out over the ocean and five bright amber lights began flashing in a random sequence. This display lasted about 10-15 seconds then went dark. We went back in the house thinking it was over, then about 5 minutes later spotted it again over the ocean coming closer towards us. As we were trying to follow the lights, they disappeared again and went dark. Then we looked up and there were 3 large amber lights about 30-40 ft. up from our deck. The object was there about 30-45 seconds hovering in the air and from the spacing of the lights, we estimate it was about the width of our house. The lights were almost rectanglar with rounded edges and about 4 ft. wide each. My husband climbed up on the roof to get a closer look and the lights went dark again. There was no sound, or was so quiet it was masked by the sound of the surf.We returned to the house, found the camera this time and waited again in case it returned. About 5 minutes later we spotted it out over the ocean again about 3 miles out going south. It had numerous amber/white lights displayed around the bottom in a circle and a red pulsating light above and then a white, more diffused light above that. It looked like a three story crown floating out over the water almost to the horizon.

Because you just don&apos;t forget about something like this, it&apos;s just to big.Maybe I am not intended to understand why or how.I do know you cannot erase these kind of memories from your mind.I only hope one day I  might find my answer,as so many others need to know also. as to why these events take place.I have had other strange happenings since ,another time ..thanks for reading&hellip;((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

High) listening to, along with the rest of the class, the teacher&apos;s lecture.  It was a morning class, and I believe it was about 10:30 am.  I was sitting by the window and happened to look out toward the east (about 30 degrees to my right) and saw an odd lighted shape, sort of like the left half of a lighted oval, at about 20 degrees above the horizon.  Toward the east is an area with a few houses and about a half mile of heavily wooded and at the time undeveloped land on either side of Salado Creek (the creek was about a quarter mile to the east of the school and runs north to south ).  That land currently contains Martin Luther King Park.  It was a largely clear day, but it seemed as though the lighted oval was behind a patch of cloud.  This shaped did not appear to be a solid object.  There was no noise associated with this sighting.  There was no noise associated with this sighting and I do not recall seeing or hearing any other aircraft in the area. While trying to figure out what this shape was, the shape faded away.  A few seconds later, the shape reappeared slightly to the right and above the first location.  This time it was brighter, with a distinct symmetrical oval shape to the phenomena, and bright white in the interior.  In the middle of this oval was what looked like a thin bright horizontal line, much like a filament in a light bulb, which was centered in the oval and taking up about half the horizontal dimension of this oval.  This central filament type light was bright, but not painful to look at. At this point, there was no question in my mind that I was seeing something that was unlike any aircraft that I had ever seen.  San Antonio in 1971 had substantial Vietnam related military flight activity from Ft. Sam Houston, Randolph AFB, and Kelly AFB, especially the frequent low level helicopter flights of UH-1 Huey helicopters.  Whatever I was looking at was nothing like any military or civilian aircraft I have seen either before or since (as an adult, I became a licensed pilot and was an Air Force flight test engineer). As I was about to get the attention of the classmate sitting in front of me it faded out once more.  It came into view a third time, again slightly above and to the left of the previous appearance.  Like the first view, it appeared to be behind some kind of mist or light cloud and was only partially visible, with the left and top part of the shape being visible.  The bright filament was not visible, and this time I could see what looked like a very small reddish tapered dome on top.  The tapered dome was relatively small, roughly one tenth the width of the full oval and about one fifth the thickness of the main oval. After a few seconds, it faded away again.  I looked all around the sky for it and about ten seconds later saw almost directly overhead a white light fade in an out of view twice.  It did so at a rate roughly the same as the interval between the first three sightings of the phenomena.  However, these last two were more points of light and I could not discern any shape to it.  The entire sighting lasted roughly one minute. I took a fair bit of ridicule about this whenever I mentioned it, so I kept quiet about it.  About two years later when I was in high school, a classmate (who I had never told about my sighting) related a story about some odd phenomena he saw one night in the same general part of town near Salado Creek.  When I asked him to explain how it looked, he described the oval shape and the filament type light in the middle.  I could not tell from his description if it was exactly the same phenomena I had observed.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was floating there by itself with no stars around it. The reason my dad and I noticed this was because compared to all the other stars, it was unbelievably bright. It was so bright that it was quite hard to look at. If it were a plane, it would&apos;ve been moving and less bright. This &apos;thing&apos; however, didnt move at all for about 3 hours... It just floated there. Occasionally you would be able to see a red light moving towards it from different directions. One time the red light came up from the bottom right hand corner of the light. As it neared the light, it faded away. A few minutes later, i saw with my binoculars, the red light moving in from the top left hand corner of the light. I zoomed in on the light with my binoculars and i saw that the light was made up of two round lights. One right above the other and slightly to the right. the top one was red-ish orange and the bottom was a very light green-ish white light. these two together shone like the brightest light in the sky. It was amazing. Every once in a while i&apos;d see the red light again. and the bright (two) lights would just float there and not move an inch. When i looked at it through binoculars i thought i just saw two lights.. the most &apos;shape&apos; i saw out of it would have to be a circle... if i had better binoculars, i may have been able to see more.

Without any sound or time the sky light seemed to turn dark but what it was was the craft appeared directly above us either from the point of light in the sky, I&apos;m not sure. It seemed like it just appeared in front of us. at that moment my mother had a feared look in her face and being her son I knew when my mother is scared and I never noticed it but she felt &quot;warm&quot; whether from the fear causing the warmth, I really don&apos;t know. In an instant the darkness left, because I was focused on that light high in the sky. It was like the saucer shot up in the sky at a very high speed, became the point of light again and soon I lost sight of it. The lights on the hill had disappeared also. We rushed home to get my father and other brothers and sister and went back to the sight. but saw nothing after that.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Possible abduction, I&apos;m not sure what happened that 8 years ago.Well, this is a little personal for me to be describing as I have been a little traumatized by the event. I was about ten years old at the time and this is my first time reporting it. I am now 18. I went to sleep on the living room couch one night because the living room has a large window looking out to the west. Anyway, I woke up in the middle of night (midnight was the time on the VCR) on my back, and surprisingly I was not groggy, almost as if I had been up the entire night. But I had decided to then count the stars until I go back to sleep because I couldn&apos;t sleep. Well, there was this one star that was moving in north to south direction (from my point of view it was from left to right). I mistook as a plane and so my focus followed it. I decided to play a mind game with myself thionking it would make me tired and thought I could control the direction of the plane by looking at the direction where i want it to go. I said to myself, &quot;I&apos;m going to control you with my eyes.) and the exact moment when I finished that sentence, the &quot;plane&quot; then flashed a very bright light into the living room where I was. I shut my eyes and pulled the covers over me. When I opened my eyes I was on my back with my arms at my sides and the covers were still over me. At first I couldn&apos;t breathe out of fright, I was so afraid to move or even think. When I finally got the courage to pull away my blanket from on top of me, I saw that the clock on the VCR was about 2:30AM. It was still dark, so I immediately got up, ran to my parents&apos; room and asked them if they saw a light flash inside the house, they groggily said no. I climbed in bed with them and went to sleep. If anybody has a record of anyone having a similar experience, please e-mail me at I ((e-address deleted))  or call mny cell at ((telephone number deleted)). I am very interested in an explanation. Since then I have had an extreme phobia of UFOs, aliens, and especially the drawings of what they might look like. Thanks. ((name deleted))((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

This was at new cut road in louisville ky. I saw this thing and got out of the car, this craft was huge, It was approx. 1-1 1/2 miles away looking at a 45 degree angle, so therefore, if I had to guess, it was approx. 2 miles from ground zero. Had 4 lights that was visible, 2 on the top and 2 on the bottom. Flavor was unidentifyable. It was moving unidirectional W-NW. The weather was clear, no clouds at all. Temp was at 32 degrees. When I was out of the car,I heard on sound at all. From considering the distance and the size, from the bottom, it had to be at least 300 yards long, top was possible 1/2 that.

The witness said the sighting lasted for approximately 10 minutes before it moved away and into the distance. It then appeared as a very faint light until it just disappeared. The object seen was extremely bright white with a ring of red lights around the middle. It was reported that there were a good number of red lights which could be easily seen with the naked eye. It was a clear night and the star were shinning brightly, but the person said this was certainly no star. HBCC UFO called the local airport which is very small to enquire to see if anyone knew if a helicopter or any aircraft was fling in that area on March 12, 2004 at approximately 10:30 p.m. and they said they were not aware of anything flying that evening. I also checked to see if anything was fling on February 27, 2004 and March 7, 2004 and again no reports of aircraft in the area. Both of these dates I mentioned had sightings of unusual craft in the area. I will also be taking a drive to visit all of the witnesses who filed reports to get a better idea where exactly the objects have been seen. Also while I chatted with the witness I was told of a number of incidents which have taken place in and around Decker Lake and Burns Lake British Columbia. Objects being witnessed by a large number of folks. Some watching an object skimming over the water on Francois Lake and the object was of a large size, silent and glowing. Other strange white/objects making some very fantastic maneuvers in the sky&apos;s above and always dropping down behind one of the mountains in the Grassy Plains area. This is rather interesting because I know there has been a number of cattle mutes that have taken place across Francois Lake and around Grassy Plains. Also strange creatures are being reported from our native peoples. I will also add I receive information from a very credible source who works on Francois Lake everyday, along with others who have reported that the large Canadian Search and Rescue Buffalo had been flying late at night for no known reason over top of Francois Lake at very unusual hours. Some of these witness made enquires to why the aircraft was there, thinking the flight crew may have been on a training mission but there was no information to come forward. I am starting to wonder if there isn&apos;t something happening all throughout this area and I am certainly going to be spending some time out there talking with residents around the area. Below is a little on what our Search and Rescue Buffalo looks like. Buffalo  the Tactical Twin from DHC DHC&rsquo;s Buffalo* was designed to meet a US Army requirement for a fixed-wing tactical transport with a cargo capacity to match Boeing-Vertol CH-46 Chinook helicopters. The type entered Canadian service in 1967 as a complement to the larger CC-130 Hercules. The training of paratroopers was among the CC-115&rsquo;s early tasks but in 1974 the CF Buffalo fleet was modified for the search-and-rescue role. Rescue equipment, improved navigation aids, and crew rest stations were all that was required to convert the Buffalo from transport** to SAR. Perhaps a little over- powered for their new role, the key virtue of the CC-115s was their availability. The Buffalo had little opportunity to make use of their phenomenal short take-off and landing abilities as SAR aircraft. However, the rear cargo ramp was ideal for rescue equipment dropping, and the paratrooper doors suited SAR-tech jumps just as well. But, the Buffs are aging and only 6 of 15 remain.

Two of them accelerated away from the last one.  The frontal two maneuvered closer to eachother, then the third one aught up in an extremely fast manner.  They all slowed down in an extreme manner and then disappeared.  Strange formation activity not appearing to be flying with FAA regulations or military strategy.  They appeared to be different than jets.", "A stationary white dot was observed for 10 minutes.I was hiking the Appalachian Trail in Great Smokies National Park, about 1 mile south from Double Spring Gap shelter.  I stopped to lie down in a clear, grassy patch that overlooked the western side of the park, and Fontana Lake.  I decided to watch the sky, and look for birds, as I enjoy watching birds fly from below.  The sun was bright and there were no clouds in the sky.  I layed on my back, and shielded the sun from my eyes.  I began to focus on how bright blue the sky was, and how there were no clouds at all.  There were several nearby jets, with jet-trails.  Soon, my eyes focused on a incredibly tiny white dot.  It was the size of a period, like this (.).  Just a single white point.  I thought to myself, &quot;that&apos;s incredibly high for a plane&quot;.  There were no exhaust trails.  I watched the point for about 10 minutes, and it did not move.  I closed my eyes, and looked away, and looked back multiple times, and the dot was still there. It was not a plane, for it did not move or have trails.  It was not a speck on my glasses, as I moved my head about and the dot stayed in the same position.  It was not a cloud, far too small.  It was not a star or part of the moon.  The moon was about quarter that night, and it was about 3:00 in the day, thus no star would be shining.  It was not a receding balloon, as I&apos;ve watched receding helium balloons before, and they diminish from sight much quicker.  The only thing I could explain it as was a geosynchronous satellite.  It had the same look, and this would explain why it didn&apos;t move.  However, no satellite is visible during this time of day.  Thus, I characterize it as unidentified.  Finally, I looked away for about 20 seconds.  When I looked back up, the dot was gone, and nowhere in the sky.", "A CHROME SAUCER.IT WAS AN UP SIDE DOWN SAUCER, LIKE THE PICTURE ON YOUR SITE BUT WAS A CHROME.

As turned on the T.V. I heard a strange sound coming from out side my house. I went outside and saw a strange thing glowing outside my house. It was hovering just above the ground and was changing shape very fast. Then sundenly it stopped and landed. There was a bright light and I woke up five hours later.((NUFORC Note:  We cannot confirm the claims made by the witness.  PD))", "Two large lights above the treetops about 150 feet from our car that radiated light that affected my wife and IMy wife and I were driving home on a Fayal Township road about six miles Southeast of Eveleth,MN. We were about one-half mile from home and traveling North about 30 mph when we both noticed two large white lights slightly above the treetops near the right side(East)of the road. My wife asked me what it was. My first thought was that they were the landing lights of an airplane which had just taken off from a nearby airport. I slowed down our car and rolled down the window,but we could hear no sound of an airplane. My wife glanced at the dashboard to see if the lights were affecting the electrical system of the car and they weren&apos;t,but she noticed the time was 7:11 pm. As we drove along slowly we noticed that the lights were only about 150 feet away from our car. Then I saw a dimmer red flashing light between the large lights which appeared to be about two feet in diameter and about ten feet apart. The white lights suddenly turned bluish white and seemed to grow in size and radiate from the object and at that instant I felt overcome by the early stages of sleep paralysis. I immediately floored the gas pedal and as we got away from the lights the sleep paralysis subsided. The experience lasted about 15 seconds. When we got home we wrote down separately what we had just seen and then compared notes. My wife said the lights were stationary thoughout the experience hovering above the treetops. She did not notice any change in color of the lights,but that there was white light projected from the two large lights and lit up the treetops brightly. She saw red lights between the two large white light,but did not see them flash. My wife described feeling as beening possessed or under hypnosis during the experience. There didn&apos;t seem to be any missing time as it was 7:20 pm when we were writing our notes of the experience. The skies were clear.", "2 circular objects flying formation after brief positioning next to each  dark blackout night no lights 1 witness caribbeanIt was a dark night on this Caribbean Island. The electricity had just gone out, total black out on the Island. I was lying with my girl friend outside on the hood of a car looking up at the twinkling starts when direcly overhead a bronze colored disc appeared clearly seen against the black sky. I watched it for a fews secs and then pointed up a said to her:  do you see that, she exclaimed in an excited voice - it is a space ship. The moment she spoke another similar object appeared, it has been flying direcly above or under the other, it shifted side-ways and then after oscilating a few times back and forth towards the other craft it was like it locked its trajectory next to the other one and both then flew on together till I could no follow them by eye anymore because of the blocking of the view by garden trees. I could not estimate their height or diameter. I do not consume alcohol, I do no use drugs I consider myself a regular person.

The campers were approximately 40 kilometers south from Prince George. Due to it being rather chilly out that evening they lit a nice camp fire to keep warm and talk about the days events. She said it was a beautiful night as the sky was clear and they were able to view the stars above. The witness said way in the distance to the north you were able to see the sky lit up from the city lights in Prince George. Straight in front of them was the Fraser River and across on the other bank was a tall stretch of trees. Approximately 100 feet above the tops of the trees sat a &quot;huge&quot;, pulsating glowing orange/yellow ball of light which appeared to be swaying slightly. They said it came out of nowhere !! Looking at something so large and very close they all got frightened and all asked one another what is that. The light stayed in it&apos;s position for a while and then it started moving away in the opposite direction from the witnesses towards the southwest rather quickly. Also the lady said there was no sound coming from the object, yet they could hear the odd car traveling the highway. The estimated the object to be twice a large as a full moon and of course as it moved further away is grew smaller in size due to the distance between the witnesses and the object. Something else she told me, as the circular object moved away, it did not shoot high into the night sky, but flew away in a straight line. I asked if the object lit up the area, she said no. Everyone figured they observed it for approximately a couple of minutes, although the witness felt they had watched it for a life time due to the strangeness of it. They were going to check the fishing nets that were set that night, but after seeing this thing, they did not want to go anywhere near the river and went back to the tents. When they all returned home the next day the woman called the local Prince George radio station and told them what they had witnessed, as she wanted to know if anyone else had reported the same object, but no reports came in.

Driving west on US route 6 out of Sheffield Lake towards Lorain Ohio at about 35 mph in light traffic, the road is only one lane in each direction and follows the southern shore of Lake Erie, homes line both sides of the road, the ones on our right have the lake as their backyard and are about 200 to 300 ft off the road.Myself and one other person are in the first vehicle and a friend was following in another. Ahead on the right is a cluster of trees near the city limits and through that I see a very bright white light appearing motionless. There are sometimes Medical helicopters traveling along the shoreline but this was not moving. As we cleared the trees there it was about 50 ft above the lake right next to a large 3 story house, a very bright white light that appeared to be star shaped but as we got closer you could make out faintly in the light a saucer shaped object with a dome on top and one red and blue light below it, steady not flashing. The light was very intense yet gave no reflection, not on the house or on the ground. Iam still driving westbound in some traffic, I slowed down and want to stop but unless you go into a driveway you can&apos;t. Then the object started moving, pacing us at about 30mph, still maintaining its position over the shore line and going behind houses, yet no reflection on anything.It looked to be about 20 to 25 ft in diameter and did not change it&apos;s appearance.My feind said be carefull driving, since I was staring at the ufo. All of a sudden a feeling of fear came over me, not just being afraid but near terror. I was driving ok and leaving about seven or eight car lenths behind the car in front because I was trying to make out exactly what the shape within that light was and keeping along side of it. Then I thought &quot;fear,fear what&apos;s with this fear.&quot; Then all of a sudden the fear left and a felling of contentment repaced it. A close encounter ? I couldn&apos;t tell you but remember we&apos;re still going down the road. We were watching the ship the whole time when after about 5 blocks, we made the one traffic light, the ufo started to speed up, just got faster and faster heading in a westbound direction and climbing in the sky until it its light became a pinpoint and was over the horizon. The climb was very gradual as it excellerated away very smoothly, no sound was heard.  The sky was clear and when it was over I made a comment but my friend said nothing. The person following us didn&apos;t see a thing, said he was busy with the cd player in his car. I have sent in a few other reports from my part of the country but never anyting like this. The geographical location is near Avon Point on Lake Erie and I have read other accounts from here. Oh by the way, I downed a drink as soon as we got to the pub.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))", "My wife and I were on our honeymoon and I was out running on the beach very early in the morning. I stopped to stretch and look at the stars sometime between 3:00 and 3:30 a.m. I believe. I was looking out toward the west (slightly south) above the ocean as we were staying in Lahaina. Suddenly one star flared brightly and decended. If I put my hand about a foot in front of my face and spread my index and thumb fingers apart I&apos;d say the object fell down about 4 1/2 inches. It then turned toward the left. The turn was a curved (not sharp) 90 degree turn. Also, the speed of both the fall and the turn was fairly constant. It was brightest at the bottom of the fall and during the turn. It then ascended straight up again and slowly faded in brightness to about the size of a star or satellite. It then proceeded on a straight course over my head and past the hotel behind me as if it were a normal satellite. While it passed over head I observed only a straight course with no turns and the speed stayed fairly constant. I&apos;ve read other reports and comments by investigators about &quot;iridium&quot; satellite flashes. I&apos;d like to know exactly what those are in case that might be it. However, from my vantage point it clearly looked as if it &quot;fell&quot; into the atmosphere, veared off to the left, and then rose out of the atmosphere. I don&apos;t know of any commercial aircraft or even space craft that can currently do that, but wouldn&apos;t be surprised to know that our military might have something like that.((NUFORC Note:  Iridium satellites do not turn during the short period of time that the sunlight glints off their solar panels, and is visible to witnesses in a small area on the ground.

In the sky it was about the size of half a dime, and it was a very deep orange colour.  It came from the East and flew directly over head of us.  We realized it was a U.F.O when the object made two perfect 90 degree turns right after eachother.  Again it was completely silent.  It continued to fly straight to the west and dissapeared in the horizon((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Dozens of residents see lights in the sky.On the evening of January 31, 2004 a large number of Prince George residents were stunned and puzzled over what they were witnessing in the night sky between 8:00 - 10:00 p.m., PST. Some called the Prince George Citizen newspaper to explain what it was they saw, and how peculiar it was. All of the witnesses, by the dozens, observed two extremely bright, orange circular lights in the sky. The lights stayed fairly close together and did not make any sudden moments. Many residents reported the lights just hanging there for a number of minutes before moving ever so slightly. HBCC UFO Research was contacted by the Prince George Citizen enquiring about it, and a staff reporter did an interview for Saturday, February 7, 2004, newspaper. Over the weekend the telephone did not stop ringing. Many reports of orange lights came in from Prince George residents. Plus other very interesting reports for 2003 and back as far as the 1950s. Some of these reports included beams of lights hitting their vehicles as they travelled along the highway. A huge ball of light hovering over the tree tops not making any sound. A line of red balls of light sitting stationary in the night sky, etc... After taking the calls and listening to the stories, some of the descriptions started me thinking. More folks contacted me. Some had watched the whole event unfold viewing the lights through binoculars. A retired military man was certainly the key to this case. Plus another lady who also gave a great description of the event. I made several enquiries to the RCMP but the police had no information about the matter and took no calls from the general public over it. I typed up a few reports below from the eye witnesses who called in. Report #1 Report received February 7, 2004 Prince George, British Columbia  Date: January 30, 2004 Time: Between 8:00 &amp; 9:00 p.m. I had a call from a lady on February 7, 2004 who wanted to file a report on something she and her husband witnessed as they were driving down Tabor from 15th. They looked to the east and saw lights in the sky and thought at first it may have been an airplane. The witnesses mentioned they saw no strobe lights which they knew an aircraft would have. They reported the lights were moving rather slowly. As they drove down the road they passed by the trees which blocked their view of the lights in the sky. After they came to a clear area, they stopped the car and looked to the south and again noticed the lights. The witnesses told me that when they saw it again, this time it appeared to look like a black balloon, or umbrella shape. The lady said it looked as if the object would flip over, so the umbrella appearance was at the bottom and then would show up back on top. The lady and husband reported not a sound coming from it and whatever it was dropped downwards. The couple reported the lights as being white in color. The witnesses estimated they observed the event for approx: 5 minutes. The folks didn&apos;t believe the object was very far from their location and said it wasn&apos;t that high up when they first saw it. Also they finally lost sight of the lights when they dropped down low enough that homes finally blocked their view. The people estimated the size to be roughly that of a golf ball. One other note, the witnesses said they believed that the lights were moving diagonally as they came closer to the ground. Thank you to the witnesses for their report. Report #2 Report received February 7, 2004 Prince George, British Columbia  Date: January 31, 2004 Time: Between 9:00 - 9:30 p.m. A gentleman called to report seeing the orange lights witnessed over Prince George on January 31, 2004. He and his wife live near 1st &amp; Foothills in Prince George and were planning an evening out when the walked out of their home, which faces towards the downtown area they noticed the two orange colored lights in the night sky. They said the lights were very bright and that is what caught their attention. The witness went on to say he is used to seeing helicopters and fixed winged aircraft flying over all the time, but what he could not understand was the brightness of the lights, also how close the lights were to one another. The couple stood just outside their front door watching the lights for a good three minutes, but due to them having reservations they had to get on their way. The husband wondered if it might be a UFO, his wife said it possibly might be a plane, but both still thought it looked rather odd. He told me he almost dismissed it at that time. But as they drove along 1st Avenue heading towards Tabor and not traveling very far the fellow decide it was time to pull the car over as he said one doesn&apos;t get to see anything like this very often or ever. As they both sat watching, they were able to get a good view of what was taking place. One of the orange lights appeared to be over top of the other or maybe off to a bit of an angle to the left. Another 3 to 4 minutes passed and the bottom light started dropping off towards the left and seemed to flicker a little bit. He thought it may have been going into some of the light clouds that were present that evening, then all of a sudden the light disappeared. The other light was still visible and stayed around the same area in the sky for a little while longer. The witness estimated the last light held it&apos;s brilliance for maybe another 30 seconds before it started to flicker. It began to fade and then would become very bright again. This went on for a very short period of time before it to vanished. Again it was lightly overcast with a high ceiling. The witness also estimated the objects were roughly a finger length apart if one was to hold out their hand at arms length. The witness stated that the lights did sit stationary for some of the time, before moving. The witnesses reported no sound was heard, and no aircraft were seen in the area. At arm&apos;s length, using his thumbnail to guess at an approx: size of the lights, he said each one may have been one fifth of the size of his nail. Thank you to the witnesses for their report. Report #3 Report received February 7, 2004 Prince George, British Columbia  Date: January 31, 2004 Time: approx: 9:30 p.m. Calls kept coming into HBCC UFO Research over the January 31, 2004 sighting in Prince George, B.C. Below is another report from a fellow who wanted to tell me what he witnessed that evening. The evening was overcast and no stars were visible at the time of the sighting. The man went on to tell me that his daughter spotted it first and then called to the rest of the family to come out and look at the strange lights in the sky which were reported to be just over top of one of the local mountains. He explained that the color of the lights were an orange/white. The witness also said he thought there may have been a small tail behind each of the lights, but it was hard to distinguish for certain. The lights were stationary for a very short time when these folks noticed them and as they watched, the lights did start to move but ever so slightly. They said there were two very bright lights which looked identical to one another. The man&apos;s wife said they looked like landing lights from an aircraft due to how close they were together, and the brightness of them. They all ruled this out quickly as the lights just stayed in the one area of the sky. They observed the lights rise up for a short distance, still staying close to one another. As they watched one of the lights seemed to disappear quickly, but they didn&apos;t think it went into the clouds as he noted the cloud ceiling was rather high that night and the lights weren&apos;t close to them. The other remaining light was seen to move back, or away from the families location and it also disappeared. Both lights were extremely bright, and the family said they stayed that way until they finally blinked out, or just vanished. These folks figured they watched the lights for at least two minutes before they were gone. The man said, how long they were visible before he noticed them is anyone&apos;s guess. They also reported no sound and the witnesses said if it had a plane or helicopter you would have certainly have heard it. The folks estimated that the lights were approx: 10 times larger than their thumbnail. Thank you to the family for their report. Report #4 Report received February 7, 2004 Prince George, British Columbia  Date: January 31, 2004 Time: approx: 9:30 - 10:00 p.m. Now this was a very interesting call that I received from a man who resides in Prince George, B.C. When I answered the phone, the fellow said he had just read their local newspaper and that he could tell me exactly what the lights were that everyone saw that evening. Below is the report the gentleman gave to me. The fellow said he watched the whole event through a pair of field glasses. It was January 31, 2004, between 9:30 - 10:00 p.m. and the man claims &quot;it&quot; landed two blocks from his home. The witness said what he watched was a couple of night jumpers, jumping with parachutes with lights attached around their feet or ankles. The man observed them coming over from the west over the hill. He mentioned that he had a fairly strong set of glasses (binoculars) and was clearly able to see the jumpers hanging in their chutes and saw when they turned their lights off. One of them landed in a park just two blocks away from the witnesses home and the other went towards the Fraser River and the BCR Railway. The gentleman figured the were practicing night jumping. When the jumpers were first spotted they were rather high up and he and his wife first thought it may have been an airplane. He went on to say the lights were a very bright orange in color, and the reason they were no longer visible was simply because they had turned them off. The fellow, now retired, was in the military himself and had done a lot of jumping and as soon as he spotted the orange lights he thought it looked familiar due to the descent, plus the way the lights were traveling. When he looked through his binoculars he knew exactly what it was he was seeing. He figured the jumpers used their lights to keep track of each other and to designate where they were going to. Once they started getting closer to the ground they turned off their lights and just used the lights from the city to land. He also said the chutes were beautiful, very modern shaped parachutes and the jumpers with such good gear were able to carry out some of the antics they pulled off that cold evening. It was actually comical as the witness said one of the jumpers almost turned himself upside down and then this would give the impression of the lights going back up into the night sky. The two jumpers were carrying out some acrobatics on their way and obviously no sound was reported. Thank you very much to the witnesses for their reports.

Almost 7 years ago my friend and I had been out riding in the woods outside of Libby, Montana, about 4 miles up Pipe Creek Road.  We had stopped so that I could take a nature break and as I got out of the pickup I notice an odd kind of light in the sky just north of our position. The light had a fuzzy apearance as if it were a real bright, but seemed to have a creamy skin surrounding it.The object wasn&apos;t really bright like a star would be and I couldn&apos;t tell just how  far away or  how  high it was in the sky.  I hadn&apos;t seen anything like it before but know it wasn&apos;t  a star or a planet and when I said to my friend, &quot;Hey, check out that weird fuzzy light in the  sky.&quot;  It  moved slowly in behind a tree.The tree blocked our view of the object but I told him to keep looking  at the  upper part of  the tree  thinking that it would appear on the other side of the tree as it passed in the direction that it was moving  but it didn&apos;t come out the other side .It apeared to me to be hiding out of plain view from us.I had a feeling that this was something that maybe didn&apos;t want to be seen.As we continued to focus on the tree for about 30 seconds or so,it  shot off from behind the tree in a southern direction so fast that it apeared to leave a streak across the sky.I asked my friend if he had seen it and if he had ,what direction it went, he said  &quot;south&quot; and  I knew then that I wasn&apos;t seeing things .He  asked me what the hell was that? and I said  it was the light that I had seen when I first got out of the truck. I really  can&apos;t say how big it was norit&apos;s altitude. It  seemed to  hover silently and then instantly travel  in a  southern direction at a very high rate of speed. Nothing I know of can move that fast from a standstill to instant  acceleration. We talked  about it  to ourselves for a few days and then I heard about the major sighting in Phoenix,Arizona via an Art Bell broadcast a few days later. I&apos;m not too sure if it had  anything to do with the Arizona sighting but it was on the same night and  right arround the same time of that  event. I did look on a map and Libby Montana is  almost due North of Phoenix so there may be something  to this sighting that connects the two together.There is also a hydroelectric dam about 15 miles  north of where we were so it may have been of intrest to the object.I do appologise for my late entry of this sighting but feel that it may be helpfull in some way, Sincerly, ((name deleted)), Libby, Montana  ps: I Do Believe we are not alone((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with this witness via telephone, and he sounds quite credible to me.  PD))", "tight faint formation directly over Edmonton, AB Canada. Going NNW.I was observing the planets (5 of them visible this evening). While trying to orient myself I saw a four or five faint lights in a tight formation pass directly overhead in a NNW direction. I thought that it might be a plane, a single object but I had a sense that they were separate because the lights were of different intesities. Because of the faintness of the lights they seemed high yet if they were high then they were going FAST! There was no Sonic boom or anything. It was weird!

I had decided to go outside and get some air, even though it was fairly colod out. I did, and I looked at Venus for a while. Suddenyl something appeared to the left of it. It was a very thin, disk-shaped object, with blue/green lights lining the whole side I could see. It stayed in the sky for a while, the began moving to my right. It didn&apos;t move very fast, but it began to go left and right, then stopped, and just kind of disappeared. I stood there in shock for a moment, then thought about what I had seen. This is not the first time I have seen a UFO in the area where I live.", "This UFO event occurred in August or Semptember of 1961.  I wish someone could shed some light on this matter.  A lot of time has passed since the event, but I&apos;ll try to recall the incident as accurately as I can. It was late summer in 1961 when ((deleted--witness #2)), ((witness #3)), ((witness #4)), ((witness #5)), and myself were camping on ((deleted)) farm.  I believe it was on a Friday late in the afternoon when we set up camp.  I always gathered the firewood and started the fire whenever we camped out.  Just before dusk I set out to gather some firewood.  ((deleted)) farm was a pristine farm consisting of series of rolling hills covered with little vegetation except in the ravines or small valleys.  It was in these places that I set out to find some firewood.  As I reached the top of the second ridge I looked down into a grassy ravine and observed a dead tree lying on its side.  The bark had fallen away revealing a bleached trunk and branches.  It had been there a long time. I went down to the tree and gathered as much firewood as I could.  I thought to myself, just before I descended the hill to the dead tree, how beautiful the contrast of the bleached tree was to the green grass cropped by the sheep.  I returned to the camp with my first load of wood and I asked ((witness #2)) if he would assist me in retrieving some firewood several ridges over.  Thus between the two of us had a sufficient amount of firewood for the night including my first gathering. Late that night we were in our tent telling scary stories.  All of us were around 14 years of age since we were classmates at Princeton High School, in Sharonville, Ohio. Around midnight we heard a strange sound above us which lasted for about 10 or 15 seconds.  The best way to describe the sound is to say that it was a high pitched whiring sound.  It sounded something like a jet engine at idle, but not as loud and it had a softer sound.  We were already a bit spooked and this unknown sound startled us.  I grabbed my bee bee gun and quickly exited the tent, not so much as to face off with the intruder, I just didn&apos;t want to be in the tent where I could not see the present of possible danger.  All the guys exited with me and we gathered together looking to the Southwest.  That seemed to be the direction of the last sounds we heard.  I may add that it is also the direction of the GE, Evendale Jet Engine Plant. After spending a few minutes outside, we reentered the tent and bedded down.  I settled into my sleeping bag while listening for and pondering the possible sources of the strange sound.  As I said GE Aircraft Engine Group was West or Southwest of us about 6 miles and the nearest road was to the North of us about one half mile. I thought perhaps it was the sound of squeaking brakes of a Semi Tractor and Trailer descending down the hill on the road to the North of us or perhaps it was a late night test of a jet engine being tested in one of the many test cells at GE.  In the middle of my curiosity I must have fallen asleep and I didn&apos;t awaken until the next morning. It was chilly so I decided to gather some firewood from the same spot as the evening as before, which was Southwest of our campsite.  To my surprise, next to the dead tree was a perfect circle burnt in the green grass, green for empahsis.  The charred area was approximately 20 feet in diameter and it was Northwest of the fallen tree approximately 20 feet.  I descended to the strange circle and I remember wondering why I didn&apos;t notice the circle the night before.  Then I ruled out the possibility of missing such a blaring landmark since I recalled thinking how beautiful the contrast of the dead tree and grass was just the night before.  I even considered that the KKK may have had meeting and built the fire, surely they would have used the firewood from the fallen tree and it was undisturbed and the charred area was not that of a normal fire.  The grass was simply charred black. I thought I would test my recollection of this site as it was the night before, so I returned to the camp and asked ((name deleted)) if he would help me gather some more firewood without telling him of the burnt circle of grass.  I wanted see if he would have any reaction to the charred circle of grass.  I remember this part of the incident and the conversation that ensued quite well.  As we arrived at the top of the second ridge ((name deleted)) said, &quot;Look at that!&quot; I said to ((name deleted)), Look at what? ((name deleted)) replied, That circle of burnt grass. I said, So...?  He replied, It wasn&apos;t there when we came here yesterday.&quot;  I knew then that this circle of fire had not been there the day before.((name deleted)) and I investigated the charred grass and discussed the possible origins, but all of the possibilities seemed rather lame.  We both agreed that it was not there the day before. I refrained from saying anything about a flying saucer though the thought came to my mind.((name deleted)) and I returned to camp and invited the others to come and see something.  All of us were baffled.  ((name deleted)) never burned open fires on his farm.  Open fires on local farms like ((name deleted)) farm or like the one I lived on at this time was an event that rarely occured.  To burn underbrush or dead trees was a fire hazard too great because of the dryness of the season. Sometime afterwards, I woke up in the middle of the night after a terrifying dream.  I dreamed that I was in a struggle or fight with someone.  It was very dark in my room even though my eyes should have been adjusted to the darkness.  I suddenly realized that a large amount of liquid was running from my nose.  At first,I thought I had a major nose run, but the smell around my face was strange and I could taste the liquid and it was different.  I made my way through the darkness to the bathroom and fumbled for the light switch.  I turned on the light and I saw blood on the light switch cover and then I looked into the mirror and to my utter surprise the lower half of my face was smeared with blood.  The blood was still gushing from both nostrils.  I had never been prone to nose bleeds even when I got into a scuffle now and then.  I cleaned myself up and woke my father and told him of the incident.  Lastly, my concentration on my studies fell way off and I do admit that I wasn&apos;t interested in school at the time, but stuff came to me easily until the above events. I apologize for the lengthy description and I freely admit that I have in the past fifteen years read about people being abducted and/or abused by so called aliens but what I have expressed is true.  I have never seen any hard evidence of the existence of aliens or their spacecraft.  If there is something to my story and the many others I want to know what happened to me and the others...((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.

I was on my paper route in my car this early morning at 3:20, I recall the time distincly because I changed the radio to a song I liked at that time.  I was driving on Carlsbad Village Drive, and about a quarter mile to Tamarack road I experienced something.  Now it being so early there was nobody on the road except me.  I was driving about 25-30 MPH when I saw a real bright light in the sky about the size of the moon.  I was totally baffuled by what I saw and I pulled over to catch a better glimpse of it.  I am an avid listener of the coast to coast am radio program so I&apos;m very interested in UFO&apos;s and such.  It got bigger as time passed and it looked like closer.  About 1 minute passed and all of a sudden it just disappeared.  I was very disappointed but at the same time going crazy and shouting and yelling what ((deleted)) is that????  Then after 10 seconds of dead silence the round bright object landed RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME!!  It was circular and glowed very brightly.  It was probably 25 feet tall and 100 feet from side to side.  I&apos;m only guessing on the estimates, real rough numbers.  I was so stunned I felt like I was going to have a heart attack.  Then I heard a voice as if somebody was talking gently into my ear.  I looked around a didnt see anybody around me.  All of a sudden the craft didn&apos;t glow anymore and on the side of the craft it said &quot;FUTURE&quot;  The Voice said &quot;nobody else can see this but you.  we are from the future.  you are the representative now of the future for this mass.  please lead or their will be dire consequences&quot;  I remember every single ((deleted)) word it said.  It talked very slowly and clearly in perfect english.  I still couldnt see anybody but the craft and after it stopped talking i shouted &quot;who the hell are you????&quot; and EVERYTHING JUST DISAPPEARED.  After about 10 minutes of me shaking and hyperventilat! ing and me getting weak in the knee&apos;s I went back into my car and started it back up.  I then reached Tamarack Road and I looked at my clock in my car and it read 3:02.  I was so stunned.  I immediately drove home and just sat for a few hours at my kitchen table stunned and thinking what to do next.

It was located just west of the Black Hills. As I pullled into the driveway I realized it was larger than I thought and that it was very bright. It had sort of a yellow brightness instead of the stark white you would see in a star. I was amazed and could not take my eyes off of it. I finally called my mom to see if she could see it too. She did! I told her she had to come over and look at it from my house, as I have a clearing that provided a perfect view. I watched it about five minutes until she arrived. Once she arrived we watched it for another ten minutes or so. As I watched it seemed to pulse. We were able to pick out a refernce point right under the light that allowed us to measure the movement. It seemed to sway (or hover) just slightly. I also thought I saw some small lights to the out side of the circle. After it started to sway we noticed that it actually was getting smaller, as if it was moving away. Within about five seconds it was completely out of sight. I checked later but there was nothing.

There were two airliners in the air at what seemed to be about the same altitude and they were leaving trails, but the object was not. I kept watching it and then it just seemed to dart straight up and vanish. A few minutes later I saw another object that looked exactly the same. I don&apos;t know if it was the same object as before or if it was a second object, but its characteristics were the same as the first. The second object stayed in the sky moving to the west for just a few minutes and then it darted up and away like the first object.

It was late night and me and my friend were on a university campus in Birmingham. Neither of us was intoxicated in any way, and although my eyes are slightly less than perfect my friend had correct glasses and we both concurred in what we saw. At about a 60deg elevation I noticed an area of the sky (virtually cloudless - no clouds near event) where the stars appeared to be moving around in relation to each other, as if seen through a dynamic lens. What caught my attention was that a) it was a windy night and the object/region was barely moving relative to us or landmarks and b) the &apos;stars&apos; refracted through the region were not accurate, that is not only the colour and luminance but the number of stars was different when the object cleared a section of sky. The slow movement of the region and the steady &quot;pulsating&quot; of its shape was entirely inconsistent with wind or thermal rising (I&apos;ve been known to dabble in parascending and gliding - I know airborne objects). I remember observing the object for 20-30 seconds before mentioning it to my friend, in case I sounded stupid. When I directed his attention  to the area, he also remarked that it was not behaving like anything subject to the wind, or flight. The best way I can describe it is not as a craft or solid object, but as if an object roughly the shape of the familiar weather-map &quot;cloud&quot; was wandering about the sky, pretending to be transparent. Size and altitude are very difficult to quantify, but my best *guess* would be 2,000ft. The region was roughly the size of cigarette pack at arm&apos;s length. Plastic sheeting or other natural phenomena (with the possible exception of some sort of thermal or other atmospheric anomaly I&apos;m not qualified to identify) was discounted by both of us in our conversation, for the reasons mentioned above and (I&apos;m fairly sure) other reasons I can&apos;t readily recall. My recollection is crystal clear in that we both agreed it was unexplainable at the time and after watching it for a while, we said something along the lines of &quot;Well, that was ****ing strange&quot; and moved on to our destination with no explanation other than &quot;we just saw a UFO&quot;.

The only way someone else could have seen It was if they were looking straight up. Anyway, it was a very large craft and it was moving very slowly following the interstate I-65 going south like it was following something on the Interstate. It had three distinct circular lights on the bottom of the craft which was flat. The craft was black in color. I could not say for sure how high up this thing was but If it would have been a jet It would have shook the place at that altitude. I remember hearing a lot of traffic (tractor trailers) on the interstate that were heading south. This thing whatever it was, I believe was following trucks on the interstate for some reason. Maybe Military? Transport of nuclear waste? After I spotted it I yelled at everyone to come outside and look and by that time it had dissapeared into the clouds. This thing had no flashing lights on it anywhere. Just the three dimmly lit lights on the bottom. I saw two or three aircraft in the area to the south but I never saw the craft again. Like I said it was very overcast and this thing was using the clouds as cover. The clouds were very low to the ground that night. It was only visible for about 15 seconds due to the cover of the clouds. I dont think this was a little green man ship.

About 01:30 we decided to call it a night and started walking back to our tent which was across a hay field from the woods we were in.  As we got to the tent I turned and looked to the east and saw what I thought were aircraft wingtip strobes out about 2-3 miles.  I didn&apos;t think much of it at the time so we went about getting the rifles cleaned and put away for the night.  For some reason I looked back in that same direction about 5 minutes later and the lights were still there.  I brought this to my girlfriends attention and had her hand me my rifle scope.  I removed the red dot sight, attached the scope to the rifle, and set the bipod on the car roof to get a steady look at this strange set of lights.  When I got the scope on the lights the were not in fact sitting still but moving very slightly from side to side.  I thought that could be from my breathing but then remembered that I had set the bipod.  I told her it must be a helicopter just hovering out there for some reason and put the rifle away. As we turned back to watch it some more, it moved about a half mile from it&apos;s original position and then started west.  I told her, I guess now we&apos;ll find out what it is.  Whatever it was passed about a quarter mile to the north of us in just a few seconds, and it made no sound at all, no rotor noise, no engine noise.  We looked at each other and I asked if she&apos;d heard anything and she said no.  Well, we both got the willies and decided that we were definatly calling it a night and went to bed. I thought that I would share this with you because I just read the report from Amityville, NY.  We weren&apos;t able to see a shape but I don&apos;t know of any aircraft military or civilian that can move that fast without any sound.", "Sphere like ship seenI was sitting out on the peak, and this big sphere-like shape with flashing lights and a buzzing sound appeared.", "standing outside staring at the moon, i noticed a quiet craft with four lights in an unusual pattern pass overhead.

At first sighting, the object would be approximately over Milford, PA.  It slowly came closer, following a northeast heading.  As it came even closer, passing directly over Port jervis, I could see it was a cluster of red lights that formed a right triangle, traveling with its long side forward.  Standing there on the highway, (looking straight up at it while cars drove past me), it looked like several rows of red lights, (8-7-6-etc.), forming the triangle.  It was a cloudy night and I couldn&apos;t see any real shape, just the perfect triangle of red lights traveling as one thing.  I guessed it to be about 200-300 feet wide and 100-150 feet from front to back.  It was approximately 400 feet over my head and silent, except for the faintest hiss. It was not rounded like a blimp, but flat.  It continued in its northeast direction traveling about 30-40 miles per hour.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It has increased in frequency and because of other events in conjunct with this, I am beginning to suspect other aspects of these &apos;sightings&apos; might be in effect. I was heading out to the garage to get a tool when I had this &apos;hunch&apos; or sinking feeling about the night sky. I almost felt panicked, something I haven&apos;t felt since I was young boy and it was exactly the same feeling, specifically a feeling of being watched. The temperature had dropped significantly, clearing the night sky for some good star viewing this evening. I look at the night sky each and every night, as well as study astrology and do some amateur astrononmy, so I am VERY aware of the placement of Venus, Mars and Jupiter and their present locations in the evening sky. What I first thought to be Venus, was a bit too high yet in the sky for 8:25pm. I looked at it and kept looking at it, and thought it was odd that it looked to be as bright as it did back in late February, when it was much brighter. I continued to look at it and then it did the unexpected, it faded into a very faint dot, and then disappeared. I let out a laugh and said, &quot;I knew it...&quot; With that, I looked DIRECTLY above my head, 90 degrees, 12 O&apos;clock and saw 2 more bright &apos;dots&apos; or orbs&apos; which were flying in an echelon right formation, heading due east. I yelled out, &quot;I SEE YOU!&quot; and with that, they faded from bright to dim dots and continued on their flight path. I tracked them for about 30 seconds until I couldn&apos;t see them anymore and if ANYONE who looks at the light sky knows about simply watching planes, you can see a plane head on and notice lens flare, which catches your attention at first, then you know it&apos;s a plane of course when it approaches closer and then you usually can continue to track it as it heads out in ANY direction thereafter. No, these things were bright looking stars, lower than real stars or satelites even, then turned into dim dots (which then made them look more natural like stars). I hope this makes sense. This is the most interesting part. I looked back in the direction of the first object and as I looked, it came &apos;zooming&apos; back into full brightnest from being merely dim. This is NOT my first experience and in light of recent events, I anticipate these events to be more frequent and spectacular. I will try to keep my camera on me more readily, but I thought I MUST report this just in case someone else took notice of any of it. Thank you for letting me contribute this...", "Circlular rotating lighted low flying craft west of Ina at Silverbell Rd, object moved slowly then instantly disappeared.I was driving west on Ina coming to the Silverbell Rd. when I saw what I thought was an extremly large plane.

We worked rotating shifts and different areas of the base and this particular night I was assigned to work the &quot;South 40&quot; area, which was campsite area on the south side of the base. There were no campers in the area but I sat at the perimeter fence at a gate house with my engine off, lights off observing the stillness of the night. It was completely dark in the area but in the distance you could see lights of other buildings on the base. I was looking in an east direction toward a building where they worked on aircraft inside the building. Just south of that building was a building they tested jet engines at times during the night time. As I was setting there I noticed a lighted object over the top of the mile long building where they worked on planes. This particular building was approximately a mile and a half away from me but you could see the top of the mile long structure. Like I said it was dark and I KNOW for a fact the only lights the building ever had on top were the lights on the four corners of the building. In the center of the building I noticed a variety of lights but NOT blinking like the red flashing lights on the corners of the building. These lights were red, green and blue. I can remember there appeared to be about a dozen lights on the object. I could not see the size or shape of the object. During the night time you could always hear planes taking off or landing. You could at times hear helicopters in the area but this night I couldn&apos;t hear any noise at all from that direction. I kept my eyes glued on those lights and after about 3 minutes the lights disappeared. I was totally freaked out. I wondered to myself, &quot;Did I actually see a UFO?&quot; I didn&apos;t report it to headquarters because the police dispatcher would think I was crazy. After seeing the object I sat there staring at the building and couldn&apos;t see the object anymore. About 10 minutes later the police dispatcher called VIA 2 way radio and told me to call him. I was setting at the guard shack and used the telephone there to call. The first thing he asked me was where I was. I told him I was setting in the South 40 area at the gate shack. He, along with the other officers that worked that area knew when you worked nights there wouldn&apos;t be any noise. The dispatcher asked me if I had seen anything unusual just recently. I told him no but I asked him why and when. He then told me the residents in the Midwest City, Del City area had witnessed odd lights over that particular building and had called their respective police department who in turn called my police dept since it was on the Air Force Base. That is when I told him I DID see something and the object didn&apos;t make any noise at all. That is the only time I had ever witnessed anything like that but since others actually had seen the same thing I did I now DO believe there are UFO&apos;s.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

It was late fall or early winter. I was coming back from putting straw down for our horses in the barn, I often looked up at the night sky to see the stars and the moon. This time it was around 9:30 p.m. I looked up at the sky towards the southwest and there was a kind of longish oval shaped object. It had bright flashing lights around the outside of it, there were white, red and green colored lights. It seemed to hover in one spot for about 5 minutes.While I was staring at this weird object it dawned on me this must be a UFO and I wondered if they knew I saw them or they saw me. A short while later it started to move and then just a flash of light and it was gone from sight. I wanted to tell someone really bad but waited about 5 years after and told my brother. I never told my parents as I knew they would never believe me. I met a farmer once from Montana who told me he saw a UFO also and he is the only person I know who ever told me he had seen one. Hope my recollection of events is ok, I pretty much remember it clearly as it is not something easily forgotten. Additional Information Below. Good Afternoon Brian,  1. - The location it took place was outside North Gower. North Gower is about 20 miles south of Ottawa.2. - The sighting lasted about 5 minutes.The lights on the object were horizontally around the object and flashed in kind of a sequence.3. - The object did not change shape.There was no sound heard during the whole time.4. - I am guessing 10,000 feet, hard to judge as it was dark at the time.5. - I think I recall a whitish flash when it took off.6. - That night it was very clear skies with stars out and quite cold.7. - There were no other aircraft that I could see in the sky that night. I hope this helps. Take care Brian  Thank you to the witness for the report.

Cordially, Peter Davenport((END))((RESPONSE))Dear Mr. Davenport,I&apos;ll tell you all that I can remember.It didn&apos;t look at all like a contrail, or even a shadow. It was very dark, quite opaque. If you can imagine a thick black pen mark drawn into the sky, but very crisp. I would swear on all my senses that it was solid. It wasn&apos;t above us, it seemed to be directly to the side of the plane, far off, but who knows depending on its actual size. It was stationary --hovering, if you will. It looked like a perfect tear in the sky. We were heading west, so it was to the north of us.I can understand where you might think it was a shadow of some kind, but it was so perfectly linear, not at all hazy or smokey. Like a perfect black line segment in the sky, short and constant. After viewing it for a while, one more became clearly visible above and behind it... it seemed to be futher back but there is limited perspective in the air, as you know.

I happened to glance NW of my position and pointed at three large, bright lights in the sky. They seemed to be motionless, and almost looked like airplanes, but were too close together and in a triangular shape.My mom ran inside the house to get my digital camera while I stared at them to see if they were moving, but they appeared to be either at a stand-still or moving directly towards me. My brother came outside and looked at them and said they were probably airplanes, but I mentioned that they made absolutely no sound at all, and were close enough that they should have been rather noisy. He shrugged, watched for a second and walked back inside. I took four pictures of the lights, but only 3 showed anything other than colored pixels.After the first flash of the camera, the objects began to move slowly southward, toward Ahtanum Ridge. There was a large, distinctly triangular object in front, moving extremely slowly, and a smaller craft following closely behind it, blinking red, white and blue. If it had made noise, or moved in a different direction, it could have easily been an airplane. But it didn&apos;t, and as far as I&apos;m concerned, it wasn&apos;t. There was a third one, the same size as the one in the front, following a little farther behind the smaller craft in the center. They were all traveling exactly the same speed, which was also why I decided they weren&apos;t airplanes. When you live in the same place since you were born, you know the air traffic and where it moves. Airplanes don&apos;t fly over Ahtanum ridge unless there&apos;s an emergency or touch-and-go training.Another reason I don&apos;t believe they were airplanes is because of their speed. All the planes I see, flying that closely (I couldn&apos;t give an accurate estimate as to the distance between myself and the three craft.) would make at least a tiny bit of noise. Considering the size of the outer two objects, unless they were stealth bombers, they would make quite a bit of noise. The smaller one, if it hadn&apos;t have been following the others, I would have easily dismissed it as an airplane at a much farther distance.Then they turned left at a slight curve and vanished over the ridge, heading towards Wapato, Washington.Mom and I got back into the car and headed north, and upon reaching the stop sign at a T-intersection, heard a car alarm sounding, coming from the left towards the fire station. All of the lights at the fire station were on, as well. The only reason the car alarm took us by surprise is because we live in the boonies and I had no idea anyone out here even had a car alarm. If they did, we&apos;ve never heard it before and we&apos;ve lived here for 18 years. The reason I&apos;m not attaching the pictures I took is because my mother sent them already in a previous report. She didn&apos;t know I had filled one out the night it happened, so she sent her own description of the events.", "Truckers followed by pulsating red light for 2 nightsOn March 22nd, approx 21:30 hours, two gasoline tanker truck drivers were followed by a large pulsating red light down rural Interstate I-81 in east Tennessee.The light was first noticed by the second witness in a truck following the lead truck.He radioed the lead driver to notify him of the odd light which was moving with them at 70 mph.

Unknown object in sky emitting or reflecting lights in area of EPCOT, Florida. Not noticed at scene. Only noticed upon viewing of photo on computer. Photo was taken on a Sony DSC-P92 digital camera.

I work at Epcot, and was surprised one night to see small white objects flying erratically over Spaceship Earth (the huge white ball at the park). It soon became apparent what they were: The lights which illuminate Spaceship Earth shine up from the ground, and portions of the beams miss the building and continue into the sky. This light is impossible to see, unless something in the sky enters a beam and is illuminated by it. For reasons I still don&apos;t understand, sea gulls and bats make a habit of flying around this area after dark, entering and leaving the light beams continuously. From a distance it appears as if small, brightly lit objects are performing impossible acrobatic maneuvers in the sky. I&apos;m not surprised to see the few reports in your database that seem to refer to this phenomenon--I&apos;m an amateur astronomer used to observing the sky, and I found it quite startling the first time I saw it.

On Saturday night, April 12, 2003 between the hours of 8:30 PM and 9:00 PM, I was on the fishing bay bridge (Pensacola side) at pillar marker number 44 just before the so called &quot;hump.&quot;  I was facing directly due East with the 3/4 full moon brilliantly shining at an angle in the sky between 1 o&apos;clock and 2 o&apos;clock; and when I was facing directly south, the moon was brilliantly shining at an angle in the sky slightly beyond 12 o&apos;clock.  The night sky was crystal clear with no clouds in sight, and the temperature outdoors was about 50 degrees Fahrenheit.  While I was looking directly due east, I noticed a large, star-like object between 22 to 30 degrees above the eastern horizon, and the object appeared to be located near Navare or Fort Walton Beach.  It was flickering like a star that cyclically changed into different colors of red, green, and blue.  My first thoughts was UFO because the lights were changing in a timely color pattern.  It also appeared and felt to my perception to be inside our atmosphere, but the distant was too vastly away to make any definite identification in which I could clearly identify what I was seeing.  It almost seem like it had an oval shape to it which the elongated part of the object was facing upwards.  I was wondering to myself if I was the only person out of about a hundred people who were fishing on the bridge that night may have seen what I saw.  So in a UFO joking mood, I decided to briefly shined my floodlight for less than a few second directly towards the object as in playful mode to get the attention of whomever may be inside if it was a UFO (like who shined that light at me, somebody can see me thought) which at time I was still actually thinking it was possibly a large planet or star, and I wanted to get the attention of the people on the bridge so they might glance at the flood beam and gazes towards the direction that I saw the star-like object in the sky.  The floodlight&apos;s beam could not reach the object that I saw in the sky.  Since the object didn&apos;t move an! d it appeared to be stationary, I decided that the object I was seeing was just a large star or planet since some stars or planets do flicker and shine similar like the object that I seen.  But the object that I just described is not the main reason why I wrote this account.  It is what happened two to three minutes later after I briefly shined the flood light at the object (star).While I was still facing directly east as I was fishing and becoming bored because the fish-bites were slacking, I saw an commercial airliner appear from out of the tree line directly from the North-East slightly over the bay.  The commercial airliner began making its slow, sharp bending approach about a mile out into the bay towards Pensacola&apos;s airport for landing.  As the commercial airliner was veering towards the airport, it looked like it had a zillion lights on it.  The commercial airliner disappeared from my viewing as it approached and  descended towards the Pensacola&apos;s airport landing strip.  The commercial airliner seem like it had been escorted because about 10 to 15 seconds later, two military aircraft appeared from out of the same direction and elevation the commercial airliner had just recently appeared.  The military aircraft didn&apos;t follow the same route that the commercial airliner took while it was approaching into Pensacola&apos;s airport. Instead, they made their turns towards Navare or Fort Walton Beach separating from each other as they flew towards those cities.  They also began flying in what appeared to be a zigzagging or searching pattern.  I could clearly see the shape of the military aircraft in the moonlight.  The military aircraft also had their identification lights on which were blinking red on one side of the wing, and blinking green on the other wing.  Their strobe lights could be clearly seen all the way across the bay.  Then about  30 seconds later, I saw an object come from the same direction and elevation the commercial airliner and military aircraft had appeared.  The direction of the object was either directly from the north or from the northeast at an angle of 45 degrees above the eastern horizon heading south.  This object seem like it had just tailed the commercial airliner or the military aircraft.  This object when first spotted appeared to be only 2 miles or less away from my position or 1/8 the distant from the fishing bridge to the midway bridge which is near t! he town of Midway.  This object was horizontally traveling at the same elevation the aircraft were flying and about the similar speed of a landing commercial airline, and the object was brighter than the brightest satellites; the object&apos;s light seem like the same intensity of arc-welding, yet, it almost seem like it was glowing but in a soft glowing manner of either a pure white color or of arc light color.  I can&apos;t recall if the object reflected a mirror image of itself onto the water&apos;s surface, but I think it did since it was so brilliantly illuminating.  The object also seem like it had a solid and spherical shape similar to a globe.  If the object that I was viewing was a satellite, it was too extremely low in orbit, for I seen satellite traversing the skies in the past.  This object had no distinguishing shape such as an outline in the moonlight, nor did it create any audible sound as it approached my position.  If I was to estimate the size of this object when I saw it at its closest approach to me of about a thousand yards or less, I would say it appeared no smaller than a baseball, or no bigger than a basketball.  When I first seen this object, I wasn&apos;t expecting it and it scared the blinky-blank out of me because the first thing that entered my mind after just shining the floodlight at the star-like object was &quot;OH blank!  That must be a UFO scout investigating who just shined a floodlight at the mother UFO ship!&quot;  My fear then ease to &quot;it must be a satellite because it looks like a satellite.&quot; But I was still wondering until after few seconds had past then I said to myself, &quot;That is an awfully low satellite going really slow.  It can&apos;t possibly be a UFO.&quot;  I was mesmerized by the object because I never seen anything like it traveling so low and slow and brilliantly illuminated.  But still this is not the main reason why I wrote this account.What really caught my attention was the fact while I was watching what I thought may be a satellite traversing the sky, the object&apos;s (satellite?) illumination just simply turned off like somebody flick the light switch to the off position once it past my two o&apos;clock angle.  The object&apos;s light just didn&apos;t dim and fade away like other satellites that I seen in my past.  Just about a couple of miles before almost entering Gulf Breeze area, this object just instantly stopped shining its lights.  This object didn&apos;t even forwardly project a beam like a headlight beam.  I seen meteorite&apos;s in my past, and those meteorites had always left behind what I call a trailing light.  The object I saw traversing didn&apos;t have this trailing light for like I said, it originally look like a satellite.  The military aircraft never ventured into the area where I saw that traversing object where it just simply disappear in a blink of an eye after viewing it for at least 30 second to a minute.Is it possible for satellites to just instantly blink out so far away from the horizon, or what I saw that night was truly an UFO possibly posing as a satellite?  I never in my past searched for UFO&apos;s in the sky, nor did I do any UFO sighting research about past sightings of them until these events occurred, and I am still seriously skeptical about UFO&apos;s reports, but the night I saw those events still has me thinking of what type of object it was that I saw traversing the night skies, and what was it that I saw motionlessly situated except for changing color pattern near the distant horizon?  Was it just a fluke incident of nature?  About a week after the incident, I looked at some star chart for that night.  All of the viewable planets were on the West side that night, and the only bright star viewable on the east side was suppose to be way down south.  I looked at the satellite charts between the hours I saw the glowing object, but I could not find any satellite that may had been traversing during those hours I saw the glowing object that instantly disappeared before my very own eyes.  I couldn&apos;t possibly be the only person who saw this object which simply vanished into nothing with the  moonlight brilliantly shining everywhere; there were just too many people on the fishing bridge that night.  Well, I guess I&apos;ll never know what I saw, and it almost a year later and still I can&apos;t find any answers to what I saw that night.  What I wrote is the best that I could describe of what I saw on the night of April 12, 2003.", "Seperate small white lights flew around eachother randlomly then formed a triangle formation and flew towards the moon eclipse.My brother, his friend and I were watching a moon eclipse.

The entire triangle flew as one unit, but before the lights made the formation they flew as independant objects.Again - the individual U.F.o&apos;s looked like stars.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

There, Highway 4 is two-lane, and twisty. It has an upward grade on the West side and a valley to the East and the road goes slightly to the NnE. Because Highway 4 is winding and visibility is low at this point, I was driving slowly (40mph or less) when I saw a small ball of Blue-white light to the west side of the road, apparantly coming towards me. The west (left) side has a grade that goes up steeply, and whatever it was would either have to go up the hill or onto the road.I slowed further and pulled to the centre of the road. At first I thought it was someone on a snomobile outing, but it was the twilight of day and I saw no snomobile, but just the light. The ball of light, as it turned up to be, came onto the roadway from the west side, and rolled in a SsE direction. It rolled over the Northewst (front driver) corner of my car and across the hood. It did not burn the paint or make sparks off of the car. The ball rolled up the hood and spread out over the windshield. My radio ariel is inside of the windsheild as wires in the glass so there were no sparks from it, either. As the ball passed over the center rear of the hood the engine died cold, although the car continued to roll of its own momentum. The dashboard lamps and headlamps went out, and the radio went off. The ball passed over the roof of the car and rolled down the back window, and across the trunk and off of the southeast (rear passanger) corner of the car. I can&apos;t be sure I heard it make a sound, if it made a sound it was like a plastic grocery bag rattling if you crumpled it up. I looked in my mirror and saw as it rolled southward a short distance (30-40 feet)down the center of the road and rolled off the East (right) side of the road into the valley below, where I lost sight of it. I turned my key off and turned it back on, and as the car was still rolling and in gear the motor started up, although the headlamps and dash lamps were dim for a few miles. By the time I had reached Estherville (Ten Miles North) the headlamps and dashboard lamps were brighter, and I continued on to Spirit Lake via Highway 9. By the time I reached Spirit Lake (about 20 miles West) all of the lamps and the like seemed to work, but my presets on the radio had to be reset, and the clock was wrong. The ball of light left no marks on my car&apos;s paint or the vinyl roof, and as my car is old enough not to have a computer in it (1978) there seem to be no lasting effects. I was physically unharmed, except that I had &quot;flash bulb syndrome&quot; (a ghost of the light was showing up as an after effect) for ten miles or so, and some metal fillings in my teeth hurt for a few days.", "Triangle Shape, 2 bright halogen lights, clear or hollow middleUFO Sighting March 21, 2004 7:26pm Kingfisher, Oklahoma Highway 3  My friend and I were driving west (into Kingfisher) on Highway 3 when we saw what we thought was a low flying airplane.  We continued to look at the &quot;plane&quot; and realized it couldn&rsquo;t be a plane because it was to bright.  At that time the flying object flew straight down as if it were going to crash. That is when I saw the 2 very bright (like Halogen lights) on either side of the object and the shape was a triangle.  The weird thing was it was clear or it did not have a middle (only the outside shape of a triangle).  It continued to go straight down for a couple of seconds then did like a U-turn and started flying (right above the tree line) the same way it did before it flew down. After it did the U-turn and it was flying horizontally. It hovered over the ground then went straight down and landed.  We could see where it landed though the trees.  All we could see was a very bright light. We turned around at a gas station and went back.  We turned down a dirt road, which was really a cemetery.  We got scared and didn&rsquo;t want to go into a dark cemetery so we turned back around and started driving the way we were originally driving.  We could still see the bright light though the trees. I turned to say something to my friend, looked back and it was gone.  Just like that. I don&rsquo;t know how it went out or where it went. All I know is what I saw was not a plane. It was in a triangle shape with two bright halogen lights on either side. I hope this report helps!((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and she seemed quite sincere to us.

Also, NUFORC said that my description was not inconsistent with a sighting of Venus.  I thought that also, but what concerned me was that the object was VERY MUCH brighter than I have EVER seen Venus, plus the fact that it just disappeared after about 30 minutes.  Also, the next night, Venus was not in the same position in the sky.  The star or whatever we saw was down lower to the horizon and a little more towards the north than Venus.

A friend of mine and I decided to continue practice softball after everyone had left. I hit a high ball and as I watch it I noticed six spheres flying in formation. Told my friend to look up and he and I watched them for about 2 minutes. It was a arc&apos;d flight in the vacinity of Fort Lewis. They were in formation as one then two and again one then two. Based on the size and distance away and because McCord Airforce Base was close by, I now estimate the size to be that of a Boeing 747. When we ran home we turned on the radio to a talk show and they said that over 100 people had called in asking if the Air Force was testing a new type of flying vehicle. In 1957 when I had returned home from a date, I glaced to the northern sky overlooking Tacoma and noticed a disk shaped object the size of a Boeing 727 flying over Tacoma in and out of clouds. This lasted about 30 seconds due to the cloud cover. No noize and the object was metallic with what looked like windows around the perimeter of the DISK. IN 1965 I student taught in Bellingham, Washington. In a science class I mentioned the fact that I did see a UFO once. An indian boy of age 14 came to me later because he did not want to be ridiculed and told me of an incident when he viewed a UFO hover overhead and then take off directly upwards at high speeds. In 1968 I was a system engineer at Boeing after finding out how little teachers get payed since I also had a degree in Physics. I was in a car pool. I mentioned once that I had seen a UFO and one of the other fellows remarked that he had seen a cigar shape UFO once. In 1969 I was a manager of system development at Boeing and one of my employees told me during lunch that when he was traveling to California from Washington, six USO flew overhead and caused some interference such that the cars on the freeway stalled out. In 1980 as manager of On Line Systems for an insurance company in Galveston, Tx.I again mentioned the fact that I did experence seeing a UFO and one of the staff members said that he say a small sphere flying around his neighborhood in a northern state (don&apos;t remember which one.)

We noticed as the objects got closer to each other they turned an orange color and seemed to &quot;pulse&quot;.

It was deeper and more consistant than a helocopter and not the same as the C-130&apos;s that have a low level route in our area. My wife heard the noise also, and by the time we could realize that it wan&apos;t a normal sound it had faded off into te distance. As bes we could tell it came from the south west and traveled to the north east. We are familiar with the Flight for Life helicopters that cross the area and it was not that sound. Other people in the aea heard the sound also, but most were asleep. I am a former USAF pilot with 5000 hours, a CFI, and have operated a Charter Air Service.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and found him to be exceptionally credible.  He is an unusually capable witness, we believe.  We have invited him to try to locate other witnesses to the event.  The witness did not see the object, only heard it.  We would invite other witnesses, who may have seen the object, to submit reports.  The witness is quite certain that the sound was not the result of a helicopter, and he believes it also was not generated by a B-2 bomber, which are based at the nearby Whiteman AFB.

Distant, hard to hold in viewfinder.In the western sky I saw a bright round object about 20 degrees above the horizon.  At first I thought it was a planet, such as Mars or Saturn.  I stared at it, and I noticed the object moved around at random, not particularly rapidly. There was no trail. The light emission was steady, not blinking. This moving object was confirmed by a second observor who said it looked like a Mercedes Benz 3-pointed star without the circle around it.  I put the videocamera on it and at 20x zoom it appeared to be a sphere.  It was difficult to keep the object on screen when at max zoom, so I conclude it was a good distance away.  We are in a flight line to the Manchester, NH Airport (it is 4+ miles NNE) and see a lot of planes, usually coming in from the SW but occasionally from far away in the West.  A plane came in as I was videoing this object, so I put the camera on the airliner for a contrasting shot.  It was not comparable to the object.  Planes are steady, this object was mobile horizontally and vertically and is not like any plane or star I have seen before.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect Venus may be the explanation.

We were playing on the old number 2 hole (new #11) on the Granite Pointe Golf Course. We both heard planes overhead, and we saw quite a sight. At least three military type jets flying in close formation around a much larger plane. The plane seemed to have a very large tank or possibly craft underneath or attached to it&apos;s belly. The planes were flying quite low. A Chemtrail/contrail seemed to be coming from the bizarre looking craft or tank. Later that day, a couple who live on Kootenay Lake - and a co-worker of mine, - 5-6 miles away, saw several jets flying patterns for over 20 minutes above the lake. The jets numbered at least 4 -5 at any one time. and seemed to have a very large amount of exhaust.

I was driving; therefore, I was unable to watch the entire time.  It had just gotten dark and we noticed what we thought was a plane above the trees on the road.  My friend mentioned that it was really low to the ground and I said, it was probably near an airport.  There were two very bright, square lights on it.  Then it looked like it was going to crash because it was heading straight for the ground and then it would even out.  Then the next time I looked at it was hovering straight down, slowly to the ground.   It was close enough to see the bright lights, they were separated and I it was not a normal shape, kind of like a triangle, but not close enough to see in detail so we decided to turn around (it was about &frac12; a mile until we turned because it was a highway) and we went toward the lights, on the same route, which we could still see through the trees.

She said it occurred early in the evening, while it was still very light, and, again, had been an overcast day. She said the &quot;shooting star&quot; disappeared from view behind the mountains north of New River. The details stuck in my mind because November 8th was my birthday. I also investigated several websites dealing with meteorites and found that smaller ones are usually only traveling a few hundred kilometers per hour that low in the atmosphere.

I live in Manitoba (Canada) and just to the Southwest corner of Riding Mountain National Park are a few lakes. I stay at a northern Lake. It was approx. 3:00 p.m... Variable cloud, otherwise a very clear sky. I had been out fishing for a few hours that day and the fish were slow at biting from the heat of summer. I was just about to come in to the shoreline somewhat from the center of the lake. I reeled in and set the rod in the boat. I felt a strong gust of wind, having been fairly calm all that day and week. It caused me to look up to the sky, suddenly there directly above me stationary in the sky was a silver disc object. The blue sky in contrast for the background. I could see the edge of a cloud float by above the disc, then blue sky again. It was up a distance in altitude but not to the clouds. I was rather shocked, it is not what you expect to see. The first thought: I was just seeing things, quickly I realized that what I was looking at was really there. I was in awe, my heart was racing..it was there for 1 to 2 minutes then it went straight up. The accent was different from any flying machine that I know of. It had instantaneous movement and it was very smooth. There was no contrail of any sort..nor was there any sounds from it, not that I could hear (the boat was idling) the ship (object) itself was not huge but not small from what I could see. I also noticed it to be smooth, but it was not close enough for any other details to be revealed. The lake where the sighting took place is rather secluded and the are very few people there during the week days. It seems the classic scenario, perhaps it is.. I will be spending my entire spring and summer out there this year. I hope for another if not a close encounter. I will let you know if I do. It is strange, people, they just look at me as if I am weird or nuts. I want to shake them and make them open their eyes. But all I do is smile and tell them it is true. If you have any questions, or feel that I have missed something out. Please feel free to drop me a line as I said I will be around until Spring. thanks. Thank you to the witness for the report. Additional Information:  The object ..the thought..was not even in my mind until I looked up and saw what was up above.. the summer week was hot lifeless air..no wind at all..I looked up to see if a storm was coming or something . Only then did I realize that I was not by myself. There were no lights that I could see...just a smooth silver disc object in the sky above me. As mentioned the object was not close enough to reveal any other details to me...it seemed to be smooth in texture....but again...I feel I was not close enough. When I first looked up..and saw the object...I began trying to figure out what I was looking at ....as the fact became more evident..my heart race increased and my breathing was more...intense...any other effects would more than likely be do to the increase breathing. The boat was sitting in the water ...I was standing in the boat watching it..above me...from what I could see...it remained stationary for the entire time....then....wow....the way it moved...it was exciting...like watching a brand new concept.. and taking it all in, in awe. The craft was in motion instantly...no speed increase....just speed. It&apos;s own shadow was evident on the north side of the object..as for reflection of light..there was a slight glint off it a couple times.

I am 31 as of this writing.  Indeed, I had always wanted to see something, but never had.  I figured that I was just one of the &quot;unlucky ones&quot;.  Perhaps there wasn&apos;t anything to see anyway. I was raised as a Roman Catholic but have never held tightly to those beliefs as I grew older, allthough I do not discount all the ideas embodied therein.  I have never had a truly close relationship with my father, however, if there was one thing he has given me, it is a healthy respect, and dare I say, reverence for the truth. I will also plainly admit that I have engaged on more than one occasion in the use of various mind altering substances.  My primary purpose being that of self discovery.  Having said that, I was not under the influence of any substance at the time of this sighting.  Furthermore, I do not suffer from what might be called &quot;flashbacks&quot;.  Unfortunetly, I do not have a doctor&apos;s not to prove this. Hopefuly this rambling prologue will make sense as I continue.  I feel it will provide necessary insight into my mindset and my validity as a witness.  I can only recount my experiences as truthfuly as I can. And now my testimony:  As mentioned above, I&apos;ve always been fascinated by UFO&apos;s.  And it were these thoughts that crossed my mind while I was flying back to Washington D.C. from Denver, Colorado.  I figured &quot;What better vantage point than above the clouds to see something.&quot;  It was to my great pleasure that I ended up with a window seat for my return leg. I was transfixed by the view out the window for almost the entire flight.  About half an hour into the flight, I figured I&apos;d try a little experiment.  You could call it &quot;sending up a mental flare&quot;.  If there was really anything out I figure I&apos;d try to communicate, to use the term very loosely, with it.  Basically, all this consisted of was me projecting my thoughts into the vast open sky in front of me.  &quot;Show me you&apos;re out there.  Do something!&quot;  As I recall we were travelling between 35 and 40 thousand feet (as noted on that tiny tv on the back of the seat in front of me).  I seem to remember we were travelling at slightly over 500 mph.  Apparently we had a good tail wind. In retrospect, I should have been more &quot;scientific&quot; in noting the exact altitude, time, and location, but in all actuality, I wasn&apos;t expecting to see anything. It was just starting to get dark, kind of grey-pale blue outside but still plenty of light.  My flight left at ~ 3:30 PM Denver time, and the incident occurred about 45 minutes into the flight. From my view out the window, I could tell we were well above the main cloud deck.  Looking straight down, you could not really see the ground except only ocassionaly.  We weren&apos;t above storm clouds per se, they were the more whispy stratus type. The horizon line, however, was marked by a line of cumulonimbus (?) exteneding from left to right across the horizon with the some large gaps between the tops of them.  They got fatter towards their base were they merged with the cloud deck. I could see some cloud to cloud lightning off to the left of my field of view.  You couldn&apos;t see the source, you would just see the cloud light up from the inside.  This activity wasn&apos;t very intense, was rather sporatic, and produced a diffuse lighting effect on the cloud. It was approximately 10 - 15 minutes after my &quot;message&quot; that I noticed that a very bright red-blue strobe began flashing out on the horizon.  It was really at the far edge of my visability.  Not that it was hard to see, more that it was the furthest thing I could see.  It appeared to be on the horizon. For a while, I thought it must be the strobe light from another airplane.  Its pulsating was more or less regular, but the object remained motionless on the horizon for quite some time.  It would flash deep red at first, quickly followed by secondary and tertiary strobes with a more blue or darker colored tint.  The secondary flashes occurred (from what I could tell) in the same place as the primary strobe.  Its size was approximately 2-3 times Venus (?). Needless to say, I was quite intrigued by this development.  The strobe seemed really bright for being so far away. (orders of magnitiude brighter than the cloud lightning; clear and defined).  I finally decided it couldn&apos;t be written off as lightning because it was in the open and not behind any cloud, besides the fact that it was more a point of light than anything else. I watched this remain more or less motionless for some time, maybe 5 to 10 minutes.  I can&apos;t say it was completely motionless as I would look back inside the cabin ocassionaly to gauge the reaction of the other passangers.  No one seemed to notice. After a while I started to think &quot;Is this it? Is this all I&apos;m gonna get?&quot;  So I issued another communication: &quot;Your going to have to do better than that!&quot;  I looked inside the cabin, back out, back in, out again.  The strobe was still there.  I was flabbergasted.  Every time I looked, it was still there. Eventaully, the strobe moved slightly to the right of my field of vision, almost going behind a large cloud.  I figured &quot;Ah-ha, it must be another plane.&quot;  But it never went BEHIND the cloud.  Or in front of it for that matter.  It never came closer or moved further away.  It just kind of stood there on the edge of the cloud, flashing every 10 - 15 seconds. At this point I had been watching it on and off for what felt like quite a while.  Everyone else as far as I could tell was still going on about their business.  The young woman next to me was talking about meaningless career climbing nonsense with an older gentleman in the aisle seat.  This is when I notice a pronounced change in the object. The object was still on the edge of this large cloud.  However, each initial burst was now followed by much more chaotic secondary and tertiary strobes of light that covered what appeared to be a HUGE area. The first stobe would flash at the bottom of the object and was followed by a series of strobes that climbed higher and wider up along the edge of the cloud.  Plese note that at this point there was still a gap between the object and the cloud. It continued to flash at more or less regular intervals and seemed to outline a HUGE shape.  Almost triangular, like an inverted pyramid.  I couldn&apos;t tell.  It was getting darker at this point, but still not what I would consider night.  The space between the strobes was rather dark and I wasn&apos;t able to make out any discernable &quot;edge&quot; to the object. I sat there in awe.  The size of this thing seemed immense.  I would estimate that it was approximately one-third (1/3) the height of the visable part of the cloud; the part that extended above the main cloud deck. I watched this go on for 5 - 10 minutes.   Red-blue initial flashes at its base followed by a succession of chaotic flashes that seemed to cascade upwards to the &quot;top&quot; of the object. This large object remained stationary (from my perspective) at the edge of the cloud for some time.  The flashes were so intense at this point that you could see it light up the edge of the cloud it was next to.  Later, you could actually see the cloud being backlit by these flashes.  The object did not initially appear to be behind the cloud, or at least I would say that most of the object was not behind the cloud.  Since my plane was moving and hence my sightline was continually changing, my view of the object must have changed, possibly explaing why initialy the large object appeared be in the open. Only toward the end of the sighting did I see the dramatic backlighting effects.  The initial effects only lit up the edge of the cloud. The second larger object never approached us either, nor did it ever seem to move further away.  It did not make any real &quot;maneuvers&quot; at all.  Throughout the sighting, from the initial single light to the last time I saw it, the object seemed to remain between two large clouds.  It did not appear to climb or descend in altitude. Also, please note, that the times I have given as to the duration of the sighting are approximate.  Needless to say, it seemed to go on for a VERY long time.  In fact, I watched it for so long that I eventually thought to myself, &quot;Allright, enough alredy.  I&apos;m getting tired of this.  You&apos;ve proved your point.&quot;  I wanted to get a nap in.  Unfortunelty, I never really did drift off. I returned my gaze to the interior of the cabin.  The next time I looked out the window the object was gone. I never mentioned it to the other passengers or crew.  As you can see from the above account, this was a very &quot;personal&quot; experience.  I felt at the time, perhaps somewhat selfishly, that this was FOR ME.  If no one else saw it, that was THEIR fault.  I mean, it was pretty hard to miss.  There was NOTHING else like it in the sky at the time.  In fact, I find it hard to believe that the pilots themselves could have missed it, allthough I assume it might have been somewhat behind their line of sight. I would also like to note, that shortly before this sighting began, we passed another plane heading west and flying slightly lower than us.  I was kind of surprised to see another plan so close to us ... probably less than 1/2 a mile away and probably 1000 - 2000 ft lower in altitude.  (I have tried to refrain from using guestimates as to the size and distance of things up to this point because I really have no clue as to the scale of things from that perspective.)  For what its worth, I noted the size and brightness of the passing plane&apos;s strobes, and the initial single object I saw (as well as the larger object seen later in the sighting) was MUCH brighter and appeared SIGNIFICANTLY larger than this plane&apos;s strobe, not to mention it was MUCH further away.  Additionaly, the palne&apos;s strobes were mostly white, while the object on the horizon was mostly deep reds and blues. In conclusion, I really don&apos;t know WHAT it is I saw.  I merely know I saw something. Perhaps I saw exactly what I wanted to.  Maybe I saw exactly what I NEEDED to.  Whatever the answer, I&apos;m buying a digital camera and keeping it handy on my next plane trip. ;^)  Sorry this is so long.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Sighting involving light formation and a mysterious vehicleWhile driving on back road near Hopewell New Jersey, my friend and I spotted a formation of 4 lights, the bottom three all diagonal to the right, with the top brightest light off slightly to the left. We looked at the formation for a minute while it stayed stationary, and then the top brightest light began to move. It passed the car and changed position from the right of the car over to the left. Once we looked back at the remaining three lights, the next top one moved a little to the right, flew straight up, then disapeared into the sky. After driving a little while longer, we were shocked to find a number of blinking lights surrounding the car. After a short amount of time, the objects disapeared, and we noticed we were being followed by a mysterious car. The car&apos;s headlights were so bright it caused my friend and I to comment on growing head aches. When we slowed to allow the car to pass, it came to a stop, and eventually fell behind us. The whole event lasted about 10 minutes.", "It was gray and did not move or have any light to it.It was halloween night and me and my mom were going around the neighborhood.It was about 10:00pm.I looked up for no reason and saw a grayish colored object with a design of lines running througout the object.I was about 6 years old and was so shocked that I just stared at it.It did not seem to move or have any light on it.I was too young to describe to my mom what I had just seen so I just kept my mouth shut.When I got home I did not say anything.I never sayed anything until a few days later.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

There is a feed company on HW 95 and the round red craft was atop the tallest silo. When I saw it my first thought was, feeding. It lit up the ground under it.  There are a lot of night lights there and I have seen that spot a million times without the craft, so I know it well and the craft was not there before or since, that I know of.  I have seen this type craft one other time, in 1965, this same area.  I was close to that one and I talked to it and lost two hours.  I watched this one for about 10 minutes and I left without saying anything.I lived about a 100 miles from here for 30 years and a neighbor told me they had seen a red ball of a large size behind my house and ask me what it was.

PD))", "Object breaks into parts followed by military helicopters.A lady telephoned me and wanted to report a sighting she and another had in Brisbane, Australia back in 1982. She was living in a two story apartment building which was located on top of a hill and had been living there for eighteen months. Also the building they lived in was right over top of the flight path for their major airport. The jet airliners would come in very low and the lady said it almost felt as if the wheels of these aircraft were skimming across the roof. So she was used to hearing and seeing the large aircraft fly over her home. One evening the couple felt a vibration which was different from the normal aircraft. Actually the vibration traveled straight through their bodies. Thinking something was not right they went to their living room window which had a beautiful view of the city. What they saw was certainly unusual. The brightest object passed right overhead. The witness told me that it looked like burning magnesium as this was the best example the lady was able to think of. Whatever it was, was extremely large and very bright. The woman said it was a brilliant blue/white in color and it was blinking, or pulsating off and on. When it pulsed off they were not able to see anything until the light returned and it was only the bright light which was seen. As it moved slowly through the night sky the object came to a stop over southern Brisbane. It was at this point high up in the sky it again disappeared due to the light going out and when the light returned the object was in a completely different location. It all happened so quickly they wondered how it was possible that any craft was able to move so fast and so far away from it&apos;s last location. This continued for some time, blinking off and on and again appearing in a different part of the sky. The lady said they watched the object for an hour and a half. Just before it left the airspace it was in, the object split into two separate lights. Both of them were now blinking on and off and the colors were amazing she said. She also added the object was shooting off what looked like flares and again these were colored as well. After a short time the two parts joined into one large object again then split into four pieces and now throwing off a large number of what they described as colored flares. Once again all the four separate parts came together forming one large brilliant object and started flying westward towards the desert. The witness said it was very exciting to watch from their veranda. The lady went on to say they knew it wasn&apos;t anything that mankind had as she knew of no technology that would be able to perform the aerial acrobatics this object had done that night in a split second. Something interesting the lady also mentioned was that the international airport had flights arriving and departing approximately every fifteen minutes. She said for the whole time the object sat over Brisbane there was not a flight to be seen coming or going or flying above. As the lady reported above..... the object left, heading west into the desert over the Great Dividing Mountain Range. She was so excited at what she had seen she could not go to bed. It was a warm night so she sat looking toward the mountain where the object had headed. Approximately thirty minutes after the object was out of her sight a group of lights appeared in the distance where the object was last seen. The lights were coming closer and it appeared that they were following the same track the object was traveling, just back tracking. As the lights drew closer and then passed right over top of their apartment the woman was able to see and hear what these objects were. There were four or five military helicopters that were flying in overhead. After the helicopters passed by and out of her sight the normal air traffic resumed their flights. The witness called the airport the following day and the folks there denied that something had taken place the night before. There was nothing in the local newspapers or on radio or television. The folks wondered if they had been the only ones watching the drama unfold in the skies that night. They never did find out what it was or find any other people who may have watched the same event.

At 7:20pm, while taking my dogs outside, I looked up at the moon which was approx. 70 degrees in the western sky at the time, and I noticed what I thought was a satellite traveling across the sky in an easterly direction. The object appeared to me to be the same intensity as an average star and was not blinking. I noticed it in the western sky and watched it move under the moon (about 3 inches under moon from my perspective) and across the sky, heading toward Orion&apos;s belt. I watched the object for 1 min before opening up the front door and calling to my boyfriend, who was on the computer at the time. I told him I thought there was a satellite and he should come check it out. While he was on the way outside, I watched the star-like object pass through the constellation Orion and start to fade out, as if high, thin clouds were passing over. By the time he made it outside, I could no longer see the object in the sky. I pointed out the direction (southern sky) of where I last saw the object to my boyfriend, but he didn&apos;t see anything. I continued to watch the southern sky to see if I could spot the object again. My boyfriend was watching the sky to the NNE and spotted an object that looked like a star moving fast across the sky in a southernly direction. The object moved at first in a straight line, then moved erratically, and back to a straight line. The object seemed to him to leave sort of a small trail as it moved across the sky. I looked up to where he was seeing the object and I did not spot it. He lost sight of it soon after and also seemed to lose interest, as he went back inside. The duration between the time that I first spotted my object to the time that my boyfriend went back inside was approx. 5 mins. I stayed outside watching the southern sky in the direction where I lost sight of the object I was viewing. I watched for another 5 mins. or so and spotted the object again, in the same place where it seemed to pass behind the high, thin clouds, as if it had stopped and started moving again. This could have been another object, I am not sure. It was still traveling toward the east, but the intensity of the light was not as bright as before, still suggesting the cloud cover. I immediately called for my boyfriend to come back out. When I looked back up to the sky, I could no longer see the object. It was a very clear night, with high, thin clouds starting to appear from the SSW on the GOES-12 infrared weather satellite (I checked this 30 mins. later) but no clouds were visible from my perspective.", "In 1980 my brother and I saw a reddish glowing oval shapped objectTheir are only a hand full of memories I remember as a child around the age of 6. As I got older, of course the more I remember. But what I&apos;m expressing in this story now is something I will never forget. Mostly because I witnessed a UFO with someone else, my brother. Don&apos;t get excited, we we&apos;re not abducted or anything, but it&apos;s a classic story anyhow. It was 1980, an average cloudless bright sunny day. I was like 6 years old at the time (I&apos;ll be 30 in March), and my brother was around 11 years old. It was in the afternoon, probably around 1:00 pm (the exact time is hard to remember because I was so young). My brother and I were both in the back seat of our family car while my mother was driving out of our neighborhood. As my mom pulled out of our neighborhood with us two in the back seats, I distinctly remember seeing something in the corner of my eye. My porifrial vision took over in a split of a second. I look to the right of me, up slightly outside of the car window, and I&apos;m stunned by what I&apos;m seeing...a glowing red oval shaped object, not moving at all. Dead still in mid-air. Then suddenly...GONE. It took off directly straight, away from the street we were on...out of sight. My brother sitting in the back seat with me yells, &quot;Did you see that!!!???&quot; and I say &quot;YEAH!&quot; We were both freaked out and explained what we saw to my mom, and she continued to drive like we were her two little boys making a story up on the fly. &quot;Wow, you something in the sky?&quot;. This interesting, the shape of the object differs from what I saw and what my brother saw. I saw an oval reddish glowing circle, halow, so you could see a hole through it (like an aerobee frisby). My brother saw an oval shape, solid, no hole. Anyhow, we both saw that it was reddish orange, oval, not moving for 3 seconds and last but not least, it&apos;s light speed take off in mid-air. I&apos;ve made a picture of what we saw, remember this is an ILLUSTRATION, I made this in Fireworks (similar to photoshop), but it&apos;s pretty close to what we saw:  http://davidpaslay.com/images/ufo.jpg  If you have any questions, or have seen something similar in Colorado feel free to email me at:  ((e-address deleted))((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

This is a very redidential area and the nearest airport is 15-20 miles away. It was comming so low to the ground, we were scared for our lives.After several loops and drops and circles at very high speeds. Again on a residential Area. At one point it seemed that it was comming toward us, then suddenly made a sharp left (my right) and took off so fast. I ran to see the direcction in which went but it was too fast to keep up at night.This object came within 50 to 100 feet of the ground when performing the straight down drops.

About 2 miles father along it, or another, reappeared and a second appeared along side it and after about 30 seconds they winked out one at a time.  Within a couple of minutes I turned right onto COR17 and then left onto the road my farm is located on which runs South West probably a bit more south so SSW.  As I cleared the hill at the beginning of the road another pair of orange balls were visible which also winked out again within 30-45 seconds.  I arrived at the farm about 19:50 and as the dogs and I exited the truck 2 or 3 orange balls illuminated to the SE in the direction of Fort Drum, NY.  These stayed illuminated for some time and I was now looking at them through a pair of 7X50 and 12X50 binoculars.  Even with he binoculars they looked round and I could see the lights of what I assumed were helicopters near them.  About 20:20 or thereabouts I called my neighbor and asked him to look in the direction of Fort Drum and tell me what he saw.  At first he said he didn&apos;t see anything but then I heard his wife say that she could see them and she redirected his gaze so that he also was seeing them.  The balls of orange were now staying illuminated for a considerable time, 10 to 15 minutes.  I called a friend of mine who lives in Governeur, NY and asked her if she could see them, she could not.  I talked to her for quite a while telling her when they were illuminated and when they were not but she never saw them.  The orange balls appeared to drift slowly downward very slowly.  While looking at them with my high powered binoculars it appeared to me that I could see a vertical smoke trail above them.  I re-called my neighbors who had seen them and asked it they could see the apparent smoke trails; they also saw them.  We then decided that they were some sort! of flares that the Army was dropping.  I watched them on and off until about 22:30 when they winked out for good.  As I recall it was a clear night and the moon came out full or nearly so.The apparent size of the balls was such that it would have taken 4 or 5 to cross the moon.  The apparent brightness was about the same as the moon. Today whilst I was perusing your files I came across the report by the young man from Parishville, NY who saw similar orange balls over Drum in mid Sept 2003.  I started reconsidering what I had observed and although they may well have been some type of flare I could see no parachute canopy.  The apparent smoke trail was vertical which had there been a canopy above the flare one would expect that the smoke would have been dispersed or disturbed somewhat.  I have had experience with  USAF ground illumination flares; they were not orange, they were the brilliant white of burning magnesium.  With all of the night vision optics used by the military today I would not expect them to be using flares.  I spent 10 years active duty in the USAF 2 of them as a weapons mechanic 2 in college and 6 as a an Astro/Aero Engineer working space track radar for a year and 5 years as a flight test instrumentation Engineer.  After leaving the USAF I worked for a pyrotechnics company for a couple of years then as an Electronic Engineer for the Navy, Air Force and finally the Army from which I retired in 1995 as a DoD civilian.((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful to the witness for his submitting such a thorough report.  We have invited him to attempt to perform triangulation on the location of the flares, and to contact local military facilities, to determine whether they might have launched flares on this date.

Sun was already setting well below the object leaving it against a dark blue backdrop.", "The object appeared to be over the Gulf of Mexico in the Nokomis FL area. At first there were 3 lights with rays of light above and below. Then 2 sets of 3 smaller lights appeared between the 3 lights. It began vertical and depending where you stood it was horizontal or at varing degrees turned. There were up to 21 lights. I called the police and an officer witnessed this as well. He called in a helicoppter and when it was headed in the direction of the lights they disappeared only to return within 5 minutes. We saw them in the same location from night fall until 8pm so for 3 other nights and then we returned from our vacation.", "Scintillating silvery, metallic object, probably disk-shaped, apparently changing attitudeI was standing on the crest of a hill above my parent&apos;s house (in Fort Worth, Texas), looking northwards, on 20 March 1970 (approximate date) at about 4:00 PM (I was 13 years old at the time). I would sometimes look for air traffic from Carswell Air Force, to my west, from this vantage point. The sky was clear. There was no air traffic in my immediate field of view. I noticed a silvery, metallic object about 30 degrees above the horizon, due north. It appeared to be elliptical, but was probably disk-shaped (1). The object was perhaps two degrees in size, measured along its horizontal axis, and appeared to be fairly distant (there were no physical points of reference that would allow me to judge the size or distance of the object). The outline of the object&apos;s surface was distinct. I might not have noticed the object had it not changed its physical appearance while I was watching it. It appeared to scintillate or &quot;wink&quot;, causing the object briefly to &quot;disappear&quot;, or at least become difficult to see. For the duration of the observation, the object did not move horizontally or vertically from its position, nor did it appear to change size. I presumed from this that the object was spatially motionless. I could detect no sound from the object, although this may have been a function of the object&apos;s possible distance from me. (1) I could not, at the time, account for the object&apos;s scintillation, although I thought it might have been due to some kind of movement. I now believe the object was in fact disk-shaped, having an apparent elliptical shape due to the oblique angle at which I was viewing it. I also now believe that the object&apos;s scintillation, or &quot;winking&quot;, was the result of the object changing its attitude relative to my position. If, for example, the object had been shifting its attitude (relative to me, the observer) by, say, plus/minus 45 degrees along its horizontal axis, it might have appeared to be a scintillating ellipse. I observed the object for perhaps 10 minutes, after which I could no longer visually resolve it in the fairly bright sky. Had the object been a conventional fixed-wing or rotor-winged aircraft, I believe I would have been able to track its movement from its (apparent) rest position to a point in the sky where it would have been obscured by some intervening object or would have gone below my field of view. It was not a lighter-than-air vehicle (e.g., a blimp or weather balloon), as I had seen these in Fort Worth before and was familiar with their appearance in the sky. It was not a missile, as I was also familiar with their appearance in the sky. The fact that the object appeared to loiter also presents some difficulties with its being a conventional aircraft. The object did not appear to be any meteorological phenomenon - at least none with which I was or am familiar. It was also not an astronomical phenomenon. The sky was far too bright to have allowed stars to be seen and, as we all know, planets do not scintillate. The object could have been some type of experimental vehicle. Working for a major manufacturer of advanced (read classified) air vehicles, though, I do not believe this would have been the case. If for no other reason, disk-shaped structures are difficult to control aerodynamically with current technology. It is also difficult to explain why an experimental (or conventional) air vehicle would want to change its attitude in the manner this object appeared to have. I am 46 years old. I live in Los Angeles, CA. I studied astronomy and physics as an undergraduate and have two Master&apos;s degrees (although not in physics or astronomy). As I mentioned above, I work for an aerospace company, selling manned and unmanned air vehicles and systems.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

While he was talking I noticed a weird object in the sky from behind him. I asked him what is that? He looked back and said I don&rsquo;t know maybe a helicopter because it was oscillating strangely. At this point it was still to far away but as it headed towards us I could tell it wasn&rsquo;t a helicopter. I got out of my car and said, &quot;What the hell is that? That&apos;s not a helicopter. He turned and we watched it as it approached us from the south heading north. This was flying disk silver on one side with a black square in the very center of the disk and the other side was black with a silver square in the center. It was flipping end over end like a spiraling football. To the west of us was a hot air balloon, which do always fly in the area during that time of the year. The hot air balloon was barely moving so the disk couldn&rsquo;t have been a balloon because it was moving at 30-60 miles an hour. It was approx 50-100 feet in diameter and flying about 500-750 ft in the air with out a sound. As soon as it was right above us I ran inside to my company and tried to get the photographer for our company to come outside and take a photo or video of it. I was working for a video dating service at that time. He finally came out as it was off in the distance still spiraling and heading north towards downtown Kansas City. He snapped a couple pictures of the disk with a 35 MM camera as it was heading off in the distance approximately 2 miles away. It was reflecting the light from the sun every time the silver side was pointing up. I watched it for a couple more minutes as it disappeared off in the distance and then went on break. I ran over to my girlfriends parents house and told them what had happened. My girlfriend of 5 years broke up with me shortly after this incident. When I got back to work I told everyone that would listen to me about what happened my boss ((name deleted)) denied it and freaked out I guess because he was very religious. I ran into him on the plaza years later with some friends of mine and he finally admitted he saw the same thing and that he may have had a nervous breakdown because of it. I talked with the photographer that took the pictures and he said that the photos came out grainy he said he was using the wrong speed and type of film and exposure.

My youngest son and I ran out onto the back porch, and my other son who just had gotten out of the shower (21, two years of college, works at Costco)also came out to see what was the matter. My husband told us to look at that bright light in the sky that was moving north at a high rate of speed.  We watched it and then it turned back south. My youngest son went and got our binoculars and we all took turns looking at it. Suddenly it stopped and then went straight up into the sky towards the moon. I was looking into the binoculars at that time, and as it was almost to the moon, my husband and both sons yelled out,&quot;There is another one!&quot; As I was looking at the first object which was going straight toward the moon, out of the left came the second one straight toward the first one.  I watched them as their paths crossed. They were both just bright objects like a star, but my husband said for us to be able to see them so clearly at such a far distance, they had to be huge. The second one continued to the South and we lost sight of it quit quickly, but the first one came back from behind the moon and turned back toward us and then went in a NW direction.  We watched it for a couple more minutes and then lost sight of it.

After a few minutes i saw a white light appear beside the star, it began to fall twards the earth.  I thought this was kind of strange, but i continued to watch it fall, not wishing to record the event(pictures/movie ect.).  I thought of it as a meterorite or somthing, and relitivly cool to watch.  The object had then been falling for about a minute, when it began to change.  It started turning red, darker and darker and getting larger and larger.  At this point i thought it was going to explode because of the heat from entering the atmosphere, this happened for about 30 seconds, at which point i noticed that this was mot a meterorite, because it was leaving no trail.  I wanted 2 grab my camera but was enthraled to stay and watch, just to see if I was wrong.  At this point it turned white again, I knew then I had to grab my camera.

At this time the light was moving horizontally across the sky as opposed to vertically.  I filmed it with some shakey hand work, I then saw a commercial airliner, I decided to film that so there would be some refferance as to what airoplanes looked like on my camera, when I looked back at the object it had dropped down again and was now flying horizontally behind some trees.

I called the Sicamous RCMP Detachment and requested to speak to the Constable who attended to the call. I was told by the dispatcher that he wasn&apos;t in that day and I left a message for him to call me back at my toll free number. I did talk briefly to the dispatcher who took the call that night from the excited witnesses. He did confirm a report was made and a RCMP Constable did go to the witnesses home to see what all the fuss was about. After several days had past I received a telephone call from the RCMP officer who drove out to take a look at what the family was reporting. (the reason why there was a delay in the officer calling me back was due to him being off for a few days)  The police officer was pleasant to talk to and we had a nice discussion. He was very helpful in providing me with information on what he saw when he arrived at the location. He was directed to where the object was sitting in the sky. At this point the witnesses said to the officer that the object had moved slightly up higher in the sky and that they had taken video of it. The constable also told me that the witnesses said that it looked more like a diamond in shape when it was lower and orange lights had kept coming and going from the object. The RCMP constable said the witness did point out one orange colored light to him, which he admits to seeing, but he did say he did not see it move. On the large object which caught everyone&apos;s attention that night, I asked the officer if he would be able to describe this to me. He said it was stationary, blue and red lights with clear lighting, almost white light in the middle. The officer also said he did not know what it was. It could have been a number of things. The constable did look through the binoculars at the object and gave me the description of what he saw and whatever it was, was just sitting there. So the officer did see it but he cannot testify to it moving around as he did not see this happen while he was there for a short period of time. The member went back to the detachment to get a phone number for a UFO group who might want to look into the sighting and passed it along to the family. The family called a UFO group and left as message but no one returned their call. They kept searching on internet and found HBCCUFO ...

It was sparkling at a rapid pace changing colors all the while and it would momentarily &quot;dim out&quot; during this sparkling action.  It would change colors from a bright white to yellow, blue, bright red, and green could be seen just before it dimmed.  The colors listed are not necessarily in order of display as it sparkled but all would be regularly present.

Not sure if they flew away in the opposite direction to us or if they literally disappeared.  The were in a row stretching out to the west.

I live about 10-15 miles south of the Colorado Springs Airport,and Peterson AFB. As I watched airplanes flying south towards me,I noticed a large balloon like object that was silver/black in color. It was very large,and seemed not to move up,but over time became lower in horizon,as it seemed to move north.As I was watching this I looked to the northwest and saw a dark object that at first thought was a B-2 Stealth bomber,but I noticed that this chevron had no broken lines as does the B-2.At arms length it was about 2 inches and the balloon shape was also about 2 inches yet balloon was further north.Planes still were taking off and none of them were as large.The airline&apos;rs were closer to me than the balloon was.The chevron looked as tho it was going to land,but I lost sight of it,as I returned my focus on the balloon object.As I watched I seemed to have just turned and walked back into my house.Also as I was watching I called a friend and was relaying what I was seeing on their answer machine.I had enough time to take pictures,but,the thought of doing so never came to mind,even tho I was looking through binoc. as well as visual.The approx. measurements were by naked eye. I heard of a sighting of a sphere shape object around Denver where the sphere followed cars. Tho photo taken by witness was smaller than what I had seen,but color was much the same as well as shape. I haved lived here for about 19 years and have seen more than my share of sightings,where it is almost a common thing. Daylight stars,stars disapering,formations of objects.And many things that are of question. None of things seen are military craft known to public.Colorado Springs is a very heavy packed with military. Norad,Air Force Academy,Peterson AFB. Fort Carson. My location is something I enjoy. I live close to Fort Carson and have an eye level view of Norad.I can see up to the the Academy. Glad I found your site,now I can rest cause I got this off my chest. A thought I had on day of sighting of balloon/chevron I thouht many people would see these as it was early and peolpe going to work.No news on it.The photo of the object in Denver was about same day as mine,I think Mufon of Colorado has the photo.Keep looking up,an around for it will keep you wondering.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The lady said it was almost completely dark out when she spotted it just above the horizon over one of the local hills. A short contrail, coral red in color. She mentioned if it had of been light out she may have been able to see the body of the craft, or something that may have been making the colored contrail. But because of the time of day, and being almost pitch black out she could not see what was causing the contrail. The witness said it was very bright, defined trail. The lady said she didn&apos;t believe it was very high up in the sky and the object did not have any flashing strobe lights on it. It traveled on a steady, straight path not making any unusual moments as it flew along. The witness said she observed it for approx: a couple of minutes and then she walked back into the store.

Well, back in October, my friend and I were walking around our highschool at night because there was a dance going on and we were waiting for some friends to come out. We were on an open football field and the sky was very clear, and I looked up and saw two very large crafts flying in the air. The two crafts were very low and seemed to be traveling very fast! I got the attention of my friend and he saw it too, and we were both in shock. I was in denial that what I saw was not an airplane, but I thought (and still think) that it was something else. It appeared as if the two crafts were flying on top of one another. They had green lights, which then became yellow. I honestly could not see the craft very well, so it is hard for me to determine the shape, but I did see that it was very low, and very fast. The thing that really led me to believe that it was not an airplane was because the crafts seemed to be flying RIGHT on top of another, and I know airplanes do not do that at such high speeds. This lasted long enough for my friend and I to talk to about it and he called his brother who actually has said he had seen it aswell, so it was about 3-5 minutes.

My friend  pointed out to me what initially looked just like a star but as you kept your eye on it you could see that it was moving steadily across the sky and while doing so it was fading to where you could almost not see it but then it started to light up again and glow strong while still moving and then again fade, glow, fade, glow, until it eventually left our sight. It looked like a very distant star but when it glowed it stood out from the rest of the stars in the sky. It was obviously very very distant, further than any plane/satelite/etc. No idea what it was but it had a great rhythmic and steady pattern of traveling across the sky while dimming and glowing, no flashing lights, no noise, and a pretty regular course, no dashing about at different speeds or in different directions. Anyone seen something similar?", "I looked up and saw an object that looked like a star-almost as bright as venus...this was too big and bright to be a satellite.I live in the pathway of an &quot;aviation hwy&quot; which commercial airlines use (East/West)all day long, also at an inbound flight path for commercial airlines into Sky Harbor Airport at lower altitudes.I looked up and saw an object that looked like a star-almost as bright as venus, but was not travelling on the common &quot;aviation hwy&quot; rather heading more NNE crossing that hwy. The light cause a commercial airline to flash its headligts, but this object never replied or changed its path. It also made no noise and had no other visible lights blinking or any other colors. Once this odject passed overhead, Im guessing at about 5 to 10,000 feet, it was probably 15 miles away from me heading NE, and its light was eactly the same, just as bright as if it was a ball of light -as bright and big as Venus - as if it was using that look as camo. Anywhoo.. If it was a plane, the light would have vanished when it was past my location as I would not have been able to see the headlights anymore. So, after the flying planet was probably over phoenix, its light dimmed out until it was gone. This was too big and bright to be a satellite. LATER((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I have been a private pilot for nearly 40 years and have flown over most of the western half of the United States. My 16 year old son was my sole passenger in the right front seat.  We had stopped in Mankato, MN to refuel and have a snack.  Departing Mankato airport approximately 2:15 pm on a heading of 100 degrees, we climbed through a layer of widely scattered cumulus clouds with bases at about 3,500 feet and tops between 4,500 and 5,000 feet. We leveled off at 7,500 feet with good visibility and the scattered clouds below us.  About twenty minutes into the flight we were passing through the area north of Austin, MN and south of Rochester, heading toward La Crosse, WI.  Suddenly the my son blurted out &quot;What the hell is that?&apos; as he looked out the window to his right toward the south. I said &quot;Where?&quot; and he pointed off to the south and somewhat below our altitude.  I spotted an object slightly higher than the level of the cloud bases and 3 to 4 miles off our right wing.  Because of our speed at 170 knots (~195mph) and the intervening scattered clouds I only had a glimpse of 5 seconds or so after I spotted it before it began to be hidden by the passing clouds. My first impression was I was looking at the back end of a blimp or a WWII barrage balloon.  The object was a medium dark grey, oval shaped but a vertical oval.  There were no vertical or horizontal stabilizing fins on it, however it did have two areas on the lower sides of the oval that were slightly bulbous and colored bright orange.  There was no apparent movement, however with our speed it could have been moving slowly and not obvious to us. It was very puzzling since the area is very rural farming country and we were not near any cities or towns.  I thought at first it was a blimp, however a blimp would probably not be traveling within the clouds at nearly 4,000 feet since there was plenty of clear air below.  My next thought was that the object might be an Aerostat balloon the Customs Service uses along the Mexican border to spot incoming drug running aircraft, but this is not near the border and I believe those are typically tethered 10,000 feet above the ground.  The only other thought was a large balloon to provide a high antenna for a radio or TV signal, but here again it was out in the middle of nowhere and was not marked on the flight chart. Since we were trying to get to Oshkosh by 3:30 pm to in order to land prior a flight of over 100 incoming Beech Bonanzas, I did not deviate to investigate. I am very familiar with almost all aircraft and have seen the Goodyear blimp and other advertising blimps many times both from the ground and in the air and this did not appear to be one of those.  On every flight I have to watch for other aircraft and am used to spotting and identifying them as traffic, yet to this day I have no idea what it was my son and I saw.", "ufo fly bye a jetA craft intercepted a jet sometime after 7pm.i stepped outside and a white ball of light moved across the sky and past a jet heading the opposite direction.

The Big Dipper was in the eastern sky.  My husband was looking up and told me to look at the Big Dipper, that he could see something.  I observed four lights in a straight horizontal line, lights that looked like stars, because they seemed so high up in the sky.  The lites were moving towards the south, then they turned widely in an arc, then were heading west.  The lights were softly lit or &quot;dim&quot;, not  bright and stayed in a straight line the whole time I saw them.  They flew over our house heading west.  I couldn&apos;t see anything besides the lights, although the area around the lights seemed to be darker than the rest of the sky.

It slowly moved toward another tree. Both witness had blue light shining on them. They also lost conciousness for several minutes. When they regained conciousness, they were standing in different locations and positions. When the craft reached the other tree it tilted onto it&apos;s side and began to wobble. It appeared that the craft would tip over on top of the two witness, so they began running away. They then turned back to see the craft shoot away from the tree at a very high speed out over a feild and then dissappear. The craft was silent while hovering, but made a very distinct noise as it shot away. The following day, the witnesses returned to the sight. They discovered distinct and unusual markings on the ground and tree correlating to what they experienced.", "cigar shaped, white, green spot at rear, seemed to be gradually fallingI was in my car facing West, waiting for my sister to pull out of the driveway so that I could pull in. Out of nowhere something flew straight over my head. I watched it until it disappeared behind some trees. It seemed like it might have been gradually falling(landing?).It was cigar shaped (or as I described it, like a tampon)and it was glowing white like a star. It also had at the bottom a tiny green light. It was going somewhat fast, but not fast enough because it seemed like I watched it forever. It seemed as if it had been catapulted through the air sorta. I did not hear any noise. I knew there was no way it was a plane, and my first thought was that maybe it was a bomb. I literally sat there waiting to hear some time of explosion. When I realized that I was not in any immediate danger, I quickly ran up the driveway, shaking, to ask my sister if she had seen it. Of course, she had not. I began to think of what it possibly could have been, avoiding the assumption that it was an alien spacecraft. I thought maybe it was a meteor, but what I saw was definitely mechanical. I also know a friend that lived in my city when he was around six and remembers seeing balls of light dancing in the sky.", "Two craft seen over flagstaff. one craft had a lage ligh come on in the center . . .The dates above are a guestimate. It was some time ago when I saw this but thought I should document it as it was the most dramtic. I have had two other sigtings, one prior to this report and one afterward. My first sigting was in Scottsdale, AZ about Summer of 1982. I saw three red light that were in a triangular formation that spanned about the space of 3 to 4 football fields. It made no sound and was much lower than any aircraft would have flown. The odd thing is is that the three lights flew as if it was one craft. YOu could not focus on the space between the tiagular shaped lights. It flew off slowly over the Pima Indian reservation. My second sigting, the one mentioned in this report was near Flagstaff, Arizona while camping. Two craft came over a bluff moving very slow. They were oval shape (I am not sure if they were oval shape or circular as I saw them from an angle) with the perimeter out lined in singular lights. After moment when the craft came over the bluff then came military jets moving at much greater speed and passing the craft. The two ships did a semi-circle around our position and went back over the bluf again. As they started to go over the bluff in the center of one of the craft a warm colored light came on and the faded off as if it was like a dimmer switch. the light in the center was about a 1/3 the size of the craft itself. The strange thing about this is I don&apos;t remember falling a sleep that night and was awoken a couple of hours later by a third person who was meeting us at our camp site. I don&apos;t remember falling a sleep. The third time I saw somthing was the event over the Phoenix Valley a few years ago. I awoke out of a sleep and walked to the window and saw the lights over what looked like camelback mountain (I was in the east valley.) Why would I have awoken out of sleep to see this? Anyway, People think I am full of it when I tell them these stories but two out of three times I was with another person.", "Four slowly moving white round objects seen in sky over Watsonville, CA.My wife and I had just walked out of the grocery store on Green Valley road and Main St. in Watsonville, CA.  It was almost 6pm and the light was still good and the sky was clear.  As we were getting into the car, my wife looked up in the sky and said &quot;Wow, look at those 2 objects in the sky.&quot; I got out of the car and looked to where she was pointing.  There were three round, bright white colored objects (almost like they were refelcting the suns rays) moving very slowly towards the South to Southwest.  They appeared to be very high up, yet were distinct and easy to see.  We watched as they slowly lined up in a straight line, stopped and stayed in the same spot for about a minute, then they moved into a triangle position.  My first reaction was &quot;They&apos;re not planes or jets, if they are helicopters they are very high&quot;  Their appearance was totally spherical, not like any aircraft we had ever seen.  We watched for about 2-3 minutes, and they appeared to be at the same altitude as when we first saw them, so they didn&apos;t appear to be balloons or something like that.  They moved very slowly, almost like hovering, then stopped, then moved again into a triangle formation.  Then after about a minute in this position they spread out into a large V formation as a fourth object slowly approached from the north and joined the V, then stopped in place as the others were.  We stood there in the parking lot of the grocery store staring up at the sky in disbelief for 10 minutes.  The light was then slowly ebbing into twilight.  To confirm whether it was some kind of stellar phenomena, I looked to where Venus was in the sky and I couldn&apos;t see it, nor any other stars or planets.  I looked back and the objects were still in their V formation, now slowly moving south.  We got in our car and drove home attempting in vain to rationalize this to some kind of human created technology.", "a noiseless, rotating cluster of shiny metal-like objects seen floating at a slow steady pace over a chapel on my university campusI was sitting outside on some steps behind a chapel on my university campus when I noticed an object rising in the distance from the direction of the river and Route 18.  At first, because it had an irregular shape, I thought it was a plastic bag floating in the wind (there was a significant breeze).  As it got higher, I thought it might have been a kite.  As the object kept rising, it also kept moving closer to me at a slow but steady pace.  I watched it the entire time and by the time it was directly overhead, it was flying about twice as high as the church steeple.  It seemed to be a cluster of metal objects which were very shiny and appeared to have shapes like large flat letters (N? S?) It almost looked like a cluster of mixed metal chairs or picture frames.  The entire cluster, about 10 feet in diameter, was rotating in different directions as it kept moving south. By this point I thought it might be some kind of remote control object or part of some kind of air vehicle that had fallen off.  As it passed overhead it made no noise (that I could distinguish from the general din of air traffic from above).   I gathered up my books and by the time I rounded the church, it was very far in the distance beyond the library. I pointed it out to someone nearby who works at the library.  He had been sitting on the front steps of the church but had been looking down until I came around.  We watched it together for several minutes and could see that it continued to rise and move farther south, rotating all the while.  Maybe it was someone&apos;s science experiment?", "Triangle shaped object, no sound, no trail, glided over my townI was talking to my brother on the phone and I walked outside to my backyard. Immediately I saw a triangle shaped object flying slowly over our house.  It flew only as high as the tree tops.

It flew from the southeast to the northwest - over the city.  I live on the east side of the city.  I watched it as far as I could see it.

Once we looked back at the remaining three lights, the next top one moved a little to the right, flew straight up, then disapeared into the sky. After driving a little while longer, we were shocked to find a number of blinking lights surrounding the car. After a short amount of time, the objects disapeared, and we noticed we were being followed by a mysterious car.

At this time the sound was extremly loud and much louder than a B1 (Las Animas is located in  an MOA - Military Operations Area where B1s, fighter jets, B-52, F-117s train). I expected to see some type of airplane lights and strobes (B1 strobes are usually a brilliant very fast strobe), all I did see was a large oval white light, no stobes moving to the North. It appeared to be at a height of a commerical jet, 20,000 plus feet. After watching the light move off to the North, I went inside and called the Pueblo (80 miles west of Las Animas) Airport tower. They said that my area was out of their radar range and I needed to call Denver Central. I did call Denver and related to them the light/craft and sound. The gentleman I spoke to said he would check and see if there was any military traffic or any aircraft in my area at that time. After several minutes he came back on the phone and told me that it was not a B1 bomber or any military plane or commerical jet, but he did say that it was a classified aircraft on a classified mission and that is all he could say about the event!

I heard no noise (and I was close enough to hear it if it was a helicopter).", "huge cloaked triangle/rectangle shaped objectIt was around 2 a.m. when I woke up from a loud whirring noise, like a hum of a huge commercial airplane, but with a little hint of  a helicopter. It felt so close to the ground, that I felt the ground vibrating in my living room. I was kind of scared to look outside, but I did anyway, so I look out my living room window, and see just stars, but right as I was about to look away, I saw the stars moving!! I look back up, and I realize that there was a huge huge aircraft that seemed to be trying to cloak itself. at the beginning, it had a pointed shape, and the rest of it I really couldn&apos;t tell. It flew very very slowly over my house. It seemed to create a shadow over my neighborhood. So I went to the backyard to get a better look at it. If it weren&apos;t flying so slow, I wouldn&apos;t have been able to see the outline of the ship. all the stars that I saw, I think were the lights of the u.f.o.. Part of its cloaking device. I haven&apos;t talked about it now, because I didn&apos;t find anyone else who had seen the similar u.f.o. I thought maybe if I post this, someone else will come out and tell their story too.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The formation had changed somewhat and some of the objects were already gone by the time I got my camera.", "Hello Brian  I was watching the contrails in the sky as they were odd. The one I was watching had the appearance of a large plane contrail, two thick and twisting trails leading into thinner lines and disappearing. I looked in the binoculars to see what plane left this trail. At the head of the trail there was no plane body. There was instead 5 distinct shapes and their trails were merging into two. The &quot;body&quot; looked like a cloud hand in a fist. As it approached the ground the &quot;fingers&quot; were slightly opening. I saw a small ship, silver and reflecting the sun. It was about a centimeter long (in the binos) and it was circling the area where the trail ended. It was an eliptical plate in shape and the back end had a red marker on it. I don&apos;t know for sure if the mark was  chevron shaped. As the ship circled the area moving with speed I noticed it was doing rollovers and would dissapear and reapear in the sunlight. This sighting occured in the sw sky over the mountains and Okanagan Lake between Vernon and Kelowna. The ship I saw headed SE. The total time was approx. five minutes from watching the contrail descend to the ship leaving the area. Thank you to the witness for the report.

But I just read a report from Feb. about a guy on the 101 and 134 that seems similar to what I saw. Driving west on the 91 freeway at approx. the lakwood exit (before merging onto the 91, 57 merge) I was looking west (straight ahead) and the ridge line is to my left. I saw the usual aircraft lights above as well as to the right of me. Then out of nowhere I see 5 really bright white lights that appeared to maybe be in a swept back type formation allthough from the front, it was hard to tell. I was amazed because they were so bright and I have never seen 5 white lights on the front of an aircraft. The night sky was not cloudy as far as I could tell and most commercial aircraft that I have seen have one close to the fuselage on each side of the wing mount. The &quot;aircraft&quot; was rather low, based on the referrence of the ridge line to my left. It appeared to be moving slow as well. The &quot;aircraft&quot; made a slight bank to its right as I approached the merge to the 91,57 I looked to my extreme left now and could tell that the &quot;front&quot; was swept back, since it was night I could not make out the exact shape but could tell that there was a structure that was aft of the wings and there was a small &quot;beacon&quot; light underneath the structure to the rear. I could not see any marker lights on top where a verticle stab. would normally be on a commercial aircraft. I can only approximate its height at around maybe 2 or 3 thousand feet up (maybe less). I could not hear any noticeable engine noise (although I was on the freeway so it would have been hard to tell). And I am not aware of any flight pattern crossing over Santiago Canyon as a &quot;turn-around&quot; for John Wayne. If El Torro Marine Base was still active I might assume it could be a C17 although I dont know if they ever flew into there or not. The most striking thing overall is that it appeared suddenly, had 5 bright white lights on the front, appeared to fly very slow and was relativly low in altitude.And was not in an area where I typically have seen &quot;large&quot; aircraft be.", "unblinking bright light in night sky that appeared stationary then moved higher in sky then went out.I live at East Pennant, NS, on the shore of Pennant Cove about 15 miles south/southwest of Halifax. At 22:30, 13 Feb. 2004, I was in bed preparing for sleep when my wife, beside me, said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a bright light in the sky.&rdquo; She was looking through our bedroom window out to sea to the southwest. I raised myself on one elbow and looking out, saw a reddish-yellow, unblinking light that appeared stationary in the sky at an elevation of about 30 degrees. Looking much like a streetlight at perhaps a mile or more distance, it was too big and much too bright to be a star though in colour and size we could have been persuaded that it was Mars at its brightest. We continued to watch it and when it appeared to move in a retrograde, west to east direction then move higher in the sky, we decided to view it through binoculars. These had just been found and before I could train them on the light, the light suddenly went out. Through the binoculars, where the object had just been, the sky was clear and the stars, which were bright that night, could be seen.", "Huge red fireball hits in NC county, locals assume it to be a small plane crash--- no small plane foundThis was like a huge red fireball that the locals in Davidson County thought to be a crash in progress of a small plane.

No evidence of a crashed plane was discovered, yet certain witness swear they saw the event.

We then saw a bright light flash on the horizon as if it was signaling the light up north towards Cape Coral and Sanibel Island. The light farther north glowed bright enough to see a reflection in the water and then all of the sudden it slowly split into three glowing objects. One went right  and one went left leaving the original duller but in the same place. The light on the right went faster and eventually behind trees out of sight. The one on the left stopped and went back to the original light and made it glow. At that moment the one on the horizon blinked again. While the north light disappeared leaving a dark spot in the sky. After about 4 or 5 minutes we thought it was gone when right in front of our eyes the Light on the horizon blinked again  and the light to the north reappeared. It glowed so bright this time that we compared it to the ALMOST full moon because the reflection on the water. The light then  split into three objects again and formed a triangle ( the light to the north) that moved across the sky slowly then darted out of sight the right which would be east. At that point we left the beach and told my friend&rsquo;s parents about it and went to bed to leave early in the morning. When we came home we told another friend who told us to look it up on the internet and then  we found http://www.spacepub.com/users/data/sightings/flo/flo.htm. which had a reference to your sight. The date today is Monday March 29.", "Scintillating orange sphere; exhibits near-instantaneous acceleration from stationaryRecently I&apos;ve noticed many reports of orange balls of light in the sky on this website.  Thought I would post my sighting from 1977 to notify that these orange balls have been around awhile!  If they are man-made probes or drones; we had them in 1977!  The date given above is approximate; it occurred sometime in March or April, 1977.Story below... &quot;doc&quot; ((name deleted)) and I were night skiing Stevens Pass ski resort (Cascade mountains, Washington State) in the spring of our senior year of high school (that&apos;s how I&apos;m certain the year was 1977).  We were skiing down &quot;Red chair&quot; at about 8:30 pm, when I noticed an orange light in the sky, while skiing.  &quot;Huh&quot;, I thought to myself, &quot;a firefly&quot;.  Although it felt wierd that a firefly would be up in the mountains while they were still snow-blanketed.  I had never seen a live firefly; only pictures in books, but my mind automatically labeled it a firefly.  I slowed to a stop over about 30 seconds, keeping an eye on the &quot;firefly&quot;.  As I was slowing to a stop, the light increased in apparent size from about star size to about half to 3/4 the size of a full moon.  The light was brilliant orange; scintillating light around it; the overall shape was circular but with ragged, jagged edges of this brilliant orange light.  After I came to a stop, I watched it, mesmerized, for about 30 seconds to 1 minute.  During this time, it&apos;s size and appearance did not change and it remained perfectly stationary at about 30 degrees above the horizon--I know that it remained stationary; because it remained just above and to the side of a mountain peak (behind &quot;Big Chief&quot; chair lift, to the direction of the eastern side of the ski area) that served as a reference point for me.  During this period, my friend &quot;doc&quot; ((name deleted)) skiied up and stopped beside me; I glanced over and saw his eyes glued to this wierd orange light.  As we both stood still watching,suddenly the object instantaneously darted across the sky--it went from being absolutely stationary beside the mountain peak; to traversing (in a time period of about 3 seconds) about 150 degrees of the horizon--from our vantage point; it traveled starting from the east and briefly disappeared toward the south behind a mountain peak; quickly reappearing on the opposite side of this mountain moving toward the south and continuing toward the southwest; when it finally disappeared from view behind another mountain to the southwest.  During this traverse, it was losing altitude; the angle of descent appeared about 5-10 degrees below horizontal, from our vantage point--before it finally disappeared, it was actually below us in elevation (down a valley) at about a 5-10 degree angle.  During it&apos;s transit, the object travelled almost too quickly for our heads and eyes to be able to follow; during its transit it remained brilliant orange and about the same apparent size; but appeared to have a short orange &quot;tail&quot; behind it--hard to say if this &quot;tail&quot; was an optical illusion; due to it&apos;s tremendous angular velocity from our vantage point.  Also, I seem to recall a faint hissing sound starting just as it disappeared from sight, and continuing for several seconds after it had disappeared from sight.  But no sonic boom or other sound.  I then looked at my friend, whose mouth was wide open &quot;did you see that?&quot; he said.  &quot;What the hell was that&quot; I replied.  We just looked at each other, then skiied down to the bottom of the run to get on the chairlift to ski some more.  I asked the lift attendant if he had seen anything in the sky, he said no (however, helping people on the chairlift he was facing the opposite direction of the object; and there were bright nite ski lights in the direction between him and the object).  My friend &quot;doc&quot; ((name deleted)) and I compared notes on what we saw; our descriptions matched. What was and still is most baffling to me was the instantaneous change in the object from being perfectly stationary (for 30-60 seconds) to moving at an extremely rapid velocity--given the first mountain it moved behind (and reappeared) was about 1.5 miles distant,and that it traversed about 150 degrees of horizon within a few seconds, it must have been moved at least 3 miles within a few seconds, corresponding to over 3600 miles per hour!  And it appeared to attain that velocity instantaneously; certainly within the half-second or less which it would take our minds to register the change from stationary to moving condition (I was a very good ping-pong player and fair badminton and tennis player,so my mind has been accustomed to very quickly registering rapid changes in speed and direction in ball-shaped objects)!  This huge acceleration rules out any manned aircraft; g-forces would tear any human apart.  Perhaps now in 2004 we have unmanned probes or drones that can perform extreme accelerations (like antiaircraft missiles); but I don&apos;t think this was possible in 1977.  A meteor is ruled out; because it was stationary in size and location near a mountain peak for 30-60 seconds; and the apparent acceleration was instantaneous, not gradual (as could happen due to parallax effects).  I think any man-made vehicle, or known natural phenomena can be ruled out.  A missile might be able to accelerate like that; however I think with only a ground-based boost system (not a mid-air launch).  This leaves unknown natural phenomena (e.g. some type of atmospheric plasma ball?) or....any ideas? P.S.  There may or may not have been a solid object behind this light--we did not observed any solid object; however the light was so brilliant that it would have obscured any otherwise nonluminescent object that it emanated from.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The lights were quite far off so we didn&apos;t think they were unusual at first, maybe planes. At first two appeared to be flying towards each other, then they avoided each other. One went high and one went low. The first light continued west while the other one stopped and just hung there. A third one appeared above the light that was moving, sort of flickered a little and then went dark. The two remaining lights stayed still after that for about 10 minutes. We drove through Nanton and were still able to see the lights though they seemed much closer now. I pulled over to the shoulder of the road and got my video camera out and and was standing on the side of the road waiting to see if the lights would move again. The third light reappeared and it was much, much closer now. I was able to film a about 15-20 seconds of it.

Number of witnesses: 5-6 Number of objects: 6-7 Shape of objects: Disc shaped Full Description of event/sighting: I was about 4 years old, were at our cabin in the Adirondacks and several neighbours were visiting us as we just arrived for our summer vacation. As I was young I was put to bed earlier but was listening to the adults talking in the living room. We had no electricity or running water so when I wanted to go to the toilet which was an outhouse in the corner of the shed my father escorted me to the shed and went back inside the cabin door to get away from the mosquitoes where he could still see the shed. While in the outhouse every minute or so I could hear a whirring from far away getting nearer then going away. When I ran back inside the cabin and told my father he said it was probably just an owl or other creature. A few minutes later all the adults were outside the back door as someone had gone to the outhouse and saw this disc shaped object which seemed to be slightly lit up and making a whirring sound coming into view from the south, passing almost overhead and disappearing around Mount Baker.I sneaked out and actually saw one ( one passed every minute or so) before I got caught and was sent back in. We had an old battery radio (tube) and when listening to the local news the next day we heard several reports of the same sighting from the village.

I looked out my window and noticed that it was way too bright. All of a sudden it started moving, and looked kind of like a plane. It had at least 3 flashing white lights, and a green/blue light at the back. It also had a dim beam in the back.  I watched with binoculars as it moved slower than a plane going up and down, kind of floating.  I didn&apos;t hear any noise, but the beam in the back was very strange.

It was quite low as all the aircraft seem to be since 9/11 and it reared off to the right and then to the left and a few very short seconds later this object followed as if it had been behind the plane, but it reared off to the right and stopped for a very brief second and followed that path. The object moved across the sky in an elegant fashion and without sound and for a very brief second I noticed white vapour coming from the back. The object appeared to have no shape, it looked the shape of a star and it was a silvery gold colour. I watched the object till it was out of sight and it seemed to glide actoss the sky as if it had a purpose. It was the most awesome sight I have ever seen and I&apos;ve never forgotten it and I remember the detail because I wrote every detail of the experience in my journal.

I told him I was it, ( the one looking after HBCC UFO). He started to tell me about a strange sighting he had back in 1998 when hauling logs out of the Morice Lake area which is approximately 80 kilometers southwest from Houston, B.C. I asked him if he could call me when the man found a little time. He did indeed call a couple of days later and told me what he saw that early winter morning. The witness was driving along the Morice West Road and just came over the top of a hill. Looking straight ahead of him he saw what he described as aircraft landing lights which were sitting on the ground. The lights were extremely bright and white. There was no flashing nor did the light move. Whatever it was, it was not moving. He also said there was no one logging in that area at that time. He also told me that a road which did lead into the area was blocked by a huge bank of snow and the road itself was covered with approximately four feet of snow. The driver said he was really curious to know what he&apos;d seen. The logger would have liked to have stopped but seeing the roads were icy and extremely slippery, a 70 ton load, plus other logging trucks coming behind him a kilometer away he thought it best to just keep going. The witness got on his radio and asked the drivers behind him if anyone was doing any forestry work where he saw the light. Everyone called back telling him there was nothing in the area. (It would be doubtful that it would have been a helicopter at that time of the morning). Also I asked if it could have been a snowmobile and he told me no. There were no signs of anyone going in along the snow covered road and that was the only access to the area where the light was. He told me all areas around where the light was sitting was dense forest. As some of the truck operators drove up over the hill they too were able to see the light and found it very unusual.

It was dark in colour, but looked distinctly different to any metal i have ever seen before, dark in colour. It appeared to have no jet or any kind of propulsion, but had strange lights down the side, evenly spaced along the sides. These were red and blue in colour. It appeared to be a USO. There was some kind of disturbance around its frame that looked as though the air around it was rippling a bit, like it was bending slightly or something. I reached for my mobile phone but none of the buttons or screen appeared to be working. It works now though, which seems strange. Then it shot off releasing what can only be described as a blast of hot air that blew us both to the ground, leaving my friend with minor bruises to his left side.

PD))", "Star-like object meandering in sky6:40pm Central time. While outside talking on the cell phone with my mother, I looked up at the moon, which was directly overhead, and saw a star-like object in the southern sky move westward toward the moon. It looked just like an average star, except it was moving. The object did not blink, was white in color and appeared to be very high in the atmosphere. It did not leave a trail and was moving approximately the same speed as a satellite. The object passed under the moon and was obscured by clouds moving in from the south. The sky was mostly cloudy at the time with a few breaks in between to where the moon and stars were clearly visible. When I saw the object, I pointed in the direction I was looking (south) and said to my boyfriend and mother (on the phone), &quot;Look at that star moving up there, by the moon!&quot; I viewed the object for 3 or 4 seconds before I lost sight of it behind the clouds. I looked at the time on the cell phone and noticed it to be 6:40pm. My boyfriend did not see the object, but continued to look at the sky. My mother, who lives on the North shore of the Lake Pontchartrain (I live on the South shore), did not see the object as she was inside at the time. I then told my mother I would call her back and continued watching for the object, but did not spot it again. We decided to stay outside a little longer and I continued to watch the sky, which was still mostly cloudy with fewer breaks in between the visible areas. 7:40pm - Spotted what appeared to be the same object again in the Southeastern part of the sky, which was clear at the time. I pointed it out to my boyfriend and said, &quot;There it is again!&quot; We both watched the object move erratically northward, then ENE until it passed out of our view of the horizon. Looked at the clock on the cell phone and it was exactly one hour later than the first sighting. Duration of second sighting was 10 to 12 seconds. When I spotted the object the second time (my boyfriend did not see this part), it moved quickly in a very erratic motion then moved northward at a steady rate, where my boyfriend was also able to pick it up. The general movement of the star-like object reminded me of an insect in flight (specifically a dragonfly), where the dragonfly would hover over a potential landing site, i.e.: stick or twig, examine the site a bit but not landing (or as if it was performing evasive maneuvers from another insect) and then flying off to find a better spot, not in a straight line but meandering. I then called my mother again and told her what I saw. I said the object was heading in her general direction and she should go outside and see if she could spot it. I told her it was pretty cloudy on the South shore of the lake, but the North shore seemed to be in a clearing, as she did not see any clouds, nor did she see the object. Another factor that my be relevant, but was not noticed at 6:40pm, possibly due to the cloud cover, is there was a strange halo around the moon (one quarter full) that I had never seen before.  The halo was approximately 6 1/2 to 7 feet in diameter from my perspective with the moon being 1/2 inch in diameter. I have see halos around the moon many times before, but they were always close to the moon, never this far away! My father said the halo was probably due to ice crystals in the atmosphere reflecting the light of the moon. The color of the halo was the same color as the moon and a perfect circle. I watched as clouds covered the area of the sky that the moon was located and the halo was also covered. I could only see it when there was a break in the clouds. The object, when spotted the second time, was within this halo on the Eastern side (moon was now in SW sky). I watched the object pass out of the halo and continue on as described above. We went inside at this point since there were just too many clouds. I went back outside at 8:40pm and the halo was still around the moon, but I could only get glimpses of it through the clouds. The sky was almost completely covered in clouds at this point. I did not spot the object again. I then went back inside and received a call from my mother. She stated that she could also see the halo around the moon, but it appeared to be purplish in color to her. She also saw 2 beams of iridescent light shining down in her general direction on the North shore of the lake, between 8:00pm and 8:40pm, she&apos;s not sure of the time as she was going in and out of the house. She described the lights as being an upside-down v, with the moon being the starting point. The lights appeared to be &quot;bubbling inside&quot; with iridescence, as stated by my mother. She thought the lights might be a trick of the eye or a reflection off of her glasses. She could not tell if the beams of light were touching the ground from her vantage point. My mother said she began to feel uneasy at this point and went back inside. I went back outside to see if I could see this as well, but the moon was not visible. My mother calls back at 8:50pm and says, &quot;I&apos;m not going out there anymore! I saw the beams of light again.&quot; She went on to describe the lights as stated above, but felt like one of the beams was shining directly at her. She got scared and went back inside. I haven&apos;t heard from her this morning, but I assume since she didn&apos;t call me back, she didn&apos;t observe anything else unusual.", "huge blue shooting starI had just arrived in NY from Paris.I was on avenue of the americas, and near greenwich village.I was looking at my left, and  in the perspective of a perpendicular street at my left, i saw a HUGE blue light, as if it was a shooting star but maybe 100 times bigger. And it went down as quickly as a shooting star and disappeared at about  2 o&apos;clock (i don&apos;t know if that mesure exist in english).It was super big and super fast.After that, i looked carefully at the planes to check with their size but their is nothing in common between them.This object was either very close which seems impossible, or huge.Even if close, i would still say it was a supersize light.((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE FROM WITNESS))Hello Peter, i&apos;m very glad you answered my report.I have waited two weeks back in Paris, since i came back from New York, and then i remembered i had to check on a UFO site if something was reported that day , the 14th of feb, because i expected a lot of people to have seen it.And what was my surprise when i saw the other reports on your site!Reassuring in a way...(your site is very well done in terms of ergonomy by the way)So, for more info, i thought i would be better if I send you the global aspect of this &quot;light&quot; as a drawing on one of my pictures taken back then.

It didn&apos;t seem to burn , though, and the speed of it wasreally astonishing.I cannot say which was the direction,but i remember I was looking at the left, and going down manhattan.  I was walking with a friend, she didn&apos;t see it.But immediately i thought this had nothing in common with anything i&apos;ve seen in the sky so far.

I was staring at the Big Dipper because it looked so close, when I noticed four very muted lights fly through the dipper part.  It flew south till it got midway through the  tail and turned west kind of erractic, like it over compensated, then corrected itself.  The time was probably 10 to 15 seconds we could see the lights before it flew over our house where we lost sight of it.  We&apos;ve seen lots of planes when we&apos;ve been outside looking at the sky at night and this was not the normal actions or flight path of any plane we&apos;ve ever seen. The sky was very bright and there wasn&apos;t any clouds in the sky. The lights were the size of stars, so I assumed this was very high up in the sky.  If you weren&apos;t looking at some star constellation very closely, you wouldn&apos;t see this.  It was almost stealthy-looking. We never saw any shape around the lights. The lights were moving too fast to be a normal plane. We&apos;ve seen military planes very high up in the sky with their vapor trails, and satelites fly over,but this wasn&apos;t any thing like that.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness via telephone, and he sounded quite credible and sincere to us.

At first my friend and I thought it was a commercial jet, but as it got closer to us we noticed it have 3 bright lights. We then realized it was not a commercial jet because by the speed and altitude it traveled at, it was impossible that a plane of that size could be flying that low. At a point it almost appeared as if it was going to land on the freeway. As we began to pass it on the freeway it hovered above us, and we were able to see a clear view of the object. It had three bright lights and had a triangular shape with a non reflective black surface. We then tried to follow it by getting off the freeway and chasing it down the surface streets, but as we got closer it just dissapeared in the night.

It was about 30 minuets to dawn yet so I could still make out some of the stars. As I was admiring the morning sky I noticed what I thought to be a star in a unusual area of the sky at that time of morning and noted its unusual color which was an orange pinkish hue.Then I seen It start to slowly move in a northerly direction and thought I was seeing a high flying aircraft as my place of employment is about 15 kilometers from Pearson Int. Airport and we have commercial aircraft fly directly over our building at any given moment of the day. Usually the planes at that time in the morning come in from the west and then bank  south to the runways. What I saw next was amazing. The object I seen quickly started to accelerate north where it met with another similar object which seemed to appear out of nowhere and they both banked hard and fast to the west accelerating and decelerating like they were playing with one another and while this was going on they seemed to wobble and shimmer. I thought I may be imagining things but I wasn&apos;t. They were flying at approximately 7 to 10,000 feet and accelerated more than the speed of a visible satellite seen on a clear night.

My husband said &quot;Look at that!&quot; and by the tone in his voice I  realized that it wasn&apos;t Venus that he was pointing at.  We both saw 2 faint &quot;pinkish&quot; lights traveling at a high rate of speed, one trailing outside and slightly behind the other.  They started to fly closer to each other, appearing to almost collide.  Their speed dropped very suddenly, they appeared to correct their positions, abruptly changed direction to the northwest and faded out of sight. It appeared that we were viewing two flat, &quot;teardrop&quot; shaped, lighted objects.  There were no blinking lights, no noise and all changes of speed and direction were unlike any aircraft we have ever seen.", "Formation of three white pinpoints slowly crossing the night sky at very high altitude.We are used to seeing satellites and the ISS cross the night sky here, as we live in a fairly rural area with little light pollution. What we saw were the same kind of steady pinpoint white light, similar to a faint star, that a satellite appears as. The very odd thing was that there were a fixed formation of three lights, that traversed the sky almost directly overhead from wnw to ese over a period of about 5-10 minutes. The lights formed the shape of an isosceles triangle, or Grekk letter Delta rotated anti-clockwise by 45 degrees. I would estimate that the lights that were furthest apart from each other (which were in &quot;line astern&quot; formation) subtended an angle of around 5 degrees from where I saw them. I&apos;ve checked with the database of satellite tracks at www.heavens-above.com, and none match the track and timings of the lights we saw for our latitude and longtitude. I don&apos;t think these were aircraft. There was no noise, and no other navigation lights were seen. These were not shooting stars. the lights were steady, and moved far too slowly and were visible for too long. My opinion is that these objects were outside the earth&apos;s atmosphere. They appeared exaclty as satellites do in terms of speed and appearance, but the unique issue was that the lights were multiple and held exactly the same relative position throughout the sighting. I am a qualified private pilot, and spent nine years with the British Army. I would consider myself to be very level headed. I fully expected to discover a rational explanation for these lights. It could be that these were an array of three satellites which may not appear on publicly available listings. I&apos;m happy to provide further details by email if you have any specific questions. I&apos;m also happy to provide an electronic image of my impression of the object(s).((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))Hi Peter,I&apos;ve just discussed this with my wife, and we agree that the total time of the sighting was 4-5 minutes. And this was not a horizon to horizon sighting. I first spotted the lights as they were just east of Polaris, and we both lost sight of them as they were about 45-60 degrees above the horizon slightly North of due East.I was outside in our garden having a cigarette, and as I often see satellites during my nicotine fixes(!), I was idly scanning the night sky.  This was at 20:01 GMT (I&apos;d just finished watching a TV show that ended at 21:00). When I saw the lights, it took me a minute or so to grasp the unusual significance, and then I dashed indoors to get my wife to come out and see them too. She followed me out, and we spent a good couple of minutes watching them before they slowly faded from view (I assume because of the particulates in the air and the reducing angle to the horizon).Thanks for the heads up on NOSS - checking the www.heavens-above.com database indicates that NOSS 2 or NOSS 2-1 are likely suspects, as the ground track and timings fits very well.Thanks for helping to solve the mystery.Regards from across the pond,  ((name deleted))((END))((NUFORC Note:  We have corresponded with the witness, and we suspect that he is an exceptional witness.

When I looked to the east, I saw this triangular-shaped silvery object.  At first I thought it was just a high-flying kite, but it was moving.  I then saw a very distinct circular light on the bottom of it.  (Also in the sky overhead were several commercial airliners and what looked like a pair of fighter jets; they appeared to be plodding through the sky, compared to the triangle.)  The triangle moved in an arc, but faster than anything I have ever seen before.  Also, it would hover in one spot for many seconds, then move on.  My daughter saw the same thing.  She went to get our telescope.  When I tried to get a better look, it just disappeared.  It also had no contrail.  I don&apos;t believe in UFO&apos;s, but I think I saw my first one.

The whole event took less than 10 seconds.  I continued to watch them fly overhead, and just as they did, the line broke formation and formed a triangle with one sphere in the middle.  I noticed as they moved they sort of fluttered, not much though, as if they were being knocked by slight currents in the air.  They appeared small to me, and I probably wouldn&apos;t have noticed them had there not been so many of them.  I will admit that I have never believed in these sorts of things.

Video footage taken of the event. Witnesses Email Report below... On June 13, 2002 I video-taped a round dark object in the sky, my kids had noticed as we sat in our hot tub just after 9:00 p.m. The object sat motionless until I started filming. Then it darted in and out of clouds, also back and forth as I tried to follow it. This was a very scary experience for my kids. I live in Hayward, Ca. and noticed on your website another sighting in the area. I&apos;ve never witnessed anything of this shape or speed in my life. I just want to get a professional opinion from someone else. Any ideas?  Telephone follow up below:  I had a pleasant conversation with the witness on the telephone. He described in detail what he and two other family members has witnessed on June 13, 2002. The man said it was something he had never saw before and was stunned at what they were observing. The fellow explained that on the night of the sighting he and the family were spending an evening in the hot tub and his daughter was playing a game , who could spot the most airplanes flying over head. The gentleman said that it is an active area due to two airports which are fairly close by. The Oakland and the Hayward airports. It was the daughter who first spotted the object and said &quot;there is a plane&quot;. The man&apos;s son looked and said he didn&apos;t believe it was a plane. The son asked his father to look at the object in the night sky. When he looked up to see what the kids were looking at he saw a black spot which was just sitting stationary in the sky just below the cloud cover. They all could see the clouds moving but the dark object stayed in the same spot, not moving. They all wondered what could this be as it certainly looked unusual and it sat in the one position for approximately one minute and again it was not moving. Some quick thinking on the Dad&apos;s part ... had him running into their home and grabbing a video camera which was sitting on the kitchen table. He ran back outside with it. He had borrowed it from a close friend a couple of days prior to this sighting to take some footage of everyday things. Also not being really familiar with the camera he was trying his best to catch what he could of the object. As he lined the camera up on the object, it started to move very quickly. It would duck into the cloud cover then pop back out. It continued doing this a couple of times but always remaining in the original area, not moving any distance from where they first noticed it. It was night and I wondered how they were able to see a dark object against a blackened sky. The witness said, even though it was dark out you were able to see a whiteness of the clouds and the dark object which sat below them. So it was the lightened backdrop which enabled the family to see the darkened craft. At one point the object moved into a darker cloud and as everyone watched it .... the cloud started swirling around and seemed to pull more of the surrounding cloud into the swirling motion. As it was doing this the cloud was growing darker. Again the object poked out from the cloud just slightly and moved back in again and this is when they all witnessed a strobing light coming from inside the cloud cover with the cloud starting to move closer in the direction of the family until it stopped and pretty much straight away moved back to it&apos;s original place. The total length of this sighting was approximately 2 to 3 minutes. The fellow said all the time they spent outside that evening they had not seen any other aircraft in the area. The man called the Hayward airport to make an enquiry about what they saw. The folks at the airport told him there were no flights going out that night. The witness felt that was rather unusual in itself. He thought maybe because the weather conditions were not that good and socked in very badly, that this may be the reason why no flights left that evening. A still picture was made and blown up from the footage at one of the local universities. The Astronomy Department of the University and others checked the photograph out and saw that there was an object in the photo but no one could figure out what it was. So again the witness was left with no answers to this puzzling sighting. The fellow told me after the sighting was over, they all went into the house as it certainly was a bit frightening to see such a strange sight. He told me he just paced around the home and wasn&apos;t at all sure what he was going to tell everyone about what they had seen and videotaped that night.

Due to his occupation the gentleman had to travel back and forth at that time between towns. They were working on contracts at two different jobs. One late night, around midnight they were on their way back to Houston from Burns Lake, B.C. and were about 5 kilometers east of Houston. There is a long straight stretch before you climb a small long hill on Highway #16 which takes you right into the town of Houston. While traveling on this straight part of the Highway the witnesses passed the local golf course, looking straight in front of them and a little to their right, sits Mount Harry Davis. On top of the mountain there sits the VOR (Visual Omni Range), at this point on the drive both men watched a large bright, white object rise from the VOR vertically into the air. They wondered if it might have been a helicopter with one bright light on it, but they soon ruled this out due to what the object did next. When the light/object reached a certain point in the night sky, it split into two balls of light and each ball of light &quot;shot&quot; off at an incredible rate of speed in different direction. The witnesses were so surprised that they stopped their truck in the middle of the highway, flew open their doors and stood watching this event unfold. Both men started looking at one another wondering what it was they just witnessed as it was so very unusual. They were so curious to know what was up at the top of the mountain, plus they wanted to look around for any sign that something may have been there, that shouldn&apos;t have been, they drove up the winding road on Mount Harry Davis and finally reached the VOR on top of the mountain. Nothing unusual was noted around the area, but they sure were baffled at what they saw the night before. Thank you to the witness for the report.

I could see JPL (Jet Propulsion Labs) on the north side, and to the east 20 + miles, and to the south east I could see Catalina Island. A very clear day. I noticed a few helicopters during the time I was on the conference call. We have a lot in the area, police mainly. I also observed a few birds (hawks and crows) flying nearby. At approximately 12:35 I was seated looking out the window facing Mt. Wilson and slighly to the East of it. I noticed an object I took for a helicoptor come into my line of vision from the mountains. It was moving towards me. I kept thinking it would soon become larger and I would see the roters spinning above. It did not get larger. As I kept watching it, it moved up just under the clouds and began to slow. It was still to small to get a good description other than it appeared an ovid type shape. I could see no appendages. Twice it was caught by sunlight and the color changed to a reddish metalic color. The object continued to move just underneath the clouds and stopped just south of the building I was in, directly above Colorado Blvd. It continued to remain stationary for a few minutes. At that time, the conference call ended and I moved to end the call. When I looked out the window again, the object could no longer be seen. I also noticed before I lost sight of it, that during the time it hovered over downtown Pasadena, a small private plane flew under it by a few hundred feet. At arms distance the object would be about 1/4 the size of the nail on my little finger. I would be interested to know if this is some sort of weather collection object. I am not saying it&apos;s alien, but I don&apos;t know what it was. Due to the closeness of JPL and indeed, the Skunk Works (just the other side of the mountains) who knows.((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))Dear Peter,Yes certainly feel free to use my report. I would love to know if these egg shaped objects are omething that is not mysterious if we only knew they were around (i.e., the weather gathering devices). Obviously if they are related to military then we won&apos;t be told.I keep trying to look in the sky when I get the chance. I must start carrying a camera.I look forward to your next guest spot on Coast to Coast.Regards,  ((name deleted))((END))", "Spherical, shiny object hovering over wooded area near Yadkin County, N.C.We were traveling home from Winston-Salem N.C. to Hamptonville N.C. from a doctor&apos;s appointment when my wife and 8 year old daughter saw a strange spherical, silvery object in the sky; as I was driving the vehicle, I was not able to see the object from my perspective, but did observe that the sky seemed most clear and did not see aircraft visible during their siting. The description of the object is theirs: the object produced no vapor trail or other visible changing characteristic, and seemed almost stationary in the sky, but was shiny, and reflected the sunlight at times very strongly. The view of the object persisted for about 5 minutes during the drive until the object was obscured by low, tree lined hills. When our vehicle entered another area on the same highway, no object or aircraft was visible. Our direction on the highway, would have probably been toward the West or Northwest, as I could see the sun out my driver window, but not in my front window; the object would have been hovering or moving over a wooded area with only secondary roads, between any large towns or cities. I saw no sundogs or persistant natural aerial phenomena to explain this siting. I questioned my wife at length about an aircraft, but she was insistant that was she saw was spherical and not a conventional craft. My daughter,who was sitting behind my wife in our vehicle at the time, saw the same object and described the same shape. I have no reason to believe either of them would lie to me about the event, and nothing in our conversations on the drive home were even remotely concerned with unknown aeriel objects. Again, the object was sited from Highway 421(a four lane highway), near Yadkin County, North Carolina between 4 and 4:30 p.m. on 2/13/2004.", "Object with blueish tail impacts NW of Lewistown MontanaA Green, blue and orange surrounded by haze object about the size of a small car with a blueish tail streaked across the the sky and seemed to impact approximately 10 to 15 miles northwest of Lewistown Montana.

I looked out the passenger side window on my right and saw two rows of 6 very large and bright lights, each the exact distance from the other. The row on the left was higher up than the one on the right.  They appeared to be several football fields long and very close to us. The lights were a pale yellow and cast no light, but only glowed.  My brother, who was beside me in the front passenger seat, was lightly dozing.  I screamed for him to wake up and look out the window.  We were both amazed at the sight and kept saying, &quot;Oh, my God, what the hell are they.&quot;  The lights on the top row on the left side suddenly went out, one after the other, in rapid succession, starting with the light closest to us.  The lower row on the right followed immediately after in the same manner.  The entire viewing lasted less than 3 minutes.  The first thing my brother said was, &quot;You know we can&apos;t ever tell anyone about this because they&apos;ll never believe it.&quot; We are both middle aged Grandparents and neither drink or do drugs.  We also aren&apos;t prone to exaggeration, and my brother has always been a pure skeptic, though I have never doubted their existence.I have read about about, and seen many, many, pictures of UFO&apos;s but, have never seen pictures of anything quite like these two. Three or four months later in broad day light we were driving north somewhere between Los angles, and Monterey, CA and watched one doing bizarre movements above the mountain tops ahead of us on the west side of the highway.  It flew straight up and would disappear, and then suddenly reappear several miles to the left just above a different set of mountain tops.  Then it would fly from right to left, and left to right horizontally.  It did a number of these seemingly impossible movements for about 20 minutes before it disappeared for good. We kept wondering if any of the other travelers were seeing what we did.  It was almost as if they were saying to us, &quot;See, we are real and you didn&apos;t imagine what you saw the other time.&quot;((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The film shows the object spinning at very high speed and maintaing a round shape.

It was unusually large, and sufficiently bright to be seen over the street lights of our small town. It appeared to fragment as it approached my horizon (about 30 degrees elevation)and then was extinguished. Except for its substantial size and brightness and fragmenting, it looked like a meteor.

So we were both looking up when an oval, silver disk flew across the sky from east to west and stopped almost directly overhead.  It did not make any sound.  It remained stationary for around 30 seconds.  The day was bright and sunny and there was only one little cumulus cloud in the sky.  My brother and I stopped playing catch and remarked to each other about the object.  We couldn&apos;t believe it stopped in midair.  It was about the height that small planes normally fly at-(pretty low).  It was the size of a medium sized aircraft.  After about 30 seconds it suddenly shot north at a high rate of speed.-(perpendicular to its former direction). We ran into the house and I called The Cleveland Press newspaper to report it.  The person who answered the phone said that so far no one else had reported seeing that object.The strange thing is that a couple weeks later that same summer I saw another strange object in the sky.  This time however it was a more conventional type aircraft.It was a regular sized jet aircraft that did not have a body. (A flying wing) One of the wings was on fire.  It looked like it was going to crash. I also reported this object to the Cleveland newspaper.  The next day in the paper they reported that an experimental air-force jet had crash landed.Based on the fact that both of these clying objects were seen so close together that summer, I have always considered that the first object was also some kind of experimental craft.  However, the first one did fit the sterotype image of a UFO.Incidentally, my brother &amp; I never talked about the object until a few years ago at a formal dinner.  He asked me if I remembered that UFO-type strange object that we saw together when we were teenagers.  How could I forget?  We just never told anyone.ps - I had to put a date on the sighting but to be honest I really don&apos;t remember.I know it was in the middle of a bright summer day when I was a teenager. (13-15 yrs old).  But that&apos;s about it.  I could ask my brother if he remembers.  Also I thought we could look up records of experimaental aircraft crash landing.  It was the same summer.  By the way there were no other aircraft in the vincinity at the time.My brother&apos;s name is ((name deleted)).  He is a professor at ((name deleted)) University.

My mother was watching my younger brothers 3 and 2 in the house. We lived Route 30 West about 6 miles outside of Gettysburg, near Belmont Rd. Often I was let out of the house to play in this foot-high weedy grass field and I played alone.I could see the house but I was 25&apos; away from the house. I remember sitting in the grass then something picked me up by my arm and dragged me thru the grass. This being was in a solid shiny material and I believe it was charcoal grey. This being had no feelings for my being dragged over the ground. It flew across the ground. I saw a cigar shaped metallic grey craft positioned on the ground below the hill. The field has a slope and this meant the craft would not be seen from Belmont or Rte 30 West. I was terrified. A being in a buff colored tight outfit came up from the center of the craft, as up a ladder, to meet us. I was hauled inside where they put me on a table. I remember struggling to get away and being so afraid. Painful probes were put inside my nose and mouth. Weeks later I had pain in my lower abdomen and would experience pain every time I breathed. I remember thinking that they were communicating without talking which I now know is telepathically.  They had no feelings, ice-cold machinelike qualities which terrified me. I didn&apos;t remember ears or hair like we have and I think with hypnosis I might be able to recall more about them. I couldn&apos;t sleep well for weeks. In Sunday school I remembered that angels flew and I thought I was being hurt by angels. I couldn&apos;t tell my parents because I had not the language to describe this and I was terrified to relive this experience.  Also, I played an angel in my grandmother&apos;s church for a Christmas play and decided that I could never burst my parents&apos; belief about angels being bad.  I remember thinking that I was going to die as they worked on me with metal and tubes and painful implements. At one point I think I went into shock. When I came to, at one point, I was levitated in the air about 5&apos; off a table. There were these beings sitting around the table looking up at me.  I think they were examining my genitals and reproductive organs. During the time I entered the craft I could not speak. It was if I was paralyzed. Later I remember thinking that time had stopped and I wondered how they could have done that. I believe that the craft was moving at some point and I was placed against a wall in an upright position.I can&apos;t remember much else but when I was able to go home from the field my legs and arms were badly bruised.  I had missed lunch but my mother thought that I was not hungry as I often came home on my own. I&apos;m not sure if she thought I may have gone up to the neighbor&apos;s house (they let us play in their field) and got food there which sometimes I did. I believe that I was gone more than was revealed by earth time.My father came home and saw me.  He was very upset and accused my mother of abusing me.  I was taken to a physician the next day for an exam. The local practitioner believed that I was showing the sudden bruising signs of leukemia.  I kept assuring my dad and mom that nothing was wrong and that mom hadn&apos;t hurt me.  I never told them about the &quot;angels.&quot;  To this day only my husband and children know about my abduction.  Exploratory surgery was performed on me soon after and bone marrow was taken from both my right thigh and my left kneecap.  The findings were negative.When I was in my 20&apos;s an unpaid psychic approached me in FL where I was living at the time. She explained that I had indeed been abducted by aliens and that I am still being monitored by them.

Object had lights on its top,bottom and sides. Object disappeared instantaneously after a half hour of viewing.", "Bright fireball in the sky that would drop other fireballs 2-3 times and then it disappeared.Two of us were sitting out on the deck and noticed a bright fireball in the sky that would intensify in light until something dropped from it that was on fire all the way to the ground. It did that 2-3 more times and when it went out, it looked like a large white balloon and then it went away.  Thought it was a basket of a hot air balloon that was on fire or a goodyear blimp that had been in the area videoing baseball games earlier in the day.", "3 very bright lights in a V formation, no sound and flying very slowlyOn March 17, 2004, around 8:30pm, I was taking my daughter to the hospital because she was having a flare up of her Crohn&apos;s Disease. When she was going around to the passenger side of the car she saw 3 bright lights to the north of us and said &quot;mom, what is that?&quot; I came out and looked, and saw 2 very bright white lights and one smaller one in kind of a triangular formation, but closer than any planes I&apos;ve ever seen. They didn&apos;t seem to be moving and looked fairly close to the ground. I ran in and got my daughters&apos; digital camera, and told my son to come out and look at them too. When I came back, they were still in the same spot. She took a picture &amp; they started moving toward us, so she took another picture. They turned SSE of us, moving toward Ahtanum Ridge slowly. We could see lights flashing, so at first I thought it might be planes, but they didn&apos;t make a sound. We watched them go south over the ridge towards Wapato, then they were gone. My daughter called the newspaper the next morning to see if anyone else had reported it &amp; they said no. She also called the FAA tower at the airport to see if they saw them, but the guy she talked to said none of them were on duty the night before. He also jokingly asked someone in the room with him if he could tell her it was ufos, and they said &quot;No&quot;.I found this site tonight because I was still thinking about what we saw, and when i read the reports from Ellensburg &amp; Yakima on the same date, i had to file my report too.", "February 1989 Roger&apos;s Park Chicago Northside 10PM -12:15AM Very Bright Lights/Bell Shape CraftThis happened in Roger&apos;s Park at 1339 W. Estes  Avenue 1/2 block from Sheridan Road while living in a second floor apartment with my husband at the time. It is near 10 PM at night and I (administrative assistant) am drying and putting away dishes telling my husband (graphic artist/muscian) that I just have the feeling someone is going to stop by our place tonight. We are getting ready to watch the 10 o&apos;clock news and begin to unpeg the futon couch to  make it into a bed in front of our 27&quot; floor model TV.  He comes over to my side and says, &quot;Look out the window&quot; and he takes my hand and we walk over to see what the bright light flooding the courtyard is about.  We find it very strange and I ask him, &quot;What do you think it is?&quot; He says, &quot;Do you think they are filming a movie on top of our roof?&quot; I say, &quot;It is very bright like the Kleig movie set lights...that&apos;s so silly, it&apos;s the middle of February at 10 o&apos;clock at night and why on top of our roof?!&quot; He suggest we put our coats on and go outside to check it out.  I step outside the foyer door onto the sidewalk where I can see my shadow like daylight (not full moon light) and exclaim how bright it is that I see my shadow like in daylight! We look up toward the roof and it is just so brilliantly white bright and we can not see beyond the castle cut-out like roof edge. We decide to walk out of the courtyard where the sidewalk is to see if we see movie trucks parked on the street and we do not. We decide to walk around to the west side of our building and there is no bright light there and nothing we can see three stories up on the roof. He wonders if there is a helicopter on our roof then, though we hear nothing like a helicopter. As we are walking back toward the sidewalk and down the street toward our courtyard we both stop simultaneously noticing that something feels very different  and we bounce off of each other some strange feelings...how it&apos;s 10 o&apos;clock at night and there is absolutely no busy traffic, no traffic sounds, no traffic at ! all on S heridan Road and we observe the light changing from green to red...we notice there are no &quot;double parked cars&quot; or pizza delivery cars, no one out walking, etc. It also seems strange that no one is looking out their windows noticing the bright light in our courtyard alone. It seems like time and space are at a standstill and we are the only two people left in the world! We decide to go back to the courtyard and try and look up toward the top of the roof again. I pull out some sunglasses I have in my coat pocket and put them on to see if I can see any better with them on. Next we remember going back inside the apartment on the second floor. Once inside our apartment I say to my husband, &quot;Do you think we should call the police? Or will the lights be gone by the time the police arrive  here and they&apos;ll just think we are nuts?&quot; He suggests we talk to our neighbors in the morning to see if any of them saw anything and to just wait and &quot; time&quot;  to see how long the lights continue to stay on outside. We look at an electric wall clock in our dinning room/music room that reads 10:30 PM and I say we couldn&apos;t have been out there for more than 10 minutes, how can it be 10:30 already! We both look at the VCR on top of the TV and the clock reads 12:00 midnight. We both feel that something is wrong with the time. We notice the lights are gone by 12:15 AM according to the VCR clock and the clock in the other room is stopped and stuck at 10:30 PM...it never works again.  We feel very exhausted and confused and go to bed. By morning time, we notice the VCR clock is correct in correlation with the morning tv programs. Now we both realize we could not possibly have been outside for nearly two hours when it seemed less than 10 minutes! None of our neighbors had noticed any light in the courtyard night before at all. I am very alarmed and I call my mother (LPN nurse) in Indiana saying I have something strange to tell her and she says she has something very strange to tell me about how she woke up in the middle of the night wit! h three short dark beings by her bedside all 3 wearing large different hats. She finds herself paralyzed and in terror, she closes her eyes and opens them again and they are still there. She is unable to wake my father (retired pipefitter) up. She wants to move and run and can&apos;t, she wants to scream and can&apos;t. She is reciting all the bible verses she can recall to her mind hoping  this will make them go away because she thinks they are evil and they are still there...she says she was not dreaming and they were very real to her and eventually they did go away. She is a very skeptical/logical person and is unwilling to talk of or speak of this bizarre thing to anyone else. She was very frightened and terrorfied by the experience and wonders if I could possibly have anything to do with it? I tell her the story about the lights. Over the course of a year, my husband is contiunally physcially ill and I go to the doctor with him to explain he is being mis-diagnosed and they need to find out what is the matter with him with the same symptoms I have been noticing. Seems he could have what is known as &quot;yuppie flu&quot; as he is a 60 hour a week work-a-holic...chronic fatigue syndrome...it is very controversial in the late 1980tys and his doctor decides to become more specialized and find out as much as he can to help him. By the 1990tys my husband&apos;s insurance company wants to know which he has - chronic fatigue syndrome or epstein barr virus...there is &quot;tilt-table&quot; test at St. Joseph&apos;s Hospital in Chicago and it is determined he has both in high numbers which qualifies him for disability pay, later he develops hypo-thyroid condition and fibromyalgia. He gradually recalls feeling back to the experience that he may have been &quot;ruffed up by some men&quot;  It saddens me to see him ill and I decide because I am the healthier one that I will undergo some hypnotherapy sessions to try and recall that missing time. During the sessions it is like I am re-living the experience. When I put on my sunglasses to look up on the roof toward the br! ight lig ht to see better...under hypnosis recall I find myself suddenly level with the roof top in the air and I am looking at a round bell-shaped craft with windows and an open door with pale light inside...there is brilliant bright light outside and a blue flashing light outside...it is attractive and over-whelming feelings of fun-ride over here, like excitement at an amusement park and next it is urgent, like an emergency...hospital emergency room rush over here.!I have not made it past this part in my hypnosis experience, so it&apos;s suggested that my mind/unconscious is blocking me not allowing me to see it all because I could not handle it...also I have heard of some kind of hypnosis gift or technique called &quot;rapid induction&quot; where a few dozen hypnotherapists in the U.S. are able to take their clients under very deeply, fully, walk them thru whole traumatic experience without them coming out of sesssion and able to give counsel at the end of session (such as in kidnapping/rape cases). I have not met any hypnotherapists who do such. I have come out of my sesssions feeling post traumatic stress disorder, so I had decided to stop altogether. This experience in Chicago I would say has been very life altering.((NUFORC Note:  One of six, seemingly credible, reports submitted by same witness.  Date of event is approximate.  PD))", "The witness for the sighting below are referring to the sighting report which took place on March 31, 2004 and the witnesses to that case had taken a number of photos of what they saw. Also a link to the March 31, 2004 sighting is included in this new report below. My wife and I saw the exact same thing over downtown St Paul last night heading south around 8:30 PM.  We believe it was a flock of geese flying at a high elevation that were catching the last rays of sunlight. Additional Information Below:  We live in a high rise in downtown St Paul, Minnesota, so I believe we have a different vantage point from which to view the phenomena than someone on the ground would have.  At approximately 8:30 PM on Thursday we went out on our balcony to have a cigarette.  The sun had set and it was fairly dark. My wife noticed the flying &quot;V&quot; formation heading due south.  The sight was identical to the picture you posted on Rense.com. or here at: http://www.hbccufo.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1150  She pointed it out to me and we stared at it.  Our initial thought was that it was a UFO.  But as we observed for about three minutes we noticed that the formation metamorphised into a sloppy looking &quot;W&quot;.  Then we saw a piece of it break off and go to the other side forming a lopsided &quot;V&quot; formation again. There was a cloud formation to the southeast that was slightly illuminated on the top as well.  Both the formation and the cloud to the southeast faded out simultaneously. There is a large Canadian goose population around here.  Typically we can see flocks flying south near the end of the evening.  Based on our observation we thought that the &quot;V&quot; was a flock of geese flying at a higher than normal elevation and they were catching the last rays of light on their underbellies. Again, we could be wrong.  I have seen unexplained sights in the sky before but this was the first time I had ever seen an illuminated flying &quot;V&quot;.  In this particular instance though, I think that the sight we saw probably had a natural explanation.

Noticed a neighbor pulling up..went toward entrance of Driveway and notice what appeared to be a Trasparent shape coming from the South heading North(First reaction was that is was a debris), but as it moved over me..it was shaped similar to a jigsaw puzzle piece and had a dim Orange glow(the only thing i can compare it to is if you held a flashlight to your hand and instead of seeing that Red glow, it was Orange). It even seemed to be gliding by..no noise at all...Once it was on top of me..it even appeared to be multiple objects..hard to tell...once heading north..it just seemed to vanish...I am still getting this weird feeling...like I saw something i was not supposed to see.....", "driving on rt.44 in canton ,i stoped for a stop light .it was a nice night so i had my sunroof open. i looked up as i always do tho look at the stars and there about 3000ft.up was a huge ovel shape craft about the size of a 747.being dark didnt help as far as seeing everything but there was different colored lights around the craft makeing a oval pattern.it was big.what got me was the size of the craft and how it hovered in one place .there was no noise at all.rt.44 is a very buisy rd. and i hope soneone else saw the same thing .i would realy like to here from you if you have . thanks        ((name deleted))", "Clear night in Oakland and my family saw five UFOs over the houseI was sitting in my car in my drive way. Saw one light high in the sky directly over my house. I thought it could be a satellite until it excellerated and performed a sharp 180 degree u-turn at high speed. That is when I took notice to a group of five lights matching the movement one at a time. The lights seem to chase each other in an erractic dog-fight style manuver as they flew from north to south in direction. The first light would excellerate, turn immediately in the opposite direction and stop. Then the next light would perform the same manuevur and stop in a formation type pattern. I thought the formation looked a lot like the big-dipper. I thought I haven&apos;t seen anything excellerate, make an 180 degree turn and stop. At that point, I ran inside and yelled for the family to come outside and view the UFOs. My wife saw the lights and remarked that they were UFOs, because she couldn&apos;t tell what it was. My daughter (10 yrs old) yelled we are being invaded and she sat down on the ground in fear. Later she asked me if they were trying to tell us something because of the formation they kept returning to. My two young boys just watched and never really said anything about it. I told my friends about it. Later, my cousin told me he saw a news report about a person who saw the same thing, but he was in Las Vegas. That&apos;s an idea of how high up they were.", "4 person, 6 sec sighting of a slow streaking flare/meteorite type object that disappeared and reappeared before passing nearby horizon.This evening, four witnesses observed a reddish orange flare-type object travel from roughly 30 degrees west-east past horizon at 10-20 miles distance for six seconds. The object streaked down slowly in similar fashion to flares I&apos;ve seen in the northern Arizona desert, although it did not appear to be burning up like a fireball which eminates and emits an aural haze, it looked more uniform like a meteorite with a tail. The object was observed from 0-1 seconds for about 10 degrees when it disappeared for 2 seconds and reappeared at 3-6 seconds to the treetop horizon. I had a very good view of the object because I was obseving that exact part of the beautiful, clear evening sky at the time it appeared directly in my line of vision. The best way that I can describe the way in which it traveled was that it appeared to me as though it had been dropped. It&apos;s brightness was that of Jupiter, and it did not seem as though it burned up before it impacted or landed roughly 10 miles away. It&apos;s behavior seemed so unusual to us that we all immediately acknowledged it and joked that the aliens were landing in Leeds, Alabama. We are MJ- age 30, April- 24, Brandi- 20, Crystal- 18, co-workers who had stopped at April&apos;s house after work to visit, and we observed the object as we were leaving to take everyone home.

I was allowed to go half way around the block and play with my 3 year old girlfriend &quot;Fluffy&quot; after 9 AM...her brothers and sisters would be off in school and that is the time my mother said I could go over to Fluffy&apos;s house to play. As I walked around the block to her house, I looked in the sky for cloud pictures and there were no clouds, a cloudless sunny day. I went down the driveway as usual to the back of her house and already found her outside in her backyard by the tulips along the side of the yard next to neighbor&apos;s garage.I think it had to be the month of May because of the tulips. Fluffy was wearing a new white blouce with rick-rack stitching across it...I asked her if it was new and she said yes and I told her how pretty it was. I asked her what game she wanted to begin playing and she said hide-and-go-seek!  Then it became very, very windy and I was laughing trying to part my long hair out of my face...I noticed the grass was long and blowing strongly too and had not been cut or mowed...I looked over to my girlfriend &quot;Fluffy&quot; and she was already crouched in the corner of an &quot;L&quot; shaped hedge by the side of her house...I said I hadn&apos;t even counted to ten yet and you&apos;re hiding! The wind was so strong and I was reaching toward her and she looked very pale and scared. She was shouting at me, &quot;What is it? What is it?&quot; and I looked up and saw large square grey tile shapes (metallic, yet I didn&apos;t know the word back then) it was low and hovering near the height of the tall tree and high enough up right above the neighbor&apos;s garage and I said, &quot;I don&apos;t know...I don&apos;t know!&quot;  She was begging me, &quot;Don&apos;t go! Don&apos;t go!&quot; I reached my hand out and said, &quot;I&apos;ll take you with me cuz you&apos;re my friend, cuz you&apos;re my friend.&quot;  The next memories I have are: Her mother is standing at the back door swinging it open and yelling angry at us, &quot;I&apos;ve been looking for you children, where have you been playing, get in here, lunch is ready now!&quot; (the house has an added on back edition with large picture window facing the backyard and window that looks out to the side of the house by the hedge area, neighbor&apos;s driveway.) We were at the side of the house together and it was as if we had become unfrozen from time and were now walking toward her mother upon hearing this to go inside the house. I am confused because I know I just got over there past 9 AM and how can it be lunch time now? Why is her mother seem upset and angry with us? We walk in the house and Chicago WGN Channel 9 is on TV with popular kid&apos;s show that comes on at noon called &quot;Bozo&apos;s Circus&quot; The ping-pong toss into buckets one thru six are happening in the show...which means it is almost over, at the end. I sit down at the kitchen table and look at the clock on the wall and it reads 12:25 PM and I am counting from 9 AM to Noon trying to figure out how it can already be that time...we hadn&apos;t even played hide-n-go-seek...why is her mom mad, has she baked a lunch casserole or fancy dish. She serves us folded over half sandwiches of peanut butter and jelly.After lunch, Fluffy and I go down in her basement with crayons (we know we can not draw on the walls of the house)  and put some chairs against the wall underneath the see thru stair steps where we draw with orange, bright green, and red crayons a big spooky man ...he looks scarey like a monster and we put him there on the basement wall that day under the stairs down to the basement laundry room.  Fluffy&apos;s five brothers and sisters come  home from school in the afternoon and discover the drawing teasing each other and asking one another who put that on the wall to scare us. They don&apos;t believe us when we tell them we drew it, we explained we stood on chairs to draw him tall and big.  The picture remained on the wall till the mid 1990tys before her parents decided to paint the basement with two coats of paint.  I go home that day before 6 PM dinner time to tell my mommy and daddy that I saw something in the sky.I tell them how windy it was and my mom says you must have seen a helicopter and I say no, it didn&apos;t make any sound. My father asks me what it looked like and I say big square grey shapes and he says you must have seen a blimp! I don&apos;t know or realize what a blimp looks like until I am six years old and I see one in the night sky. My folks remember this day because I would not stop talking about going over to Fluffy&apos;s house to play and seeing something in the sky. I remember the feeling of not feeling safe. Her mother did not know where we were and we went away somewhere all morning and came back after 12 o&apos;clock noon time. Fluffy and I both had 3 foot tall manequin dolls and she took her doll out to where the autumn leaf pile is burned in the back yard behind her house and lit a match and burnt her doll. I watch and her mom comes out asking her why she did such a thing to her doll and she says, &quot;I don&apos;t know&quot;  I am afraid of my doll getting me that I keep shut in my bedroom closet.((NUFORC Note:  One of six, seemingly credible, reports submitted by same witness.

(7miles East of Chanute) I noticed what appeared to be a large bright light low to the west horizon. (Much brighter than any others stars) It appeared to have two lights on top of each other.  The night was perfectly clear and completely silent.  I stood and watched the light for about 6 minutes trying to figure out why it seemed to be flickering.  I then called my daughter and her boyfriend (they were still in town) to ask if they could see anything from where they were at.  They could not see anything though.  I then continued to watch for another 2 or 3 minutes when I started to notice a triangle surrounding the lights.  These lines that formed the triangle were green and like what appeared to be on a car dash display. (Color/shade of green) I hurried up and called my daughter back and told her and her boyfriend to get out here before it was gone.    I continued to watch and noticed that the formation was definitely coming towards my house.The triangle was getting larger in size therefore I knew it was coming closer.  5 or 6 more minutes passed and I called my daughter again to see how far away they were.  They were on the main highway near my house only &frac12; mile away from me but could not see anything.  (That&rsquo;s how low this thing was flying) I ran out to the gravel road north of my house as I noticed it moving slightly northwards.  It seemed to be hovering at what appeared to be about 80&apos; or 90&apos; above the tree tops and only 1/4 or &frac12; mile away from me to the west.  I determined my distance using the strobe like flash the object was emitting on the trees.  About every 5 or 10 seconds there would be a flash of white light shining downward.  On a few occasions the light was red.  The light would be bright enough I could see the hedge rows below it.  I then used the hedge rows to calculate my distance from the object.Having to guess the actual size the object, I would say that using the three green lines that formed the triangle, the object was equivalent to 2 (two) full moons width.  This was calculated when the UFO was at its closest point to me.  I heard my daughter coming down the road so I phoned her to tell her to turn off her lights but her car does not allow lights to turn off while car is running.  When they pulled up I quickly jumped in the car so we could drive closer.  As we started to drive about 65mph on the gravel, it quickly started moving back towards the west. (The way it originally came from) We drove back to Chanute and on through town continuing 11 miles on west of town.  All the while we were traveling at a high rate of speed.  The object disappeared into the horizon at a low altitude.There were three of us that saw this happen yet none of us could even begin to explain what exactly it looked like.  I did report this to the Sheriffs Department but they had not heard anything about it.  The object made no sound whatsoever. (The night was perfectly still and noiseless)((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witnesses via telephone, and they seemed to us to be exceptionally seriou-minded and credible.  The object was seen two nights sequentially.

Looking up I saw what appeard to be a light about 2x the luminosity of venus. CLouds were present and moving North. THe object moved South at a steady slow rate. There was no vapor trail or noise. If it was man made, it would have been located up in orbit, or at least above FL70. The object could not have been reflecting the sunlight because the luminosity was constant even though it moved. Most things only reflect at certain angles.", "Swirling in CirclesI was sitting on my roof smoking when 5 flashes of light swirled around in the sky in a circle. They were tiny which means they must have been far away but they were circling above a cloud (maybe thinking no one could see them) for 5 seconds then dashed away.", "Bright Light - That turns into a Saw Blade Shape when videotaped by a Digital Video Camera.It looked like a bright star that was about tree level in the sky.The night sky was clear, no rain, no clouds etc. You could see the moon &amp; other stars, but they were much farther up in the sky &amp; smaller too.

I showed him &amp; his mother, they both agreed it was wierd, my husband got out his digital camera &amp; could see movement of this object, it was not until I got out my Cannon XL Digital Camera that you could see that it was unusual.

Description:  It was oval and had a square in the middle of it and it was very very bright it had two lines in the middle and a thick antenna on top. Mom: At approximately 9 P.M. this evening I was seated at my computer desk when startled by a bright light zooming past my window. I immediately got up to see what was going on when the light flashed and was gone immediately, no sound no noise nothing just gone!  I remember thinking it may have been the police because the lights went past so fast, it did not seem plausible at all, but for some odd reason I did not give it any further consideration at that time until my husband was alerted by our 11 year old and our five year old that there was something strange in our back yard. We are very &quot;down to earth&quot; type people and deal with what is &quot;realistic&quot; pinch me if you would because I had always associated &quot;realistic&quot; with what is known and now I have to change this theory to realistic - once seen!((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the father and older daughter, and we found them to be seemingly quite sincere and credible.  The daughter described how she and her younger sister were seated in their bedroom, when the entire room suddenly was illuminated by two bright flashes.  Their impression was that the flashes had emanated from outside their window, so they quickly rushed to the window, threw the heavy curtains aside, and were witness to an oval shaped object, intensely bright, hovering less than 30 feet from their window.  The object then accelerated away from them, disappearing from their view in seconds.

When they were side by side, they were in identical formation and going at the same speeds.  Once or twice when they crossed it seemed they got out of synch but quickly went side by side again.

I would venture a guess that they were maybe around an altitude of approx. 40 thousand feet or so, HOWEVER they seemed to pull back and forth quite a bit so maybe at some times were as low as 20 thousand feet and slightly higher than 40k ft.They darted up and down and horizontally directly in front of us for less than a minute and then darted over towards the baseball park, where they didn&apos;t go directly over, but went more towards the north side of the park and seemed to almost stop for another half a minute or so.  Almost as if they hovered and then sharply flew north for a moment and then took a serious turn and headed south VERY quickly.An interesting note was the fact that one of these objects seemed more stable than the other.  One was always crossing the other and seemed to want to stray but was pulled in next to the more stable object. I would also state that they were definitely following the coastline as they headed south.As I had mentioned, I have been reading up and found something very uncanny regarding our sighting here, to someone in Scotland.  I&apos;ve copied and pasted the reference....it&apos;s almost identical!  (Source http://www.rense.com/general6/discsspotted.htm)((#2))I do now believe that the objects may have been as low as 10 -15k feet at points last night.  I did observe some airplanes landing and based on recent flights that I have taken, I would have to say that they were probably at this level at a couple of points.Hope this helps you.  ((name deleted))((#3))Would it help if I drew you a picture of the objects and the paths they took? I can scan it over to you tomorrow if you would like. ((#4))You&apos;re very welcome.....I&apos;ve been reading on your site re: the many sightings here in Florida as well as in the local vacinity in which we live.  Up until last night, I had no idea what was going on down here! I&apos;m amazed.I use to tease my ex-husband about his &quot;sky watching&quot; and filming.  I will never, ever do that again!  I have tried to make a rational explanation for what we saw and just cannot do it. Nothing makes sense with this (I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve heard this before though).I was really interested in the one report from a few years back of someone seeing crafts embodied in their own haze: THIS IS WHAT WE SAW LAST NIGHT!  No extra lights; the objects seemed to glow greyish from within and emit a brownish haze that encompassed each.Anyhow, I won&apos;t take up your time here.......I&apos;ll scan over the picture(s) tomorrow morning for you.Have a good evening Mr. Davenport.((#5))Dear Mr. Davenport,Attached is my drawing of what we had seen last night.

Between the waste water treatment plant and the aep power plant{both plants are to my right west}. I saw to my left {east} 2 very bright round red lights in the sky with a small white round light in the middle. The lights where moving slowly.The red lights where pulsing and the white light was more of a blinking. The height was low 80-100 feet.Also it was very foggy out and real dark no moonlight, or stars out.I also saw a faint light coming down through the fog mist. It was small at the top and large at the bottom {like a funnel}.Then after 6-10 seconds in the blink of an eye dead darkness the lights went out.The lights where more like balls then aircraft lights. This was close to the freeway and the lights {before they went out},where moving in the direction of the aep power plant.southwest.Also my car started missing running rough.I have not looked at it yet maybee just a bad plug.", "A triangular, slow moving, silent, lighted with 6 lights on base with green and blue being dominate, subdued yellow and red also,On this night My fiance&apos;, her daughter and myself winessed a triangular object traveling NE over Oakdale MN.  It passed directly over our vehicle as we were driving due south.  We seen it initially comming towards us about 2 or 3 miles away.  I said to my fiance, &quot;look, theres a UFO&quot;. In jest at first because we are both sky-watchers.  I said this because I am not used to seeing aircraft with dominate blue and green lights on it.  There were 6 lights visible from the bottom of the craft. Two lights 1 blue and 1 green that were dominate.  There were 3 yellow/white lights about 1/3 as bright as the green and blue lights. Also a slightly fainter red light. The red light was on the leading edge of the triangle at the apex.  2/3&apos;s of the way back to the base of the triangle were the green and blue lights nearer to the edges.  At the base were the 3 yellow/white lights located centered on the base between the green and blue lights. As it came closer and then right over us it was very clear that this was not a helicopter because my best guess would be that it couldn&apos;t be more than 1200 feet in the air and there was no sound.  I seemed to be going no mre than 80 miles per hour.  I turned around to follow it and kept up pretty well at 50 MPH. I was in a residential area and soon had to stop.  We stopped abd watched it for several minutes and seen 1 helicopter going from SE to NW seemingly going towards this object.  There was also another helicopter going directly N and to our left that seemed to be headed in that direction also.  It was very easy to hear and see that these were helicopters as we were stopped now with the windows down.  As the object in question reached about 5 miles to our north it started to change direction to more northwesterly as opposed to NE.  It made a apparently very slow turn, but as I was so far to the south of it.... it could have just been the distance that made it look slow.  Ater that we were unable to see the object.  We decided at this time to go back to our home! I am former Air force and have a better than average knowledge of aircraft and their characteristics... this is the first time I was stumped ;)", "Slow moving object in night sky abruptly disappearsAs I was leaving work on the evening of March 22, 2004 at 10:53 PM, I noticed a very slow moving light in the distance, aprroximately 4 nautical miles or so in a cloudless sky.  I was facing in a NNE direction and the object was moving in a SW direction.  At first I took the object to be a distant airplane, as we live approximately 94 nautical miles from BWI, DCA and IAD and am quite familiar with how approaching or cruising airplnes appear in the night sky. There was also air traffic in the vacinity that evening, so it was easy to make a quick comparison. But as this object moved and appeared to get closer I could see no individual strobe or marker lights. The object also seemd to be lower than a typical cruising or approaching airplane would be for our region. Due to the distance of the object I could not confirm any presence or lack of any sound. It was at this point that the object, which had a steady luminosity, abruptly and un-nervingly dissapeared. I continued to scan the area of the night sky for its reappearance, but to no avail. It is possible that it may have been a small airplane departing from Doersom Airport, outside of Gettysburg. But wouldn&apos;t small aircraft still be required to have strobe and marker lights? I would like to know if I have mis-identified a known object, please advise.", "Round object changing colors from white to red, green, yellow or orange.We were going to sleep and my girlfriend noticed a bright object in the sky to our NNW. We noticed that the object was not moving, but when it did it moved from side to side slowly. We also noticed that this object seemed round, changing colors or flashing colors from bright white to red, to green, maybe even yellow or orange. The object seemed to be fairly high up in the sky,if I had to guess I would say somewhere around 5000 ft.

I was about to turn around and go to my bed when I saw a blurbed little red light pop on near Jupiter.  It was originally heading south, but it turned west from its course by large swoop-like turns, like a ball on a string.  After the first light had caught my attention, three more came out of the east, at a steady speed in a loose echeleon formation.  Two were flying straight and rigid, while the one farthest south was swerving around like a bouncy ball.  While they were as close to being directly above me as they ever came to be, an incredibly bright meteor, short, extremely fast.  It did NOT effect the craft in formation.About fifteen minutes afterwards, I saw a another strange looking meteor, the reason I say it looked strange is because it looked extremely low, like a trace bullet.The red lights had no particular shape, just little red blurbs of light. I am known to be a mostly honest person.  With only one witness, that being me, this probably doesn&apos;t count all that much.  But I knew what I saw and it scared me plenty.I also saw the first one throght binoculars, so I knew I wasn&apos;t seeing things, and I wasn&apos;t dreaming either.", "glint of light on mettalic circular objecti saw a glint of light in a somewhat circular shape i guess but it was the sun shining off an object which was NOT the shape of a plane... it was extremely bright and it was of mettalic color and when the glint of light was gone the ufo was gone", "they werent planes they were UFOSI was in the Navigator Of The seas a royal caribbean cruise i was there celebrating my 15th birthday then we got out of the disco for teen from 15-17 years around 3:50 am it was our last night in the cruise and it was a saturday in the early morning (4:00am ) so we got out of the disco and we were walking on deck 12 then my friends and my chaperons saw 3 bright light they were white there werent moving and where positioned on a diagonal line. we thought the were planes but they didnt move and they didnt have light like a plane and still 3 planes are never gonna be together on a diagonal line and we were overseas we were supposed to get to miami around 9 am so there wasnt any land nearby and they didnt make sounds like a plane then we tought there were light on an islan but there werent any islands over there since we were overseas and we all could sea the ocean went on and on they werent satelites because they were too close to the ocean. the day before we had been to cozumel mexico and ive heard that ufos are mostly seen in mexico ... then after a while the first ufo the lowest one took off and color light turned on and then it took of until i couldnt see it anymore when it took of it did look like a plane but before i could tell it was still then after we couldnt see the first one the 2 lowest ufo took off the same way therewas no sound and no trail then after we couldnt see it anymore the third one took of the same way and we were really scared!! thats when i realized that maybe those stories about ufos can be true.", "clear diamond shape thing with blue and orange light came close to land but did not land on it and vanishedtrue and real brihgt blue orange light , then the shape of the ship started to appear , like a dimoned , started to close down to the face of the earth , and suddenly disappeared away like lighting .", "I remember it being in June of 1987 but the actual day is hard to remember.There is a stretch of road that runs through Burlington Ct called rout 4. Located off this road and between Johnnycake Airport and the Burlington Trout Hatchery is a stretch of winding roads that takes you into the direction of Nepaug Reservoir. Along these roads which has zero street lights and is very wooded is a clearing that overlooks a small section of the reservoir. On this night my brother, his friend and myself were sitting on the hood of my car looking up at the night sky that was loaded with stars. I remember talking about the Challenger accident (6 months eariler) that for me was still fresh in my mind. My brothers friend was the first to notice a star like object crossing the night sky. Looking in the direction he was pointing I observed this object cross the entire sky within seconds as far as the eye could see than turn around to make a pass back in our direction. This happend 4 times in a matter of 1 minute. On what was to be its final pass we noticed in its path was a much larger object, the best way I can describe it to you is it looked like a circle formation of star like objects. As the moving craft reached this larger circle (maintaining its same observed speed) we thought it would continue going but when it reached the outer edge of this larger circle it was just gone.At that moment we looked at each other amaized at what we had seen, and over to our left, above the water and small hilltops were these three(3) fire balls. The formation between these 3 fireballs and our location was a diamond. We looked at the objects for at least 30 minutes. Within this time frame each one moved very slowly, the one to our far left seemed to drift straight back and away from us than it was gone like it flipped off a switch. The object to our far right descended straight down behind the tree line. At that moment we noticed a small plane making its landing approach at the near by airfield, thats when I made the joakingly remark and said (pointing to the object dead ahead of us) &quot;Watch, I bet this one will bounce&quot; Just as I said it, the object started to bounce itself behind the small hilltop. These objects were at the same level as the small plane was at the time of its landing approach to the airfield. By this time we were speechless as to what we saw. At that moment we heard a noise that came from the very dark woods behind us that sounded as if something fell from the top of the trees and hit every branch on its way down. If you had a stop watch at that moment I think it would have been a new worlds record for getting into a car, locking the doors, turning the key and getting our asses outta there. We drove to Torrington Ct which is about a 30 minute drive, within 10 minutes of getting into town we saw another friend of my brothers, we told her what we had seen, drove her back up to the sight and each one of the fireballs were back in the exact place we saw them the first time. After a few minutes they each began to move again as they did before. We never looked up into the sky to see if the star formation was still there and whatever had made the noise that scared us outta there in the first place I guess was gone cause we didn&apos;t hear any noises again. The person we found to show her what we had seen had seen enough and wanted to go back after observing the objects for only about 15 ! minutes. Whatever we had seen that night, in the sky and over the reservoir were not low or high flying air planes except for the one noted. As far as what fell out of the tree, who knows, but I bet it hurt.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

I saw a light on the horizont, over me. It was big as a street lamp (almost three quarter of the full moon). I saw that the oval light was moving in diagonal, so I raised my eyes, thinking that it was a falling stars, but it was bigger, slower and suddenly it changed direction. Instead of in diagonal, it started moving in horizontal, and after a second it vanished. My first reaction was the cry, I was a little scared. The day after, to have a confirm, I asked to my university friends (I&apos;m a doctor in sciences of communication and I&apos;m attending a master of Journalism), and one of them told me that he too, the night before was in a car with a friend, and saw the same thing!", "In 1967 our town was celebrating it&apos;s bi-centanial, a month long celebration which included several events including a temporary museum housed in an old elementary schol directly behind our house. On the rear of the building was a set of fire escapes leading from the ground down to the ground, just 50 yards away was a base ball field. One evening I awoke and noticed red and green blinking lights in our back yard, I looked out the window and saw something very large hovoring above the base ball field about 20 feet off the ground with red and green blinking lights around the bottom of the craft. The event didn&apos;t scare me, and I returned to bed after observing the craft for about a half hour. The next morning I informed my parents as to what I saw, being 9 years old they dismissed the incident as a vivid imagination, until the following day when the local newspaper the Demorcrat Messanger ran a story about the two guards in the temporary museum reporting seeing the same craft the same morning, the night was warm and the guards decided to sleep on the fire escape facing the ball field, they claimed they were awoken by the brightness of the lights of the craft, and eventually it simply rose into the sky straight up and to the northeast until it disappeared about 1/2 hour later.", "blue fireball descendingwe were driving north on us highway 169. as we looked to the east, three of us saw what seemed to be a blue light hurtling towards the ground some distance away. we were afraid it was an airplane. we never saw an explosion, the blue fireball just disappeared from view behind the tree line. i speculated that perhaps it was a helicopter landing on a nearby (15 miles away) hospital ( unity hospital, fridley, mn) and then I decided to check for any websites that might have information and I found this one. it was very eerie that others have seen this blue ball of light- the picture shown was the exact same thing we saw.yikes.((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of the fireball seen over Canada.

So i sat up and told her to look at the sky then thats whenwe came to think it was a UFO, because it could&apos;nt possibly belong to the USA. Then the light got brighter. As it came closer i felt fear in my heart, i&apos;d say it was about 10 feet away from us. We tried to run but we could&apos;nt move i tried to move but it was as if someone or something was controling us. My friend could&apos;nt move either, she could barely even speak fom the shock.

It was small and hard to determine the altidude. It seemed to drift slowly to the south then to the south east. The object appeared to be small and round. It seemed to wobble or spin. It flashed a firey red light at an irregular interval. Sometimes the light was quick and dim. Other times it seemed to flare up. As it slowly drifted over the building I lost sight of it an so left my office to go downstairs to see if I could catch it on the other side of the building. When I came outside and looked around it was gone. However at the same time I looked south and saw a single military aircraft moving untypically fast from the direction of Ellington Field an moving WNW. It seemed to be 3-5 miles to the south. The plane then went west and I think did a U-turn back toward the east. I would note however that President Bush is in town tonight for a fund raiser. That&apos;s it. I don&apos;t know what it was. It was NOT a plane or helicopter. It seems like it could possibly heve been a baloon of some kind but the flashing was wierd - unless it has an irregular surface that was &quot;spinning&quot; and possibly reflecting light from the sunset in the west. Plausible - but I just can&apos;t say. It was certainly unusual enough to get and hold my attention. I took 3 digital photos but they don&apos;t show much more than a small reddish dot.

Just pass the Springfield Metro (subway station) and at about 11:00 O&apos;clock position, my wife noticed two strange cloud-like formations in the sky. She pointed these objects out to me and they were very noticeable, being that the sky was rather clear and blue. At first I thought they were hot air balloons but then I noticed that they were like vapor clouds, and somewhat thick in consistency since both were casting a shadow. The shape of these UFOs were identical to each other, their tops were circular in shape, as domes, and both had &quot;trails&quot; at their base, similar to tentacles from a jellyfish. They did not seem to move from their positions, static as they floated above.

Then I noticed what looked like the trail from another jet, except it kind of looked like two trails from a jet real close together. As I watched it more, there was no jet, and the trail wasn&apos;t getting any longer. It was completely horizontal (north to south). It was fairly high in the sky, and as I looked at it more over a period of about a minute, I swear it looked like a perfect row of small windows going down the length of it. It also seemed to have a perfect, long, cylindrical shape, with the windows going down the middle. I could tell it was cylindrical because the top and bottom kind of faded as if there was some roundness to the object. I couldn&apos;t tell how high it was in the sky, but the object looked enormous. After about two minutes of watching it, it performed a 4 second fade out from being completely visible, to disappearing completely. I&apos;ve never witnessed the trail of a jet disappear that quick after being visible for that long.There is not one cloud in the sky today, completely empty blue sky except for first jet that I saw, and the other unexplainable object.There&apos;s no way I was the only person to have seen it, there was tons of cars on the freeway, and the object was in plain view as you were driving southbound. From where I was, it looked like it was hovering directly over the Northgate area, but pretty high up.First time I&apos;ve seen anything like that in person.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness.

The craft had 10 lights. It seemed to moving and the lights were blinking. Many cars on the highway were slowing down to look at the lights. The craft seemed to jumped to a new location.

I spent the night there with the girl, she had 2 older brothers and they had seen it before. We lived near the air port (Dulles), and I even said, It&apos;s a reflection, just like the Brady Bunch, but we all ran outside, and it was still there. By the time the parents got outside, it was gone, and they thought we were just imagining things or seeing things from the airport.

Recorded the event with a telescope!Goto www.spacecanada.org for video and photos. I go for a walk around 6:pm MST  Around 6:10 I notice there is a bright star like object south west of the quarter waxing moon. Sunset has just started and the object is about a Venus magnitude.Very striking against the blue sky. I hookup the 32mm Anteares and got a line on it with my Celestron Telescope.Through the eyepiece you could see what definitely looked like a balloon with a package swinging below it.As it drifted east I switched to my digital camera and the adapted 20mm Celestron. I was able to record some excellent video. Although it would have been better with a computer automated system of tracking to soften the vibration. As it drifted east it seem to track smoothly.Then it seemed to start back towards the moon. As it did, the package seemed to drop something and the balloon looked like it became an elongated umbrella.  Its was transparent looking but showed a reflective white pattern. As the package fell, it looked like it was tethered on a loosely packed string of pearls.Instead of being straight bellow the balloon, it snaked back and forth in the sky.The length must have been incredible.  I think about 5 degree of the sky was encompassed from top to bottom of tether line. Time End: 6:25 pm MST  Cloud cover started over and I lost the remaining event. Fantastic none the less!  Interesting that this event matches my daughter[&apos;s drawing above.  Same moon phase.((NUFORC Note:  One of two excellent reports from the same witness.

The object was oval shaped, laying horizontal, it&apos;s top side was bright, and bottom side was bright, the center front to back was like a white flame, not as bright as it&apos;s top and bottom. A bright comet tail followed the object, apox. ten times the length of the object. The objects diameter was as large as a cargo plane (maybe two or three degrees across, 1.5 degrees from top to bottom). The object traveled from the south east to north east, that is, it changed bearing and from traveling north on the east horizon, to a north-east-north direction. It vanished into another veil of darkness. My estimation of speed is that it traveled perhaps 1000 mp-minute. Based on a apox. est of distance in feet, measured in time traveled.

It moved slowly and I could see its outline because blocked out the background behind it and it also reflected a small amount of light from the city below.Thinking that my eyes were playing tricks on my or my glasses had a glare, I removed my glasses and was still able to see the object and the small amount of light reflected from it.

At first I thought it was like a &quot;balloon&quot; much, much larger than a child&apos;s balloon compared to the size of cloud and how I visually saw object. I am sorry I could not give approximate height since I am not knowlegable about estimating such! As I continued to observe object it descended in a zig-zag, stair-step fashion down to the west across front of cloud right to the very center and middle of the puka hole in the cloud holding steady. It did not appear like the marijuana eradication black helicopters here...was not long shape and did not have rotors, just black and round. Seemed to high up in the sky and clouds to be a helicopter really.  Then in just a few seconds time it zipped down from the puka-hole and off to the west past the cloud and completely disappeared and no longer visible in the cloud or sky. This was rather startling as I expected to still be able to see it, whereas, it did a fast vanishing motion. I kept watch on the cloud and sky looking for it. Then totally unexpectedly it did reappear again from the east portion of the cloud, gradually coming out of the cloud and then fading back into the cloud. This left me with a rather disturbing feeling. I know the viewing time was 4 minutes long as I timed it on my stopwatch.((NUFORC Note:  One of six, seemingly credible, reports submitted by same witness.

It was a slightly illuminated brownish/orange, sphere shaped object that wasent going anywhere.It just hung there in mid air. Anyways I grabbed a set of binoculars that I carry with me in my truck and managed to focus on the object just as it started to move out towards the ocean and out of range.

At first it looked like the backdraft of a jet, but there was no smoke and it was traveling all together, no trail of smoke was left behind. It was reddish orange and there seemed to be a small black dot in front of the red line. The best way to describe the object itself is it looked like a constant streak of light. It was moving southward, too high to be in normal airspace. It was moving very slowly at first, but then gradually sped up, slowed back down, and faded away. The colors never changed, and the object remained intact.((NUFORC Note:  If the witnesses were not looking at a contrail, illuminated by the setting sun, then we don&apos;t know what they witnessed.

These orbs of light streaked across the sky and then reversed their directions and began &quot;playing&quot; and interacting with each other as if in a &quot;dog-fight&quot;. It reminded me of those old war films where the planes would fly in formation and then break-away and engage with the enemy...I am a skeptic at heart and did not want to believe what I saw clearly taking place. These aerobatics continued for some time and we ruled out all of the usual causes that may have created this illusion: 1) neither of us were in intoxicated in any way 2) the sky was totally unobstructed by clouds or Moonlight 3) they were not birds or bats due to the velocity of travel across a huge portion of the sky and the way in which they could stand completely still, They could veer off in any direction without breaking speed, either.4) I woke up my roommate and had her come and see this orbs also.5) last, but not least, at 6AM they all returned to the &quot;star&quot; just before daybreak.I might add also that this occured just days before Hurricane Isabelle began its journey towards our shore. I live one mile from the Atlantic Coast and Isabelle was headed directly for us as a catagory 5 hurricane. In the last approach to our shoreline Isabelle reduced to a catagory 3 and changed course to come inland above us.I know that these were other-wordly craft and wonder if they usually appear before catastophic events and I also wonder if anyone else in our area witnessed this same phenomena.", "Large triangle shaped object over Horton, KS moving east.Three of us were heading back to Atchison, Ks after a post fourth of July fireworks show at the Sac and Fox Casino. My friends car has a sunroof, so i was leaning back in the passenger side seat, looking up at the stars. This triangle shaped constellation caught my eye, because the magnitude of it was dimmer then the surrounding stars. Then i noticed something else. It started moving. One point of the triangle was pointing East, and that was the direction that this thing was moving. I was so excited that i told my friend to stop the car. She did and we got out of the car and i pointed to where the object was. It finally caught her eye and we both had chills running up our spines. My girlfriend was with us but she said that she could not see it. We were frantically trying to get her to see it, but eventually it faded as it moved further east. Whatever this thing was, it had to be huge, because based on the magnitude of the light, and the distance it would have had to have been above us, i am guessing it was in the Earths orbit (not inside the atmosphere). Seeing things like that sure makes one truly wonder.....we are not alone.", "Calgary, I saw something towards the west at 11:55 p.m. Thursday. I watched it thinking its only a star, then it moved one way then back again. It looked kind of like a yellow white light with pulsing red light. Two planes flew past, this was weird because the light didn&apos;t move at first, then after the second plane flew by, it moved away slowly. I live in Haysboro Southwest part of Calgary, looking west is where I saw this. It&apos;s a very cool evening. I hope someone else saw this too. Additional Information Below:  The witness observed the light for approximately 5 minutes before losing sight of it. I also was playing a cat and mouse game, hide behind a tree branch, and see if it moves, and yes it did. Now as for the lights probing, moving back and forth, its kind of hard to see between the branches and my binoculars aren&apos;t that great for distance. I would estimate the object&apos;s altitude was as high as the two planes as they were flying into the city. I did not hear any sound coming from the object but did hear the sound of the planes that flew over. It was about the size of a pea/dime. There were no other witnesses to the sighting, only myself. I went out side to see why there was so many lights in our alley. Some kids decided to spray paint their initials on the side of our garage last night and I thought they were back. So I went on to the porch to have a look. I saw the moon and I decided to take a picture of it. Then I looked at all the stars in the sky when I noticed that one was was sitting there as the first plane flew by, then it moved. I grabbed my binoculars to have a closer look and then it moved again. I played this game you close one eye, see what happens, it moved further west and then north. The red light kept pulsing and I noticed it turning and then it stopped. I wanted to go chase it, but thought it would disappear. After the second plane flew by, it left heading west by north. The first plane looked like a normal commercial airline, the second plane I paid no attention to it. Sorry that&apos;s about all I can tell you, I hope someone else saw it too.

The witness was kind enough to supply some more information on the sighting. Additional Information below. The object never stayed stationary at anytime during the sighting. No sound was heard coming from the objects. Also there was no trail or tail following the two object. An estimation of the altitude of the lights would have placed them at the height the UNBC University was sitting. (so not high at all). Both lights traveled side to side for moments, then split apart. No flames, but the flickering of the lights seemed to be like fire. The objects were moving North-east above Ospika/foothills.
