["Bright light over Western Salt Lake moves across the sky then vertically and disappears.I noticed a bright light in the Western sky and watched it for a moment thinking it was an airplane. The light was very bright white.  I looked closer to see if I could make out any red or green port and starboard lights, but there were none visible.  The light moved across the sky at about the speed of a plane, but then suddenly moved vertically and the light started to fade and then disappear.  It happened within about 10 seconds.  My cell phone stopped working briefly (for about 10 seconds) after the light disappeared.This even occurred over the Oquirrh Mountains from my perspective on the East bench of the Salt Lake Valley.", "Round globe light with a wobble passes by the sky nightLooked out this evening north west direction about 40 degree up in the sky and saw star like object moving towards the  south east.Looked liked a bright light or planet, had a slight wobble and slow speed to it and steady  glow to it then faded out, no beacon light or sound very odd, seen this in 2009 five of them. Thank you.", "Bright objects and flashes over Louisville,Kentucky.At aproximately 9:30 pm Est I went out on the porch to smoke a cigarette when I noticed a really extremely bright light in the sky. It was unusual in its shape and size.The light was very very bright and seemed to be unstable as if beams were shooting out from all over it.A I watched this object, just to the left of it what at first I thought was a plane flew right into it.  I looked to the right thinking it was going fly past it and it did not. That is when I jumped up and told my son something is not right with that object I think it is a UFO.As we watched it within 3-4 minutes two white bullet  shapes objects came out of it,one on the left and one on the right.I ran in and grabbed my video camera and started filming it. We watched as its movements were irratic at times and at one time before it completely disappeared it came closer and then backed away and then disappeared.Within about 5 minutes it reappeared in the same area and to the right of it a red object appeared in the sky.The red object moved faster than any jet we had ever seen. It was if it was encircling the the white object. Then all of a sudden they disappear and we see flashes of white light as if someone was taking a picture and the flash was so bright.By now our neighbors were outside watching the activity and we noticed all the planes coming into our airport were circling away and we noticed jets taking off in the direction of the ufos. All of a sudden we hear a sonic boom and we look at the traces in the sky from the jets heading in that direction.I tried to video tape the red object and the happenings afterwards but for some odd reason I could not get it to film, all I got was static across my screen as I tried to film it.Witnesses: 1. I am self employed and a paranormal investigator.2.Truck Driver 3.Caregiver 4.Student 5.Cook", "Light object hovering and black object suddenly seen steaking across sky daytime in front of white object.Approximately 4:00 pm traveling north on Stampede Dam Rd .I was seated in the right side back seat, I looked to my left at the ridgeline and noticed a white object slowly moving south just slightly above the ridgeline. The object seemed to be going too slow to be an aircraft.  It didn&rsquo;t appear to be a helicopter either because it appeared solid white possibly emitting a white light.  My friend in the front seat said it looked like a cloud that was moving .I had been taking many snapshots of the object with my Cannon power shot 8 mega pixel.  Then I started recording video of the object. I was having trouble keeping the object inside the view finder.  At the end of the video approx.1:16 minutes.  The object disappeared .I uploaded the pictures and video onto my computer the next day.  As I reviewed the video, I noticed a black disc shaped object appear out of nowhere and travel across the screen in an instant and then again.  Only upon pausing the video can the blac! k disc shaped object be clearly seen.", "Green oval shape light in the clouds over Shannon, IrelandI was standing outside the back door at 4:30 am exactly and I was looking in the sky towards Shannon Airport (South West Ireland).  It was cloudy and I saw this oval shape object lighting up the clouds in bright Green shooting through a clear spot for a split second, it was far away but it was still super fast as if it was near me.", "Very large and bright low hanging light in the sky, lasted for about 45 minutes before it dissapeared.It was just after dusk, it was clear and the crescent moon was out as well as other stars.  I was on my way home from the store and my daughter,who is 5yrs. old, said she made a wish on the wishing star. When I looked at the star she was pointing at I noticed that it was not the planet Venus, which was the largest star besides the moon in the sky and in the wrong place, it wasn&apos;t a star at all.  It was just a very large, very bright light hanging low in the sky.  I was driving home about 10 minutes though open fields and in a large valley which you can see the mountains in the distance.  I kept it in view as much as I could, it was very low to the ground and varied in its brightness, but I couldn&apos;t get a good look at the shape.  As I approached our road, I realized that it was hovering somewhere around my house, so I turned in my lane and when I got back to the house it was over the woods directly behind my house. I got my camera and took a few still pics with the! night vision.  I would have taken video but my disc was full.  So I watched it for several more minutes and talked to my husband on the phone outside while watching it and then after we hung up I decided to get back in the car and try to get a better look at it on the next road over, because it was dancing behind the trees.  I took my daughter and we rode to the next road over, but it was gone.  I live in a fly through area and we get lots of planes and aircraft, but nothing like this. It was silent and very bright, much brighter and closer to the ground than a star could ever be. Im not sure what it was. I hope someone else saw it too. Thanks.", "2 Black circles moving in a straight line.As I was walking out of my house I checked the time, it was 7:52pm.  I was taking out the garbage. Once outside I glanced toward the western sky and saw what I first thought was a large black bird(buzzard)gliding through the air on wind/thermal current. As I continued to watch I noticed it was moving in a straight line, no wing flaps, no variation from the southwest to north east direction it was moving.  I realised that it was no bird and thought maybe a ballon. It was a black circle moving in a straight line.I then realised that it could not be a ballon, because there was no deviation in it&apos;s path, i.e. no floating or oscillating movements as baloon would with wind currents. I then quickly went inside to get my binoculars. Back outside I focused on the object.I noticed it was solid black, not reflecting any light at all. Kind of a flat black if you will. It was also a perfect circle! Not egg shaped like most baloons being round at the top and more narrow at the bottom.  Anyways I as watched through the binocs it had nothing attached(i.e.string)no lights, no markings whatsoever. I would guess it was about 2-3k feet up, making no sound at all. The thing that puzzled me so was that it flew in a straight line, never deviating from it&apos;s path. I watched for maybe 3 mins until it flew out of sight in the distance.  It was moving around 25-30 mph. Not very fast at all.Well I go back inside wondering what I had just seen, when I decided go back out to make sure I closed the lid on outside garbage. I still had binocs in hand. While outside I looked back to the area where I first spotted the circle and lo and behold there is a second one exactly like the first moving in the exact same manner and path as well as speed.  I estimate these thing were no more than 2-3 feet wide. I checked the time and it was 7:56pm. I also watched this object through the binocs until it flew out of sight. It looked identical to the first object.I went back inside and checked local weather radar on cable TV. The winds were light 3-5 mph out of the southeast. If it were big ballons they would have been traveling in a straight line against a cross wind! I have no idea what I saw, but I know what they were not(bird,or baloon). The Sun was setting but there was still plenty of daylight.  Weather was clear with light clouds. These black circles stood out very well against the sky. If anyone had been in our area and looked up they would have easily spotted the objects. I know people see alot of things, some explainable, some not. But two perfectly shaped circles, black, travelling in precise straight lines with no deviations in their path is really weird. Again, no sound, no smoke trail,no strings, lights, reflections, markings, nothing. I am a 47yo Operations Manager who lives in Beaufort S.C. We have 2 major airports, Hilton Head, SavannahG.A., as well as the Marine Corp. Air Station, so I see lots of private, commercia! l, as well as military air craft. These objects were truly something I have never seen before.", "Orange teardrop-shape craftMy wife and I had just gotten home from a late walk in southwest Wichita, I was pointing out constellations to her when we both saw a craft approach from the south with no indicator lights like a airplane and no audible engine noise.  It was dark orange that faded to light orange, we first thought it might be a plane on fire but it kept a constant path and speed.  The craft did a 90 degree bank to the east and faded outside the city limits.  I was reluctant to report it until I saw the other report made.", "Circular lights in sky over Fort Leonard Wood, MOI was walking with my girlfriend to my house, when we stopped for a moment.  We both were looking at the night sky, and she pointed to the southwest of us, and that&apos;s when she said &quot;Spaceship!&quot; and we both saw two &quot;flames&quot; (emitting a bright orange-red glow) in a perfect circles, from what looked to us, usual cruising altitude for normal jets, except, at that altitude, they are never that large. They both looked to be about 96 feet wide, and about 128 feet apart.  The one on the left disappeared, in what could be described as a dissolving manner, and the second one did the same about 1 second after. That was the end of that.", "Witnessed with a friend, a large, rectangular object hovering at sundown in Tulsa, Oklahoma.It was about sundown on a March evening in 1989.  I forgot the exact day.  I was riding in my friend&rsquo;s Jeep and we were heading back to his apartment.  We were stopped at a red light at an intersection heading east.  Up in the Southeastern sky, it looked like a jet airliner was on fire heading down toward Earth.  The smoke and fire cleared after a few seconds and revealed a large, rectangle shaped, solid object.  It had dozens of white lights along the side.  I want to say they seemed to be windows, because the light seemed to be coming from inside the object, not mounted on the outside.The object seemed to be about a football field or so long.  It hovered at treetop level at a fifteen degree angle slowly drifting north about a mile away.  It made no sound. Everyone in their cars at the intersection was freaking out.  All of this took place over about a minute or so, maybe less. It had drifted pretty far North by the time the traffic light turned green.  That&apos;s when we saw and heard fighter jets (lights out) screaming toward the object from the far Southern sky.  As we hurried to try to get under it to get a better view, we lost sight of it for a few seconds because of the trees on the left side of the road.  When we got to the next intersection, the jets flew right over us, and we saw the object way down the street.  I could see the back end of it.  I would guess it was about a mile away, moving faster and much higher in the sky now.  We knew we would never catch up with it.  Almost as soon as we saw it, it quickly moved very high in the sky at an unbelievable speed, and it was gone.About an hour later, I went and told my Dad about it, and drew some sketches. We watched the ten o&rsquo;clock news, as they were going to have a story WITH FILM FOOTAGE of an object seen in the sky that night.  The film they showed was taken by a lady that had been at a local nearby restaurant that evening, and it had that restaurant&rsquo;s sign in the foreground.  But what they showed looked like a falling star, nothing more.  No word from the dozens of witnesses that saw what we saw.  No footage of the object hovering a hundred feet or so off the ground, or any of the rest of it.  They said it was a &quot;Russian satellite falling out of its orbit.&quot;   When those things happen, don&apos;t they know about when and where those things will fall?  I&apos;m all the time hearing weathermen saying things like, &quot;Keep an eye in the Western sky tonight to catch a glimpse of blah blah blah..Over the years, I&apos;ve wondered how many other people saw that, and I&apos;ve wanted to compare notes.  I haven&apos;t been able to find anything in any newspaper of TV. archives that even told the story.Since that night, I&apos;ve questioned everything.  I truly believe the government knows much more than we even believe they do.  I hate to sound like one of those conspiracy freaks, but after seeing undisputable proof that we are not alone, it makes me uneasy to not have the whole story.  Anyway, that&apos;s my story, as best as I can remember it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))", "2 starlight objects racing across sky.First night ever in backyard, with a pair of Orion 10x50 binoculars in my hand.  New interest in astronomy, and trying to get somewhat familiar with night sky.  At 60 yrs old, nonetheless. Anyway was in lounge chair lying back, and looked over to my left (NNE), maybe 45-50 degrees from what I perceived to be horizon, and with naked eyes noticed two what I thought were stars.  But they were moving, moving east.  They were keeping the same distance apart, as if they were attached. But I thought they were too far apart to be connected.  I believe they were at least my fist-width apart at arms-length.  I watched for a few more seconds, to verify they were in fact moving.  Then looked through my binoculars at the objects.  But the magnification didnt seem to do anything more as far as figuring out what they were. I thought the binoculars would reveal airplane lights blinking, or colors, or something.  But - nothing more than my eyes did, though I suspect they were a bit larger through the binoculars.  They just looked like white stars to me.  As I watched them disappear in the east, over treetops, they seemed to be going faster, and were now twinkling, like stars. ! I figured this was some atmospheric thing playing tricks on my eyes.  The closer one disappeared first, then the lead one turned to a blur before disappearing above the trees.  Never any sound, but again I thought they were stars, so didn&apos;t expect any noise.", "blue orb and dream  I was watching TV with some friends at the time.  We cant smoke in his house so 3 of us went outside on the porch to smoke.  They were facing east and only I was facing west south west and I looked up and seen it.

Then I woke up abruptly so scared and rememberd so vividly and felling a scratching feeling on my side on the left just above the hip and seen a pale white line but after scratching was gone !  scared the shit out of me was scared shitless.... i fest!

We live by the beach in Portobello Edinburgh.  The sea is visible at the foot of our street and we could both see a large black featureless rectangle about three quarters of a mile out to sea.  The weather was clear, calm and visibility was perfect.I&rsquo;m always observing ships and am reasonably familiar with most the ships that frequent the Forth.I couldn&rsquo;t make out any superstructure.  No masts, funnels, sails..anything.  No markings.  I don&rsquo;t have the best eyesight so I asked my daughter if she could make out any details.  She could not.I went upstairs to get my binoculars and to check out www.marine-traffic.com and to see if I could still see the object from my sitting room window.  I couldn&rsquo;t.I checked Marine Traffic and there was one ship displayed which was a great deal further out and it looked nothing like what we had seen.I took the binoculars down stairs and went to the beach.  The object had gone. The ship recorded on Marine Traffic was half as far away again as the object, but was easily distinguished as it was red and we could make out superstructures even from that distance, even without binoculars.I would estimate I was no more than 10 minutes maximum upstairs.  Such is the range of view from the beach, a motorboat would have had difficulty in disappearing out of sight in that length of time.I asked some people on the beach if they had noticed anything; they had not.I&rsquo;m reporting this simply because it was, by definition &lsquo;unidentified&rsquo; and it may help should someone else report the event.((NUFORC Note:  We have requested clarification from the witness as to the time of the sighting, which was not indicated in the original report.

Then about two or three minutes later we heard jets outside. We ran outside to see if we could see anything. We couldn&apos;t see any jets.At 11:00pm I look to my left and saw a single solid light stayed there for 2 or 3 seconds, and faded out.About ten seconds later we saw three lights, but middle light had other 3 lights surrounding it.

I didn&rsquo;t pay much attention as I thought it to be a neon sign on the Bank of America building across the street.  I rolled over and attempted to sleep when the light again flickered through the curtains.  I still ignored it, and again with even more intensity the light flickered through the curtains.I reluctantly got up and moved the curtains so I could see where the light was coming from.  I looked up at the top of the Bank of America building of about 20 stories high and the neon sign was not flickering.  I was closing the curtains when I noticed what I thought was a police helicopter surrounded by bright lights. Spot lights were coming from the base and shining in various spots in the parking lot.  My first thought was that it was some kind of drug bust and the helicopter would be landing with a swat team.  However, the craft did not land, but stayed hovering high in the dark night.  Now it had definitely got my attention.As I focused on it, I made out the shape to be a cube, definitely three dimensional.  I couldn&rsquo;t make out any substance such as steel.  It was a cube of light, swirling bright light on a three dimensional cube.  I was still trying to rationalize what it could be.  I then remembered seeing special shape hot air balloons in Albuquerque which lit up at night in similar fashion.  &quot;That&rsquo;s what is must be,&quot; I told myself.  Then something even stranger happened.  I heard musical tones similar to wind chimes or ancient flutes that we often hear in Greek mythology type movies.  But the sounds were coming from inside my head even though it felt I was hearing them with my ears.I became afraid and did not move for about 20 minutes while I continued to watch.  I finally said to myself, &quot;What ever it is knows I am here, and I cannot hide from it.&quot;  I immediately dressed and walked outside.  I stayed underneath the 2nd floor overhang and peered out to see above.  It was even more magnificent when viewing through the night air although it was hard to focus on, somewhat blurred.  At that moment I was surrounded by an orchestra of musical tones again sounding like ancient flutes or pipes.  I thought to myself, how beautiful!  The song was child like, something you might hear a children&rsquo;s nursery.  Again, I heard the music in my head and outside, but not in our natural way of hearing, hard to explain . . .To make a long story short, I packed my bags and was running to my SUV when an early morning garbage truck and driver stopped in the alley next to my car. I looked at the driver in the eyes and signaled to look up with my eyes.  I turned and ran with luggage in tow, got in my car and drove two hours to my home in Lubbock.  I drove to my sister&rsquo;s office where my mother happened to be and told both of them what I witnessed.  By the look on their faces they were fearful for me.  I phoned a friend of mine who happens to be a deputy sheriff in Amarillo to ask if anyone had phoned in such a sighting in the early morning dark.  He laughed hysterically and said no, but would let me know if anyone did.  He did not call back.  I&rsquo;ve since moved to Phoenix and have told only a handful of people what I witnessed that early morning on June 20, 2005, five years ago.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report elects to remain anonymous.

I noticed a white light coming over the visual horizon and heading in my direction.  It took approximately 1 or 2 minutes for the craft to come into closer view and stopped over our complex.  It was shaped like a &quot;top&quot; and had spot lights around the entire circumference of the craft.  The lights were like spot-lights and fanned the ground.  It sounded like a turbine engine and rumbled the building.  My brother was next to me but not at the window.  He heard the sound, but when prompted to come look, he refused and waiting to long before attempting to look and missed it.  I went down to my mom and told her what I seen.  She said she heard it but it was a jet.  She didn&apos;t believe me and neither did my brother.The following morning, I discussed the event with a neighbor friend who also verified him and his parents seen the same thing.  Humoring me, my mom called the airforce and asked if anyone else had reported anything.  They said no.Granted, I was young and only in 3rd grade.  But as a boy, I know what a jet looks like.  I know what a helicopter looks like.  This vehicle had no wings and no props. and yet it sounded like a jet.

The circle just appeared and moved a short distance across the sky, south to north, was still for just a moment and then vanished, as if it had been erased.  It was not moving as fast as a meteor would, but it was moving.From my perspective, the bright neon green circle was a few inches above the houses and moved from left to right a few inches, like two inches.This object did not have the same characteristics as a meteor.  It did not have a tail, nor did it shoot high across the sky and fade away.  Meteors are fairly easy to track because they consume more distance in the sky than this object.  As low as this object was, and that it was headed across the sky instead of a falling or having had an arc flight pattern, like meteors do, it could not have possibly come from the atmosphere.", "Bright white light flying over wilmore KentuckyThe light came into view in a descending patern as if it were a plane about to land, but silent, alot brighter than a normal plane and no airports were nearby.

This aircraft was larger than any plane I have ever seen and was flying low and did not make any sound.

I was very excited and the feeling I had was one of pure elation.The object moved silently towards the south and downtown area of Austin and then seemed to accelerate and was out of sight within a fraction of a second.The next day on the local rock radio station KLBJ, they announced that if anyone had seen anything unusual the night before it was because the Air Force was testing something.I later became a weather technician for the Texas Air Guard and even though I was already familiar with most military craft I became an expert at recognizing all atmospheric phenomena and different types of aircraft as was required by my job.I do not believe nor have I ever believed that this huge, silent golden triangle was of a terran origin. I have only found one other witness online to this event who saw it 30 miles to the north of Austin and he stated that he saw several small shapes flying around the triangle as it headed south towards the Austin area.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))", "bright wierd fast motionsWoke up to bright light out of window towards north over ridge about midnight.looked like a welding torch light going up and down and in circles near the ridge north of me.Wierd motions uncapapble of helicopter or plane.the went down over ridge out of sight,lasted 5 minutes very bright.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))", "Around 12 red lights moving in loose formation over State College, PA.I was exiting the grocery store when I saw people pointing upwards and shouting. As I walked further into the parking lot and looked up there were about 12 red lights in the sky. For size perspective they looked rather like low flying aircraft lights, but there was only one light per object and the light was all I could see of the object. The lights were grouped roughly in a V formation.At first I thought that there were two irregularly shaped disks leading the formation but as objects raised and lowered in altitude as they moved south it became clear that the fairly low (but light) cloud cover meant that as objects raised above the cloud cover the light from the object reflected down below as a dark disk shape through the cloud.The objects were moving fairly slow and not as steady as I have seen most aircraft fly (more of a bobbing motion). They were moving not in unison but definitely as a group of some sort. I did not get a firm count because I would loose/see more as they changed altitude. This took place in an urban area and I lost sight as the objects moved out of my line of sight into the tree line/buildings. About another 10 or so people witnessed this in the parking lot that I was in. There is a National Guard unit stationed ~15 miles away, and there are several small airports, but none that I know of that would be doing any kind of experimental aircraft work, etc.", "three lights over Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin at around 21:55I went outside to get my cellphone, which I had left in my car.  The first thing I noticed was a small dog across the street that was barking excessively.  Up in the sky I saw odd lights hovering. There were two sets of red and blue lights with a large conical spot light in between. I could not make out the shape of an object around the lights in the dark.  I stared in silence and then it began to creep forward slowly. At that point I ran to my car, grabbed my phone, and called a friend. After I quickly explained it to her I ran to the door of my house and called for my stepdad to come outside being he was the only one awake, losing sight of the object for less than 10 seconds. It was moving a steady pace but seemed extremely slow in comparison to how low the object was in the sky. It also made no noise. It had the motion of a helicopter following a high speed car chase but the lights seem much too far apart to resemble a helicopter, and again it made no sound! .  My stepdad came out,  watched it for maybe 15 seconds, dismissed it as an airplane and went inside.  At that point it was a little past our house and I was losing sight of it so I jumped up on the roof of my car and watched until it disappeared into the tree line.", "My wife and I independently and in two locations saw similar unexplained lights at about the same timeLast night sometime between 23:00 and 0:00 on 6/11/10 I went upstairs and just happened to see two yellow lights that appeared to be stationary on Duncan road near our horse pasture.  I thought someone was messing with the horses so I ran downstairs and grabbed a powerful flashlight and went outside and pointed the light down Duncan road.  Nothing was there, there was no sound, absolutely nothing was visible or could be heard. I scanned the flashlight beam all around and the horses were resting and did not appear disturbed.  I forgot about it.  Shortly after that I heard a crash on the porch and a chair with cat food on it was turned over with no sign of an animal.  This could have been a raccoon or something.  My wife works late and got home about 00:30 after midnight and I told her about the chair, but did not mention the lights.Today on 6/12 my wife and I were coming home from eating lunch and she mentioned she saw four lights red and yellow on Mile Creek road where Love Care road intersects.  This is no more than a mile from our house. She said the lights moved rapidly off to one side and were gone.  She thought it was someone with a trailer in a nearby house, but when she passed nothing was there.  We decided her sighting and mine were very coincidental and unusual and may be worth reporting", "Black object floating around airplane.I was on a bus nearing Harlem Ave and Summerdale Ave and was looking eastward at planes landing. In that area the planes come in over Harlem somewhat low.  I noticed a black spot, which I initially thought was a bird, following along side and behind a plane and then swoop around to the front of the plane. It then followed along side and then drifted away from the plane.  I kept watching the spot move around a small patch of sky.  Its movement reminded me of a boat on water.  I say the shape was oval shaped in general, but at times appeared to be almost like a figure eight.  As the bus approached Higgins Rd I lost sight of the shape.", "Orb and 6 Jet Fighters SpottedAround 11:00 P.M. I was taking out the trash and I spotted many of what appeared to be Jet Fighters, at least 3 or 4, over the course of about 10 minutes.  I continually watched the sky, but it got cloudy. I eventually saw a blinding white spherical light appear in front of me.  It was blindingly white but didn&apos;t hurt to see, and it appeared to travel almost instantaneously; it appeared to travel in spurts of Energy, though continuous it had more energy let out at certain times.  The light behind it almost had many clouds of light jetted from it in the opposite direction of its motion.Also, I noticed over this time 2 more Jet Fighters flying over my head before my vision was obscured by clouds, and this I feel was may not have been coincidence.  The real question remains of why 5-6 Jet Fighters were flying over a small town I will not disclose in this paragraph.", "Triangle type craf with lights over MilfordWe were on our way back from dinner.  As we drove down our street there was a craft banking towards us as it moved left.  It was triangular shaped with blue lights on the back that almost looked like afterburners. It had red light on the side.  At first i thought it was just a low flying plane from the neerby airport but I have a pilots license and i know planes.  I can tell you that that was NOT a plane. When we arrived home i turned on the police scanner and there were 7 calls of house alarms going off all at once.  I believe that the craft caused it.", "36 bright objects flying across the sky in a short amount of timeAt first site I thought someone had lost a mylar balloon but upon closer inspection it was decided the item was too large and moving in a manner not consistent with a balloon.  While watching, we started to see one after the other traveling from west to east in the southern sky at about a 45 degree angle from where the moon was in the evening sky.  A very few were seen flying from east to west.  Those that were, were closer and almost looked like airplanes.  They were very bright.  We thought perhaps it was the sun reflecting off of planes however the closest airport is smaller and does not accommodate a large number of planes.  We started counting the objects and saw approximately 36 items.  When we had gotten to about 30 we saw a jet stream in the sky above one of the items.  You could see the stream but not the jet itself leading us to believe that the objects were possibly something other than standard airplanes.  A couple were closer than others and emi! tted a bright white light.  It was close to dusk so we thought it possibly reflection of the sun.It was just very odd to see such a large number of items even if they were just planes.  We could not determine that so to us they were UFO&rsquo;s.", "Huge Rectangular Craft  With LightsTraveling at a High Rate of SpeedOn 18 May at approximately 12:30 PM, I saw a very large object in the sky moving very quickly across the sky.  The shape of the object was rectangular and it had lights around the perimeter.  It looked like a flying building.  I was traveling down a state highway in the east central town of Hephzibah, Georgia.  This is a four-lane highway with a median and cars travel very fast on this road.  As I saw the object in the sky, other drivers saw it as well and started braking and pointing at the object.  I witnessed the object for less than a minute when it rapidly accelerated and disappeared from view in about 3 seconds.  It was clearly visible; there were few clouds in the sky.  It looked nothing like a plane or a balloon or a helicopter or any other terrestrial flying object.", "i was ridind to work. i seen a grate sun rise so took a photo. when got to work and look at the photo i seen a blue dot in the photo top left hand corner", "Bright Zig-Zagging Light over Des Moines, 6/24/10So, I&apos;m standing on my back Deck in the town of Waukee, Iowa [6/24/2010, APRX 9:15 OR 10:15 PM CST] waiting for my dog to pee so I could take her back in and go to bed.Explanation of the time discrepancy: I vaguely remember looking at a clock after this sighting and THOUGHT it said 9:15, but realized the next day that the sun hadn&rsquo;t fully set by 9:15 on that day and I remember it being dark, because despite the ambient light of the city to the east of my house, I could clearly see stars. This leads me to believe that it was really 10:15 and I had misread the clock the night before.Anyway, on 6/24/2010, as I look up, I glance to the west south west I see a very bright white light moving in a easterly direction (toward me, toward Des Moines proper). The brightness is what caught my eye.It was traveling (as near as I can figure) in a straight line toward the east, perhaps east, north east. No green/red aircraft lights as one would see on an airliner. In fact I saw a jet liner flying to the east far above this object.I am not good at estimating altitude but it, and as such I have a hard time telling you how big this thing was. But the jet liner moving east above this thing looked to be more than twice as high, that&apos;s the impression I got anyway.So I figured, it&apos;s an airplane with its landing lights on and the landing lights are washing out the red/green strobes so that I can&apos;t see them. But as the thing keeps moving east, the light doesn&apos;t die out at all.If it were an aircraft landing light, it would be directional. You might see it very brightly as the aircraft was moving toward you but it would become more difficult to see as the plane moved over and started moving away from you.The thing moved over where I was standing, perhaps to the south of my position a little bit but clearly over the city of Des Moines, then it kept moving at the same rate of speed BUT it began moving (or at least the light did) in a slightly, nearly unnoticeable zig-zag manner.Mind you, I can see nothing but the bright white light. I see no craft/structure, no wings, nothing but the light. And the light continues off in an easterly direction until I lose sight of it behind the roofline of the other houses behind mine. It moved in a straight tack and for about 15 seconds, in a slightly zig-zag manner but it stayed at a steady speed. It wasn&apos;t very fast at all. The jet liner above it overtook it easily.It made no noise that I could hear but it might have been too far away and it appeared to be illuminated all the way around. In other words, the light stayed bright, no matter the angle at which I viewed the thing.I doubt it was a helicopter because if it was it seemed too high (although I have a hard time judging altitude) and even if it was a helicopter, what&apos;s with the 360 degree illumination effect? Even those super bright spotlights on helicopters are directional.I tried taking a picture of it, but my crappy cell phone camera is all I had close and all you could see was a blurry white spot on a black background, it didn&apos;t tell the story at all and I deleted it out of frustration (sorry). By the time I could have gone in and gotten my good camera, come out, set it up and get the shot, the thing would have been gone.So, whatever this thing was, I remember thinking that the airliner flying above might not have been able to see it because of the illumination from the city below, but who knows? If the airliner did see it, he didn&apos;t alter his course or anything so it must not have concerned him. But the thing was very bright, in comparison to the stars (and the night was very clear), it was easily noticeable at first glance.All told, it crossed the sky (from rooftops to the west to roofline in the east) in about 90-120 seconds. I remember distinctly thinking that whatever I was seeing wasn&apos;t normal so I made a point to watch it intently (another reason I didn&apos;t go for the good camera). It was right after I made this decision that it started to zig-zag (again, ever-so slightly) and I remember wondering just what exactly I was seeing. The zig-zag was just enough to be noticeable but slight enough to make me wonder if I was perhaps seeing things correctly.Now I am rationalizing and explaining it away as any number of plausible explanations. But the fact that it was #1 so bright #2 had no red/greens #3 moving relatively slowly compared with the air traffic above it #4 IT ZIG ZAGGED. I&apos;m baffled and my logic tells me that it could not have zig-zagged, but I KNOW I saw the thing zig-zag!  So tell me I&apos;m not crazy! Explain this thing to me. I know what it was not...It wasn&apos;t a balloon (too fast, steady speed, night, over a metro area close to an airport). I know it wasn&apos;t the space station, a meteor or a satellite...a jet liner flew OVER it. The jet-liner above it was further to the south than the light, but from my angle I watched as the airplane disappeared briefly behind this light then reappeared as the plane outpaced the light.I seriously doubt that it was a helicopter. I was a flight medic for some years and I know rotor-craft, especially the commonly seen rotor-craft in this area. The flight path didn&apos;t make sense (for a medical helicopter anyway). It came from out of town and bypassed all hospitals and went back out of town to the east.Maybe it was military, but our Air Guard base is south of where this thing flew...it wasn&apos;t on approach to DSM International, it was WAY too far north, its course did not change and it didn&rsquo;t appear to change altitude at all (again difficult to judge &amp; be certain). It certainly didn&apos;t just take off from DSM either.  I suppose it could have been like a private plane/jet or even a military jet, but I could hear NOTHING and what&apos;s with the light?  Let alone the ZIG ZAGGING!!!???  Once the light disappeared over the roofline to the east and I could no longer see it, I brought the dog back in and went to bed.  I had completely forgotten about seeing the light until the following evening and I shared this report on an online forum where someone suggested that I report the event to you.", "Pulsating Light Alternating Between White and Blue Varying BrightnessApproximately 10 PM, looking north from my house towards the intersection of US 41 and SR 52, there was an object traveling in loops getting closer to the ground.  The object eventually disappeared behind a group of trees the shot back up at a high rate of speed only to loop downward 3 or 4 more times before disappearing for good.The object was brightly lit and varied in intensity.

I tried to focus and get a better look but the light was so bright and powerful it hurt my eyes to look at. I couldn&apos;t focus on this object as hard I tried.  I was outside of my house and I called 6 other family members to oberserve it and they all agreed it wasn&apos;t a star but a unknown object.  I stayed outside to observe the object to see if it would move or change but it didn&apos;t move at all and I tried to take a picture of it but it was too far away to capture a good picture of it.  I have a picture of the light but it is small.   As I stood out observing the object other people came out of their houses and I could hear people talking about the object in the sky. I also called a family member driving towards the house! and they could also see it.  The object slowly started to move down and it seemed to get closer.   As it seemed to get closer maybe within 2 miles it looked like it was pulsating light coming from it.  I started to worry and I went into my house.  When I went into my house I heard airplanes and helicopters flying by my house which is uncharacteristic of this time of night or even flying in my are.  An hour later I went out to see what it was and it was gone.  I would say this is the most eerie thing I have observed in the night sky in my life.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  Venus?

THE SKY WAS CLOUDLESS AND DEEP BLUE, WITH A STEADY 8-10 MPH WIND FROM THE SOUTH.  I HAD JUST SET UP CAMP AND WAS GETTING ORGANIZED WHILE I WAITED FOR MY WIFE AND SON TO JOIN ME FROM GLEN BURNIE, MD.  I NOTICED SOME COLORFUL KITES ALOFT IN NEIGHBORING CAMP LOOPS AND WATCHED THEM FOR A WHILE.  I GLANCED OUT TO THE DUNES FACING EAST LISTENING TO THE CONSTANT CRASH OF THE WAVES, WHEN I NOTICED THE OBJECT IN THE NE SKY, OUT OVER THE SHORELINE.  MY FIRST IMPRESSION WAS THAT SOMEONE WAS FLYING A KITE ON THE BEACH, BUT THAT THOUGHT QUICKLY ENDED WHEN I SENSED THE OBJECT MOVING SLOWLY SOUTHWARD, AGAINST THE WIND.  I GRABBED MY WW2 7X50 FIELD GLASSES FROM THE TRUCK AND EXAMINED THE OBJECT NOTING IMMEDIATELY THAT IT WAS SLIGHTLY CURVED WITH BOTH ENDS FACING THE ATLANTIC.  IT REMINDED ME OF A DARK GRAY CRAYON WITH A BLUNT END. AT THIS TIME I BECAME AWARE THAT THE THING BECAME STRAIGHT LOOKING EXACTLY L!

WOW, THAT&rsquo;S ALL FOLKS.", "Strange aircraft again over southern Rhode IslandWhile resting at East Beach in Charlestown, RI, at the above date and time, enjoying a beautiful clear blue sky and warm sun, I noticed a twin engine plane, with rows of windows on each side, and having pods at the wing tips (fuel?), white in color, flying a continuous loop over the beach, circling, slowly, then going away to the west, but coming right back.  I thought this continuous pattern of low flying, low level observation, was odd, especially after the fourth time of it flying right over me.  The beach was almost unpopulated, it being a Monday, and it being a very long 3 mile stretch of beach, and I was down about a quarter mile, away from most people at the entrance.  So, there were about fifty people on the beach but all but me and three other people were at the entrance.  I had my binoculars with me, so I decided to get a close up of the plane as it kept flying directly over me in its circling.  I first noticed no FAA identifying markings of any ki! nd on it...no numbers or letters, etc. I saw only one small blinking red light at the tip of the rear &apos;fin&apos; (aeleron?), and then I noticed a conspicuous large dark spot, like an oval camera lens, on the underside of the fuselage behind the wings.  I then thought this was some kind of secret government plane taking photos.  The plane continued its pattern of circling over the beach where I was, so I decided to leave and head for my trunk in the parking lot.  The plane made another pass, this time right over me in the parking lot, whereupon I took out my binoculars again to get another close look....while looking at the bottom of the &apos;plane&apos; I was shocked to see a quick flash of green light, very bright, come from what I thought previously was a camera lens!  This quick flash of green light was directed toward me, as if they were letting me know that they saw me, and maybe even were reading my thoughts.  It freaked me out, as I said, &apos;oh my God.&apos;  It was so unnatural a thing ! that it did.  This  was no ordinary plane by any means, but a ! craft ma squerading as a twin engine plane, but having a whole different propulsion and technology, as in the green light underneath.  There were no wing tip lights or any thing which I thought should be on a registered FAA plane.  It made a sound very similar to a prop plane, but different.  The windows were all blacked out, including the cockpit windows.  I then left in my truck and drove to Walmart about 5 miles away.  After shopping for a half hour I decided to go back to the beach parking lot to see if the &apos;plane&apos; was still there in its same circling pattern, and it was!  It flew a couple hundred feet above the shoreline, then circled over the salt pond in back of the beach, headed West again, and then repeated this pattern, over and over...nothing normal about it.  This is just one more strange aircraft sighting in this area.  My belief is that aliens are masquerading their craft as jets, passenger jets, and small prop/commuter planes like this one.  The strange &apos;camera&apos; spot/l! ens that flashed bright green at me while I was looking at it through the binoculars was the strangest event, and a bit intimidating...maybe that was &apos;their&apos; intent.  Something very strange in going on in southern Rhode Island...very strange.  By the way, the flashing green light did not emit a beam that I could see.", "UFO PicturesI was young and had a camera. I was in my parents yard. When I looked up I noticed this crazy shape flying in the sky.  So I took a few photos.  After that I don&apos;t remember much. I&apos;m not saying I was taken or anything.  I think it was because I was young.  All I remember after the picture was saying, &quot;Damn, it&apos;s gone&quot;.  Today I was looking through some old boxes and came across one with photos.

I positioned myself in the shade of the roof line to mask the sun from my shots.I downloaded the pictures, from my camera to my computer, late in the afternoon to see if I was successful in capturing the colorful effects of the sun.  As I visually scanned the pictures, I noticed several outstanding white circular blots which appeared at several locations in each of the pictures.  Some were relatively close to others, some were larger and more prevalent than others, but all except one, were, by my estimation, at an extreme distance in the sky.  I counted no less than eight objects on one of the three pictures I took and found there to be two to three objects on the second photo and five, maybe more on the other.One image appears very much larger or closer and lower than the rest:  it is spherical in shape and has what appears to be a dark belt (almost like a wind shield) wrapping horizontally around the mid-section of the sphere.  I cannot describe this image in better detail, because it is out of focus.  I thought, at first, that I might have captured a portion of my old TV antenna array, but I can&apos;t visualize this, even if it is out of focus.  And the antenna is farther to the left of where I took these pictures. In trying to give this object some size or distance perspective with the surroundings in the picture, I note it is at the bottom of the picture, just above the roof line and almost gives the appearance of a head-on frontal aspect of a jetliner, but there are no wings, rudder, or elevators in view.  Additionally, I saw no aircraft while I was taking these pictures, though the Providence airport is in the direction of my photos.I checked the other two photos to see if the same images appeared, or if they were at the same relative locations on each picture, thinking perhaps my lens might be dirty, and if so, the spots would be observable on them too, but this was not the case. I thought for a moment, that I might be seeing some very bright stars as an anomally, but ruled this out as these sightings are so close to the sun.I cannot tell whether these objects had any relative motion, or how long they may have been observable since I didn&apos;t even notice them when I took the pictures.  I am however, baffled by what I have captured on these photos.", "Extremely bright orange ring with yellow, fiery center seen over Southern IndianaObject was a bright orange ring with what looked like fire in the center that was bright yellow.

As I was walking towards my front door I noticed something moving in the sky.  At first I thought it might have been a meteorite because my initial glance of the object was a fast streak of white light across the sky and then it faded out to black.  I then, noticed, that the object reappeared as bright as it was before.  It was like nothing I have ever seen.  The way it turned, the speed at which it accelerated, and the fact that it was completely soundless was all the proof I needed to assume it was not man-made!  I have been around military Aircraft my whole life, and this was NOT one of ours!  I stared at it for about ten minutes before it slowly disintegrated.

It was hovering over the water I would say about 15-20,000ft in the air at the Port Whitby Boat Marina in Ontario, Canada.  Right around that area.  As the green glowing object started moving I knew it was time to test the camera out on my phone. As I take out my phone and get the camera ready to start taking a couple of pictures.  My girlfriend and I are stunned by what we are observing.  The object is idle in one spot, then in a split second must have travelled a couple of miles in the sky to the left.  Then stops for a split second again and then goes back in another split second to the right then once again stops for a split second then again another split second later back to the left when it stops in less then a second again then in speed that I have never seen before not even from fighter jets shoots off to the right into the sky and disappears.  I had managed to be able to take 2 pictures on my phone during this event of the ! object moving back and forth. I know for certainty there is NO aircraf t in the world that can perform such maneuvers and can have speed like that and be able to stop on a dime and again accelerate to incredible speed in what seemed like just a couple of miles.

They were about the same brightness as the brightest stars in the sky. They looked like satellites but were moving much faster, say 10x faster. The two lights moved in a perfectly straight line across the sky, but were paired up with each other, and swapped relative positions with each other several times, one behind the other, then rotating to side by side, then back to front-and back, a few different times, randomly. The lights were a constant brightness, no blinking or wavering, they did not leave a trail. There was no sound at all.The whole incident was over in perhaps 3 seconds. I stood up in the spa and pointed out the lights to my son but he didn&apos;t stand up and look in time to see anything.We go in the spa every night and look at the stars.

When I got in my car and pulled out of the drive way, I saw this  bright star-like object hovering high above the clouds.  I was so blown away by its beauty, that I kept staring at it in amazement.  I just knew that it wasn&apos;t Venus or a any kind of planet or star.  As I kept driving the road, the object disappeared and I could not find it.  By the time I reached the end of the road to make a right turn at the corner, I saw it again, but this time it was lower and much farther away in distance.  It also appeared brighter than before.  I just held the brakes and stared at it for a brief moment before making a right turn.  As I drove in the other direction, I came to a stoplight.  When I stopped, I looked at my left and I saw the object moving in my direction, as if it were following me.  I don&apos;t know why I did what I did after this, but I guess it was a test to see if it was really following me or if it was truly in the Earth&apos;s atmosphere.  The creepiest, yet most amazing thing happened after this.  I drove down the road and made a left turn.  I wanted to get closer and get a better look.  I did not see it in the sky when I checked. Instead, the bright light came down and suddenly appeared above some trees on the right of the road and slowly moved across the street.  It started getting really close to me.  It was so close to my car in both length and height that I could see its spherical shape.  I put my car in park and watched it hover right above me. I didn&apos;t hear any sounds coming from it.  Then, suddenly, the white sphere of light vanished. As I drove away, it appeared once again high in the sky, but in a different position.

I looked up to the point of that sound and saw four chemtrails, very obvious and very high in the sky, all close together, as if from one plane with four jet engines.  Through my binoculars I saw, rather, four tiny objects extremely close to one another producing these enormous chemtrails.  The objects, of what I can say were chevron shaped, and silver, traveled at a faster pace than an airliner, heading SW, and at an altitude,  I would guess, of 15 to 20 thousand feet.   What struck me as very odd was the precision of these four small craft and the much larger chemtrails they produced.  They were so precise in there close proximity to one another and produced identical chemtrails that it appeared to be one object, like the four engined jet that I first thought it was.  However, I did see through the binoculars that they were four distinct objects.

This was at approximately 20:50 EST.  The object appeared to be just a very bright star at first-- which was what caught our attention.  It was later determined to be moving, however, after a closer study.~A few points to supplement this assertion are: 1) object was eclipsed momentarily by tree limbs at several points and but would always return to open sky, as perceived from our position in front of my house.2) it flickered as it moved back and forth along the horizon and in circular or arc-shaped, sweeping motions to and fro.3) the object&apos;s light would dim after it reached the peak of its arc-maneuver and hence begin to move in the opposite direction, and would brighten considerably when facing us. the path of the light&apos;s beam could be seen when facing from side to side.4) once in awhile, the light would juke every which way and at odd combinations of sharp angles, in short bursts of incredible speed.~It at first seemed to be hovering over one point but we found the object to be maneuvering away from our position, as it eventually disappeared over the horizon. We were both compelled by strange, anxious feelings for the duration of the sighting.~ We repeatedly had to back up to keep the object in our view and actually had to move to my second-story balcony for the last ten minutes of the event, as if hypnotized to stare at this weird light until it could no longer be viewed. This was at approximately 21:19.~ I attempted to signal the object with a MAG-light-- in numeric combinations of numbers counting down from three-- but to no avail.  At one point, I attempted to use the 75-watt bulbs in the balcony lights as well. But still, the object retreated.~I judged the object to be three miles away at first and it was gone forty minutes later, still moving  in the direction of the Delaware Water Gap.

I paid more attention when I saw them fly horizontally and go vertical, one chasing the other.  They were moving so fast I thought they were spot lights or my imagination. I went back in my work and came back out 15 min later for another smoke and to leave when I looked over and the 2 lights were still chasing each other but where a lot closer.  I stood there and I saw 2 bright spheres flying at really high speeds all over the sky.  This continued for another 15 min when they started to slow down.  I wasn&rsquo;t going to report this until I saw 5 more spheres appear, like they where there the whole time but didn&rsquo;t have lights on.  Six formed a V formation and one was to the north of the V but behind the leader of the V.  They flew off at extremely high speeds to the northeast until I couldn&rsquo;t see them anymore.  The date and time of the sighting was 04/26/10 at 23:45 to 04/27/10 at 0:15.", "Orange object seen moving across night sky.  Did not have a trail, nor did it fragment, explode, or change sizeOn Friday 28MAY2010, a friend and I were visiting a third friend at his house in Green Bay.  The residence is located just southeast of St. Vincent Hospital  (The hospital is visible from the backyard).  This residence is on the east side of Green Bay, approximately 3 miles north of WI-172, and 3-4 miles east of the Fox River (Distances are rough estimates!)   At approximately 10:10 PM, the three of us were sitting on the back deck of the house.  I was sitting on a bench at the edge of the deck and right next to the house, facing north-northwest.  Friend #1 was sitting directly to my left, facing due North.   Friend #2 was sitting on a picnic table in the middle of the deck facing us.  As we were talking, Friend #1 happened to look up in roughly northeastern direction and see something in the sky.He remarked &quot;Is that an airplane?  That&apos;s not an airplane!&quot;.   At this point, I cannot remember if he indicated the direction the object was traveling.  I could not see the object from where I was sitting because the house blocked my view.  I instinctively turned to my left and looked upward over my shoulder, where I was able to view a patch of sky not obscured by the house or the stand of trees at the edge of the property.  I managed to see the object as it moved.I saw what appeared to be an orange &quot;fire-colored&quot; object, very roughly circular, but nebulous in appearance, moving across the sky at a rapid clip. It was about as large as the thumbnail on a man&apos;s pinky finger, if held at arms length.  There was no trail or halo around this object, nor did it change size as it moved.Once the object was obscured by trees, I dashed for the west end of the yard, where the line of trees ended (about 15-20 feet past the end of the deck).  The object again entered my field of view.  Its characteristics had not changed in the few seconds where I moved my position.  The object continued on a straight-line course from east-northeast to west-southwest.  It did not change speed.  It did not appear to change altitude.  The object did not change color or size either.  Everything remained constant until it appeared to fade just before it left our available field of vision.  One characteristic of the object that struck me is that the center appeared darkened somewhat compared to the outer edges.  When the object disappeared, it did not flash, &quot;blink&quot; or explode, it just faded in about a half-second.The sky was clear that night. Despite there being a large volume of commerical air traffic in Green Bay, there was no air traffic sighted other than the emergency medevac helicopter that periodically flew in to land at the nearby hospital. I do not think the flight path of incoming planes intersects with the helicopter&apos;s usual flight pattern. This helicopter was not in the area during the sighting.As my friends and I discussed this object, we were of the initial opinion that it was some type of celestial body which entered and then exited the atmosphere.  However the absence of a trail, and the constant shape/size of the object are disconcerting when considering this theory.  Growing up in the country, I have seen my share of &quot;Shooting stars&quot;, meteorites, orbiting satellites, and what have you.  Most meteors I&apos;ve seen actually moved FASTER that the object in question.  The absence of trail is not all that unusual, but a meteor travelling at what appeared to be quite an oblique angle, visible for 30+ seconds, would seem to be large enough to expect to see a trail behind it.The entire event lasted about one minute, or one minute 30 seconds, from the time my friend spotted the object to the time it disappeared.Due to my uncertainty about what I saw, I am submitting this report with hopes that:  1) it can be compared to any similar reports submitted from 5/28/2010 or otherwise from Brown County/Green Bay  2) The experts at NUFORC can indicate the likelihood that this was indeed a meteorite or similar (re-entering satellite?) and NOT a UFO  Thank you for your accepting this report", "1 red fireball and then 5 more at the same time, moved towards us-stopped-then disappearedMy niece looked up to the sky to see what a first she told everyone that it was a shooting star - when all of the sdults looked up we saw a bright red circular object that was moving throught the sky.  It appeared to have a white tail moving behind it.  It was moving fast.  We had no clue what we were seeing and called a local news station who did not believe our story.  Fifteen minutes had past an in another direction we saw 5 of the same fireball moving in the opposite direction.  They were much slower.  They came towards our direction, stopped momentarialy and then continued to moved and eventually all of them dissapeared at different times.  we were also able to catch it on video tape.", "object with one flashing white light flying very erratically moves impossibly fast in impossible fashionThis is the second report that I&rsquo;ve filed this week, though I&rsquo;ve received no response to my first sighting report. I&rsquo;m curious to know if my first report was classified a hoax or a joke, and that&rsquo;s why it is being ignored. I mean I have far better things to do with my time than make stuff up. I read somewhere during the extensive research I&rsquo;ve conducted over the last year and a half, that a witness is more likely to be credible if he or she only ever files a single report; though credibility sharply decreases the more reports someone files.  The reason given is that UFO sightings are so statistically rare that it is highly unlikely a witness will ever have more than one UFO sighting or experience.  I can&rsquo;t say for sure about anyone else, but I know that in my case that for some reason the tiny patch of sky visible from my house, as well as once at my friends house and twice at my job last year, has been teeming with highly unusual activity.  Last night that act! ivity continued. I was outside over by my car that I share with my grandmother; whom I also take care of, and of course I was sky-watching. (I saw something 8 summers ago that has had me intently watching the sky ever-since)  I was facing north and looked over to my left(north by northwest of where I&rsquo;m standing) and saw something flying in an extremely erratic fashion. It had a flashing white light on it that for the most part was in one second intervals; though the pattern was somewhat irregular.  Every time the light would blink off, when it blinked back on the object had moved an insanely long distance.  But it wasn&rsquo;t simply traveling forward. It was moving forwards, backwards, diagonally and side-to-side. I&rsquo;ll put it to you like this. If this craft had a solid light instead of a blinking light, the pilot could have written its name just by maneuvering.   I&rsquo;m sure you are familiar with what happened at Stephenville Texas, right?  Yea it would have probably looked a lot like that.  I stood there and watched for about 2 or 3 minutes as this object darted around the sky the same way an electromagnetic charge instantaneously jumps from pole to pole.  If there was a human pilot flying this object, unless he is using some unknown super-technology, he or she would not have been able to withstand the G force required to make manuevers like this.  The oddest thing is that the object should have passed out of view; and if it was moving straight it would have. Instead it was moving in every possible direction, but never the same direction for very long.  Finally I just laughed and said to myself, &ldquo;show off!&rdquo;   The funny thing is that it isn&rsquo;t the first time I&rsquo;ve witnessed something very similar. Like I said in my last report I stopped filing reports after the first one to MUFON last year. No one is willing to come near NJ because of Morristown, but all that would be water under the bridge if I could just get an investigator with some high-tech cameras, video-recorders and infrared equipment to come down here and set up shop for a! night or two. Forget for the moment that almost no one sees stuff like this on a regular basis, because for once there is someone who really does.  I have a 141 IQ, am highly educated through collegiate and self-taught means and my vision is 20/15. I am a writer, work as a waiter, have an elderly grandmother to take care of, and absolutely no time to take out of my busy day to file a fake UFO report. Why would I ridicule a topic that I have extensively studied and found to be extraordinarily credible; based on things like the disclosure project, the Rendalshim Forrest incident, O&rsquo;Hare Airport, the 1951 incident where dozens of UFO&rsquo;s buzzed the white-house, the &ldquo;battle&rdquo; of LA, combined with what I have seen with my own eyes? I&rsquo;d give anything if someone would come down here with some good image-recording equipment because whatever is going on down here isn&rsquo;t normal, by any stretch of the imagination.", "White light shining down like a spot light then zipping back and forth and upward.I do not remember the exact date, but it was sometime between late June and July 24th of 1994.  I was walking down the middle of the street with a friend at around 2:00 am.  Suddenly a light shined done on us from behind.  It was like a spotlight shining from a helicopter, only there was no noise that is associated with a helicopter.  We both turned around at the same time and saw a light hovering just above the tree line roughly 300 yards away from us.  When we turned the light seemed to instantly reduce in intensity, like it wasn&rsquo;t a spotlight anymore, but just a light.  The object then zipped the left and upward, right and up, left and up and then back to the right and upward at a 45 degree angle and disappeared.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

Then as if turning sideways, they would suddenly disappear, then appear again in a random group.  There were at least two separate &quot;clusters&quot; of shapes with at least one metallic side on each shape, just hovering and moving almost in a circular motion, not far from each other. We watched them for about a half hour with some other curious onlookers and nobody could tell what they were...the two clusters eventually joined in a line above us and went south east of us. After a few minutes of watching these objects and evaluating their movements, it was obvious that they were not birds, balloons, kites or parachutes.((NUFORC Note:  Wife&apos;s report.

I turned off the headlights and kept on the parking lights to try to sneak up on it; but had to turn the lights back on pretty soon.  This time the lights were white and small like they started out that first time we saw it, but this time we noticed that there were small yellow flashing lights on the outside of each white light.  As we approached the thing, it started to immediately back away and the lights got bigger.  The closer we got, the faster it went.  We kept visual with it as it went into the air and went ahead of us down the farm road.  When it got to my daughter&rsquo;s house, it was behind some trees; we could still see the two lights.

We kept following the objects when more and more of the same objects were appearing. Some were close to eachother and some were spread out.  About an 1 hour and a half one of the objects went stationary while two objects came near the stationary object and went into a triangle formation.

I looked up and saw a HUGE sphere in the sky.  It was perfectly still, and made no sound.  I only looked up because of some birds--I wouldn&apos;t have noticed it otherwise--it blended almost completely in with the surrounding sky and clouds, but you could see the edges of it fairly clearly when you were looking straight at it.  It wasn&apos;t reflective at all, and I didn&apos;t see lights.  It was weird--I remember thinking it was almost like there was some kind of computer generated surface on the object that matched it exactly to the color of the sky and cloud cover, but you could see that the clouds didn&apos;t match up on the edges with the sky, and that they were moving a little differently than the real clouds.  I pulled my car over and got out to watch it for at least 15 minutes.  It didn&apos;t move.  I had my young children in the car with me--they had an after sch! ool appointment, so I had to continue on into Lincoln.  For the record, I know what a weather balloon looks like, and this was way too big and the wrong color to be a weather balloon.  I have no idea what it was, or how much longer it was there.  I should add that this was within 5 miles of the Nebraska Air National Guard base, within 45 miles of Offutt Airforce base in Omaha.  What did I see?((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.  PD))", "Glowing green light resembling a ruler, moving slowly with no up or down motion.I awoke from sleep last night to go to the washroom, and on returning into my room I glanced outside and noticed a glowing green rectangular object approximately 500 metres away.  My estimate of the size of this object, taking into account the distance it was from my window, is that it was in between 10 and 30 centimetres wide and 120 to 200 centimetres tall.After throwing on some clothes and shoes I left my house and observed this object from the top of my driveway (~465m away). The object appeared to slowly float right to left parallel to the ground, at an estimated 5km/h.  It continued its course until it was obscured by trees that blocked my vision. The easiest way for me to describe the appearance of this object is to compare it to an oversized ruler.I have been trying to come up with an explanation of what I saw, and as such I have thought of a few questions already that readers of this report may want to ask, so I present to you some more facts:  There are no lights in my room that are green, or otherwise.I did not turn on the lights when I got up to go to the washroom, so this sighting couldn&rsquo;t have been caused by a reflection of light from my room, or my house.I did turn on a light in the washroom, but it is a dull 40w glazed bulb, and I didn&rsquo;t look directly at it, so this couldn&rsquo;t have been a case of after-images in my eyes created by looking at a bright light source while my pupils were dilated from darkness.I can&rsquo;t discount is the possibility of fireflies engaging in some sort of strange behaviour, as the colour of green was identical to the colour that fireflies produce. As to why these fireflies would /could behave in this type of behaviour is beyond me.I considered the possibility that someone could have had some sort of reflector /light/glow stick on the side of a bike, or on pants or arms, but this doesn&rsquo;t seem likely since the object was moving in what appeared to be only along the x axis from right to left, not up or down at all &ndash; contradictory to what one would expect to see if this object was affixed to somebody&rsquo;s leg or arms while walking.What do you think?

My path around a corner apple tree I felt the presence of something. Second time around in the same spot I feel a presence again so I am looking around but see nothing.  Third time I am coming up to this corner looking at everything in front of me and see nothing but going under and around the tree I feel a presence again, continuing on and looking back, still I see nothing.  OK now I am disturbed, I know I am being watched but I don&rsquo;t see anything.  It is my fourth pass I am determined to see what is looking at me.  I come up on the corner I feel the presence I pass under the tree and as I look back, up in the apple tree is a small creature being with dark almond shaped eyes, opaque color thin limbs.  It was kind of scrunched up in the tree just watching me, in clear view and just watching me.  When I first seen the being it was invisible, I mean I was looking thru i! t, I wasn&rsquo;t grasping what I was seeing. I was scared.  I did not finish mowing the lawn.  I did not tell anyone as I thought certain they think me crazy.About a week later around 1:00 am I witnessed a mother ship hovering in the field just outside the bathroom window.  5 acres separated us and our neighbor, I could not see the neighbor&rsquo;s house it was so big.  It appeared to be hovering just a few feet off the ground, round and disk like in shape with many windows.  It was close enough you could see activity in the port holes of the craft.My sense was that the being in the tree was lost or perhaps like a teenager took off and the mother ship was there to pick him/her up.  I have always been of the opinion that we are not alone and well now I know that to be true.  Of course you ask the question, Why me, why did this being presence it&rsquo;s self to me?  I sensed the lesson for me was continue on my journey continue on my search for peace.  It was like the being and I had something in common, assuring me that there are struggles no matter who you are or where you are in the universe.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

I ran a service company that cleaned commercial heating and air conditioning systems. This sighting happened just outside of Altivista va. on state rd. 29 heading north.  Myself and one employee were traveling home after work this particular night at about 11:00pm when i noticed a very bright light up ahead just above the highway.  At first when i mentioned this to my work partner, he laughed and did not pay much attention to this object, but i was watching closely. As i began to get closer to this object i realized that it was no air craft.  This object was a large black colored trangle with three huge barrels under the bottom that emitted light from each of them.  The light glowed brightly and then it faded out to a dull glow under each barrel, and it did this several times as we were still approaching the object.By this time we were almost directly under the object in my work van.  I pulled over to the side of the road so we could continue to observe this object.  My work partner was at this point, very afraid of what he was seeing and i admitt i was not feeling comfortable with this sighting because it was so close to us and we were the only ones on the highway during this sighting. This object was totally silent as it hovered above us. This object was just above tree top level which was about sixty feet up.As we were sitting there on the side of the road looking up at the object it began to slowly move to the right side a little further closer to the trees and then we noticed that the object was gone, but we did not see it vanish or move one direction or the other at that point.  Strangely enough, we both had a feeling of missing time or something i just have no way of explaining, but thats how it was.  My work partner, who is now a long time friend as well, was a serious skeptic about such things as u.f.o.s until this experience.  I had told him about the disc i saw back in 1996 over the s! ears bui lding, but he never believed me until this experience happened to him.

Clear blue sky with no clouds.This sighting happened to me as nearly as I can recall back about two years ago, during the month of July of 2008. It may have been something like July 15th or so.I was out in my backyard cutting the grass and I sat down to rest a bit on a 3 foot high railroad tie fence at the back of my yard. My back yard has an elevation slope of about 4 degrees which is why I usually need to rest since half of the grass cutting is &quot;going up hill&quot;.As I looked up to the north, I noticed a white object floating or stationary over the crest of the mountain ridge which, from my back yard is about 1 1/2 miles north of here. I know it&apos;s about 1 1/2 miles from here because of the time it takes for the sound to reach me from the annual fireworks displays each year. Although the fireworks originate from an area on the crest of that mountain about a mile west of here, so for the timing of the flash of fireworks to the &quot;boom&quot; is about 9 seconds, but since where I saw the &quot;UFO&quot; is a shorter distance, so I approximate it to be about 1 1/2 miles (7 to 8 seconds).I put the shape of the object in your form as &quot;cigar shaped&quot; although that&apos;s not exactly it&apos;s correct shape. I&apos;m a former technical illustrator and since I smoke cigars I&apos;m well aware of the fact that cigar shape doesn&apos;t exactly describe it perfectly. The upper and lower sides weren&apos;t exactly parallel as in most cigars, but slightly convex - very slightly. And each end of the craft was round, not like in most cigars which are round on one end and the lighting end is flat or just cut straight off.But anyway, that&apos;s the best I can describe it verbally, but with drawing it I could draw it exactly as it was.The craft was just white, not shiny metallic like an aluminum aircraft.  Also the craft wasn&apos;t blindingly emitting a strong source of light, it was just white like a white object.  One thing that I noticed was that there didn&apos;t seem to be any shadow on the underside of the craft,  It was just all white.I took about 1 second to adjust my eyeglasses and then when looking back at it, it just wasn&apos;t there anymore.Now I&apos;m 74 years old and have been wearing eyeglasses for about 65 years so I&apos;m well aware of whether or not it was a white piece of fluff or object on my eyeglasses.  The craft I saw I clearly focused on. It wasn&apos;t an object on my eyeglasses.  I know the difference after 65 years.  I was a member of the USAF for 4 years and also have my Private Pilot&apos;s Certificate so am used to viewing object in the sky.So when I looked back to the object after first seeing it  for about 5 seconds it was just wasn&apos;t there anymore.My theory as to why it wasn&apos;t there anymore is that either:   1 - It zoomed away in that time, or else,  2 - It just became invisible in that time.Incidentally, I know clouds can disappear in only a few seconds, like about  5 seconds at times, but this object disappeared in only one second.  I know that in film clips on TV that clouds seem to disappear in only maybe about 1 second, but that&apos;s only in time lapse filming.  This object disappeared in real time in only 1 second.So, there you have it. Every time I go out to cut the grass now, I always keep an eye on the sky here but haven&apos;t  seen that object anymore.  I keep looking but so far, no luck.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

As I approached downtown Sacramento I noticed four very bright stars in the sky over the city. Within seconds I realized that one was a distant airplane (because of the red and green lights that I noticed it exhibited as I looked more closely). The &quot;stars&quot; were about seven full moons apart from each other.As I got closer to the city I could see that the lights were seemingly stationary because their orientation altered naturally with my approach and the turns in the freeway. I apparently was getting closer to them.As I got into town, near the area of Sutter General Hospital the three lights were to my side. The closest of the lights was about five times bigger than a very bright star or five times a magnitude 1 star. It seemed to be around three hundred feet in the air. I tried to notice how far the closest object was from me but I couldn&apos;t tell. At first it looked closer than my exit which was coming up (the 16th Street Exit) but as I approached the exit I could see it was farther away... perhaps twice as far.Still, I knew these were not stars nor some other regular natural celestial phenomena. As I approached them they were in front of me; when I got closer they were next to me and then as I went further they were behind me and they were low in the sky.I had seen them from the vantage of the freeway but as I took the exit which descended onto the surface streets the objects were lost amidst buildings and trees and I could not see them again.In all I saw the objects for about six minutes.

I immediately noticed that it was moving to slow for a shooting star and it did not change in light intensity, nor did it have the normal streak behind it.  I watched the object move from west to east, I know this as I am familiar with the layout of my parents property. I watched this light for several seconds and determined it was not a plane due to fact that the light was not unidirectional, as would be the case if it were a plane or helicopter.  I called to my nephew who was inside and asked him if he wanted to see something weird. We both observed the light/object as it continued towards the east.  After a few moments he ran inside to tell his mom, my sister, to come out and look at what was in the sky.  I explained that it was weird because there were no flashing port or starboard lights.  The flight speed and altitude was also odd as it seemed to be drifting and did not appear to follow a straight path. I thought that it could possibly be a satellite but due to its brightness and low elevation have considered otherwise.  I doubt that it was a small plane as there was no prop noise.  The object continued to the east until it disappeared behind the horizon.", "One disc-shaped object flying South over Dallas then followed an aircraft West.As I was sitting outside on my porch this morning, I glanced up at the starry night sky, only to notice a UFO.

I am including her contact phone number in the appropiate section.Alien Encounter - Alien Encountered in Cheatham County, TN  I reside in Cheatham County, Tennessee, and observed an alien in my yard in February this year.The reason I am coming forward is because the description the woman in Georgia provided of the 3 alien beings she observed at a campsite where she and her husband were camping the latter part of 2009 is almost exactly the same as what I saw.It was approximately 5:00 in the morning.  There was still snow on the ground from the last snow.  I had gotten ready for work and was sitting in my Suzuki in the drive letting it warm up before leaving for my job in Nashville, Tennessee.I caught movement out of the corner of my eye in the area of my garage (which is used for storage and not to pull a car into).  At first, I thought it was one of the neighbor&apos;s dogs.I turned to look and saw something which very closely matched the description of the alien creatures which the woman in Georgia observed.Its body, extra long arms and hind legs were so thin.  Its head was very large and bumpy.It was pale in color and hairless.It was very cold outside, and the creature appeared a light grayish color (I&apos;m not sure whether the cold temperature would have affected the appearance of the color).The only difference in my story and hers is that the 3 creatures she saw were upright.  This was moving on all 4&apos;s, however, the way it was moving made it appear like a monkey or gorilla that are oftentimes upright, but then use their arms in conjunction with their legs to propel themselves forward.On all 4&apos;s, it was about the height of a large dog, and I observed that it would be considered short, compared to most humans, if it stood upright.Its legs were short, quite a bit stockier than the body and arms, which were long and skinny.It kept looking back as though it thought it was being followed, and so it was surprised to see me sitting inside the automobile when it looked around, directly at me, for the first time.I got a good look at its large, round eyes which were darkish in color.  They appeared a dark brown.  It was as though it sensed I wasn&apos;t going to hurt it, and it continued on across my yard, across the road, and continued out a connecting road which is directly in front of my home.There are lots of wooded areas in the direction it was traveling, and lots of wooded area behind my home.I am not comfortable just ignoring this occurrence. Questions are racing through my mind - questions which need to be answered.What are these creatures doing in our wooded areas, hiding out by day and wandering by night?  Where did they come from?  Are they depleting any of our resources?  Will they become dangerous if someone acts aggressively toward them?  (I was so busy looking at its eyes and bumpy head that I cannot describe a nose and/or mouth.)

We could see 4 white lights defining the shape of a misshapen square and it appeared to be a single craft since the stars behind it could not be seen.At first, the UFO seemed quite close to us and moved fairly slowly.  But as it moved away it began to change shape, move faster and rise higher into the sky.  As the craft moved away from us in a Northern direction, the lights rotated into a triangle form with the point facing forward.  The UFO also began to speed up.  It was moving faster than any other aircraft we have ever witnessed before.  It had also seemed to reach an elevation comparable to an airplane as it headed farther North.  But unlike an airplane the craft never made a sound.We watched the UFO until our eyes couldn&rsquo;t track it any longer.

I live a short distance from where this incident took place.  This is my report, and I am an expert U.S. Government typist.  On Friday,  June 25, 2010, at around 3:00 PM, I was in town doing some shopping at our local Kroger store on the Scottsville Road.  The day was clear, hot, and humid.  When I came out of the Kroger store I saw a man in the parking lot looking up into the sky, so I decided to have a look for myself.  We both saw to our amazement what looked like a flying disk or saucer-type object traveling straight across the sky.  At first I dismissed it as a balloon, but the longer I watched it I began to wonder exactly what it was that we were seeing.  The object was large, and looked to be twice the size of an automobile.  There were no other around either.  It was about a mile away as close as I could tell.  The object was disk-shaped and was a very shiny silver color.  There looked t! o be indentations or lights around the edges of the object as well.  The main reasons I began to truly wonder if it was a balloon was these.  The object traveled in a very straight path line where as a balloon would wobble up and down and not fly in a straight formation.  As the silver object flew it tilted from one side to the other about a mile apart each time as if showing off.  First it tilted and flew sideways with its top showing, and then it would tilt again and fly sideways with the bottom showing.  The object repeatedly  did this over and over again the whole fives minutes I watched it.  If it was a craft it may have been going out of control.  There were no streamers of markings on, or attached, to the object like a balloon would have either.  It continued flying along at the same altitude.  I put my groceries inside my car, and then looked back up and the object was gone.  I think it may have went behind some cloud cover or fell somewhere.  This may be a coincide! nce, but shortly after as I was traveling home on the Scottsvi! lle Road their was a traffic jam or something holding up the traffic.  Finally we came upon a large semi truck that was stopped dead in the road.  To make it seem weird there was nothing visible wrong with the truck, and I could not a see any truck drivers either.  No other vehicles were damaged either.  There were close to seven police cars that just simply had this truck surrounded, and the roadway cordoned off.  Amazingly, the truck was in a direct path as to where the mysterius disk-shaped object would have traveled over.  Did he see it and stop?  Did something crash?  I don&apos;t know.  Did anyone else see this object besides us?  Did the object stop the engine of the truck?  I wonder now.  Anyway, that&apos;s my report.  I am a Christian, and this sighting is true and accurate to the best of my ability.  If anyone else saw this object I would love to know about it.", "Blue dotted lights forming a circle.

The object was moving towards me, heading north parallel to the west side of the freeway.  As it approached I could see that it looked like a sphere flying in the air, clearly not an airplane shape.  The object kept coming, as it got closer and the glare went away I was able to get a good view of it from the passenger&rsquo;s front window. It was a metallic disc, with conical shape at the bottom and top, rhombus shaped profile.  It had no windows, lights or moving parts.  I was a metallic color, resembling what an unpainted aluminum aircraft body would look like and it had no markings on it.  It was moving in a straight line with no signs of leaving any trail behind it.

I went back to the car to turn on the radio to see if anyone was reporting on this, but nothing.   We got back in the car and kept driving even though the ships were still there and flying.  I stopped watching them since i had to drive, but my wife kept looking.  Then she says &quot;oh my god&quot;.  I am like, &quot;what?&quot;   She says &quot;a bluish-white light just appeared in the sky and they (the ships) vanished&quot;.  I was like &quot;no way&quot;...and i looked where they had been and sure enough, they were gone, just starry sky was there.  Weird.  So we kept driving.  About maybe 5 minutes or so later my wife says &quot;there they are again&quot;.  I was like &quot;jesus...what the hell&quot;.  So i stopped again and we got out to see.  Once again the 2 big triangle ships were blotting out most of the sky but this time some kind of orange colored orbs were WAY up in the sky and floating in mid air.  They pulsed in color, yellowish orange, and there were 4 of them spaced out (i could not say how far because i had no spacial references).  Anyways, one of them dropped down lower than the others and appeared to be getting larger, and indeed it was rapidly coming closer to where we were even though it had to still be miles away.  We had our dog with us and he was barking and seemed pretty nervous at this point and i really didnt know what to do.  I thought maybe we should go back to the car but we just kind of decided to stay on the road and watch.  It stopped probably a mile (guessing) from us and was very very low to the ground. Then it hovered a while and went back the way that it came. Then (sorry this story is so long) we were about to get back in the car when we heard a plane coming from behind us (northeast) and it was moving so fast it had to be a fighter jet, we could see the lights on the plane also even though it was pretty high up in the sky.  It was flying super fast towards! the glowing light orbs and the big triangle ships.  The damnedest thing, we saw the plane fly (from our vantage point) right close to one of the orb things and the plane blew up.  We saw it explode and drop out of the sky in flames but there was no noise, although it was far away and we thought maybe thats why we couldnt hear it explode. So at this point i am thinking that there is NO way that we are the only ones seeing this whole thing unfold, so again i check all the radio stations but still nothing.  We both were trying to decide if we should keep driving south towards phoenix or stay away...and we decided to keep going.  As we got closer and closer to the city, the lights of the city made it impossible to see anything anymore and that was it.  I don&apos;t know what it all was but it was not possible for something that huge to fly like that and i still have no idea what it was.

They were immobile when I saw them, and they didn&apos;t have beacons, which means they were not helicopters or airplanes. Then they started to move slowly in opposite directions, I tried to follow both but I ended up following one of them and kept following it until it was out of view.

The object appeared within moments after the fully set and visually appeared to be approximately 5-8 miles off the coastline.  The object was cigar shaped, it was vertical and looked like a ray of light in the sky.It sat stationary for about two minutes.  It began to move at the pace of a jet airliner although. Suddenly, it stopped and then sat stationary again for about 30 seconds, after that it began to move closer, maybe a mile, nothing more than that. It started to move around again at a jet airliner pace in the sky but it swayed back and forward. After about five minutes of witnessing the entire phenomena, it quickly dissipated and faded into the atmosphere.  Its camouflage mechanism made it hard to capture a phone picture.  Additionally, the twilight was not helpful in trying to get a photo as the entire sky blended in.Others that witnessed the sunset and the unusual sighting directly following the sunset that evening were talking about it amongst each other although no group made a big deal about it.I should probably mention that I posted a Facebook post about the sighting to my friends and after I posted that, Facebook on my phone coincidentally is all in Spanish and I cannot get it back into English anymore.", "3 small white lights in the shape of a triangle, one object onlyI woke up at 4am that morning to get ready for work.  I am currently a student in the medical field and I had to be at the hospital by 5:30 am that morning.  It was still sort of dark out, enough that I had to turn my headlights on.  There was no wind. The sky was clear, no clouds were in site.  I got in my car around 4:50am, started it and waited for it to warm up. I live in a normal neighborhood in the south east part of the city.  As I was backing out of my driveway I happened to look up in the sky out of the driver&rsquo;s side window, which would have been towards the west.  I saw a fairly small whitish light about 45-55 degrees above the horizon in the sky.  It almost looked like a star.  When I first saw it I did a double take, when I fixed my eyes on the object it looked like it was moving around very fast and then it stopped and hovered for a few seconds.  After that I started driving west down my street still looking at it through the front windshield of the car.! It was moving very slowly.  There were no flashing lights, or blinking lights like those on an airplane or any other man-made aerial craft.  As soon as I got to the end of the street at the stop sign I stopped and got out of my car and was watching the light slowly travel north north east at a fairly slow rate, slower than any airplane could fly without crashing.  When I got out of my car and looked up at the object it was pretty far away, but it almost looked like there were 3 lights in the shape of a triangle.  They appeared to be kind of close together, like it was a single object, not 3 flying objects in close proximity.  For a few seconds I was pondering driving back to my house to grab my video camera, but I didn&rsquo;t want to lose sight of it as it was traveling away from me.  (Later that evening I checked to see if my video camera was even charged and it wasn&rsquo;t.  I am always going to make sure it is from now on at all times.)  I was parked in front of a neighbor&rsquo;s house long e! nough for someone to turn on their front porch light.  I don&rsquo;t ! know if they saw me and was wondering what I was doing.  I didn&apos;t want them to call the cops thinking I was a prowler or anything so I got back in my car and watched the object moving away from me slightly increasing in speed. I backed the car up back towards my house so I could try to see it as there were trees blocking my field of view and I gradually lost it in the sky due to the sun starting to rise over the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range.  Like I said I know what I saw, and I saw something that wasn&rsquo;t man made. It looked like it had 3 small lights in the shape of a triangle and they were white. I am not a liar.  I consider myself very credible.  I teach at a local high school, and I am also a student in the medical field.  I have also seen several other unknown objects in the sky over my lifetime.

I had a friend, Ryan, who lived across the street.  I spent the night at his house.  At around midnight (exact time, date and month unknown) me and Ryan were laying on his front lawn looking up, staring at the beautiful sky, talking about random topics.  Suddenly, and silently, a triangular shaped craft came into view.  A pretty damn big craft.  Our estimate was that it was several times the size of a 747.  It was relatively close to the ground.  It had to have been black because we saw no outline. We were able to see it was triangular in shape because it had many lights underneath.  I describe it as dim, smokey orange, green and yellow lights, with one big white one in the middle. We stood up shouting and screaming in fear and amazement.  Sometime during the event, I told him to go find a camera or video camera.  The craft suddenly shot a beam of white light to the earth (next to the highway on the! area of dead grass) and then retracted.  Then a few seconds later it shown a light seemingly through the top of it into the clouds.  I was watching it as it continued to fly off. My friend returned with his mom and no camera.  I think the craft was already gone because I remember his mom did not get a chance to see it.  We then noticed his neighbor working in his garage, but it seemed he didnt see the craft, and must not have been there during the event.  It was truely incredible.

Tuesday sighting 6/15/10 total of 7 objects from 9:45 p.m. until we stopped watching at 11:00 p.m. (I verified my times with my cell phone call log); two large objects, one in the NE (a large round ball of light same as Sunday) and one to the West (a cigar shaped object with 3 lights that changed into on solid ball of light), 2 smaller flying objects were emitted from large object in the West, and 3 smaller flying objects were shooting around the large object in the NE.Object in the West changed shape and color from a cigar to a large round light and the colors changed from bright yellow to an amber orange.  Object in the NE (was the same both nights) appeared to be too far away so we could not make out a shape, it just looked like a round flashing object.  We could see lights changing colors from white, red, light blue-ish, and a slight orange color. I could physically see the NE object change direction in an almost erratic manner.  We got very excited about the sighting and were making a lot of noise and the object almost instantly stopped moving around. At approximately 9:50 pm a smaller object shot across the sky just under the NE object.  The smaller light came from the bottom right side of the large NE object and zipped across at an upward (45 degree) angle.  At approximately 10:10 pm another smaller object shot across the sky just under the NE object.  This time the object came from the left side and shot across to the right at a very sli! ght (20 degree) angle.  One more object shot around the sky shortly after that (approx. 10:40 pm) this time just a horizontal path just under the large NE object.  All three of the shooting lights were short bursts and in different directions that the others.  They did not follow the same path or direction.  The large NE object pulsated and slightly wobbled in the sky, as the time went by it appeared to go farther up into the sky, like it was going higher up so the light appeared to be smaller and farther away, but we could still see that it was pulsated very brightly (about 3x brighter than any star in the sky, and brighter than any airplane that flew by).  Both of the large objects pulsated.The other object in the West was cigar shaped when we initially spotted it.  It was hovering (directly to the right of the moon) in place and appeared to be suspended vertically with 3 very bright lights (changing from orange to yellow).  This object was much closer and lower than the other NE object. We have a video of this (W) object.  It was recorded from the back porch through the screen, and there was some debate about if it was an optical illusion.  However, we could see the cigar shape and 3 lights in plain sight, and I am absolutely sure that it was not an illusion.  We watched this object change shape (or appear to be different in shape) because the lights appeared to become one large light instead of the 3 single lights.  When this happened we ran out to the front of the house to watch it.  From the front of the house we saw this object change color and size (or brightness).  It moved across the sky in short, slow, erratic movements (up, down, side to side, and at angled, wobbling or dancing), and eventually found its place very low in the sky and drastically below and to the right of the moon.  It pulsated the entire time with very bright, large flashes to small flickering.  At one point the object became at least 3x brighter and appeared to be coming toward us.  Shortly after that the object dimmed down and appeared to be moving (slowly) downward again.

Some say black helicopters are in the area, but I think they were chasing what actually did the job.  A helicopter does not fit my understanding of the event.  Although I was not a direct witness, I was too close. Here is my story. On Thursday night, August 29, 1991, my late wife and I were camping on Kennally Creek, six miles east of Donnelly, Idaho.  That night at 3AM there was a wild ruckus of coyotes barking.  It woke us up and our attention was on those coyotes wondering why this was happening.  It seemed like all the coyotes in the whole valley were concentrated just to the south of where we were camping. Imagine a hundred coyotes in one place barking and baying.  Then total silence.  By total silence I mean that nothing could be heard.  We were next to a stream and could not hear the stream gurgling. Many know the wonderful sounds that a stream can make to lure you into dreamland when camping.  However, this night, at this moment not even the stream could be heard.Suddenly, there was a screaming-screeching sound of great volume that lasted more than a minute. There was silence again, that same total silence defeating even the natural sounds of the forest and the stream. This time the silence lasted for about five minutes. Suddenly, that same loud noise, the intense lasting screaming sound could be heard once again, and after it was over, the coyotes were barking once again. We were listening to the coyotes in some degree of fear trying to figure out what was happening and then, oddly, we both fell fast asleep.We woke up together at 9AM, discussed the strangeness of the night and decided to pack up and go back home. About a week later we invited my parents to join us on a camping trip and returned to the same place. This location by Kennally Creek had been a family favorite since about 1956. In those forty years very little had changed at the campsite. Not even the tiny pond where my sister and I played with frogs and garter snakes has changed, and where my grandchildren did the same.That night of the first day camping with my parents a local rancher showed up on horseback and told us the story of how, just over a ridge a week before, just 160 yards from our tent, was a horse mutilation. He detailed the usual findings of precision cuts, no tracks, and no blood. It happened on the same night we heard the coyotes and screaming sounds. Some may say we just heard a mountain lion scream; however, a mountain lion does live there, just a few hundred feet to the north and we have heard it scream, and there was no comparison; however, if you need the mountain lion connection, you would have to have several of them in one place and screaming in more than twice the volume as they can do.A little more about the location can be given. Using Google Earth &trade; you travel nearly due east of Donnelly, Idaho six miles. The coordinates for the mutilation are: 44&ordm; 42&apos; 41.53&quot;N, 115&ordm; 57&apos; 39.82W and the coordinates for the campsite are 44&ordm; 42&rsquo; 41.53&rdquo; N, 115&ordm; 57&rsquo; 33.39&rdquo; W.An old newspaper article can be found at Google Newspapers by pasting this address into your browser: http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&amp;dat=19910906&amp;id=ZTsVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PwgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6538,3646572  From the camping spot, Kennally Creek empties into Gold Fork River at about 2 &frac12; miles south as the crow flies.  The area is closed now.

After I got off the train I tried to get a better look at it since I wouldnt be on a moving train, but It was obscured by trees and buildings or it was gone.

At the time I was working on a song that I had been writing, using a handheld synthesizer.  The sky had been mostly clear all day, but it was beginning to get a little cloudy. I needed to urinate badly, so I got up and walked to the side of our property and began my bussiness. It was then that I noticed that the moon was becoming extremely bright, so bright that I began worry that someone might see me, and become offended.  I then noticed that the light that was shining so brightly was not the moon at all, the moon being white in color.  This was yellow, so close to the color of a street light, that I thought for a brief moment that maybe someone had installed a telephone pole and street light in our yard.  That ridiculous notion was taken from me when the &quot;street light&quot; began to slowly move in the direction of the clouds.  The light had been so close to the ground that it had eclipsed the moon, but as it moved, I could see the moon again.  The light then seemed to shrink in on itself, not unlike a dimmer switch connected to a light bulb.  It startled me to the point that I had forgotten I was still indecently exposed.  As I stood there, mouth agape, I was starled yet again. This time it was bone chilling.  As a hole in the clouds opened up, I saw the night sky clearly. The stars were easy to see, and were clearly stationary, because the clouds were moving very fast, but the stars were remaining still.  But what startled me was the sheer number of yellow stars.  They were moving in the same direction as the clouds, and these &quot;yellow stars&quot; were above the clouds, because they would be covered up by the clouds as they moved.  It occured to me then, that the yellow lights were in our atmosphere, because they were much clearer to see than the stars.  I know they were just above the clouds, because some of them were doing what I had seen the first one I noticed doing. They  looked like they would have been part of the star field, but they were too many and too clearly observed. To be honest, I thought that we were being invaded. I know, I know, I watch alot of movies, but this was the real thing! I was honestly scared, and I figured that maybe I had better go tell my loved ones that I love them.  I was a little shaky as I ran inside to get my brother and mother. I got into the door, and stopped, realizing the enormity of what I was about to say to them. My mother looked at me expectantly, knowing somehow, that I had some important news. At this point I thought, if they are going to think I&apos;m going crazy, then I&apos;m going to force this on them, instead of just telling them. So I said,&quot; Mom, you have to help me now!&quot;  Then I turned, and ran out the front door. They followed me, but when they saw the lights, they came up short.  There were dozens, maybe hundreds, above the clouds, and they would show up in the dozens below the clouds.  However, when they would show up below the clouds, it seemed that they were there already, but not shining. Then the light would intensify,  sustain, then dim. Sometimes they would just dissapear into a cloud, and would actually &quot;burn&quot; holes in the clouds. I then called my grandma, my best friends, my other friends. Several of my friends were in different places, a couple miles away, but when they went outside, they were amazed. Many people saw these lights, and I think many people are afraid to admit it. I was just watching them, when three jets came roaring in a speeds much faster than lights were moving. The lights did not appear to flee. Instead, they just dimmed down, until you could not see them. They would appear in different intervals in many different places, only to dissapear again. After that there were helicopters flying in really low. They could not get near a light, but it was clear that the pilots were aware of the lights, and desired to close in on them. But it was the same thing as with the jets.By this time there were very few showing up close to the! ground, instead they all seemed to slowly move on to the west! . At abo ut eleven  o&apos;clock, I had decided to get the little camera we have. I was waiting for another to come  low enough to photograph, but I had to settle for one that was actually at a high altitude. As I took the picture, and the flash went off, the camera died from loss of power. It was probably only coincidence, but the wireless internet at my house was knocked out of service at that exact moment. Upon recharging the camera, I found no picture recorded. That is too bad. I was so excited about seeing these things, that I lost my priorities. Next time I see anything like that, I&apos;m going to have a camera waiting.", "Strange orange glow coming from trees alongside highway.Last year, (I don&apos;t remember the exact date) I was driving to city early in the morning with my sister, the sun was just coming up the left and I just happened to glance out the passenger window to my right and noticed a very steady bright, orange glow coming up from behind the trees.  At first I thought maybe there was a forest fire, but I slowed down and we looked closer and saw that there was no smoke, just a strange orange glow like the sun was coming up behind the trees...but how can that be if the sun was on the total opposite side of us?  I also thought it could possibly be coming from some lights on a farm or something, but I don&apos;t think it&apos;s possible for a few lights on a farm to light up a whole area of the sky like that.  I travel along that same highway alot, but I have never seen that orange glow ever again.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

I looked to the horizon and noticed how pretty the moon was (it was low and orange). So I backed up, and stopped to admire it.  As I was looking at it, there was a very bright star above it.  It was then I noticed it was moving! It was moving about the pace of an airplane.  When I first saw it next to the moon it was in the west.  It was headed southeast. I ran to the house and got my father, and he ran out just in time to see it too.  It never changed direction, just kept heading in a straight path.

I hope this is a reputable site.  I can tell you I have watched, googled many sighting shows etc. since my siting and I have yet to run across anything that was as large and close with such a clear view of what I witnessed.  I would love to be able to share more details of my sighting to the appropriate personnel.  It was quite amazing, astonishing and etched in my momeory.

We were on the thruway and saw what looked like two very bright white lights with a flashing red one between them.  I thought nothing of it thinking it was a radio tower.  We approached the Angola rest stop and the lights appeared to not be attached to anything but just hovering.  We passed the Angola rest stop and actually drove past it (the craft).  It appeared to be about 10 stories off the ground.  We saw the underbelly of the craft and it was triangle shaped.  It had three bright lights on each corner of the triangle and there were two bright white lights on its belly, one longer than the other, there was a red flashing light between those lights.  As we passed it (at about 10:12 PM), I continued to look back and the craft&rsquo;s front light looked like a spotlight- it had a light cone.  It rotated and then disappeared in place.  It didn&rsquo;t fly away, it faded away.  Like it went into the clouds, but! there weren&rsquo;t any clouds that night.As we continued to drive, I saw what I can only describe as was a flashing red and blue star in the distance. It jumped a measured distance across the sky in bursts.  It was very fast. As we approached the Fredonia Exit we saw the flashing lights move closer.  Suddenly very close.  It didn&rsquo;t have its lights on anymore but it did have blue and red flashing tail lights. The underbelly of the craft looked indescribable.  It appeared to be dimly lit with a light source below it flashing slight colors.  It disappeared around 11: 10 PM or so.", "saw &amp; filmed a pulsating diamond shaped object which changed shape several times over Portland, Oregon about 9:30 PMSaw a stationary object while driving home, which was too close and bright to be a star.  There were no other stars visible in that portion of the sky. We pulled the car over and watched the object for about 5 minutes before proceeding home about a half an mile to get the HD Handycam to film it.  Recorded it on film for about 7 minutes from our backyard over the roof of the house behind us.  The object changed shape several times and pulsated brighter, mainly staying in a diamond shape.  There were also dark vertical lines which crossed the object periodically, and there was a darker circle or diamond shape in the center the object sometimes when the object was in a diamond shape.", "Oval shaped object sighted hovering over a fieldI was driving down a back road in the afternoon when I felt the urge to direct my attention to the left of me towards a field.  My attention was immediately stolen by what looked to be a oval shaped object hovering over the field approximately 200-300ft. in the air (that would be my best guess).  The object was not moving, and was not emitting any lights or sounds, but I could tell the object was shiny due to the fact the sun was reflecting off of the object.As a passed a few trees, and my line of sight was broken, I looked back in the general area only to find the object was gone.  I slowed down my car from  about 30mph to about 15mph and scanned the sky and the fields that I could see, but the object had disappeared.I immediately called a friend of mine and told him what I had saw, and asked another friend or two how I could obtain information pertaining to anyone else reporting  a strange object in the area.  They suggested contacting the county and/or state authorities.  My plan is to contact them in the next day or two and ask about any reports of a &lsquo;low flying aircraft&rsquo; in the past week.  This area hasn&rsquo;t been known to have many UFO sightings to my knowledge, nor have I witnessed anything like this area here before, but I know I&rsquo;m am now more intrigued than ever to learn, document, and report any strange sighting or occurrences from this area.I have sent a sighting report to the HBCC UFO Research as well with the same information I have provided in this report.", "White cigarette shaped object traveling northbound Quakertown Rt. 309Late afternoon somewhere after 17:30 but before 18:00 looking east above the house behind my yard object was seen traveling northbound at a steady speed.  A large object.The sun was still fairly high at this time and was at my back.  In comparison the object would have been 1.5 times the width of the sun.  It could have been as long as a football field but what I saw at that distance looked like it took up the space a middle school spans.  Like a shopping plaza. It was white. WHITE.  It did appear to fade on the edge which was either some motion blur or reflection if it was shiny.  I can&rsquo;t say it was shiny but it did appear to be somewhat reflective on the edges.  It looked a lot like a flying cigarette.A white filter cigarette about the size of a shopping plaza passed over my area and looked like it was about two miles away.Our entire town here is only 1.7 miles wide. The area is heavily congested with shopping districts and we are within 4miles of the turnpike. The commerce traffic up here is huge both on the ground and in the air. There are always balloons, small private planes, military stuff, black choppers all the time from Willow Grove and who knows where else.There is a small airport within a mile of my home and others within two miles in neighboring towns. SOMEONE HAD TO SEE THIS.  There was heavy plane traffic all day and there usually is on nice days.  The thing that can clear this up is a pilot.I was looking east on my lawn to look at one of the jets blowing one of those afterburner smoke trails traveling straight up.  My sight line at that point was looking upward more than likely 65degrees as the plane was traveling fast my gave follows it up and the cigarette either showed up or coasted into my site line and that damn thing just traveled real smooth from right to left even broke the plane of the smoke trail, no sound almost looked like it faded but I was squinting to see if this was an illusion but this thing traveled.  It did not dip, fade out, it was not smoke it did look like it could cloak itself. This is broad daylight&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.. A WHITE OBJECT on a light blue sky, CLEAR day!  It could have been a giant Frisbee.  Please help me.I watched the object for 30-60secs.  I don&rsquo;t have the exact time of day either.  I was so glued to it I didn&rsquo;t get to my watch, I hurried into the house to grab my binoculars that are by the door knowing when I came out I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to locate it.  It was white.  I never would have seen it if I wasn&rsquo;t looking at the jet.About 90mins later my neighbor north of my home two doors down meets me and my girlfriend out front on the sidewalk and I asked him if he saw anything within the last two hours and he verified a cigarette traveling westbound.  His sightline was toward the south which indicates to me the object had to have made a hard left after I went into the house.  His iteration to me has the object traveling towards the highway.  When I saw the object it was traveling parallel to the highway.

There was no sound and the line of travel was perfectly straight. the object was around 3000 ft from the ground at a guess.

In a second triangle was acute then it became obtuse, in other second stars were going toward each other and then they were doing the opposite (going from one another).

It was approximately 15-20 minutes before actual sunrise, when the sky was just lighting up, very clear out, we were standing in front of the Westin on A1A just north of Las Olas Blvd.We got to the water&apos;s edge and after a couple seconds I looked up and my eyes immediately fixated on something moving across the sky.It&apos;s very difficult to describe what we saw. The object was black - at first I thought it might be a bird very high up, but I couldn&apos;t discern any wings flapping, it just looked like a solid object moving slowly over the ocean, over and past us and continuing inland. There were no flashing lights, and as there were quite a few planes on the horizon, it was quite easy to see that this was not one of them. It was hard to focus on also, it seemed far away but quite low at the same time; for a second I actually thought it sort of looked like a person flying, but I dismissed this for obvious reasons. My girlfriend described it as &quot;an asymmetrical rectangular blob floating westward, not like a bird that varies direction and flaps its wings, but more like a balloon&quot;.Very creepy, no sound at all, and again this thing flew in from the ocean, maybe 1,000 ft (?) up, and proceeded inland. There were several planes on the horizon, several miles away and clearly discernible as conventional aircraft. The object that passed above us most definitely was not.", "Erin Ontario UFO SIghtingThis is what happened. I, my brother and a close friend were driving to my cousins in Erin, Ontario.  We were coming close to the edge of the town, when my brother noticed something moving in a strange way in the sky.  It turned out to be a star and the moving clouds created the illusion of it moving.  As I looked at the star I noticed something else.  It looked like a tear from the side but from below it was a triangular shape.  It had a red light on what looked like the aft of the vessel. It was so close I thought it was a plane making an emergency landing.  We opened the windows to see what it sounded like, and heard nothing at all.  If it was any known craft in this area it would have been deafening at the distance it was.  We decide to follow the craft as far as we could we got to the edge of the town and watched the craft fly east at a steady pace, stop, hover, then fly west, stop, hover, then continue north west.  The three of us are still unsure what this was! and there was no reported military training in that area.  A week prior to this my brother and I were outside my house when we noticed what looked like a star moving very fast across the sky.  I said that it was probably a satellite just I  I said that the star stopped moved the opposite direction, so east, and then continued its original path, until it was out of sight.  My brother and I have had a number of experiences with these phenomenons.  We used to live close to military base Borden in Proton Township, and we would see these same types of craft all the time.  Being located so close to the military base they let the community know when they are training, and none of the sighting to which I speak of corresponded to these training exercises.", "ufo over mpls 5/28/2010over the Wellsfargo building in minneapolis minneasota. i have video of this with my digital camera. it hovers in an irregular pattern and the begins to change direction quickly and very sharply. its not a helicoper or plane. then after it seems to sharply change direction it shoots off in a direction very very fast. then 5 min later it comes back and does the same thing. i also noticed it following a commercial jet that seemed to fly very low and not in a normal patter right over the city on mpls.((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus??

He was plowing this field and he got the feeling that he was being watched.  The tractor had its headlights on and he looked around, but did not observe anything at ground level.  He looked above the tractor as he reached the end of the field and observed a large cigar shaped vehicle hovering motionless above the tractor as he did his turn around.  This vehicle was observing and following him as he crossed the field.  He became paniced and decided to leave the field when he reached the other end of the field.He raised the plow out of the ground and drove the tractor out of the field.  He then drove into a heavily grove of trees and when he reached it he shut off his headlights and shut off the tractor engine.  The cigar shaped vehicle followed him over the heavy wooded area and when the tractor was no longer visible the cigar shaped vehicle accelerated and streaked away at a great rate of speed.

We were sitting in a field with no obstruction of the sky and the weather was clear with no clouds.  The fireworks were not being used and were not scheduled for another 30 minutes, so no confusion with any other object was possible.  As I was looking at the stars i noticed a bright white light moving from the horizon which was the west heading eastward.  It appeared to be very high in the sky and was moving quite fast for the altitude. I mentioned it to my wife who looked up and saw the light.  At that time when she acknowledged it , it disappeared for about 3 seconds after a flash and reappeared further along in the same path of flight. When it did this she told her family to look, it did the flash again and reappeared two more times.  It then flashed and reappeared after what seemed a be 90 degree turn and headed south.  It flashed and reappeared three times and was at the tree line to our south.

The total time of the visible object was around 30 seconds. I could see the extreme humidity outside was very thick and can only see 1 or 2 visible stars.  After checking the ISS flyovers of St.Louis, there are no orbital paths flying over here until June so it wasn&apos;t an ISS flyover or a satellite, because satellites always give off a reddish hue due to the infrared light reflected back off the earth.  Again it was a bright white object started out as a dim light then in the middle of path grew extremely bright as the ISS is and then slowly dimmed out with a speed about as fast as the ISS flyovers are from what I can reference.  There were no FAA lights, just one solid whi! te light, nothing blinking or flashing. No other planes in the sky before or after event.", "I saw a reddish colored orb that was &quot;observing lighting show thunderstorms&quot; &amp; it displayed 2 amazing climbs and a huge burst of speed.I was the captain, flying a four engine turbine powered aircraft (L-188) at flight level 230 (23,000 feet) inbound toward Indianapolis, Indiana, thence cleared to Ft. Wayne for the Detroit Star Ft. Wayne transition into YIP (Yipsilanti, Willow Run Airport, Mich.)  That&rsquo;s a  &apos;standard terminal arrival route.&apos;   I was on a heading of about 030 degrees.  Both my first officer &amp; flight engineer were doing other duties when I first spotted traffic at my 1100 position, 10 miles &amp; slightly below me.  As captain, I always kept the red instrument panel lighting at a absolute minimum setting so as to have the best visibility outside.  I first spotted a cranberry red light.  It appeared as if it were just another aircraft in the clear night sky, no shape or size, just a red light in level steady flight about 4000 feet below me &amp; 10 miles to my left moving left to right at a steady speed of about 400 knots, about the same speed I was doing.  The size of the light was just like any other aircraft&rsquo;s rotating beacon or light, but this was a constant steady light, not like a normal pulsating rotating beacon that aircraft are required to have. I noticed in was headed straight towards a large thunderstorm cloud that was at my 1 o&apos;clock position and 10 miles.  This thunderstorm had constant &amp; consistent in-cloud to in-cloud lighting strikes that really was lighting up the large cloud like a Chinese lantern.  The red light kept a steady 400 knot speed aiming right at the storm cloud.  Then when it got to within 200 yards of the thundercloud itself, the red light changed course from 110 degree direction to a 250 degree direction, instantly, still maintaining the constant 400 knot speed.  It didn&apos;t turn, like an aircraft makes a turn, it just changed course, instantly, like a curser on a computer is capable of doing when you jerk your mouse control quickly left to right. Now it was heading straight towards a long line of constant lighting thunder storms, or squall line, that was at my 9 o&apos;clock position and about 20 miles off my left wing tip.  As I watched the light move at a constant speed from my right to my left directly in front of me, it suddenly climbed at a perfect 45 degree up angle, leveled off for a about 2 miles and then climbed again at a perfect 45 degree up angle without any change in speed either time, to an altitude about 3000 feet above me.  It then turned slightly right to a heading of about 250 degrees straight toward a point just in front of the first of a long line of constant lighting thunderstorms.As soon as the red orb got established on the new heading towards the all lit up lightning squall line to my left, this red light went from its 400 knot speed to, I&apos;m going to guess between 2ooo to 3000 miles per hour for about one long second then it again immediately went back to its slower 400 knot constant speed again.  It covered that 20 mile distance in just over a second, someone should be able to turn that into a speed in miles per hour.  It didn&apos;t accelerate up to that speed and it didn&apos;t decelerate back to the slower speed again, it just made an instant jump from a slow 400 knots to a really fast 3000 knot speed, for just over a second, covering the 20 mile distance and then immediately back to the same slower speed of about 400 knots.  It was amazing to watch.  After being a airline captain for over ten years I have never ever, before or since seen an object under such obvious control that maneuvered &amp; changed speed instantly, at will, so they could maneuver to and observe the constant &amp; consistent thunderstorm light show display.I watched it make one more turn to its left, a heading of about 190 degrees so as to parallel this long line of constant light shows off to its right side.  It was then behind me to my 8 o&apos;clock position.  I brought the attention of my other two crewmembers just before the red light made its two 45 degree climbs, they saw that but couldn&apos;t see to jump in speed an jump back in speed because it was off to the left side of our aircraft.  It was under something&rsquo;s control, sightseeing at thunderstorm light shows in the night, making 45 degree climbs and capable of unknown speeds that amazed me to the point that I only thought was to turn off my rotating beacon/navigation wing-tip lights to hide my aircraft in the dark from its view.  But I didn&apos;t even think to call Indy ARTCC and ask if they had it on their radar.  My two other crewmembers really didn&apos;t grasp what I quickly brought to their attention, it all was over in 2 minutes.  I saw something amazing, I don&apos;t know what it was, I just hope it was from Earth.I was an ATP, flying four engine aircraft all over North, South America and Europe, for about 30 of my 40 years aviation life, and I never even came close to having an accident.  I was lucky to always fly well maintained aircraft.  That&rsquo;s my story.", "We saw the government reaction to the lights after seeing the lights.Here is exactly what happened.  Me and some buddies were hanging out in our parking lot when 2 of us saw the same green light, very bright, fly by really quickly and disappear beyond the treeline, never saw it land.  We of course started yelling out of fear, we knew it had to land very far away, about 10 minutes later we saw a second, same speed, same green light, the crazy part that made us know this was no ordinary thing was that they wrere so low, and about 5-10 minutes later, government planes (so i think) started flying very low in the same direction of the ufos, not a normal amount of planes, maybe about 15-20, very very low and all in the same places.

The green looked almost like you could touch it, like it was living.  I swear on everything this is not a joke.  In almost no time it was gone.

I didn&apos;t think much of it as I thought it was an airliner on approach to IAH airport with it&apos;s bright landing lights on.However, as I continued to approach it, I realized that is wasn&apos;t moving, but hovering over the tree tops about two tenths of a mile off of the main road.  Also strange was the fact that despite a fairly clear evening, the object seemed to be shrouded in fog (too low for a cloud) and the large bright light began moving back and forth onto itself--more like a very large spot light.  Couldn&apos;t clearly see the object itself, but could see the light moving back and forth through the fog/vapor.  It was very large, 3-5 times the size of the largest airliner. It continued to hover as I passed it, and I turned off of the main road at first chance to get a better look.  The under side was also shrouded in fog that was illuminated by various small white lights with an overall triangular shape. There seemed to be a smaller platform underneath.As I turned my vehicle to try to follow it, it very slowly and silently moved off towards the north, just above the tree tops out of view.  From the back it looked like a dark rectangular object with 3 large white lights across the back. It was too big for a helicopter or an airliner. There were no other aircraft in the sky at that time. FM 1960 is a busy road and I&apos;m sure someone else had to see it, however there are often planes passing through there on approach to IAH.  If you weren&apos;t really paying attention you might just assume it was an airliner--except it was hovering.", "Triangle shaped object hovering for extended period of time and then finally vanished.I was brushing my teeth when my husband hollared for me. He was standing looking out our back window that faces a field. He said, &apos;look at the light, it&apos;s not moving&apos; it was far too close to be a star. He decided he was going to go out and look for it. I stayed by the window, cell phone in hand. He called and said it seemed a lot farther out than he had thought. The object was moving lower and farther away it appeared until it finally disappeared from my sight. Right before it disappeared I called him to tell him I could barely see it. He said he couldn&apos;t either. Like that, it was gone. This is the second time my husband has seen this particular shape, although last time it was a lot closer. Roughly 200 feet off the ground and right above the edge of the field behind our home. He was walking 2 houses down to his moms, the object paced him.

I guess I must have been between 10 and 15 years young back then. I am now 32 years of age.Ok, this story has been nagging me for many years, as I have never been completely sure if I have only been dreaming or if it has been real, that is why I have not really told anyone.One night I woke up in the middle of the night, and I got up to go into the kitchen to get myself some fresh water to drink from the sink in the kitchen on the second floor of our house.  I hopped on the kitchen table that was beside the big kitchen window in order to get a better view out of the window.  I had a habit of watching the stars out of that particular window quite frequently when beeing dark outside.So I gazed at the stars when I started to see some lights rising on the horizon of our small mountainous terrain here.  The lights quickly grew to light-spheres while coming down from the top of the little mountain that was straight ahead of the window.  They were moving in a straight decending line directly towards our house, keeping rather near to the ground at all times and very very fast.  So fast that for a moment I even feared they would crush into our house.  In a splitsecond they stopped dead ahead of the kitchen window at only a few, maybe 3 to 5 meters away.  The whole travel could not have lasted more then 3-4 seconds in total.  I just checked from Google Earth that the top of the mountain is approx. 500m bird-line from our house, high-differential of maybe 100 meters.Now I could see the orbs / spheres very clearly.  There were maybe 5-7 of them, each one kind of translucient, still radiating a quite strong light.  Each one in a different color: blue, orange, red, purple, yellow, almost like a rainbow.  The colored light seemed the come from the spheres outer shell only, beeing unevenly distributed.  Kind of like the soap-bubbles having this kind of oily, uneven texture.  The texture now only beeing unevenly distrubuted patters of light.  The spheres must have been about 1/2 to 1 meter in diameter.For a few seconds the spheres where hovering still before my window.  Then they started to move again, spinning around our house, light sipping in from the different windows in the different rooms.  That got me freaking out and I started to panic, as I realized that I was alone at home that night, my parents beeing on some of their parties.  I think i started screaming, running around eratically around the house (of that I am sure). I was really really scared and I don&apos;t remeber having any clear thought in that moments.Weird thing is, I do not know how it ended.  That is why I was always struggling with myself, pondering wether it was only a dream or something real.  And I still am. I was wondering if there is anyone out there, having experienced something similar.Although having a strong interest in the matter of UFO, I try to remain sceptic. To this very day I have not seen anyting that has convinced me of UFO&apos;s or e.g. dimensional things beeing real.For the above stated reason I will give permission to release my contact info.

The colors on each craft seemed to oddly spread and then go back to normal.  As I&apos;m writing this the crafts are gone now... my friend jus looked at the sky and told me there not there anymore.  I&apos;m not joking I swear.  I don&apos;t know if it was ufos but its clearly a big possibility.  My friend and I are 15 years old and the other people here are drunk adults so the other 8 witnesses won&apos;t be good.

Very shiny and bright.May 3,2010 at 7:45p.m. My second visual of an unusual object. We were at the baseball field and halfway through the game I was talking to a couple of people and looked up and saw this gray silver object in the air. I told everyone to look. It was very shiny as if the sun was reflecting off of it. It seemed to be mostly shaped like a rocket.  There was no sound, no lights, no smoke. It looked like it was floating with the front  of it a little lifted. It was not going slow or going fast.  Several people thought maybe a plane but it did not look or sound like a plane.  This time I had my camera and took several pictures. Some of them are hard to see but I am sharing  with you anyway.

I do know that it was in 1995, I believe in the summertime. Myself and a friend (both about 16 yrs of age) witnessed it from my mother&apos;s home in Longbranch, WA.  I have checked on and off for years to see if I could find any similar reports occurred in the same area around the same timeframe and have been unable to find any to date.  I recently found the website for NUFORC, so I thought I would give a shot at reporting it here to see if I could get any further information.  I have to admit that in a way the following description will sound like something you might read or see in a sci-fi story, but I can assure that I and my friend witnessed the event as I will describe in the text below firsthand with the exception of the details from the following morning which were relayed to me by my mother, which seem to bear relevance to the situation so I will include that as well.At some point late night or early morning, I will say around midnight would be a fair estimate, the two of us were sitting in my room.  I looked through my window and saw a bright light through the branches of a tree outside which at first I took to be just a bright star in the night sky.  Within the next several minutes I looked out again and the light was still there in the same position but seemed a little brighter.  Again a few minutes passed and I looked out again, but at this time I could see that the light was in another position relative to the tree, so at this time I mentioned it to my friend and we decided to watch it through the window as the position changed seemed unusual.  Again it stayed in this position for a couple minutes while we watched and then suddenly disappeared and reappeared almost instantly at yet a new point. At this juncture we decided to go outside to watch as it seemed to be getting closer and would soon be at a point where we could not easily see it above from the window.  Outside we watched for several more minutes with the same process repeating where the object would be stationary in the sky, disappear, and then reappear at another point.  I would say this went on for what seemed to be at least 20 to 30 minutes.  If I recall the directions correctly the object was north of us to begin with when I first saw it and progressively moved south toward us as it went (I will continue to use this directional assumption for the duration of this account).At this time from the southeast we heard the sound of jets approaching from the direction of McChord Air Force Base which is located in Tacoma, which is the nearest large city to Longbranch.  We located them in the sky and saw multiple jets moving in the direction of the light.  When they appeared to be nearing it, it moved to a new point in the same manner as before and the jets turned and went toward it again.  This repeated several times with the same results over several more minutes. More jets approached and this continued with the object now moving further into the east.  They progressively moved out further over the surrounding woods in that direction  until we could no longer see them over the trees.  I would estimate this cat and mouse between them to have gone on for at least 15 to 20 minutes before we lost sight of them all with an estimate of around maybe 8 to 10 jets participating overall.  We watched a few more minutes to be sure they didn&apos;t come back in our directio! n and then saw a large dark object coming just over the trees from the same direction the jets and object disappeared from, passing directly over our heads.  When it got near and passed above us it clearly appeared to be a large black helicopter running with no visible lights and with no discernible sound from the rotors.  This is the end of what we saw firsthand.The next morning my mother returned from a trip she had taken to visit family in the Tacoma area the day before and when she got home she asked if anything unusual had happened the night before.  When I asked why she was asking she stated that when she was passing through Longbranch on the way to our home that there were multiple government-plated cars parked by the road with men in suits stopping any passersby to ask if they had seen or heard anything going on the previous night, without giving any information into the nature of their inquiry.  I informed her of what I&apos;d seen but we agreed to keep the information to ourselves at that time.  We never heard or saw anything further on it.  As stated previously, the last part involving my mother was not first-hand, but it does seem pertinent to the prior night&apos;s event, although she passed away a few years ago and is no longer around to verify that particular aspect.If you have taken the time to read this in total without discounting it offhand, I appreciate your time and apologize for the length of it, although I did feel I should be as detailed and thorough as possible.  I hope to find out through this outlet if anyone else has seen or heard anything about what happened here, but if not I shall continue to search on my own in the future as I would like to know what occurred here.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

The craft had 2 red lights in front of it, and a red light in the rear, center of the two front lights.  After the craft passed the car, the 2 front red lights dissapeared, and a 4th light, this one white, was in the center of the craft, but was only visible from the side and rear of the craft.  3 of us were in the car, and we all saw this craft.  There were no sudden movements of the craft, no sound coming from the craft, and none of the lights were flashing, meaning it was not an airplane or helecopter.

I got even closer and could see that this object emitting the light was about 1/4 mile past the airport and somewhat in-line with the airport beacon due to my perspective.  I passed the airport and neared the object and could clearly see it was a UFO.  I stopped adjacent to its position alongside the road and exited my vehicle to better observe it.  The object was large and saucer shaped with bright lights of different colors along its outer rim and on top and bottom.

At 11:40 p.m. we went out on to the balcony to enjoy the night air.  We were passing to the east of the Dominican Republic after leaving St. Thomas earlier that afternoon.Just after going out on the balcony I noticed a while spherical shaped light out on the water a couple of hundred yards out form the ship. I remarked to my wife, &quot;What&apos;s that light out there&quot;?  She said, &quot; It&apos;s a ship&quot;. But then I pointed out that there wasn&apos;t a ship to be seen and the light didn&apos;t look like a ship light. It was very intense, bright white, and there were no other lights around. Within seconds of saying this, the light began to rise up from the ocean surface. It reached a height of approximately 30 degrees above the horizon. After rising up the light appeared to be more spherical. It then began to perform acrobatic maneuvers. The object would move along a few seconds in one direction then dart back across the sky at a nearly 180 degree angle from the direction it was traveling. As we were seeing this we pointed the object out to a group on a balcony just above us. They confirmed that we were all seeing the same thing.The object darted around in the sky for a few minutes then moved back down to the ocean surface. As it moved down, it appeared to be coming right at the ship. All of us watching the object kind of stepped back and had a moment wondering if the object was going to come all the way to the ship. As the object approached the ship, about 150 yards out, it went into the water. We could see the light under the water for a few seconds, and then it disappeared.While watching the object my wife and I were talking to the other witnesses making comments like, &quot;Are you seeing what I am seeing?&quot;, &quot;Wow!&quot; and variations of &quot;Holy Crap!&quot;. We confirmed with each other that we had all seen the same thing.There is no doubt we all saw the same thing. However, none of us had any idea what we had just seen. The object moved in ways I never seen a manmade flying object move before. It cut and darted faster than any bird I&apos;ve ever seen. At times it moved so fast it was hard to track it moving across the sky. Then it would stop.It was an incredible event. I have no idea what the object&apos;s origins or purpose was. I have no idea if it was man made or of some other origin. If it was man made, we have  craft that can do some incredible maneuvering. That it went into the water and disappeared  made it all the more incredible and all the more mysterious to me. I have no way of knowing other than the what I saw and the feeling I got while seeing it, but I&apos;m pretty sure we all saw something not of human making. I could be wrong. Its possible we have some fantastic craft.

PDT on April 15th, 2010 in Ventura California.I was looking toward the west at the constellation of Orion when I heard a brief &quot;screech&quot; sound lasting around one second and coming from the vicinity which I was viewing. Thinking it was an owl I quickly looked for it and saw a faint silhouette of something moving in the clear sky.  At first it looked like it was a large bird high in the air as the front and two sides were heavily darkened against the mostly dark sky.  It was moving toward me and over a period of about 2 seconds it became clearer and resembled a hang-glider. It was descending and moving toward the east and seemed to be gliding smoothly, making no sound that I could hear.   As it reached its closest point to me, what looked to be several hundred feet or so, a very sharp and definite outline appeared.  It was an equilateral triangle and had three circular areas symmetrically placed near the tips. There was a slight contrast between the gray triangular area and the circular areas, as the circular portions ! had a very faint glowing quality to them.  As it silently continued moving away from me, the craft seemed to have only 2 dimensions.  It looked completely flat like it was a projection.  It began to gently ripple with smooth wave patterns and disappeared within a little over a second after doing so. The total event lasted around 8 seconds.I have my master&rsquo;s degree in physics and teach college level physics as a career.  I am also involved in astronomy.  I am about 20 minutes drive from a naval base and do hear and see military aircraft from time to time. Though it is possible that I was seeing a &quot;secret aircraft,&quot;  I am doubtful that such a craft would be flown in such plain view as it was very apparent what was seen.  Judging from the change in angular diameter, its descent was fairly rapid and it changed from a dark, fluctuating shadow into a crisp configuration, lightly contrasted against the clear dark sky.  I would estimate the base of the triangle to be around 50 feet, though I could be way off.   Once leveled off at around 500 feet, it glided forward at perhaps 100 miles per hour until it disappeared from sight somewhat like a mirage does. The measured angle from the horizontal at which the craft began to wave out of sight was around 20 degrees.  It all happened very fast and was short in duration, m! aking it difficult to be definite on measurements.  All in all, I saw a craft without doubt and I am perplexed by what I have seen.", "Large orange and yellow dome in Los Banos California.We were driving down I-5 south through Los Banos California on 6/16/10, at around 1:50 am.

It was solid white (at least I don&rsquo;t remember any markings or lights) and triangular in shape.  It was long and narrow, looking about the shape of the long paper airplanes we made as kids.  It was moving very slowly and completely silently.I watched for a moment and then looked down to tell my grandson to look up.  When we both looked up, the object was gone.  It was broad daylight and the sky was completely clear with no clouds into which it could have disappeared.  I could not have taken my eyes off of it for more than a few seconds.  It would have had to move at a tremendous speed to disappear in that time.

Then I saw 2 rows of 3 large rectangles of blue white glowing light.Each rectangle could have been house size.  They appeared to be at the rear of the craft as it moved away from me.  This reminded me of the Star Wars movie and the engines of &quot;The Millennium Falcon&quot;.

It was flying along very slow for a jet and it had a ball of light traveling below it near the ground at the same rate of speed.  You can see the ball in the first few frames, might be a reflection too.I grabbed my video camera and while driving started taping.  In the beginning I passed a freeway sign, Blake Ranch Rd. Exit 1 mile.  I recorded until just after I pass the exit, the craft was to far away, maybe 3 or 4 miles.  It would have passed over the Kingman Airport or very close.When I played the tape later in Kingman, the time code showed I had traveled that one mile in 32 seconds!

I left the kitchen and went to my living room and I still had that   pressure in my ears so I walked outside. When I got outside I just kinda looked up at the   stars and above my house was what looked like a plane but with very little lights.The lights on the thing didn&apos;t seem to strobe and there was no sound coming from it.The   plane or elicopter or whatever it was wasn&apos;t moving so I thought it must be a helicopter   until it disappeared and reappeared closer over my head, and just as soon as it done that   it done something that&apos;s kinda hard to explain it moved like if you moved your hand  in  front of the TV or computer monitor But it was moving extremely fast to the point of were   it was hard for me to track it with my eyes.

Witness #1, a 50 year old male, stepped outside to smoke an after dinner cigarette, but almost immediately returned to the house to have myself and the other witness, his 52 year old wife, step outside to look at something in the sky.  I was 17 at the time and living with them.The three of us went outside and Witness #1 directed our attention to two bluish-gray chevron or boomerang shaped objects low on the horizon.  They were identical in size, color and shape with one exception explained below.  Instead of being parallel to the horizon, both objects were perpendicular to it.The objects appeared to be about 1 mile north of us traveling west at very low speed, perhaps 5 mph or less.  The lead object was perhaps 500 to 1,000 feet in front of the second object.  We did not hear any sound from the objects, but I did not expect to since they appeared to be about a mile away.Witness #1 went back into the house and returned with a pair of 10 X 50 binoculars.  All three of us had a turn viewing the objects with them.  I noticed while viewing through the binoculars the top third of the second object was blinking into and out of sight (similar to a fluorescent bulb immediately after being turned on) at the rate of about once per second.  I was left with the impression the second object was experiencing mechanical problems or some sort of malfunction and was being escorted or possibly towed by the first object as the distance between them never deviated.After watching the objects for several minutes, they both disappeared behind some trees and we never discussed the incident again.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

I couldn&rsquo;t tell the size of it. It was either really high and very large or really low and not that large.  If I put my arm all the way out it was the slightly larger than my hand.  It had lights pulsating in sequence beginning from the point of the triangle (the front) down to the back and then back up to the front. When it reached the front the lights would pause for a second and then start the rotation over again.  I followed the object for a total of about 10 minutes, and was able to get a pretty good look of it.  The lights on it where a light blue in color.  The bottom/belly of the object appeared to be rounded. The object appeared to be a midnight blue in color but that could have been a reflection from the flashing blue lights.  For about 5 minutes the object was going with traffic while zigzagging left and right over the freeway.  After a little bit, still traveling in a zigzag path, it began to speed up until it traveled out of sight.  At 9 pm my boyfriend called me.  While explaining to him what I had seen,  I saw another light.  At that point I was coming up to the agricultural check point on the northbound side of I-5.  At first I thought it was an airplane.  When I got closer I realized it wasn&rsquo;t moving and it was only about 100 yards above the freeway.

Tamalpais State Park.  To the left side of the car, shinning down into a valley, appeared three green (light in color) triangular beams of light, each the same proportion.  At first, we believed the lights were coming from a helicopter.  However, why were they green and triangular?  After about 10 seconds, I stopped the car and rolled down the car windows.  There were no sounds from a helicopter or anything else, only silence.  We could not see what was generating the lights because of the overhead trees.  After approximately 10 more seconds, the lights went out.  Still no sound, only silence.  We could not explain what it was and joked about it being a UFO.

I observed the UFOs first at about 2200, and saw two through trees.  I knew they were far away based on how fast I was moving and how the objects remained still as the trees obscuring my view of them zoomed past me as I drove by them. I saw two first.  They appeared as oval shaped amber lights.  My view of them vanished as houses obscured my view of them. I then proceeded with a patrol for work, then moved to another location.At this location about 8 miles North of the first, I again saw them; about 30 minutes after the first sighting.  This time I saw 8 or more of these large lights. The first illuminated, about 3/4 the size of the full moon in the sky.  Then many more appeared to the left, and in a sort-of strobe like way the lights on the right went out and ones to the left came on.  They also zoomed around (though never moved far) they were not stationary.I pointed it out to some residents in a pool of the community I was at.

I was looking out my driverside window towards the city, which would have been directly east of the city.  It was an elongated triangular shaped object, seemingly delta shaped, which was either glowing or reflecting a bright yellowish white light.  At first glance I thought I was seeing moonlight through a break in distant clouds but quickly realized that the body of light was moving.It was traveling southbound with me and without immediately considering the details I just assumed it was a particularly visible conventional aircraft, but it&apos;s odd shape kept my attention.  With only my own perspective to judge from I couldn&apos;t accurately determine the objects distance from me and therefore couldn&apos;t figure its speed or altitude but after watching it for a couple minutes I realized that it was either much too large and traveling much too fast to be anything conventional or it was flying much too low over the city.  Within a few minutes I was taking the 35 East exit and at this point the shape was south east of the city.Around this point it split into two lights, one was directly above the other.  The bottom of the two lights seemed to have a slight red hue and the top was a pale white.

We were headed to his Uncle&apos;S  house for a casual New Years Eve family gathering in Wheaton.  As we headed west on Warrenville Road we spotted a light suspended in the sky over the field next to the road.  It was a clear quiet night.  I begged my ex to pull over to the side of the road so we could get a better look at it.  There was nothing attached to the light...no tower beneath it; nothing from which it was suspended.  Once we stopped (as did a couple cars in front of us and 1 behind us) the light started scanning the field beneath it (EDGE OF mORTON aRBORETUM). I rolled down my window to listen for some type of engine noise...thinking maybe it was attached to a small aircraft (thinking manmade)...I could only hear a PULSATING humming/vibrating noise similar the noise of power line towers.  As I reached for the door handle to get out of the car my ! ex grabbed my jacket sleeve and said, &quot;no! Don&apos;t get out!&quot; I pleaded with him to back up so maybe I could see it better...as he put the car in reverse and slowly startED back the object stopped scanning the ground and the light was immediately extinguished like a camera shutter closes.At that point my ex shifted into gear and sped away. My ex would never discuss what we saw admit to anyone what we witnessed and asked me not to, fearing people would think we were &quot;nuts&quot;.

The light looked as if it was many miles away and somewhat high in the sky.  It was round and was very white but looked filtered as if it was through clouds or fog around it, but there were no clouds at that time.

The object was in the direction of Luke AFB from our position.", "2 lights over Hiller&oslash;d Denmarkwas sitting in my apartment in Hiller&oslash;d, Denmark, and went out to get some air when i noticed 2 flying objects going kinda fast but not in a straigt line.. they both had a orange light from them but one of the object was loosing light..  suddenly the light was gone and as i saw the other object move the line dissapeared aswell.  i could still the object as it moved away till i lost focus of it..they made no sound!", "Did not notice the strange objects only when checking pictures when returning back home from holidaytaken from Norfolk botanical gardens overlooking norfolk international airport. objects were not seen only when checking pictures on the pc and croping them close can u see the strange objects.

It was very big and glowing at least 5 times more then any star.  In fact it is full moon and it had almost the same intensity.  Everything happened in Corby, Northampton United Kingdom.  After like 2 seconds it got above us and it did a sudden move to the right and back to initial position.  This move was repeated one more time and then it increased speed and passed over our heads.  It looked like it stopped for a few seconds moved left and right in this time and after that it just disappeared.The shape was bizarre to me since it looked like a stingray; there were 4 orange lights one on top two on the sides and one at the tail.  They did not blink or change intensity all the time.  The colour was a very beautiful orange and intense.I just want to add the sky was clear there were 18 Celsius or 64 Fahrenheit and also it was a full moon.  The UFO was way to big in order to be mistaken with a star or an airplane.  There was no sound from it or anything else that will get your attention.I tried to take a picture with my cell phone but nothing came clear.  If there is a buzz or someone else saw it I will be happy to share my experience with him/her.", "Black triangle spotted over home after I heard loud lets fly by my house.Around 2:30 am I was awoken by what sounded like 2 or 3 military jets roaring by just outside my window. There is no base around Wenatchee so we rarely see military aircraft.  When I looked out the window I saw a the wavy distortion that you would expect from something extremely hot. Like a hot road distorting the scenery on the horizon.  But I saw no lights or planes in the darkness. I laid back down and stared up at the stars through my skylight, which is apprx. 8&apos; x 8&apos; in size. Around 10 min. later, I saw a classic black triangle floating silently above my house.  Perfectly framed in my skylight as if planned. I could see it blacking out the stars behind it more than I could actually see the craft, but it was a definite triangle.  Moving quite slowly. Nobody I have asked, around town, saw it. My girlfriend woke up to the jet sounds but nobody else seems to have heard it.  Which I find hard to believe because it was insanely loud.There was also a little spot plane circling the area of my house for about 30 min before the sighting and an hour after, which is very strange.  I never see or hear planes circling that late. And I live by a small airport.That&apos;s about it, really.  I have seen several ufos over the years but never the infamous triangle!

PD))", "It was around 9:20pm last night (May 4, 2010) and it was pitch black; the sky was clear and we could see the stars, and there was some wind, it was warm.  My husband and I were walking our 2 dogs, and we were passing through the parking lot at Bridgeport Shopping Center, which is at the NE corner of the intersection of Newhall Ranch Road and McBean Parkway, in Valencia, California.  Valencia is part of the incorporated town of Santa Clarita, if you&apos;re searching for it on a map.  Bridgeport Shopping Center has pedestrian walkways and lower buildings - it&apos;s new, and is mostly empty in the evenings, we guess there were about 10 other people around the shopping center at that moment but no one was near us. We were at the far East side of the parking lot where there are few street lights.We were walking East toward Grandview Drive when my husband noticed a long line of red lights in the sky that appeared above the treeline, not too high up, and were acting in a very bizarre fashion. If the lights were on some kind of craft/s then it was completely silent.There were about 12 lights - all RED, no white, and they were in a line, as if connected to a leading edge. At first it was just hovering - for maybe one minute, and then started to slowly float Southeast. The string of lights never descended. We didn&apos;t see a solid shape behind the lights, it was too dark, we could only see the lights themselves. They all seemed to be about the same size. The size of the lights themselves -- relative to a star in the night sky -- they were the same size as the brightest star in the sky. All together, the span of the lights in a line reached almost completely across our entire field of view. They were above the horizon, well above the treeline, and above the rooftops of everything around.It was very hard to gauge where exactly the thing was, we guestimated it was over Eastern Santa Clarita, East of the 5 Freeway, but West of the 14, North of Lyons Avenue and potentially South of Newhall Ranch Road, where we were standing &ndash; although it appeared directly over us. It was a straight line of lights at a 45 degree angle. Like a stick, turned up on an angle. This was the shape &quot;/&quot;, with the tallest part rising on its right side, with the whole thing heading slowly South by SouthEast. It (the string of lights) never broke formation. It slowly floated South-South East until it became so dim we could no longer see it, without ever changing the distances between the lights themselves. They were not evenly spaced. The whole line silently hovered and then slowly floated off, with entire sections blinking on and off randomly. It was very long/wide! As a gauge, if I hold my thumb out away from me (about 2.5 feet) and my thumb represents one of the lights that we saw - then! the whole line of lights took up my entire field of view. (It took about 5 minutes for it to disappear from view.)  Just when we thought the whole line was lit up, another light would blink on, to the far left or far right - making the total string even wider/longer. The lights did not look like flares to me. I have seen flares and these lights were constantly blinking on and off, wildly -- quickly pulsating. There was never a time when all the lights were on uniformly at the same time, they were always shimmering. Sometimes whole sections would just go out and come back on again 10 seconds later, in random order.The lights, always red, were all blinking/shimmering fast, but not uniformly, and not strobing in any regular pattern and with no regular timing, not the way aircraft safety lights would. Any one light also had an irregular pattern. We thought -- could it be a squadron of helicopters? But the lights didn&apos;t behave in a predictable way. These red lights would go on and off in random order and with random timing by first becoming dim, then bright, then dim, then off, and then bright again -- as if they were shimmering. My husband commented that it looked like the special effects on TV when a craft goes into &quot;cloaking&quot; mode, or the way lights look reflected in water. He is a skeptic and he was dumbfounded as to what we were seeing.Position relative to each other: the lights kept their exact distance from one another the whole time, even as the line of lights drifted South. The size of the individual lights was like looking at red car brake lights from 2 miles away. That&apos;s the only way I can describe it - against the night sky they were as bright and big as the biggest/brightest star in the sky. We can&apos;t tell how high the string of lights was, but we couldn&apos;t see any other stars through them. We could not see if it was one solid craft, or many lights. They did remain in a stable position relative to one another - at least giving the illusion that they were along the edge of one craft. I&apos;ve seen sheriff&apos;s dept. helicopters fly nightly over town and I would say these lights appeared to be floating around the same height. They were not too distant, definitely over town, not over the mountains. It took several minutes for them to go a few miles.We ran East along the sidewalk to keep a view of it, and eventually the line disappeared as it floated out of view, and became dimmer, eventually disappearing completely from our line of sight. We stared for 5 more minutes and then started to walk home, heading East toward the edge of the parking lot. Then we saw another set of lights, doing exactly the same thing, just over the treeline to the East of Grandview Road. The line had the same weird pattern of red lights shimmering off and on and lasted for 2-3 minutes but was not quite as wide and was oriented horizontally. It didn&apos;t drift or descend, it just got more and more dim and finally was down to 2 lights, and then disappeared.We stared a little longer, and then walked home. I immediately called the Sheriff station for Santa Clarita. I reported what we saw and the police officer said they had over 100 calls reporting UFOs already that night. He could not say if people reported the same thing we saw.The sky was filled with other aircraft that night, heading into Burbank airport or LAX. They all looked normal compared to this.Our backgrounds: My husband is in IT and I am a technology and sciences editor for a national publication. We&apos;ve never seen anything out of the ordinary before and have lived here 3 years, so we also know what&apos;s common in the sky here. My husband is a firm skeptic, and I&apos;m uncertain. I&apos;m aware of military testing at VAFB and I have seen missile tests at a distance from the 101, and this didn&apos;t look like that. I&apos;ve also seen small meteors and meteor showers and they don&apos;t hover and glide.", "4 flashing red lights forming a square lthen a line flashing o and off4 lingts forming a square with red lights then they all moved to a line with the lights coming on and off ive never been so freaked out by seeing this.", "Red Tube In skyI was with my friend Matt and we were fishing between marthas vineyard and nantucket (Massachusetts).

I went to my apartment on the third floor and saw it out the window with binoculars.  It was a long black tube with a small protrusion at one end at a 90 degree angle respective to the body.  Wife said it had a long split running the full length of the body that was slightly lighter than the surrounding body&apos;s black color.  I could not see that from my location.  It was 1/2 mile from me and about 400 feet off the ground. Wife saw it from 9:10 to 9:15 when she had to make a turn to get the kids to school.  I saw it from 9:13 to 9:17 when it disappeared.  I didn&apos;t see the direction but it was definitely gone from the sky.  Wife said it kept coming closer then going farther away.  It was completely vertical to 10 degrees when she saw it.

What I saw and my friend said he saw were two different things.What I remember seeing, was a long, maybe 20ft. in length, and ten feet in width, flying object. I was going about 60 miles per hour, and the object after diving down out of the clouds, leveled off and seemed to be going faster than we were driving.I could see the outline of the object, but the middle of the object seemed to be translucent. While trying to drive and look up at this object, the object, even though flying straight, seemed to turn and look towards us. I remember I saw what I can only describe as two eyes, that were about the size of can of pop in circumference, and bright blue, look back towards us.Whatever I saw, then flew back up into the clouds.

I was about 16-17 yrs old.   After picking up a girl in my car, we went to the local parking area. At that time it had the nickname &quot;Pregnant Point&quot; (how appropriate).This area is located in Somersworth, NH between two roads that run parallel to one another:  Salmon Falls Rd and Rt 108 (the old Rt 16).  No more than a mile between the two.  This road today starts at the corner of a local tool crib and almost across the street is a gas station that once had the name Agway.   From Rt 108, going towards Salmon Falls Rd, there is a dirt road to the right and that&rsquo;s where we had parked that evening.   Backed into the woods on the left hand side perpendicular onto this road we sat talking (completely sober) and while talking we noticed what appeared to be a star way off in the sky that would just grow bright and then fade and continue to do this for awhile.   We at first thought that it could have been a plane but didn&rsquo;t move at all.   After a few minutes we had just ignored it.   While looking at one another and talking, I glanced back at the sky and went into a sort of horrific shock by the presence of a huge saucer hovering no more than 40 ft or so just above the tree tops across the dirt road we were on and no more than 25-30 ft away.  It was aprox. 75 yds or so in diameter, silverish from what I remember and had numerous lights revolving around the bottom rim.I was in such a state of shock, that I couldn&rsquo;t even speak with tears running down my face and trying to speak but only had an open mouth with no words.  This girl whom I have no idea to this day who she is, didn&rsquo;t see it at all at this time and kept asking me what was wrong.  She was kinda freaked by my state of shock.  This saucer made absolutely no noise and vanished in about 5-6 seconds maybe a little longer but not much.As soon as I was able, I started my car and still unable to talk, took a right back onto this dirt road and then another right back onto pregnant point (this girl kept asking me what the matter was).  I still couldn&rsquo;t talk at this time.As I turned left onto Salmon Falls Rd, she screamed like a blood curling scream from some horror film.  I knew then she had just seen it.  When I turned onto Salmon Falls Rd., she had spotted this UFO out the passenger window over the Salmon Falls River and the swamp next to it.Once in Rochester and no idea where I had dropped her off, I went home and called the Rochester Police to report what had happened.   All they said was, &quot;Thank you.&quot;  I was a little set back by the response but being young, I just let it go.   Who would ever believe me anyway?   I had told no one else until the next day because it was a little late that night.The next day, I was driving my car on Central Ave in nearby Dover, NH, and I tuned into the local radio station WTSN in Dover.  I hadn&rsquo;t talked to my brother ((name deleted)) at all.  ((name deleted)) had just come on WTSN because he was at that time, he was the Strafford County ((deleted)).He had reported UFO sightings in numerous areas; Exeter Police reported sightings from officers themselves, Dover Police had sightings over the Junior High School, Somersworth Police had sightings over the water tower and Rochester Police chased a UFO up Rochester Hill Rd which is actually Rt 108 (the old Rt 16) just a few miles from where I was.To top it all off, a friend (whom I had no knowledge of where he worked at this time) was in the local newspaper: &quot;Foster&rsquo;s Daily Democrat&quot; and had reported a confirmed sighting that night.  He was working at the Agway gas station no more than &frac34; of a mile in parallel to where I was parked.A few years ago, I had called the Rochester Police for police reports of that time and they told me that there were no records of my calling.  However, at the time of this writing I have physically gone in and put in a request for records.I later on had researched that time period and found ((name deleted)) report in the newspaper of Foster&rsquo;s dated August 17, 1974.  Some years later his brother and I were at coffee and he remembers his brothers sighting who now lives out of state.Since that time, I have told my story to WTSN in the late 1990&rsquo;s on a live call in show called, &quot;The Open Mike&quot;  program and have also told my story to  &quot;The Bay&quot; (98.7) radio station on an early morning show.What I saw is as real as you and I my friend.Today, the trees where I had spotted this UFO appear to have not grown as tall as the others nearby.  I hope that you can add this to your archives.Thank you for time for what this is worth.((NUFORC Note:  Time of sighting is not indicated by witness.

Then, it got dimmer quickly and then COMPLETELY disappeared.  About a half hour afterwards, my cousin and I were watching what I thought was a star.  It is there every night in about the same place, and blinks red, blue, and other colors almost like a strobe light.  Last night, though, we were watching it very closely and in less than an hours time, the &quot;star&quot; had moved very slowly to the right, so much so that it could not have been a star.  Then, the star was moving up and down slightly, and left to right very slightly.  Soon after it was moving that way, another small, bright orange light appeared up and to the right of it, OUT OF NOWHERE went down and to! the right and back up fairly quickly, and completely disappeared.

The light could have been reflecting off something else because for what I could see , this thing almost blended perfectly with the night sky except for its reflective ability . Maybe it was a stealth , but I think that if I had a rifle , that it was close enough to hit . I just want to know if anyone else saw this thing in my area , and was this a real sighting .", "Blue sphere moving slowly at low altitude, stopping twice to hover over road and then lake, vanishing with incredible speed5-31-10  I have not told anyone else about this event, with the exception of my children.  I was never completely sure about what it was that I actually saw, but I know what I saw was real.  I did not want to sound like a nut case, or someone that was trying to get attention through sensational happenings.  However, after years of watching programs about UFO sightings and reading testimonials of others that have described over and over almost exactly, in most cases what I witnessed, I have finally decided for sure that I saw a UFO that did not seem to be anything that could be designed and operated by people from Earth.My wife and I were driving home after checking on our employees that worked late shifts.  We were heading North on I-405 through Kirkland WA.  My wife was sleeping.  It was about 4:30 am when I saw a bright fluorescent sphere moving very slow from east to west.  It had just cleared over the top of a hill to my right and lowered to a few hundred ft. above the road.  Then it stopped directly above the road and hovered there for a few seconds.  I yelled at my wife to wake up and to take a look at what was right in front of us.  The sphere started to slowly move west across the road.  It kept an altitude relative to the slope of the hillside covered with houses, as this area is heavily populated.  It moved slowly out over Lake Washington.  When it was a few hundred feet out over the lake, it again stopped and hovered for a few seconds.  At arms distance the size of the object was relative to the size of a basketball.  The color was about the same as the blue of propane or natural gas when burning.  It made absolutely no sound.  At this time my wife was witnessing the event as well as I was.  Then suddenly the sphere slightly expanded and then rapidly shrank into a pin sized dot that lasted for a second or two, as it vanished with incredible speed to the North, almost as if it just disappeared.  We were both speechless for a few seconds and then we verified with each other that we both saw what we saw and could not put any logical explanation forth to name this as a natural earthly happening.I no longer feel like I need to suppress my feeling about what we saw that early morning.  I know I have seen something like all of the others that have reported seeing something similar.  Unless there is a great secret, being well hidden from the masses, what we have witnessed is not from this planet.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))", "Sighting of 12 bright, shiny objects darting about late afternoon eastern sky.At approximately 5:35 p.m. on Thursday, April 22, 2010, myself and a co-worker witnessed an unusual constellation of bright, shiny objects darting about in the sky.  I was situated in the center of the city of Claremont, CA 91711, looking up at the eastern sky.  My angle of elevation was at approximately 75 degrees.  The cluster, of about a dozen or so objects, was loosely arranged in a random configuration, about the size of the sun.  The size of the individual objects was a bit larger than a star.  Their movement was of a random darting about; sometimes appearing to suddenly disappear and then reappear.  I observed the phenomenon for about 2-3 minutes, before it abruptly stopped and disappeared altogether.", "Nine menacing crafts rounded up a large group of campers on the Colorado River during one incredibly long night.On the last Saturday night of March, 1978, I was with a group of friends on a spring break camping trip in a former California State Campground, 18 miles north of Winterhaven California. I say former because the facility had been virtually destroyed by massive flooding from the Colorado River where it had served as a landing for travelers navigating down the River. Before it had been destroyed, it had housed a seasonal general store, as well as a large camping area with large bathroom-shower facilities and Ranger trailer up on a hill overlooking the grounds. But by this year, all of that was gone, and the trailer abandoned by the Rangers but the area was still used by a handful of hardcore campers.During this last Saturday in March, the nine of us were on the peak of last mountain at the farthest end of a chain of foothills that began at the campgrounds and ran north along the Colorado River ending at this last peak overlooking a panoramic view of the entire northwestern desert and river valley below.Before our encounter that night, two truly amazing events occurred.  First we experienced an unexplainable loud buzzing electrical discharges through our hands when flicking our index fingers. We could hear the loud buzz, as well as feel the strong current running through our fingers. This lasted approximately a few minutes and then disappeared.  The second strange anomaly to occur next was - the sunset we watched from the peak lasted a abnormally long time - at least two hours longer than it normally would. We commented on this several times while in progress but no one could explain and unfortunately, no one had a watch to give an accurate accounting. However, it was undoubtedly much longer than can be explained by any normal physical means. And as if that wasn&apos;t strange enough, it ended so abruptly, we were caught completely by surprise in the complete darkness of the night. We normally would have already made the long trek back to camp, a couple of miles through the rug! ged foothills, during the twilight which always proceeds the setting of the sun. But in this case, we were so mesmerized by the incredibly long beautiful smoldering orange glow of the sun which appeared to stick right behind the mountains in the far west, we didn&apos;t leave, we just naturally expected the benefit of the post sunset, slowly fading twilight, which for some reason didn&apos;t happen . . . defying all laws of physics.Once we were confronted with this sudden darkness, we tried to not let it freak us out and gather ourselves for the long treacherously difficult trip back in total darkness, the moon not yet risen, and frankly were a little more than concerned about our safety getting down - especially down the narrow path from the precariously steep cliff we were on - hundreds of feet to the canyon floor below. Anyway, right as we were beginning our descent down, one of our group spotted a star erratically zooming across the night sky in straight lines from point to point. We all began to watch, suddenly pointing to other stars that were behaving in a similar fashion. It didn&apos;t take long for the group of us to realize that they couldn&apos;t possibly be stars but must be lights in our own night sky that just resembled stars. And sure enough, with in a few minutes, they all gathered together in a tight rotating ball growing larger as they dropped out of the night sky in to the distant horizon,! appearing to settle into the river basin several miles northwest up stream from our location.Although below our view, we watched their bright domes of light wind down the river south towards us. In a fairly short time they came into our view as they appeared from around a bend in the river entering our section of the valley. There were nine crafts flying in a diamond formation. They each had several search lights fanning the area as if they were frantically looking for something or someone. As they came underneath us in the washes below, we were, of course, still several hundred feet above on our perch, they suddenly broke formation and shot out in different directions in what appeared to be a co-ordinated military maneuver securing the area.Until this point, they had hovered silently down the river - but when they broke into their frantic search in different directions, their crafts gave off bright flashes of lights and loud crackling blasts of electrical discharges resembling thunder and lighting. I could feel and smell the static electrical energy fields they were creating as they surged about. I could also hear the roar of air they propelled and also the sound of the water being displaced by the rush of air as well. It was amazing how quickly they would move from one point to another - a brilliant flash light with a simultaneous crack of thunder and instantaneously be somewhere else stopped dead but for the roar of moving air which appeared a breaking mechanism.As I said, when they came into our area of washes, they broke out of formation and sped around as if looking for something, as this was happening, a very strange event occurred at the very same time. The other eight people I was with on the ledge began talking amongst themselves as if they were in a different time and place. And no matter how hard I tried to get their attention concerning the fantastic scene unfolding below, they just continued talking to each other seemingly oblivious to it all. In fact I got the distinct impression they were discussing a sunset lasting a very long time. I basically felt they were sacred senseless and were in some kind of fear induced manic behavior which seemed impossible to break, so I gave up trying, turning back to the crafts below which had moved down the river past us to the campground a couple of miles away to our south - except for two craft that had shot below our position inland around the other side of the foothills.Instead of moving on south on the inland side, these two came quickly back to right below us and one of the craft shot up to our position on the ledge and hovered level with me about a hundred feet away - out over the canyon floor. My companions were still completely engrossed, talking frantically to each other, even though I made one last futile attempt to draw their attention to the ship silently hanging in front of us. It was shaped like the Bat plane - with a curved, rounded front, and sweeping back to two large wings comprising the back. The front appeared to have a elongated windshield mimicking the line of the curve - making up about a third of the height of the ship which was probably fifteen to twenty feet. The width at its widest - near the back from one wing to another - was approximately twice its height, maybe more, like fifty feet. It radiated a fluorescent reddish light from underneath that lit up the entire area in a eerie blood like glow. And I could see! equipment like or led lights inside the front windshield. There was also a gentle humming sound similar to an electric train transformer. I felt a pronounced static electrical field like presence engulfing the area.In a matter of a few moments the craft began to rise above me and came closer - to about fifty feet - now I could see the shape, which I described already, because of the glow of the red panels which mimicked the shape of each back wing. It was about as long as it was wide. It was making no noise as it lifted above me and it did this very slowly and gently with just the faint transformer hum.As soon as it was directly above me - a green spotlight came on in the middle of the craft between the two red panels and I was entirely encased in a green mist that felt hot to my skin. I immediately felt a sexually charged sensation in my balls as well as the base of my spine that began to surge through my entire body. It was like an all consuming orgasm of heated energy pulsating my every fibre. As I seemed to climax, I felt myself lifting or levitating towards the ship. It wasn&apos;t like I was being pulled, as much as I was being energized to a float on my own - like my molecules were being manipulated by an internally-produced, stimulating force. The last thing I saw at this point was looking down on my friends still talking manically amongst themselves as I floated upward.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  However, the last Saturday in March 1978 was March 25.

It was a partly cloudy day, but clear, not hazy or humid - blue skies dotted with white cumulus - we were looking SSE and it was traveling from east to west. I judged the altitude to be a couple thousand feet in the air and it was moving along the edge of a cloud, skirting it. It looked almost like a frisbee and it was silver. Maybe 3 seconds after focusing on it the craft seemed to turn 90 degrees onto its side where it took on a saucer or circular appearance. It then disappeared among the clouds it had been skirting. My friend and I looked at each other dumbfounded and quickly went inside.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

If you held a quarter in your finger tips and put your arm out that is how big the object was as seen by us . It was blocking out some of the stars as it flew through the sky . It was so close that we were able to perfectly see the triangular shape with three large round lights as bright as the stars in the sky and about the same size . The lights were perfectly spaced apart from eachother at each point of the triangle . I could make out a faint shape of the craft and it was a differant shade of dark than the sky . About 5 minutes later after the sighting there was a jet flying roughly in the same direction almost as if tracking or monitoring the object . The jet i could hear clear as day and it was up much higher than this object .

The light was a bluish spotlight that appeared funnel shaped and it was shining down just above the tree tops as it came toward us.  The leaves were all off the trees and we were just about to get into our car.  It dawned on me that there was no noise at all like a month earlier when Coast Guard heliocopters were searching for a lost kayaker on the lake beside us.  Suddenly, the large light went straight up to a pinpoint in a matter of seconds and zig zagged across the sky.  I called the local air control tower and he said no flights were in the area and he gave me the closest AFB in Oscoda and I spoke with their air controller who also said no military planes were in that area at the time.  He gave me an 800 number to call and report a UFO which I did, however, no one ever contacted me about it.

He took some pictures of it (which were never released to the paper) and he and the lady watched it for about an hour.  It was never explained what it was that he saw.

The lights appeared to not originate from any one location but was kept within a specific &quot;section&quot; of the overall sky.The &quot;flying lights&quot; were bright white but appeared to either fade or go behind clouds.  The size was much larger than &quot;shooting stars&quot; or satellites.  At times there were as many as 6 of these lights going in different directions at one time.  The lights had no specific pattern and appeard to be &apos;soaring&apos; and would change direction. There was no apparent trail left by the lights.  No other color than white to the lights, no sound, no aircraft in the area or apparent satellites near by.This activity seemed to be specific to an area close to where we saw the moon, as opposed to all throughout the sky.

Shortly after exiting a building, a motion in the sky in front of me caught my attention.  I looked up to see a light which appeared to be very high moving very fast.  I was facing south and the the object was visible above a building in front of me, moving south as well.  Because of the distance the object appeared very small, and was indiscernable as anything other than a single bright blue light.  The best discription i can give is that it looked excactly like a meteor, and in fact at first i thought that was what i had seen.  The difference was that this object had no tail associated with meteors i have seen in the past, and it zig-zagged, darting both to the right and left before dissappearing.  It was only visible for just over a second.

Many scientists, astronomers, government officials and government agencies have labeled it as a meteorite.  I don&rsquo;t believe it was as I believe that if something were to be seen by many as evidence, many still would not believe as the expression goes, even if it were to bite them on their rear ends.There is a video taken from the police dashboard of the sighting.  The strange thing that I wanted to report was that during the viewing of the dash board video there is silence as it was a quiet street that the officer was parked.  However, if you turn your theater home speakers up and turn up the bass something strange happens.  You  hear this heavy strong engine bursting sound going off and on as if something is cruising through space.  As the night turns to day you see the green &quot;round&quot; fire ball appear and then the sound goes quiet until you hear an explosion and the object darts off into the horizon with no trails.  The strange part is that upon turning the sound up the volume gets caught or stuck and if you pause the film you will continue to hear it unless you close the file and re-open.  Final note is that as the object darts of or at the end of the footage you will hear the police radio pick up something.

When we zoomed in, the shape seemed diamond but with what looked like many round lights in it. Then it changed into a thin, oblong shape that seemed to split into two parts and make other shapes- almost like symbols.  We stopped the truck and put the camera on the dash and watched the said object jump in, out, and all around the screen.  It would then return to the diamond shape. It changed shape many times. We videoed the object for 27 minutes before it quickly became smaller and disappeared.

After we got ice cream we proceeded to sit at some benches at the perimeter of the park and eat each of our ice cream desserts there.As we were beginning to eat the dessert My daughter (age 6) asked me , &ldquo;what is that light in the sky Papa?&rdquo; I took a look in the direction that she was pointing and noticed a very bright object approaching from a distance (It came from the direction of Westmont, another suburb of Johnstown) towards the direction where we were standing. (Note: The four of us were not the only ones out at this time of night.  There was another family, eating their ice cream desserts beside us as well. They did not seem to be paying attention to what we were looking at)  My initial answer to my daughter&rsquo;s question was that the object was a helicopter, possibly with a spotlight on. I mentioned the spotlight, as the light the object was emitting was extremely bright, orange, and looked like what you would see, if looking at a spotlight head from a distance. I stated to her that the helicopter was probably coming in for a landing at the local hospital (Conemaugh hospital).As I continued to observe the object, it came to a gradual stop. (Note: as it approached our location, it did not &ldquo;fly&rdquo; very fast at all, which led me to believe it was a helicopter)  We continued to watch the object and as time past, I came to the realization that it was not a conventional aircraft. The object remained stationary for a period of 30 minutes or more. (The length of time we were at the location eating our ice cream).I became perplexed as to what this object could be.  It was a pretty clear night, and many stars were visible.  This object however was in our atmosphere, much brighter then even the north star, or planet such as Venus, and after having seen it move initially, it remained stationary for an extended period of time.My girlfriend mentioned at some point during this event, that there was in fact quite a bit of  &ldquo;aerial&rdquo; activity in the vicinity of this object.  We both notice several smaller aircraft flying in what I call &quot;an observation flight path&quot; at various locations in the sky near to each other and in the direction of the object.I will say that after looking at the smaller aircraft for some time, and following their flight paths, At least one of the aircraft came to complete stop mid air and seemed to be observing the object that I am reporting on.  The smaller aircraft looked to be a &ldquo;conventional aircraft&rdquo;, as it had both white and red blinking lights. The only abnormal behavior that this small aircraft exhibited was the &ldquo;hovering&rdquo; maneuver it was able to do when &ldquo;observing&rdquo; the bright object.I will mention that I was able to take some photographs and video footage of this event with my smart phone.  As you may already know, the quality of this media is not very good. I also do not have flash on the camera, which definitely did not help my cause in attempting to capture good footage for the purpose of evidence. You are welcome to this footage if you so desire.After at least 30 minutes of observing the object, I packed the family in the car and took them home.  After being home for about 20 minutes, I decided I needed to go back to the location where I saw the object and ensure that what I saw was indeed not a star or planet.  When I arrived at the exact location I had initially seen the object, it was no longer there.  There was no aerial traffic either. The skies remained clear of clouds, allowing me to see the stars. This object was most definitely not a star or planet.", "Disc shaped object fashing red light in s spinning motion like 10 flashes per sec.I was looking at the moon right now and from the north I saw some weard circular craft flashing red like 10 flashes per sec.

For the 13 years that followed, I assumed it was just a bad dream, that was until my Mother described having had witnessed something exactly identical that had also occurred to her 13 years prior, in the same location but on a different night.One evening in 1977, in a small apartment building in Hanna City, Illinois, I as a 5 yr old child, had been awoken to something that was incomprehensible and terrifying.  This particular night, I went into my Mother&rsquo;s bed to sleep which was not routine for me.Sometime during the night, I was awoken by a strange cylindrical, machine-like object. It was approximately the size of a coffee can, maybe a little bigger. It hovered 3 to 4 inches off the floor and spun silently as it moved around the bedroom. There was a slight glow around this object and it seemed to almost have intelligence about it.How it got into the building, I don&rsquo;t know. I was positioned on the right side of my Mother&rsquo;s queen-sized bed, and she was asleep on the left. She never awoke during my witnessing of this object. I first noticed it as it entered through the bedroom door on the right hand side of the room. It was metallic and appeared to have sharp edges. After it made its entrance into the bedroom, it hovered in front of the foot of the bed going right to left. I could see its glow cast just below the foot before it had emerged into sight. It then proceeded to come back and make a turn around the right front portion of the bed and slowly approached me along the right side of the bed still hovering/spinning approximately 3-4 inches off the floor. As it made its way to just below where I was sitting watching it, it ascended up to my level.At this point I was paralyzed with terror, I could not scream or move. I lost all consciousness and never had another experience like it again. I have no memory of what occurred after that, what it was, or why it was there.13 years later, when I was 18, the experience came up in conversation between Mom and I somehow, and I learned it was not just a dream. She had the exact, identical experience, same description, and same outcome as I did. Since then, we have been completely at a loss for an explanation of what it was. We have been trying to find other&rsquo;s with the same experience/sighting. I have a feeling it may have been some type of alien drone or probe, for it wasn&rsquo;t much like a ghost or apparition. I have read about hundreds of E.T. and UFO sightings, but nothing is described to like what my Mother and I witnessed.I have had only one actual, &ldquo;typical&rdquo; UFO sighting since that thing in the bedroom.  In February, 1994, at  Ft.  Leonardwood, MO.  Between the hours of 10:00 &amp; 11:00, on a clear day, there was a silver, diamond-shaped UFO in the sky moving in all sorts of sharp angular directions, and traveling from one end of the sky to the other in just fractions of a second, which must have been at least 200 miles ground distance. I had no other witnesses, but I was fully coherent and aware of what I was witnessing. It was visible for maybe about a minute, and it took off and disappeared from sight.I have no question about the UFO sighting in Missouri, for it seems to be like one of thousands of accounts. But nothing compares to the mechanical-cylindrical object that both my Mother and I witnessed on different occasions without knowledge of each other&rsquo;s experience of it. I would love to know if anyone has an idea of what it really was, what its purpose was, and why only my Mother and I had the experience with it. To this day, I&rsquo;m baffled but open to any explanation.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident in 1977 is approximate.

I say roughly because one ball appeared to be out of the line and further ahead.  I initially thought it was a military craft formation of some sort moving from the southeast, however as they got closer, it became apparent that this was not something mechanical.  There was absoulely no noise at all, and no trails of smoke or vapor were behind them.  They were located not too far above the horizon (meaning I did not have to look too far up to see them).  They appeared to be moving rapidly to the west and the pattern they were moving in changed as they moved.  There did not appear to be grouped in any shape now as they were moving.  Right before they disappeared, they clustered up together in two ci! rcles and then started winking out one by one.

At approximately 10:30pm I was leaving my office in downtown Oregon City.  I was walking to the place I normally park under the bridge when I remembered it was Saturday and I had parked right in front of the office where the meters don&rsquo;t run on weekends.  As I was heading back, facing east, I noticed four (4) lights over the cliff where the big Oregon City elevator is - Which coincidentally is shaped like a UFO. They looked fairly high up, about as high as a plane would be coming in for landing at PDX from that distance - Ten thousand feet, (10,000) maybe? They ascended slowly upwards, appearing over the cliff. Although they were shaped like a triangle, it was apparent they were separate objects in a triangle formation. As they rose the formation began to break up and they criss-crossed each other.  They gradually faded the higher they climbed, eventually disappearing altogether. As one formation began to fade another rose up over the cliff a! nd as similar pattern was repeated. They moved slow and consistent, like balloons being released on a calm day. There was no mistaking them for balloons, however, it was very dark and they were lit up by their own light sources, not the sun or moon.  There appeared to be 12 total but I could be wrong.  I was frantically trying to call my workmate who was still up in the office to get him to come down and see. He made it down in time to see about 4 of the remaining lights before they faded. The lights were red-orange in color and they did not blink, flare up or change shape.  They were simply very bright as the rose over the cliff and faded the higher they climbed. We waited about 10 minutes to see if anymore appeared, but that was it.  End of show.  On a personal note, I am 34 and have never seen a UFO before, of any kind, except on film.

Another truck driver traveling north saw it also and asked me what it was.  All during this time the cylinder stayed perfectly horizontal to the ground. In all honesty I believe it was doing a contour survey of the ground.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))", "Large Chevron shaped craft and bright Orbs over Santa Barbara, CA.At approximately 10:50PM on 4/22/10, I stepped out on my balcony like I do almost every night just to get some fresh air. I walked down to the far end of the balcony towards my neighbors front door, I turned around to come back to my area of the balcony, and as I turned I rested my hands on the wooded side of the balcony, and I looked up. I noticed a dark shadow moving west directly above me very slowly. As my eyes began to focus, I clearly saw the outline of a very large rounded boomerang shape ship with no lights. I could make out the outline very well. I would guessed it to be flying at between 2500-3000 feet, because it appeared to be lower than the mountains, which are around 3200 feet. The ship was more rounded like a half a circle with sharp points or horns coming off of it, sort of like a Chinese throwing star. It was low enough that it was reflecting light off of the bottom part of the ship. From the reflection I could clearly see that it was a sliv! er/light color. The object slowly faded away in the distance. The entire experience was surreal and very eerie. On the same night at 11:05PM, I also saw 2 bright orbs connected to one another to what appeared to be a rod of some sort. They traveled in the same direction as the other object, however they moved much faster, and the objects appeared to circle each other as it moved across the sky heading west. This object was also seen by my fiance whom just arrived home from work.", "As I was sitting in my car I notice out of the corner of my eye a very large bright white light that seemed to be moving very fast across the sky towards the left of my vision.  It only appeared briefly before dissapearing into a small red ball and then completely vanished.  Within 2 minutes or so as I&apos;m still gazing I notice another to the right of me very similar in size and shape but very different in color and speed.  This one, multicolored and a lot slower traveled to the right of my vision for seconds before performing a very similar disappearing act.", "I took pictures of a solid silver object in the sky!While outside I noticed a solid shiney silver object in the sky.  I watched it for about 2minutes and realized that it wasn&apos;t a plane and it wasn&apos;t moving so I ran inside to get my camera.  When I returned I looked for it in the same area and found it again, I proceeded to take several pictures with my 300mm zoom.  I am afraid the pictures are still fuzzy but the object is clearly visible, then the craft shot out another object which flew away from it at great speed the main craft then left the area slowly and I lost track of it!", "Pyramidal Craft over Westwood NJUFO Sighting-  Point of view from me and my mother inside the car and also looking outside the car(with the window rolled down.)  My mother was driving me to a doctor&rsquo;s appointment at around 3:40pm through Westwood, NJ, facing west towards route 17.  My mother recalls exactly what I did when we reflected on this sighting.  I looked in the sky and saw a seemingly pyramidal shaped object.  It seemed metallic in nature; my mother describes it as a shiny aluminum.  It was dark, almost black at one face and extremely shiny at another face.   Also, there was some rotation that I observed on this object.   The most amazing thing about this object was its seemingly random and very rapid movement.Overall, this object was hovering over the town of Westwood, at one point right over our heads.  But in the objects vicinity, there was rapid movement.  At first thinking this was maybe an eye floater, since I was also inside the car, I opened the window and there it still was, moving very rapidly, yet in a general direction; It seemed as if it was headed somewhere.  The best analogy I can give for the rapid movement in the vicinity of the object is that of the following situation:  If you have a camera that you are holding and trying to focus on an object from far away, no matter how still you try to make your camera, the object always seems to be shaking.  This is what it looked it, like it was excessively shaking, even thrashing about.I have perfect vision and no history of mental problems.  My mother also claims to have witnessed this same phenomenon.  However, my mother was driving, and I actually took the time to open the window and capture the image in my mind, it is still very clear and fresh to me.   I also want to add that this was completely broad daylight on a clear blue sky with very few clouds.My mother and I would like to add that there must have been some other people who saw this object since it was in plain sight.Underneath I have drawn a picture of what it looked like. (This object would be against a clear blue sky).Again, it was trashing about spontaneously, not just traveling in a linear way.Also: I called the local paper, the Bergen Record.  They say that they received NO CALLS about this.I also called the Westwood Police station and told them about this, they said that they did not receive any calls regarding this phenomenon.    The officer from Westwood Police Department informed me to call Teterboro Airport to ask if there was anything in the air that day.  I asked for the number to call the airport; he could not find the number and instead told me that he would call Air Traffic Control (he said that if they needed to talk to me that they would call my house phone).  I haven&rsquo;t received a call yet, and if I do, I will update this.Personally, I am AMAZED that in this broad daylight, NO ONE OTHER THAN ME called the the police or news organizations&hellip;it might happen later but to the people who read this:  I GREATELY underestimated the TIMIDNESS and PASSIVENESS of people in general.  To me and my mom, we thought that MASSIVE amounts of people would report this&hellip;but in fact no one else did.PS: I tried sketching a picture but it wouldn&apos;t let me copy and paste it into the box.I would be happy to draw a picture.", "Triangles/Conesright off the shore in Seal Rock Oregon watching two cone like UFO&apos;s hovering over the ocean with red and blue sphere lights simmutaneously lighting up while 8 more cone like ufo&apos;s in and out of the clouds as well as 7 triangle UFO&apos;s three of which were above us and in our clouds with beams of light as if using flashlights illuminating the clouds bringing to light a portion of a triangle UFO looking as bronze in color((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We were outside watching the space station pass overhead, and while the space station was still visible, we observed the small red glow moving up from the horizon.  It didn&apos;t look like a plane; it looked too big, and it wasn&apos;t blinking, although it did change from red to orange and yellow at inconsistent intervals.  It reminded me of some very slow-moving meteor gradually fizzling out.I suppose it could possibly have been the sunset reflecting off of a plane, although that doesn&apos;t seem likely either; the glow moved toward us across the sky for maybe 40 seconds, before finally seeming to slow, stop, and then quickly fade away and disappear.  My father and I waited for a while to see if we saw anything that looked like a plane continuing along the same path, and didn&apos;t see anything at all.Also, interestingly, I saw some very distant blinking lights that looked like those of planes, traveling right across and perpendicular to the path of that red glow.  How they were traveling was weird; I saw one set of blinking lights move from east to west, I looked away, and when I looked back, there was an identical set of lights moving west to east along what looked like the same path.  This repeated again; I guess I saw at least four planes traveling on almost exactly the same path in opposite directions, or the same plane changing direction three times. The lights didn&apos;t look like those of a helicopter and none of the flying objects made any noise.I&apos;m aware of Wright Patterson Air Force base being about 30 miles away, but it&apos;s northeast of my location unlike those strange lights, and I&apos;ve never been aware of any strange flying objects before.", "Large Amber Lights Circling Each otherMe and my husband and my 7 year old son were going south between wikieup and wickenburg at about 8:30pm, when we saw on the left side of the road up in the sky two objects that were amber in color that appeared to be circling each other (they were very large) then they disappeared.  A few minutes later we saw a single large oval amber colored light that also disappeared.  We could look up and see the planes flying in the sky and they were tiny in comparison. A few minutes later we saw on the right side of the road two very very large amber cigar shaped lights side by side that were moveing forward, these also quickly disappeared right before our eyes. the sky was clear and the sun had just set so there was still some light in the sky so that when the lights went out you could see that there was nothing there. about four years earlier we saw a similar large amber light in the same location at the same time of night that also disappeared.", "Bright white light moving from north west to south east.

The fireworks are set off in a field located behind and to the left ( if you are facing the front of the school) of the local high school, and to the right of the middle school and were slated to start at 9:30 PM, but in the end were not set of until around 9:45.  My family and I decided to take seat in the field which is across the street located in front of the high school to view the evenings display.  There were many people around us.  Just to include some background info, they had already set of several &quot;test&quot; fireworks at around 9:15 PM.  Again these fireworks, when viewed from our orientation, were located behind and to the left of the high school.As we were waiting for the display to begin, at around 9:25, I was looking at the sky and noticed a red, circular object, with a kind of haze around the outside edges.  It lined up with the left corner of the high school, however much farther south than the school was, and was just floating there.  I alerted my husband and sister to the object (my son is 2 and took no interest), and it began to move in an east to west direction, but could also have been moving away in an east to south-west direction.  From our viewpoint it seemed to travel the length of the school (east to west).  It was also slowly climbing in altitude, which quickly made us realize this was not a flare.  The object also seemed to be pulsating, as in the light would grow smaller, get bigger, and grow smaller again,but was not blinking.  Once it reached about the middle of the high school, as it was climbing very slowly in altitude it began to disappear. It would flicker out, then reappear and flicker out.  It did this very slowly.  Eventually, it either shrunk and disappeared or flew so far that the light was no longer visible.  This object was visible for between one and two minutes.   I have tried to calculate the distance away and altitude just now, but find it hard to triangulate it without going back to the site and using proper tools, less I give and improper estimate.After viewing the object, we were all puzzled as to what it could be.  There were people behind us whom I know noticed it, and were confused also because I heard them saying, &quot;What in the world is that?&quot;  We did not discuss the matter with them, however.  This object was in no way a plane, helicopter, flare, or firework.  It moved too slowly to be a plane or helicopter, and was like no fire work I have ever seen.  It also did not originate from the area where the fireworks were being set off at, and it went in a direction against the wind.  I am able to remember this because the fireworks were being blown toward us to the north, and the object was moving to the west. The object seemed to just appear all the sudden, also. I would have though it was possibly a flare, being happy to arrive at a known solution; however it traveled in a direction, and lasted an amount of time uncommon for a flare.  Usually a flare will still be lit after it travels upward and begins to fall to the ground.This object at no time fell in altitude, it rose. I have seen flares before, and this was not a flare.  I am at a loss as to what this object was, and it has bothered me since.  I hope this report was of service, and if there are any further questions, feel free to contact me.", "July 4th, at 11pm witnessed orange fireball with traveling across the entire night sky in Coon Rapids Minnesota.At about 11pm at night as my husband, mother- in-law, my children and I were stucked in traffic leaving a 4th of July fireworks celebration in Conn Rapids Minnesota a teenager in the street next to our car pointed up at the night sky and said something about &quot;Hey look at that&quot;.

Off The Ground Forming A Triangle Flash In And Out Twice &amp; Then From Afar Coyotes Howl At It For 4-5 MinutesMY UFO TESTIMONY  It was Saturday, July 17, 2010. Me, my girlfriend and her son visited the Bruneau Dunes Observatory in Idaho (between Bruneau and Mountain Home). The staff was there along with us and 20 or so other people. They did not allow us to have on any white lights and the only lights there were the small red reflector type electrically lit lights on the cement. At around 11 PM I was facing what I believe was South East towards the Education Center (look at the map I provide. I think that was the direction) and suddenly out of nowhere, above the building, three white lights with green on the outer parts of the lights flickered for 1 to 2 seconds and then they in a sense &ldquo;turned off&rdquo; like you turn off a light in a room. It just went black. It seemed that even though these lights were like 7 FT. or so above the building, they were actually coming from further away, ahead of us and were probably a lot bigger than what we saw. Keep in mind the building is 10 FT or more in height. I think! I said out loud, &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; There was a guy on the left of me who saw it too and so did my girlfriend who was on the right side of me. They both clearly confirmed what I saw. We continued to look in that same direction and only a few seconds later the three lights flickered on again for 1-2 seconds and then disappeared. Whatever it was, it did not emit any noise at all. From where I was standing, it looked as if each light was 2 ft. or so in diameter or almost double the size of the moon from where I was standing if I put my thumb up to the moon which was to the right of us almost behind us. They looked size-wise like three double-sized basketball shaped balls of light that were glowing white and green and shook a little bit. There was 1 light on top and two others on the bottom, forming a triangle shape, but I did not see any structure holding it all together. It must have been much further away from us.About a few minutes later, we suddenly started hearing a pack of coyotes a little bit from the left of the building but far ahead of us, over 150 FT or more away making some very nasty howling noises as if they were on the defense against something that upset them. They were howling (right) in the direction of where we saw the 3 lights. Their intense howlings got more intense and nasty for about 4-5 minutes or so. Keep in mind that we never heard the coyotes howl before or after they howled. This only took place after the lights emitted twice and then ended. After that, they went on the coyotes went on and on for 4-5 minutes. I asked one of the staff members who was manning one of the telescopes about it and I told him what the three of us saw. He said to me, &ldquo;What are you guys smoking?&rdquo; Still the young guy in a baseball cap who was about 6 ft. tall and around 27-32 years old saw the lights. Me, I&rsquo;m 35 and my girlfriend is 38. All three of us saw it. We, the three witnesses ! and my girlfriend&rsquo;s son were the last ones to stay at the observatory with the staff. I spoke with the person who gave the presentation in the education center earlier at 9 pm and he didn&rsquo;t act like he didn&rsquo;t believe us but from what it looked like, he had never heard of this before and was startled a bit but very calm and professional. We then went home. It is weird to call this a UFO since as it seems from what I saw it was a &quot;UO&quot; (Unidentified Object) since I nor the other witnesses saw it &quot;fly&quot; or &quot;fly away&quot;. It just blinked in and then out and then the coyote&apos;s flipped out yelling at whatever it was.Some background info you should know: Today, July 19, 2010, I contacted the Bruneau Dunes Observatory and mentioned this situation that happened on Saturday. They were very nice. Apparently this had never happened there before. I asked what was beyond the building. Two people at different times on the phone told me there was 150 FT of mowed green grass. Beyond that is a lake, which they call &ldquo;small lake&rdquo; (people fish there) which is left of &ldquo;big lake&rdquo;. Apparently both lakes combined make up half the size of a football field (300 Acres). With that info and the fact that they said that coyotes are afraid of people and would not be on the 150 ft. of grass behind the buildings, they must have been on the grounds area past the grass and on the surrounding left of &ldquo;small lake&rdquo;. I won&rsquo;t make any assumptions but if I put this info together, it seems to me that whatever this triangular light object was (at least we saw it as triangular from our view) it could have been hovering over ! the lake and it flipped out the coyotes 2 minutes after we saw it and they were yelling at this object for 3-5 minutes. I also contacted Mountain Home Air Force Base that is way on the other side of all this and spoke to them about it. The lady mentioned that they did not hear about any of this and that they do not have any dealings in that area since they are on the complete other side of it (behind where we were standing). Other info I found out is that the observatory is 20 miles south of Mountain Home and 6 miles SW of Bruneau. I believe that is what the lady at the observatory told me.MY GIRLFRIEND&rsquo;S UFO TESTIMONY  It was past 11 PM on July 17, 2010. We were at the Bruneau Dunes Observatory in Idaho. I was lying down on the circular cement seating to the right with my head up looking towards the tree next to the Bruneau Dunes Observatory Education Center. First I saw two round lights. One at the top and one below it to the left of it and it appeared that there was another light behind the branches of the tree on the right. They flickered forward and back for a second, but when they retracted it was very smooth. It looked as if they were on top of the roof but they weren&apos;t. I didn&apos;t know what they were. And then I sat up and asked my boyfriend, &quot;Did you see that?&quot; and he said to me, &quot;What was that about?&quot; and then I saw it again. I saw like three rounded white flickering lights. They were not aligned. I saw one on top and the other one was one across from the other. I said again to my boyfriend, &quot;Did you see that?&quot; and then he said, &quot;(my name), what was that?&quot; And there was a young guy ! sitting opposite from me on the circular cement seating area and he said, &quot;I saw that too. What was that about?&quot;  And then I told my son, &quot;You missed it!&quot; He was sitting in front of me on the cement seating area but was looking in the opposite direction. My boyfriend, the guy and I started talking about what we saw. My son was also with us as we were talking. I thought it was cool but weird since I didn&apos;t know where it came from. My boyfriend said, &quot;I saw three lights and they were kind of green.&quot; And then the guy who also saw it agreed with my boyfriend and said, Yeah, they were green.&quot; I said, &quot;No. The ones I saw, they were white.&quot;  As we were talking, the coyotes started to howl and they angrily started barking, like they saw something. They were on the left side of where the lights flashed. The coyotes were howling for about 4 minutes then stopped.  That was the only time we heard the coyotes that night.After the coyotes stopped howling, my boyfriend told one of the observatory staff members what we saw and then he said to my boyfriend, &quot;What are you smoking?&quot;  Then my boyfriend said to him, &quot;I&apos;m not the only one who saw it?  They saw it too.  My boyfriend pointed at me and the other guy who saw it. Then my boyfriend said to the observatory staff member, &quot;If I&apos;m smoking something, it&apos;s Parliament Ultra Lights and Wallgreens is my supplier.&quot;  The three of us and my son continued talking about it, wondering what were those lights.  We had the question the whole night: &ldquo;What was that?&quot;  And nobody could answer the question about what we saw.", "Rugby shape window area in sky with a craft inside.The date was early February 2008, my car would not start the day before and I had arranged the day before for a friend at work to pick me up from a ring road about 200 yards from were I lived in the morning.In the morning,  I went to the end of my road and cross over the ring road and waited about 100 yards from the traffic lights and stood there waiting to be picked up, it was a cold but clear day and across from me was semi detached housing some traffic but no people walking.I looked down at my feet they were cold and when I looked up again seconds later there in front of me is  a sight I still cannot believe could have been there but there it was, it seemed to be a large 30 foot or more rugby ball shaped object just floating 20 feet maybe slightly more above the semi&rsquo;s across the road from me (around 60 foot from were I was standing) but that was not what got my attention but it was the object or part of the object I could see within this rugby shape window like opening,  this object craft whatever was very shiny and seemed to be made up of angled shape panels, it was certainly larger then the rugby shape opening, I seemed to be looking into another reality or whatever because it was rotating back forwards side to side in a very jecky wayI just was unable to focus on it as it was jecking so much but all within the shape opeinng, I got glimpes of  of different bits of this craft within the shape opening, I  then  noticed after about a minute  or! so a very dull vermilion part that did not seem to be of  metal, then after aboout 2 minutes or there abouts had past it flicked that dull area into view and it looked like flesh (it&rsquo;s very hard to explain) what that bit was but it was a long trangle shape which seemed to be raised above the very shiny metal around it then it flick to another angle, during this time I look along the road to see if I could get someone to see what I was seeing but there just was no one around.I was getting very annoyed because except for cars going past no one was around to confim this, this was happening in a built up area of BOLTON I then looked to see if my friend was coming down the road when I looked back at this object it  had begun to move up and to my right and all I could see now was a dull brown rugby ball shape I could not see the bright metallic craft within it now  and it went out of sight after around a min  or so.I had just seen a shape wiith a object larger then the shape I have no idea but could this be way these UFO&rsquo;s seem to disappear and change shape maybe when entering or leaving these, it could maybe be the way they travel to and from here undetected who knows, this sighting really shock my belief in what suppose to be real and what does not, this is why only now do I feel its time to put it down not very good but to the best of my ability.I did tell my friend what had happen but of course he just laugh it off.", "Bright blue-green ball with trailing light tailLast night at about 2:35 AM while driving north on Trinity road by Lake Superior College, my wife, son and I witnessed a very large very bright blue-green glow with a streak or tail of light behind it drop from the sky almost straight down at an extremely hi speed.It appeared as if the glow stopped before reaching the ground.My guess is it was a meteorite, but I would really like to know for sure what exactly it was that we saw, and if anyone else saw the same thing.", "Pinkish white to red white disksDriving North on County Rd. 400 3 miles south of Highway 58 near Walesboro.

I noticed an orange light in front, but above me.  As I stared at it, I realized that it seemed to be falling toward me.  Directly toward me.  It was round, but it looked like it had a web of lights on top of it, making it look almost teardrop shaped.  At first, I considered it was flames.  I thought it might be a comet falling from the sky, so I turned onto 13 Mile road and pulled into the parking lot of the apartments that were west of Grove.  It had gotten higher in the sky at this point and looked like an orange dot.  It started moving north. I took a picture of it and watched it for a few minutes.  It seemed to just be standing in the sky at this point. So I continued heading west on 13 Mile Road to Schoenherr.  In the parking lot of the Kmart at 13 Mile and Schoenherr, the orange light was still visible and heading west, toward me.  As it was getting closer, close enough to notice the round shape again, I pulled around a building, and when I looked back, it was gone.", "Black triangle hovering in one spot with one red light on a corner and white lights on the others.Thursday, July 8th, 2010.  I would have reported this earlier, but I wanted to do a little research first.  I was driving home from a gathering with friends in Marietta, Georgia.  The time was approximately 10:30 PM and I was traveling west on Whitlock just before Kennesaw Mountain Battlefield Park, when I noticed a large, black rectangular object hovering just above the tree line.  It had one red light on the corner and two white lights on the other corners.  I had the window down and I didn&rsquo;t hear any noise.  As I reached the park, I could see that it was actually hovering at the tree line on the edge of the park.  What had initially caught my attention was that it was not moving at all.  I turned around after I passed the park to get another look, but the object was gone.  We are near Lockheed, so I thought perhaps it was an experimental craft of some sort, if they perhaps have some kind of silent craft capable of hovering in one spot.  I thought I&rsquo;d go ahead and report it since it didn&rsquo;t fit anything I&rsquo;d ever seen.", "Round object that moved from side to side and in a straight motion, disappeared and would reappear during a crystal clear nightWhile in our backyard admiring the clear night and all the stars and planets that were so bright and brilliant my husband and I both noticed (since we were pointing and looking at the same area) what looked like a star (small, less bright, round in shape) but was moving fairly quickly and smoothly in a straight motion.  After a few seconds it would disappear and would reappear to the side of where it just disappeared and would move in another quick, smooth straight motion, then slowly disappear and reappear again to the opposite side.   We both realized it couldn&rsquo;t be a plane b/c there were no flashing lights, no noise and planes can only move in a straight forward motion, not move over to the left or right.   We weren&rsquo;t sure what to think but wanted to report it so it was documented.", "A bright light spinning and weaving over a small town in Idaho.I went to my bedroom window to tell my dogs to be quiet, and I saw a bright light weaving in the sky.

Canada.I was sitting on the couch watching TV, when my little brother came storming down yelling for me to follow him outside,   So I got up and ran with him to the back of our home, and he told me to look up.  We were looking at what appeared to be some sort of object crossing the city horizon, it looked as big as the space station on a clear night when the station almost looks like a big star, and it was a faint orange color.   As I stood in awe,my little brother ran and got my dad, he too witnessed the object.  It was heading due east, almost appeared to be following the clouds which were heading in the same direction.  Anyways, when i noticed this thing in the sky, it came fast but then it was almost like it noticed us, and kinda slowed down, then stopped completely only for a few seconds then slowly gained momentum, and continued on east.   This isn&apos;t a hoax, I truly believe these things have been observing us for sometime, back in the 90&apos;s not sure what year, I witnessed a triangular object much like those been described countless times with the 3 lites on each point.   I never told anyone about that, anyways, this thing was like Just over the house.   Hovering, again i just recalled this, it was cloudy?  I wonder if thats a coincidence.

All at once it sped up and appeared to be going twice the speed that it started at for about three to four seconds, and then slowed to its previous speed and in a mind blowing it just stopped.  I watched it for about 10 to 15 seconds when it started  moving again in a northeast direction and made an arching turn to the left and I lost sight of it.

The UFO hovered over my house and then stopped as I got a full look at it and then it took off east/south/east so fast that it was literally gone in the blink of an eye.

It wasn&apos;t much higher than the rooftops and the lights weren&apos;t very bright but it was still, perfectly still in the sky and definitely had a square shape between them.About 30 minutes later there was one orange light moving pretty fast through the sky, much faster than I&apos;ve ever seen a plane move.  Shortly after that there were two planes going the same route  but slower that were obviously some kind of plane or jet flying through the sky.

I can see planes around that time of night and when they have their headlights on they appear as only one light instead of two.  These were unusual in that I have never seen 4 lights (planes) that close together.  One was ahead and then two, one above the other, and then the fourth appeared to be behind the other 3.  They seemed to be moving fairly rapidly toward the airport and I figured that three of them would have to circle to await their turn to land.As I watched, the lights appeared to stop moving toward the west so I thought they had probably turned enough toward my viewpoint that their forward progress wouldn&rsquo;t be visible to me.  Then, suddenly they all four went out.  I watched for awhile longer to see if those four planes landed and I saw at least one other plane go into the landing route and then a second but they were coming from the south and were not anywhere near where I had seen those other four lights.I thought it strange that those four planes had not landed and I didn&rsquo;t see any other lights to indicate where they had gone and since my husband was asleep, I figured I&rsquo;d tell him the next day.

Witnessed by two of my brothers.  Later that night after one of my brothers and I retired to the camper, other brother began yelling at us to wake up around 1:00AM.  When I opened the door of the camper there were 5 indentical lights in the sky motionless in formation.  One by one each light went strait up and then moved off to the east(?) and faded like a dimmer switch...last light held position for about a minute and then followed the expact pattern of other lights.  There was no sound associated with the lights, estimate 5000ft alt.Two of us are former military and are very familair with copters and fixed wing airplanes.  I am a life long UFO sceptic and this is the first thing I have ever seen in the sky that I could not explain.

Another one would show up in about 5 to 10 min later.  When the fireworks were going you could see these were following the clouds of smoke from the fireworks at the same speed and direction.  Maybe it was someone attaching flares to helium balloons and letting them loose one at a time.", "Several flashing lights in various positions seen in the northern sky nightly.Every night, in the northern sky, I see several small flashing lights.  They appear in various places and are mostly stationary, however every occasionally they seem to make small circular movements and then return to the original position.  They do not appear in the same place every night.  At first I only noticed one at about 0300.  The next night I saw three.  Since then I have seen different numbers on different nights.  The lights seem to be white primarily but flash to blue and red.I don&rsquo;t have access to a large telescope, but I did watch through a 60x spotting scope.  Through the spotting scope it appears that the red and blue lights are to the side of the white light, not the same light source changing color.  I was unable to see the shape of the object that the lights are coming from.I am police officer who works night shift and I told one of my squad mates about the light the first night I noticed it and he and I both spent about 15-20 minutes watching trying to figure it out.  About a week later the other officer told me that he pointed out the lights to a friend of his and the friend used his telescope (significantly stronger than my spotting scope) and said that he could see a vague shape like a satellite of some sort but couldn&rsquo;t think of any satellite that would be flashing red and blue lights and moving that way.I have also pointed out the lights to my wife, and none of us have been unable to come up with an explanation for these lights that I see every clear night.

I found it odd my dog didnt make a sound as the dog always always alerts to anything outside. I got up after it was gone and looked around outside at which the dog came running up to me but there was no evidence of anything outside I know im not insane I was afraid to tell anyone at work I know what i heard I know it was not any type of plane or copter I grew up on base next to the runway and been air force all my life. This was definatley not normal and I do not watch sci Fi movies as my coworkers suggested and i was not dreaming I was petrified listening. NEXT time I will get up and take a picture for sure. I was wondering if anyone else saw or heard this in my town.", "Glowing orange orb in skyMy family and I walked outside to say goodbye to my dad.  As we were saying goodbye we looked over to our orchards.  There was a orange orb in the sky we watched it for about two minutes as it was coming near us.  Our first instincts was it was a plane without it&apos;s flashers on but as it came closer we heard no sound and the object was far to big to be a plane.  As it came over our heads and passed it shot off into the distance (approx) 15 seconds and it glowed red and dissapeared.  There was no sound and it was a orb the sky.  There was no way it could be a fire work or a plane, to low to be a sattilte.

Behind the trees is a large field.  As I was standing there, I saw a bright orange/red ball of light appear above the trees, travel rapidly in a wavy motion, then disappear behind the tree line. There are no lights or houses on this small ridge.  I would estimate that the light was no farther than 750-800 feet away from my house.  I would say that the light itself would be about the size of a softball judging from the distance it was from the house.", "Around 23:00 hours a pulsating bright light grew bigger and brighter before dimming and got smaller before disappearing.Looking up above me at the night sky I noticed a bright light bigger than the stars.  It started to pulsate and grow bigger.  Then it got dimmer and smaller as if it accelerated away and disappeared. There was lightning to the northwest in the clouds that wasn&apos;t really  moving too fast.  The clouds just kept flashing as if the lightning was inside the clouds.

Disappeared.On July 27, 2010 at approximately 19:30 my roommates and I were sitting on our front porch.  My mother&rsquo;s boyfriend, noticed something gliding through the sky.  The object was noticed in the eastern sky flying in a SSW direction.  We had visual observation of the craft for about 5 minutes before it faded out of sight.The craft was a silver cigar shape with a dark band in the middle.  I could not make out any wings or a tail.  It was completely silent, and there was no contrail.  I live in the hills.  Most planes go out of sight over a hill, but unlike most airplanes I see, this did not go over the horizon out of sight.  Rather, the object seemed to get smaller and smaller, until it was no longer visible.There was a sense of confusion upon realizing all the strange attributes of this craft.  I managed to remember to grab my camera and I was able to capture several photos on a Nikon D-3000 DSLR camera.", "Orange circle-shaped light, moved fast, appearance changed with angle,  5,000 ft alt. no markers lights ,On July 4, 2010 at approximately 9:00 p.m CST, 3 people witnessed what appeared to be an orange glowing ball at  an altitude of 3,000 to 5,000 feet.  The object seemed to be moving faster than a typically seen light aircraft in the area.  The object was seen in a southwesterly direction from the city of Mulberry, Arkansas (Western Arkansas).  The object moved north then turned and proceeded west.  There was some dusk light on the horizon.   We dismissed it as an aircraft, but the appearance simply didn&rsquo;t fit with typical marker lights of a light or even higher flying jet.  I  and my family live near an airport in Fayetteville, AR, and are airplane observers.  I have been involved in identifying aircraft and have made a hobby of learning about airplanes for over 30 years.  I am a science instructor as well.  The objects main characteristic was the orange color and was very strange as an observer looked at it head on.  The orange color did change somewhat as its direction changed.   I dismissed this sighting until I heard that many others throughout the country had seen objects on the same night.

They were flying slowly together in perfect unison, but in no particular order or shape. At first I thought it was one huge (about 2 football fields long)object, but I THINK they were separate objects...then, after about 2 minutes, they, in no specific order, one-by-one, sometimes two at a time, just disappeared.   They moved so perfectly together and did not sway or waiver at all.   They definitely were not balloons or planes or flares or anything that we&apos;ve ever seen.   They also had to have some sort of silent engines because they were &apos;powered&apos; through the sky.

My sister said, &quot;Is that a satellite?&quot; and upon that I look around to see what she&rsquo;s referring to, and suddenly see on her side of the car an enormous flying object that had lights all across the side I was looking at.  As I&rsquo;m trying to drive and also adjust my eyes to the very dark night sky, I start seeing that whatever it is I&rsquo;m looking at is flying at a tilt.  I assumed it was a plane with extra lights along the wings, but then as I keep looking it starts listing upwards and the lights that were on a 45 degree angle on the &quot;wings&quot; suddenly started tilting/listing up into vertical and kept rotating all the way around 180 degrees.  I didn&rsquo;t understand what I was seeing and thought that it was a plane that was crashing into the ground, but it was in such slow motion I just had to pull over.   As I pulled off onto the emergency lane, we saw what appeared to be a saucer/oval shape gigantic ship with lights all around the rim.  When it was tilted I could see that they went all around the rim.  This ship looked to me like it was the size of two football stadiums or so.  That is all I can compare it to.  It was so big and silent.The &quot;ship&quot; looked like it was dark grey or black and the lights around the rim were yellowish. Not plane lights and no green or red or flashing.  There were three distinctly brighter lights on the side I was looking at, one on the left, one in the center, and one at the right side, but there were a few smaller lights. All the lights were glowing in different capacities.  This &quot;ship&quot; seemed to be &quot;landed&quot; after it did the somersaults in slow motion, next to a very dark mountainside.There was no sound from this &quot;ship.&quot;  After a few brief moments we saw the first of five balls of light that slowly floated out from the left side (from my view looking at it) of the ship.  These lights were a silvery ball is the only way I can describe it, but we were at quite a distance from the mountain and where the ship was.  One after another these silver glowing balls came out but at different travel paths.  They were going around the base and midpoint of the mountain slowly but steadily.  The ship that I was looking at slowly had the lights around the rim go dim or something and they were not as prevalent.  The most startling thing was that the ship appeared to disappear.  I&rsquo;m not 100% certain of that as I don&rsquo;t understand how that could happen but from my vantage point it either disappeared or lowered behind land or a hill that I could not see as it was so dark in the desert that night.I was not going to go check out this situation, as my sister and I were traveling alone at night and I started to get nervous being on the side of the road with big rigs going by so I decided that we saw enough of whatever we were looking at and we went on our way to continue on to Marina del Rey, CA where I live.I have not looked into any other sightings or websites or books to see if other people have seen what I saw.  Please let me know if there are other sightings similar to this so I know I&rsquo;m not crazy or making things up that have a good explanation.  Maybe the military is doing something new?

A lighted object went by.  Can&apos;t be sure of size or how far away or how far up it was.  Sphere was illuminated by steady, flickering, yellowish light.  No blinking, on-off lights. No sound.  It could have been a candle underneath a homemade hot air balloon.  However, we think the flight path was too straight, too fast; and it maintained exact elevation and exact direction during the entire period of sighting.

We were told to immediatly come outside and look towards the sky (due west) and see them for ourselves.  We then saw 25+ orange lighted objects (which appeared to blink in and out as they dimmed in the upper atmosphere.  They all appeared to be moving in the same direction (towards the northeast) and all seemed to stem from the same location.  They were only visable for about 3-5 minutes. 3 airplanes were seen in the sky as well (heading to SeaTac airport to land).  We took video on our camera, but only a couple were barely visable through the street lights.  You can see the airplane clearly. Unless something is reported on our local news media stations, we are assuming that these were indeed UFO&apos;s.......and ALOT of them!!!  We also called the local news stations to report the incident, in which they informed that they had not recieved any other calls about it..........but would look into it.", "Odd point of light seen in clouded skyI was looking out my back door as I let my dog back in, and I saw an odd point of light off in the distance (30-45 degrees above horizontal). I didnt think much of it at first really, perhaps a reflection onto the glass of the door.  So I opened the door up and looked beyond the glass and I could still see it. Again, it was just a point of light, something akin to a star.  But a storm had just been through, and there was solid cloudcover overhead, lightening still flashing about.  As I watched the light, it seemed to shift from side to side very slightly every 30 seconds or so. In addition to its movements, there was a &apos;pulse&apos; of light around it.  Thats the best I can word what happened.  There was the central point of white light, and in a very minute &apos;aura&apos; like section around it, there was a pulsing light ring that shifted from red, to blue, to white, and through that cycle fairly quickly. (2-3 seconds per color shift)", "Bright object in sky suddenly switched direction, faded and dissapeared.ISS went over head about 21:20 EST.  Approx two minutes later another large bright light decended from a Westerly direction.  It was coming toward the earth and it grew larger and brighter very quickly.  So much so that I was nervous that it might strike the earth.  It had no shape we could see just a very bright light that was similar in size and brightness to the ISS that had just gone past minutes earlier (from a WNW direction.)   This object was as bright if not brighter than the ISS.  Suddenly it switched direction back out into space and faded very very quickly and finally dissapeared out of site.I know it was not a metorite or other debris burning up because of this change in direction.  I know it was not the ISS as that had just passed two minutes prior to seeing this.  I know it was not a satellite passing by as we have seen those many many times before.  This was not any of these things and both my husband and I  witnessed it.

In the west and northwest there was a band of light-colored sky extending from the horizon upward about 15 degrees.  (Usually at this time of evening at this latitude, the sky is entirely dark.)   At the edge of this band of light the sky turned very dark.  In the dark area there appeared an unusual &ldquo;disc&rdquo; of gold or orange-colored light.  It stood out in stark contrast to its nearly black surrounding.  The disc stayed in a fixed position at about 75 degrees up in the NW sky for several minutes, then appeared to &ldquo;drift&rdquo; several degrees &ndash; perhaps 10 &ndash; upward and northward, then stopped again before fading away.  The night sky was cloudy and it looked like the disc faded out, it was not covered up by the clouds.The disc reminded me of the symbol for a hurricane on a weather map.  It was round, but had one point instead of the two found on the hurricane symbol.  It was also blurry and indistinct.The diameter of the disc appeared to be between a quarter and a half of the diameter of a full moon.  Of course, not knowing either the size of the disc or its distance from my location, it is impossible to &ldquo;guesstimate&rdquo; either value.", "3 orange lights in triad formation, Holyoke, Mass, July 2, 2010Friday, July 2, 2010 approximately 8:50 pm - driving South on Route 91 through the Holyoke, MA area.   The sky was partly cloudy, the sun was down, but the sky was still light.This section of highway looks down over Holyoke to the left.  Westover Air Reserve base rotating beacon is easily seen on the left.I noticed 3 orange lights to the right of the highway in a triangular formation.

There are several airfields in this area, so at first I thought little of the lights - but the color was a distinctly different orange color, very different from any surrounding lights in the area. They were about as bright as a small plane&apos;s landing light.  There were no aircraft strobes, tail beacon, or nav lights.All 3 lights were approximately the same distance apart, with 2 in front, and 1 in the rear.  They appeared to be moving together very slowly in a north, north east direction - very smoothly.  My view became obscured momentarily due to a line of trees on the right side of the highway. Once past the tree line and the lights were back in view, the rear light appeared to just go out.  I fully expected to see some kind of craft (airplane, balloon, etc.) where the rear light had been, but there was nothing.  I then lost sight of them since I had past them by then.

Blood was not found around or on the carcass.  The carcass was examined by a veterinarian and a full investigation begun.  The killing may have been part of a cult related ritual, but this has not been proven.The sheriff&rsquo;s department learned two days prior to this incident in Jewell County a similar incident was reported near Colorado Springs.The Wilson&rsquo;s bull was in a gated pasture with other cows and calves but none of the animals were killed.

This is not my first sighting it&rsquo;s my 3rd in the past three years.", "Two sightings of the same object  within 22 hours of each other in Northern CaliforniaThis is two events within 21 hours of each other. At approximately 12:40am Sunday the 27th my friend and I went outside to talk and we were seated facing west. I was looking up to the southwest a bit when a bright flash of light with a diamond shape object in the middle just appeared. It came in really fast through what I call a portal, with a bright flash of light. AS it entered it stopped in the sky almost as fast as it came in and floated slowly from my left to right, a south to north movement as I could tell.After the initial bright flash of light as it broke into our atmosphere and as it began it&apos;s glide/descent, the light quickly faded but not light instant on instant off. It just dimmed but as the celestial craft dimmed it also began to cloak or transform into a small light behind the foliage of the tree. I could see the small light just either go away from me or disappear altogether. My friend witnessed some of the event but not all; from the dimming glide to the small light. This event took about 10 seconds or so.I was in total awe but the initial reaction I felt was that stir in your stomach and that tinge of fear that comes from seeing something so celestial you just know it is not of this world. I thought. &quot;Oh my God&quot; and I exclaimed &apos;what is that!?!&quot; which was then when my friend pulled the focus. I could see the object/craft so clearly as it entered our airspace, and I say that because I have seen many things concerning outer/inner world phenomenon like fireballs screaming across the sky, meteors striking our atmosphere so hard I could see the outer layer of earth&apos;s atmosphere and even sightings of UFO&apos;s floating in the sky. This brightness entered our earth and came to a halt as if it was the easiest thing an aircraft could do.The second sighting came at 9:35pm the very same day, Sunday 27th and lasted more or less about a minute. Me and my friends jokingly said, &quot;let&apos;s sit outside and lets see em again.&quot; We looked in the same position and my friend says,&quot;here they come&quot; but in a joking manner because he saw a bright star coming at us. He said it again, and then again and I realized the pitch in his voice changed and this object was moving straight towards us.It was moving, no gliding across the sky from west(southwest) to east(northeast). It was in perfect view and I could see the diamond shape craft/celestial with a light that was so bright and . . . pure. I mean, I can&apos;t really describe it because I have NEVER seen such beautiful white bright light like this celestial emanated. It was smooth as glass and it was so bright and white there was this hue of blue in the center of the diamond shape... incredible beauty of light! It was so . . . pure  It was too early for a star to be this bright. Even Venus was dim because there was light in the sky still. This was as pure brightness and a color of light I had never seen.  As it moved across the sky it was unworldly in its movement. By that I mean unlike any aircraft we know today. Not like a plane or even a high flying jet aircraft. They ALL move with a worldly rhythm but this moved so effortlessly across the sky at a pace that is not of this planet.  It glided without movement or turbulence of any kind and the brightness of the light NEVER wavered.  It stayed beautiful and bright throughout the course of it&apos;s flight until it went out of our vision.  It moved from west to east and it was SILENT and PERFECT! NO SOUND came from this celestial at all.  I ran from one yard to another yard to follow the flight path and I tried videotaping it but I could not capture it.  I&apos;ll look again but it was dark on camera.I know something big is happening. It just falls into place with what I know is occurring with the planets.  My psychic ability tells me that we are in a transformation for all the human race but now I realize this is on a much larger scale than even I had foreseen.I am still in awe and I know this is not just another sighting, I just know that. Seeing something move across the sky is one thing; watching a diamond craft/celestial enter our airspace, and come to a halt like it did with such ease is another.  Maybe it didn&apos;t know, or care, that I saw it enter but it wanted us/me to see it later that evening.  It was clear and not fuzzy, it was close and not far away although I cannot tell the size from its flight.  It looked HUGE when it entered the portal early morning but much smaller when we saw it later.  I/we saw it clearly and it was, for lack of better words, beautifully perfect.", "Red Fireball over highway and truckIt was around 1:30am, July 8th 2010.  My husband and I were taking his friend to the store after work.We were going down HWY-25 by the walmart, just fixing to stop at a redlight.  When we both looked up at what appeared to be a bright red fireballish orb(approx. size of basketball/soccerball), floating in the air about 10-15 feet above us.  We drove right under it, and then I turned around to look at the red light, and it was no longer there.  As if it just dissapeared. Nothing fell from the sky or anything, we drove right underneath it.  It would have hit our truck. There was no one around.  No other cars, nothing.  We thought it could have been a light hanging on a electric line or something, but there was no line and no lights when we looked back and drove by it again on the way home.It happened in a matter of seconds, and I was in such shock I could barely drive.  Its as though it came out of nowhere, appeared in front of my car, then vanished again.  I didn&apos;t ever see it from a distance driving up to it. Just once I got close to stopping, and after my husband confirmed I wasn&apos;t completely crazy by pointing at it as well.  Its just hours after it happened now and I have a horrible headache, which I felt fine before this sighting, as does my husband.", "V shaped object, no lights, quickly flew across clear sky.Clear sky in the south, 2 witnesses saw a V shaped aircraft in the sky on July 16, 2010.

Observing Venus, Saturn, Mars triangle formation to the east when I looked directly overhead and saw 5 small lights (slightly more luminous than the stars) in rectangle formation moving to the east. I thought...&quot;What the hell kind of plane is that?&quot;.....when they suddenly broke formation, moved around one another for a quick second, like they were jockeying for position, and formed a triangle.  They jockeyed again to form a circle, back to a triangle, a straight line North to South, back to a triangle.....all while travelling East. Approx. 20 sec from when I first saw them...they had moved out of eye view. No sound at all. Best guesstimate of alltitude....possibly ISS alltitude or less.", "red light, flying above the fireworks but under the clouds.....In the night sky on the 4 of July in Louisville, KY, just above the fireworks and below the clouds there was a light, it was red with some yellow to it.  I live by Louisville international airport and this is was no plane.  It had only one &quot;running&quot; light as where the planes have at least two on each wing, where as this light just looked liked a ball.  The light made two or three different passes.  Each time it would go south and disappear into the clouds and then appear to be moving east to north kinda like it was circling around and then back to the south where it disappeared into the clouds.  The police did have their helicopter out but the helicopter lights were blue and white.  This red light looked like it was to high in the sky to be a regular civilian helicopter.", "As we were driving through Windsor Great Park in the county of Berkshire, United Kingdom, both myself and my girlfriend witnessed  from the car window 8 smallish red and yellow balls of light.They appeared to be hovering and not moving and in a cluster type formation, although not in any distinctive shape formation i.e. square/diamond.The balls of light appeared to be glowing.  They were approximately 300 feet in the sky and therefore too low to be stars and were certainly not planes.We attempted to turn the car around 1/2 mile up.  We managed to head back towards where we first witnessed the incident and kept visual contact with them for approximately 1-2 minutes.  Turning back round and losing sight of them for two minutes we headed back to the exact same place within about 3-4 minutes but there was absolutely no trace of any of them to be seen.", "Driving home from Wal-Mart and noticed bright orange circle in the sky.   It stayed in the same location for our five minute drive home and then took a 90 degree turn.  Once we arrived at our home, we observed the object in the sky for several more minutes.  The object did not move and continued with an orange glow.  After several minutes it faded away and was gone.  This could not have been a meteor, plane, helicopter, satellite, or the space station as it stayed stationary for approximately 15 mins.  This object was extremely unique and unlike anything we have ever seen in the sky.", "A real July 4th showDuring our July 4th celebration several of us were simply talking.  I first looked up to the sky and noticed a light moving across the sky very slowly as if it were an aircraft.  I mentioned that they had a great view of fireworks around the area and my friends looked up. Just as they did the craft made an erratic move then shot across the sky  heading north at an astonishing speed.   We are all in our fifties so we are not young kids making up a story.

The lights were orange and of various sizes.  My wife dismissed them as airplanes queuing up to land but they were out of the normal staging area and anyway, airplanes don&apos;t bunch up in clusters to land.   We watched them for about 10 minutes as they floated from east (direction of Puget Sound) toward downtown and then drifted upwards into the clouds and disappeared.   They lasted longer than a firework remains lit, but their motion seemed more determined by air currents than locomotion.  They didn&apos;t all appear at once, but rather, appeared one after another, twinkling into being, drifting from east to west, and then uplifting into the clouds.  No idea what they were.", "Red/Orange Fireball Moving Over Tyler, TX, at Speed of AirplaneI, my sister, and my two sons saw something over Tyler, TX, around 9:25 PM on July 10, 2010.  The sky was not completely dark yet.  My sons and I were in the pool.  I put my head back to dip my hair into the water... when I saw a bright red glow approaching from the distance.  One of my sons saw it at the same time, and we both said, &quot;What is THAT?&quot;   It was traveling at the speed of a plane, and as it approached..  my younger son and I saw something behind the glow...  almost like a parachute shape, but translucent looking.  My son said it looked like  a glare on something behind the light.  But then that shape went away, and all we saw was a red fireball.  By this point, it looked like a plane on fire.  My older son called for my sister to come outside.   We stood in shock.. it looked like a plane in flight that was in flames.  We were scared because we thought it was a plane on fire and we were just waiting for it to fall... and my mind was thinking, &quot;How can a plane st! ill fly if it&apos;s on fire?&quot;... but it continued on in the distance until it could no longer be seen.  Once it was gone, we realized that it could not have been a plane because there was no noise, but it was moving in the direction that we had seen planes coming from earlier.  There were NO OTHER reports of this to the local news station when my sister called, and no one else I know saw it.  People keep saying it was a weather balloon or hot air balloon that we must have seen.  Yeah right.  I&apos;ve seen both, and this was neither.", "Strange light seen over Orange CaliforniaA bright light appeared from the east near roof-top level at a distance of a few miles.  At first it seemed to be an airplane heading toward nearby John Wayne Airport and even turned in that direction like a normal airplane.  There were no green or red lights, only a single star-like white light.  After turning to the south, the light dimmed and then made an abrupt turn to the north and brightened to about 1 magnitude or brighter.  The object began a series of acrobatic maneuvers that an airplane could not perform.  It reversed direction almost instantly, swooped down very rapidly, and climbed just as quickly.  This pattern of movement continued during the entire episode.  Although the object seemed to stay in one part of the sky, it slowly drifted toward the east and finally disappeared from view.  I watched the object for about 10 minutes.  While observing the strange motions, I saw an early-morning jogger come by and pointed out the object to him.  He joined me in my observations until the object passed from view.", "A small ovni in Mexicos SkyI was with a colleague in a car on Insurgentes Sur avenue in M&eacute;xico DF going to visit a customer.  My colleague was driving.  She told me that in Mexico DF it was normal to see OVNIs and that even the local news sometimes showed them on TV; warning me for what I was about to see. Then she told me to look over a tree pointing me in that direction, and then in the sky pretty far away, maybe thousands of meters away, was a silver object absolutely static in the sky.  It looked pretty small from where I was, but I know it was made from some kind of metal because the sun shined and kind of reflected on a spot of the object.  It looked as if it was rotating, because its edges where somehow dimed; and this happens when something is rotating at a high speed. The object then moved at a VERY high speed away from the site and disappeared. I&rsquo;m not aware if other drivers saw it, we were on a heavy traffic avenue.This is the first time in my life that I see something like this, and I am very happy that I did.", "There was an anomaly of circular light with dark, changing shapes passing in and out of it.There was what I would describe as an anomaly of light, about the size of a softball if held at arm&apos;s length above my head, directly above my house.

While talking, we noticed something in the sky that did not look like a plane.  As it flew closer, we noticed the shape of the object and that it was extremely  quiet.  It didn&rsquo;t make a sound at all and was flying so low that we thought it was going to hit our house.   It was a triangle shape and had a few lights on it.  A white light and two red slow blinking lights. Shortly after this flew out of sight, we noticed another one of these aircrafts flying towards us.  It looked exactly like the other one with all the same descriptions as the last one.

I know quite some things about astronomy but I&apos;m nothing close to an expert or anything like that.Since a few weeks I&apos;ve seen an extremely bright &quot;star&quot; in the sky at night time. The first time it seemed like the light of an airplain, yet it missed the blinking white and red light of the wings and it was so much brighter. And it moved much faster but dissipated before it was out of view. It didn&apos;t have a tail or anything else a normal meteor has.Tonight I saw it again but it was completely stationary. It didn&apos;t move at all. Not even when I compaired it with the stars. When I first looked at it my eyes almost hurt of the brightness it almost looked as if it was a tiny sun of it&apos;s own but the light did not difuse.  Then I noticed that the light seemed to get a little dimmer but when I looked closer it was as if it&apos;s aura (at night the moon has a circle of light around it sometimes when there&apos;s a thin layer of clouds) was shifting it made me think of the head light of a car in the mist yet it was very short-ranged and I couldn&apos;t really make out if it was really like a moving &quot;head light&quot;.  But then around the object itselve.  Even though it was far away and due to the light not really clear I did have the idea it was a bit triangle shaped but it could just be rays of light.Now about half an hour later, 3:12 AM, it&apos;s gone.  I&apos;ve kind of a light head ache of looking at the bright light but I only watched it for some 5 minutes and that was almost 30 minutes ago.  I also felt some sort of pressure on/in my head even when I closed my eyes, when I watched it. And I&apos;m one of those rare, blessed persons who doesn&apos;t have head aches, ever!  But I could be a side affect of my light sensitivity, but still, sunlight never has an effect on anything like this.I also tried to take a picture of it but my camera wasn&apos;t able to capture it due to the extreme light contrasts between the black sky and the bright &quot;star&quot;.I made a picture but its really vague if you still wanted to view this picture let me know.

Small pinpoints of bright light.The 4th flash of light was a little different than the previous ones in that it was almost like a diffused strobe flash, like when someone takes a flash picture outside at night- that kind of effect.My first thought was that it was some kind of occillating space junk or debris, and was catching the sun at a particular angle.  I thought that, because it was about the same height as a satellite.  I had seen a couple of regular looking satellites later in the evening, as well.The strangest thing about this observation, was that I saw the same kind of flashes the very next night! In the same spot as well.The only difference was that it didnt do the strobe flash.But the other 3 flashes about 2 or 3 seconds apart were exactly as I saw them the previous night.Wierd.", "Large orbs moving at a steady altitude and velocityWe witnessed a total of four occurrences of visitor activity on the 4th of July 2010 in the Lake Forest Subdivision of Huntsville Alabama.  At 8:50 PM we saw a single large reddish orange glowing orb coming from the south moving slowing northward; it was very low, maybe 250 to 300&apos; above the rooftops.  There was absolutely no sound being emitted from the illuminating sphere.  We watched it for about 5-10 minutes as it passed over our neighborhood and then got into our car and drove to the gas station at the corner of Martin and Zerdt roads.  We could see fireworks off in the distance so we sat in the car for about 15 minutes and watched.  As we drove home heading west on Martin Road, we saw a formation of 3 glowing orbs.  This time I really thought, hey these things are extraterrestrial and I want to make sure there not hot air balloons or helicopters.  So we slowed down to almost a complete stop, rolled down the windows to see if we could hear helicopter blades, but there was no sound at all.   And they were not hot air balloons.  We had traffic behind us, so we had to move on and we are not sure where they went, but assume they continued to move northward as did the first one.  We were sitting outside and then around 10 pm we saw one more solitary glowing orb, but at a higher altitude than the others and this one was either blinking, or something behind it was blinking and we watched it move northward as well, then the dog barked, we looked away and when we looked up again it had disappeared.  Then about 15 minutes later my boyfriend said, look at that satellite.  And I said, where?  Then I exclaimed, Wow, did you see that?   He said I sure did, wow!   We saw four distinct bright lights that looked like stars that were in a cluster which was kind of vibrating and then they formed into a line and just zip off into space on at a time very quickly.  It made warp speed seem slow, they just zipped up and off into space and where gone! in an instant.  Neither of us had ever witnessed anything like this before.  We believe that since the orbs were so slow moving and close to the ground there must have been a number of others who saw the same thing on that clear 4th of July night in Huntsville, Alabama.For the skeptics, I looked up sky lanterns and balloons on-line and just wanted to let you know that there was no way the first one or the second set of three that we saw were in any way sky lanterns. These illuminating things  were huge.  They moved steadily and with a purpose.  Not anything similar to a sky lantern and we were close enough to tell that they were not hot air balloons.  My boyfriend thinks they were as large as a VW bug and my estimate is a bit larger.  They did not flicker and produced an energy glow that was supernatural.  This is the first time I have ever looked at a ufo site and ever posted any such thing.  We are both of sound mind and we were not under the influence that night.

The camp is located approximately half way between Coudersport, PA and Galeton, PA (not too far from Denton Hill State Park).  Sometime around 22:20, we noticed an orange fireball going slowly across the sky.  The fireball appeared to be traveling from North to (SouthEast).  The five of us were astonished.  It did not look like a plane or helicopter.  It was definitely an orange glowing ball.  My husband and friend felt for sure they saw some type of tail at the end of it.  I did not notice it.  The fireball was traveling in a fairly straight line at first.  Then it seemed to change directions (zigzag) several times, almost as though it was losing its course.  After viewing this for several minutes, the glow became less and less until we couldn&rsquo;t see it anymore.  It did not appear to have traveled out of view, but more like it burnt out.  It was not a shooting s! tar and did not look like a meteor.  Nor, was it &lsquo;The Northern Lights&rsquo;, not even close.  It also was not part of a fireworks display.  It was extremely high in the sky.  For those people who may say it was just too much July 4th celebrating, our 14 year old daughter witnessed this also.", "They know who we are.

It appeared they were trying to find out what was up there but they also just took off, not up into the sky but, to the left in seconds they were gone. After the red, white, and blue aircraft left, the red lights took off, and disappeared into thin air.  The fireworks display began and all of a sudden the 2 red lights appeared again to the right of the display.  Again they just hovered there in perfect distance apart horizontally as if they were watching the fireworks.  I tried the whole time to get this on video with my phone though the lights could not be picked up on my camera.  I do have the video of me trying, and what everyone was saying.  When the fireworks were over, the lights took off and disappeared.  This really freaked everyone out, and we would like to know what it was.  They were way too high in the sky and way too fast to be any kind of aircraft we have.  These red lights had to have been 3 or even 4 times the size of the smaller red, white and blue flashing lights.", "Looking NE there was a bright round/triangular object hovering in the sky and moving sporadically; changed in shape, size, &amp; brightnessLast night on Sunday, July 4th, 2010, in Deer Park Ohio (just outside of Cincinnati) at around 10:00pm my mom (medical field), her boyfriend (ex-army officer) and I (student) went outside to look at fireworks.   After a few minutes, my mom&apos;s boyfriend  looked North East and pointed at a bright object in the sky.  At first he thought it was a star of some kind, but it became apparent after a few minutes that it was too large and bright to be a star.  The object appeared to be a ways in the distance, though I couldn&apos;t say the exact miles.  At first it looked rounded in shape and a bright white, though after time it would change in shape and also brightness.  The shape would change from round to almost triangular, would dim and brighten, and would also at time get smaller and the stretch out again.After the three of us arguing about what it could be (approx. 15 minutes later), I noticed more and more that it seemed to be hovering rather than still standing.  From the time we first spotted it, to around 10:20pm it had moved (in comparison) from one end of our house to the other.  After more speculating, I went inside to grab my moms&apos; phone camera and also a small pair of binoculars.  Finally, now having a better view of the hovering object, I honestly cannot tell you what it was.  I&apos;ve never seen any star, aircraft or anything of that sort like that before in my life; both my mom and her boyfriend said the same.  Using the binoculars the object appeared triangular but seemed to have a faint rounded halo around it.  It was bright with in the center but also had small blue/green &quot;lights&quot; (quotation because I don&apos;t know how else to describe them).  Every so often it looked as though there were bright red streaks that would flare out from the object almost like what you wou! ld see on a jet of some sort.  After watching it more closely we started seeing it move sporadically up and down, and to the left.  The movement wasn&apos;t big, but enough so that it was clearly noticeable.The time now was around 10:30pm, and while myself and my mom were still watching it, my mother&apos;s boyfriend got bored and went back into the house.  I really wanted to see if we could get a better view of the object, so I talked my mom into driving closer toward it.  We went down streets and back roads and were able to follow it for quite a ways.  We got a little closer to it, but in the end it was late, and we were too tired to keep driving.  I last saw the strange object at around 10:45-10:50pm when we turned around back toward home.  Once we arrived, now around 11pm, we searched the entire sky around us, (of course including where we first spotted it)  but saw no trace of the strange bright object any longer. It&apos;s as if it just disappeared.Even thinking back on it now, It was like nothing I&apos;ve ever seen before... it was so brilliant and brightly colored, even more than the tiny specks of stars around it. But the shape of it is unlike any air craft I know of. It was and still is incredibly fascinating. Though unfortunately, my moms&apos; phone camera was all we had at the time... So the few pictures we took came out unclear and did not do justice to how amazing it looked with the binoculars aid.  A few photos we did take however, show the relative size as well as it moving (you can clearly see a &quot;tail&quot; or steak behind the object.) If you want the photos I will gladly send them to you. And also, any information you may have as to what this object could&apos;ve been or even if someone around our location reported something similar, we would be most grateful.

It traveled in a 20 degree upward angle for aprox.  3 miles, then slowed down headed in a southerly direction and proceeded out of sight.  The object was in view long enough for me to go and get my binoculars and run back outside, however all I could see was an amber light, for another 15 to 20 seconds.  This was not a flare or a firework.  It was traveling as fast as an F18 but made no noise and was approximately 5 to 8 miles away.", "It was early evening when my wife, and two of my son and I were in my pool when one of my sons was the first to notice high in the sky what could best be described to be a very bright distant flashing round light, it was far away and looked like the size of a very large bright star.  Because of the distance no detail of the object could be seen but it was stationary and the flashing was very bright and had no distinct pattern as it flashed at random.   The object seemed to at first to be moving higher in the sky and drifting I think in what may be North direction. At this time we debated and rationalized that if it could be a Mylar helium balloon and the sun would reflect off of it as it turned creating the bright flash of lights as it turned into the sun that was starting to set in the west.   Then it got a little more interesting as it started moving ( Drifting)  at a more rapid speed in a completely different direction at first moving closer to us and the! n moving what I think was east.  It made no noise had no characteristics of an aircraft that we could define.  We do not know what it was we saw but  if it was in fact a balloon its behavior was indeed unusual and the  brightness of the flashing seemed too strong and bright to be reflective.   The object moved farther and farther away until we could no longer see it.", "Extra star seen moving across the big dipper and then fading.At around 10:55 PM, my wife and I were enjoying a walk out under the stars in our neighborhood.  The skies were clear so we could easily see the stars and had been looking up pointing out which constellations we knew. During this time I was looking up at the big dipper and noticed an extra star in the middle of the constellation which through me off for a second.  It was the exact same size and brightness as the other stars in the constellation but was moving.  I pointed it out to my wife because it didn&rsquo;t look like a plane since usually a plane would have multiple lights or flashing lights. We watched it move from right to left at a 45 degree downward angle over the course of about five seconds as it crossed a distance about equal the size of the constellation.  As it moved downwards the light began to fade until we could no longer see it.  This was also odd because there were no clouds for it to disappear behind.", "Green line over HalifaxTonight as I was walking my dog, there was a bright green line high up in the sky.

It kept a steady straight pace.  It almost looked like a plane that was on fire, however, there were no noises (engines) and as it flew further away from us it dissipated.  It was flying west.  If I were to compare it to the moon, I would have to say it was about the same size.  There were four of us shooting off fireworks at the time.

Still Daylight.  Periodic slight cirrus types of clouds were in the sky.I was in the pool at my friends house in Plano , Texas.  I looked up into the sky looking east and noticed a tiny pulsing REDish Gold spec of light in the air.  It was moving northward very slowly. The object was about the size of a head of a pin seen at arms length.I observed for about 5 minutes.  It stopped moving and stayed in a stationary position..  I said to myself that i am going to go to my car to get my digital canon camera.  And i did.When i got back it was hard to relocate the object at first but i finally was able.  It was sitting there for another 4 minutes and then slowly moved off to the north...Minutes later, I noticed another Goldish red orb in another area in the sky.  Basically overhead but  just a few degrees off to the south from just overhead...  It was larger  or lower and perhaps at the cirrus cloud height.  I took a few pictures with my canon camera..   Again it was still broad daylight and it almost seemed to glisten in a red gold type of light..  It was not close enough to tell if it was actually metallic or if it was a light.  I decided for some strange reason to turn the flash on the camera to on..  When I did that and took a photo.  The object that was standing stationary in the sky for about 5 minutes rapidly accelerated toward the southwest..   And then accelerated again and vanished. It was a two stage acceleration, going from still to rapid speed m then suddenly accelerates again to super fast and it was gone.When looking at the photo that I took,  and after I enlarged it,  looks  like all those other photos that you would see of UFOs in the national enquirer, and I laughed to myself..To the naked eye it was more visible and did not represent any known aircraft.  It was neither a bird nor a balloon.  I did not know of any bird or balloon that will accelerate the way this thing did, or stay stationary they it did while being watched in the North Texas sky..Photo to be sent in Email", "sighting in northern ireland and possible abduction.. ongoing  Myself and i keep having reoccurring memories about a sighting we both believe it is true and we always put it down to a dream, thing is it cant be a dream about the same thing on the same night.. every time we see something about ufo sightings it gives us weird feelings.. a programme on national  geo channel TV has us worried. it tells of a sighting in Arizona in 1997 about a v shape craft..  we don&rsquo;t remember a shape as such but when it told of glowing red orbs moving too and from the big thing we just looked at each other in shock.. this is something about what we had both experienced but failed to remember.. this is very real.. what we both agree on is we cannot remember the date, we both agree it was from our back garden at our last address, we looked out over our fence it was dark but not pitch dark more like late dusk or early dawn, a little pink or red tinge to the sky.. i recall to her come here quick what the hell is this come quick some shape about! my 1 o&rsquo;clock position and about 45 degrees.. by the time she came to see a lot of other red orb lights moving into its area and out from it there where lots  i remember shouting woooh did you see that!!! i cant remember what i saw now, i somehow think it was two orbs colliding and becoming one, but as we speak about it now Michele remembers this also.. I also remember saying quick we better check the news, there was a fear of we where being invaded..  there is something chilling about this encounter and as time goes on we are constantly reminded of things, little pieces of this puzzle come back to us with startling reality..  we also have had another dream at the same time as we slept and when we woke in morning we told the same thing to each other that there was something with long fingers coming to get us, we both put it down to Freddy crougar type nightmare..   this Freddy crougar dream happened in my fianc&eacute;e&rsquo;s house five years ago. this airborne vision was only 3years a! go .. there was no sound we can remember..

We like to stargaze and took our recliners out into the pasture where we could get a good view of the entire night sky.  We had our radio.  This was at 10pm  sometime between 10 and midnight we saw three strange flashes.  There were three incidences:  two we both saw and one my husband alone saw.The first one my husband alone saw. He said what he saw was an extremely bright flash of light, right between the two bottom stars of the big dipper.  By time he said &quot;oh wow!&quot; and pointed, it had disappeared.  It wasn&apos;t streaking like a meteor. He said it just got bright and disappeared.A while later, maybe 20 minutes to a half hour later I was watching a satellite cross the sky.  I pointed it out to my husband, &quot;I see one!&quot;.  It was directly in front of us.  We both were watching it. As it crossed, it suddenly got extremely bright. So bright the light from it almost hurt my eyes the way high beams from an oncoming car would. It lasted no more than two seconds and them dimmed.  After it dimmed you could no longer see the satellite at all.  I thought maybe it had burned up in space.  There wasn&apos;t an object to track across the sky any longer.  I thought maybe because of the brightness I just couldn&apos;t see it anymore, but it was really gone!  My husband said that was what he had seen earlier.We saw a third one which wasn&apos;t nearly as bright as the first one I had witnessed.  The third one happened the same way.  Visually tracking a satellite across the sky, this one was further to our North (our right hand side, our chairs were facing West).It brightened, then disappeared completely from the sky.After hearing reports on the radio last night, July 6th, about others seeing something unusual, I was compelled to write.  We sat out briefly last night and something unusual again.At around 10:20 we saw the same thing again.  While tracking a satellite across the sky we saw it brighten significantly and then disappear.  This was not as bright as the first one I saw on July fourth.  Maybe 15 minutes later we both saw what looked like two satellites traveling North one behind the other quite close (I have NEVER seen that before).  We watched as the one behind then gradually changed direction heading East as the first one continued North.I am 52 years old. I don&apos;t drink and I have been watching satellites cross the night sky since my early twenties when a friend pointed them out to me while camping.

I have viewed it from several different vantage points, both with the naked eye and with binoculars, a well as taken pictures.  Anybody who looks up at the sky could clearly see it. It is not being shy or covert at all.  It doesn&rsquo;t seem to move much except to make a very slow descent behind the big mountain that makes up one half of the Camarillo grade (101 freeway, where truck scales are), so by 11:30 or so, it ha disappeared from my view. It does appear to change colors occasionally, from brilliant white, to a hazy yellowish orange, to a bluish white glow, and sometimes a red aura appears on the top part of whatever this is. It also appeared to have some much smaller, much dimmer lights come off it in several instances over the past week.  Because there is a military base nearby ( Point Mugu) I at first thought it was some kind of helicopter holding its position in a military exercise of some kind. And it might be just that, I don&rsquo;t know what it is at this point.I wouldn&rsquo;t have even come here to post this, except for a caller I heard on the Coast to Coast  radio show that described how he was seeing a strange bright light in the sky from sundown to 11:30pm, and this had been every evening for the last week or so. He went on to describe the very same characteristics that the light I was seeing possessed. The show host told this caller to report his sighting on this website. So I figured I should do the same with my sighting, for whatever its worth. I unfortunately did not hear where the caller was calling from, but would like to find out if it&rsquo;s the same light or two different ones in two separate places. I guess I will just continue to watch it at night, and to try to get some better pictures of it.((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus in the western sky, we suspect.

It was a very bright white light.  No port or starboard lights or any other normal aircraft lights. It appeared to be around 20,000 to 25,000 feet moving from west south west to east north east.

Whatever this was it looked to be just over our town, looked like it was just observing.  It would sway out slightly then back to it&apos;s original position, as it did this I also noticed the light casting  out  lines onto a diamond shaped craft.  It also seemed to move closer, then back again, each time it moved I could see the shape of it. I watched it for about an hour and a half, it was still there when I went to bed, and it was still changing it&apos;s position.

They continued towards us for a bit then turned east and headed out over the ocean.   At that point we saw 2 more appear then another 2 and finally an 8th light.  They all followed the same approximate flight pattern, although at slightly different altitudes.  The leading light then all the following lights seemed to dim and dissapear at roughly the same area over the ocean , one at a time.

Hundreds of people had to have seen this last Monday night.", "I completed a report on your site over a year ago and it was very brief and not as descriptive as I should have been in my initial report.  But since the time of my sighting, I have left out so many other significant factors to that night/morning that I just felt compelled to write to you again and explain the whole event, as there is so much more to mention.I have talked about my experience with several people over the past several months and have been made fun of countless times by friends and co-workers, but I still feel the need to explain the whole story to get it off my chest.On 1/2/09, I received a call from a friend&rsquo;s son, who begged me to come up to Lafayette CO, to watch some meteor showers after I got off of work.  It was on a Friday and I was very tired and did not want to drive up there and hang out that particular night.  But the boy who was 13 or 14 at the time kept insisting that I come up and stay the night.  In fact, her 2 other children got on the phone and begged to see me as well and after I spoke with them, I felt compelled to drive up there.  So I packed a bag and headed north from my house in Denver.I arrived at about 8:00pm-8: 30pm and it was cold and I was dragging butt after a long week.  The kids immediately asked me to run to 7-11 to buy firewood for the outdoor fireplace as it was going to be even colder later that night and into the early morning hours.  So I bought 3 or 4 bundles of wood for our night.  Upon our return from 7-11, we hung out for a while and planned our night and agreed that we (my friend and I) would get up around 3:00am-3: 30am to start making hot cocoa and coffee for the 4:00 am showers.  But at around 11:00pm-11: 30pm, the kids were very hyper and were not ready for bed by any means.  They asked me if we could burn one of the bundles of wood and sky watch for a while before heading to bed.  I hesitantly said yes but knew that I was fading fast and didn&rsquo;t have much energy from a long week at work.  At any rate, I didn&rsquo;t want to disappoint them, so we headed outside.Once we got the fire going and brought out blankets and snacks, my friend&rsquo;s daughter (7 yr. old) climbed on lap to stay warm.  The 2 boys, I believe were 13 and 11 were running around singing loud and throwing things in the yard.  I was getting annoyed because I didn&rsquo;t have the energy they had and I really wanted to just chill out and relax in quite and peace.  The little girl fell asleep in my lap almost immediately as she was bundled up well and was pretty warm.  About 10-15 minutes after she fell asleep, I saw a gray animal or &quot;something&quot; running in a very weird manner along the side of the fence.  Whatever it was, it used a hand as well as its legs to run and hop at the same time.  At first glance I thought it was a wild animal and as soon as I had that thought, I literally threw the girl off of me and yelled, &quot;What ((deleted)) was that?&quot;   This thing moved very fast along the fence and was gone in no time at all.  My friend had her back to the &quot;thing&quot; and the boys were running wild and didn&rsquo;t see anything.  I was so freaked out; I didn&rsquo;t want to stay out there anymore.  I told them what I saw and they kept asking questions and so on.  Finally, I said that I was going to go inside and sleep for a while because I was getting up at 3:00am-3: 30am to make the snacks and then to watch the showers.  Plus, we needed to save some of the wood I bought.  So the boys said that they were staying downstairs to watch movies with the intention of staying awake all night.  My friend, her daughter and I went upstairs to her bedroom and we all were going to sleep together in the same bed.  After we jumped into bed, I was on one end, my friend in the middle, and her daughter was at the other end snuggled up with her mom.  I fell asleep immediately.After sleeping for a while, I woke up freezing like I have never felt before. (I have lived in Colorado my whole life and never wore coats in the winter and would only wear jackets because I am always hot).  So I pulled the blankets up to cover myself up more.  As soon as I did this, I was immediately burning up.  I threw the blankets off of me, and I was freezing again.  By this time, I woke up because my face touched my arm, which was like an ice-cube.  My eyes opened and I rolled over to see a purple light hovering below the ceiling.  I tried to focus my eyes to understand what I was seeing, but I could never really make out what it was.  It just changed shapes and was hovering about 3 or 4 inches from the ceiling, closer to my side of the bed.  I watched the thing for about 10-15 minutes before I decided to get dressed and start making the coffee and snacks.1/3/09  At about 3:40am, I woke up my friend and told her what happened in the bedroom and she decided to get up too.  I also told her that the boys were downstairs sleeping in the livingroom with the TV still on.  I told her to look for her video camera with the infrared feature so that we can have it for the showers.  Then it occurred to me that she may want a smoke before the kids got up (they didn&rsquo;t know she smoked) so we decided to smoke first before getting any cameras together.  Besides, I&rsquo;m not good with any kind of camera with the exception of a cell phone camera so this was going to be all on her to set that part up.This is the part that I originally reported to this site, but I left out some stuff so I need to re-tell the story.A couple of minutes before 4:00am, we went outside to smoke.  We were out there for a short while when I saw what looked like a flock of geese flying towards us.  I pointed in the direction of where I was looking and yelled, &quot;Look!&quot;   As soon as I said that, I then realized that this was not a flock of geese at all.  It was a triangular shaped object that was gray on the outside of the perimeter and on the bottom, but shiny black finish on the rest of it.  As soon as I told her to look, the thing changed direction a little and aimed its path towards us.  It was directly over us about 300-500 ft in the air and made no sound and was moving very slow.  I initially said that it was going 30-40mph, but it was going slower than that.  My friend stood there with her mouth open and totally freaked out and I started checking in with her because I thought she was going to start screaming or something.  By this time, we could see directly underneath this thing and again, it was gray, with a light at each point of the triangle, with a round &quot;portal&quot; in the center and some weird designs on the bottom.  It didn&rsquo;t make a sound at all. It started moving in between her house and her neighbor&rsquo;s house and I started to chase it.  When I started running after it, I knocked over the chairs on the patio and bumped the table really loud, when all of the sudden, it disappeared right in front of us.  The lights weren&rsquo;t on, but something inside was illuminating the lights from within to let us know they were lights.  And it looked as though it was using our street lamps and porch lights to guide itself.  I know I said that we watched this thing for 7 seconds in the first report, but there was no way it could have been that short because of the detail we were able to extract from it.  That was one of the things that always bothered me about it my first report. It was more like 20-30 seconds.After it disappeared, we went in and woke up the boys first.  My friend said, &quot;That was the most amazing UFO I have ever seen.&quot;  We started telling the kids to get up in case it came back, and because it was time for the showers.  So after we got settled in our spots, the showers came down immediately.  During the showers, we saw more UFO activity with lights flying low all over the place and doing crazy maneuvers and indescribable movements. We would keep talking about it for the next 2 hours.So at about 6:00am-6: 30am, the wood was almost gone, the winds were picking up and some light snow started to fall. I told everyone that I was going back to bed because I really didn&rsquo;t sleep much and I was freezing again.  So I went upstairs to lay down in my friend&rsquo;s bed again alone.  The purple light was gone this time.  At about 7:00am, my friend came in to crash too for a while.  However, at 8:30am, I got up to go to the bathroom. In the bathroom, there are lots of windows to look at onto the front yard.  When I glanced out of one of the windows, I saw a light layer of snow (about an inch high) covering the ground, with a perfect circle partly on the grass, sidewalk, and street in her front yard.  There were no tire tracks, footprints of any kind or anything else near the circle or any other place out front. It was totally untouched by humans or animals. I woke my friend up again and to show her what was out front.  She looked out the window and asked me, &quot;What the hell happened last night?&quot;I know this was a long story, but I had to go back and correct some things.  I just couldn&rsquo;t keep all of this information out of this crazy experience.  I swear that I am not making this up and have witnesses to substantiate this weird night/morning.  My friend has agreed to talk to anyone about her piece of the story too.  However, we do have to keep the kids out of it for obvious reasons.  However, my friend&rsquo;s children and I have experienced other UFO&rsquo;s that same year, at that same house.  And there is more to tell, believe me!  But that was the most amazing UFO at that house because it was so huge.  But we do have more stories about some other cool sighting too of a smaller triangle flying 20ft above our heads 3x&rsquo;s in the same night.  But that&rsquo;s another story for another time.  Besides, I don&rsquo;t remember the date of that one.", "Saw a plane, bright light beside it then beind it then back beside it a 100 feet or so.I was hitchiking to Mineral Wells Texas from Goree Texas.  It was very late approx 1 AM.  I was on a farm market road.  There was no traffic. I was walking along and looked up and saw a airplane I could hear.  I saw a very bright light flying beside the plane, the plane was a comercial plane.  I watched it a minute or so and looked back where I was walking.  A few secound later I look back up and it is flying behind the plane.  I looked back down and then back up and it was flying beside it again. The hair on my neck stood up.  I was honestly scared.  I saw a house about 3-4 hundred yards off the highway with lights on.  I decided to go to it to see if I might use the phone to call my recruiter to come and pick me up.  I had to go over 4 bobwire fences to get to the house.  I knocked on the door and a very harsh voice asked who is it.  I asked to use the phone.  He yelled out you better get out of here before I shoot you.  I didn&apos;t waist any time leaving. I crossed over 2 of the fences in a run and as I was going over the third fence I heard shots and heard pellets landing all around me.  From there I cannot tell you anything.  The next thing I remember is being in my recruiters car and pulling into his driveway.  I cannot tell you how I got in his car, how I contacted him to get him to pick me up in his car.  I cannot tell you going over the forth fence or getting on the highway.  When we were pulling up in his driveway it was just starting to get light outside.  So I am missing 4-5 hours that I cannot account for. I contacted MUFON but they seem to be a joke.  Talked to a man over Skype, can&apos;t remenber his name,seen him as we talked.  I told him my story and this thing I have in my body.  It&apos;s a tiny spot like a ball.  They told me they were putting together a bus with Xray equipment and would come and Xray this spot and see if it might be a implant.  I told him I can show him lights in the sky every clear night that I cannot explain.  I promise you they are not of this earth.  You can&apos;t just look up and see them, there is a way to do it to be able to spot them.  These lights do very strange things that aircraft doesn&apos;t do.  Like dog fighting,getting extreamly bright and then just vanishing.  Sorry but I don&apos;t think planes do that.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It appeared to be a star, but as we watched it for awhile, we noticed that we could both see something like spurts coming out of it and it would move. My first impression was something was shooting out of it like a projectile. It was far enough away to appear as a star but close enough to see almost tracers off of it when it moved.  As we were watching this light move around, another star looking light came floating across the sky towards the one that we were watching and continued past it without stopping or slowing. There was no erratic movement with the one going across the sky, but it did manage to cross the entire skyline and out of our sight within 2 minutes or less. I don&apos;t know how fast that would be. Now as of July 27th, 2010 there are still lights in the sky and I have noticed up to 6 or more. I have an apartment that has windows facing the other side o! f my building and I could see more of these moving objects in the sky on that side as well. It almost appears as if they are making a circle around a large part of my city, but very high up. I do live in a border town, which borders Sault Ste Marie, Michigan. I noticed one light that stood out more than the rest and it seemed to have a red that I could notice through the white. When I first noticed this light from my balcony, it seemed closer than the others and it was more centered over the international bridge on the USA side. I recently went back out to look and this red and white light seems to have now moved more to the Canadian side and more over Essar Steel which is what I believe to be the 3rd largest steel comapany in the the World. I don&apos;t know if anyone else has seen anything like this on either side of the border, but I encourage anyone in the area to take a look and see if you can notice these same lights. This is not my first time seeing the white light with r! ed shining through. I did submit a report back in September of! 2009 wh en I was about 4 to 5 hours out of town and I witnessed a sighting at a closer range that appeared to be the same type of light. My friend that witnessed this recent sighting has also witnessed another sighting about a month ago from his back yard and was lucky enough to get footage of a white star looking light flying at a constant rate across the sky. I have heard of people referring to the movements as almost seeming like the operator is drunk, but being an outdoors man, the best way I could describe the movement is, the way a water spider moves around on the water.

From underneath the object we saw three large circular red lights in a line and perpendicular to that line was a curved line of red lights.  In between the red lights there were smaller circular lights which I believe were white in color.  At the eastern end of the object (the side we approached from, which I believe to be the front of the object) we saw what appeared to be to spot lights pointed east and angled slightly toward the ground.After we passed by the object I immediately called my father (an Air Force vet who grew up on US Marine bases) and asked him if he knew of anything that could fit the description.  Dad could not tell me about anything that fit that description.  My wife and I quickly sped up and turned around at the first opportunity (Exit 137) to try to get a picture of it.  The object was out of our sight for two to three minutes while we turned around.  When we got back to the place where we passed beneath the object, it was gone without a trace.I am pretty familiar with military and civilian aircraft, fixed and rotary wing alike, having grown up in a military family and around air bases/air ports.  I haven&rsquo;t the faintest clue what this object was, where it came from, or where it went.

They were stationalry and remained visable for approx. 30 seconds.  Two of the lights faded within 15 seconds of the sighting and the third, bottomlight, faded more slowly taking approx. 30 seconds for it to completely disappear.  There was no motion or sound. The lights were white and quite bright.  The lights did not penetrate the sky only remained stationary and almost like a constellation.  There is no such constellation in the southern sky at any time of the year that has ever resembled this pattern.", "Multiple UFO sightings in Kearney NebraskaOn July 4th, 2010, at 10:30 Pm me and my husband were outside watching fireworks when I noticed  12 Red orbs to the north of our house.  We watched as the orbs seem to be moving to the North, Northwest very slowly.  This was a different direction then the embers from the fireworks were going.  They were about a half a mile in the air and made no sound at all.  The UFO&rsquo;s stayed the same distance apart, and really had no formation that I could recognize. This cluster of Red orbs moved out of sight in 5 to 6 minutes.  Then as I watched the sky I saw one single red orb come from the east, moving to the west the same path as the cluster moved. It seemed to move at the same speed and the same height as the others had.  The light faded and just disappeared within five minutes.  In the next 15 minutes we had seen two more orbs do the same thing as the previous ones.I really have no idea what these UFOs were but I am glad to see others had seen the same thing.

At first we believed it to be cloud cover being the reason they vanished but they never reappeared considering their brightness. Ten minutes after first sighting.  We saw the same shape again coming from the south but a little farther east.  This time one appeared then followed by another then followed by another.  Each one was evenly paced.   After going a distance the first object disappeared, then another came into view.   Each object got to the same point and then disappeared and again another appeared.  This time there was five to six objects.I work for the military and checked with the local helicopter BDE.

Then moving away slowly, over NW Los Angeles CountyIn the 9 pm hour noticed a particularly bright white light in western sky.  It was strange because it was a hazy night, and no stars or planets were visible, as it was not a clear enough evening.  Not only was this visible, but it was exceptionally bright.The object was stationary, and high in the sky.  I showed my wife who also thought it was strange, because no stars could be seen, but this could.  I decided to stand on my porch with binoculars and look closer.It was difficult to make out any discernible shape, because the white light was too bright.  But it was just sitting still in the sky.  No aviation lights blinking of any kind.  No detectable movement.  It was definitely not a helicopter, or plane.  I watched commercial planes fly by it, and sometimes under it, on their approach to LAX and Burbank airports.I mad sure not to move my position on my porch, so that I could keep the lights position in perspective against the visual landmarks I was comparing its position too.  It remained still, lined up in the same spot and  not moving. I judged this by relating it&apos;s position to a palm tree, and telephone lines in my line of view.It was hard to judge how far away it was, because I don&apos;t know how big it was.  It definitely wasn&apos;t close by.  I would guess hovering somewhere between Woodland Hills and Malibu, CA, both due west of my location.After about 30 mins I was ready to give up, having decided it simply must be a very bright viewing of Venus or something, when it suddenly (albeit slowly) started moving to the north and further away (out towards the ocean, maybe near Thousand Oaks, CA).I watched closely, and had my wife join me.  She had been checking it&apos;s location from time to time, during the half hour.  She completely agreed that it had moved significantly off the spot it had hovered, completely still in, and was moving away.I felt that it also seemed less bright, and possibly even a slightly orange hue, during its exiting the area.Eventually it was out of our view.

I didn&apos;t knew where to report it then.  However, I&apos;m reporting it now because I saw an article in my local newspaper today regarding a UFO sighting in Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia, so I decided to search for a place to report my sighting.This is not a joke.  It was around May or June last year.  I was waiting for my girlfriend in my car at a petrol station directly opposite her house which was location opposite the Malaysia National Zoo.It was a sunny afternoon.  The time was approximately between 1300 to 1400 hours.  I was looking into the sky because I have a habit of gazing at cloud formations.It was then I noticed a golden sphere object in the air, the color was somewhat rough like sandpaper, perhaps matted. I thought I was seeing things, so just to confirm it, I got out of my car and took a good look at it again.  It was still there hovering about the clouds as though it was trying to use the sun&apos;s glare to cover it&apos;s existence.The UFO was hovering approximately 10-12 Kilometers above ground level.  I&apos;m not quite good with measurements but it&apos;s about the altitude of a flying airplane.After 2 to 3 minutes, the UFO started to gain altitude till it disappeared amongst the clouds.  Not sure if it went into space or what, but it certainly doesn&apos;t look like a mirage.I can&apos;t see any proper means of propulsion on the unidentified flying object but it was definitely spherical.  Hope this report helps out the research on UFO.  This was definitely my first sighting.None of the Characteristics check-boxes below fits the description.  The UFO is just as I described it, no lights or anything, it just seems that the gold surface of the UFO reflects the light from the sun.This is the latitude an longitude according to my search on Google Maps: 3.207056,101.755012.

It shines a very bright lite and makes very weird patterns through the night skies.  I have noticed that when vehicles are passing through the valley it will get real dim and almost dissapear so it is not spotted.  After the vehicles pass it gets bright again. It also dims when it is changing its location.  My wife and kids have also seen this.

I was out in my pickup that I keep at my sister&rsquo;s house, doing some fishing and taking pictures of the scenery.  It was a clear blue sky and I was east of Skykomish at the Martin Creek trailhead for the Iron Goat Trail.  I thought I would head further up the road past the trailhead parking area on US Forest Service road 6710 for some pictures.  (There were two cars in the dirt parking lot).  Further on, I pasted a parked white full size van with a family that had been apparently hiking. I came to a side road that headed up the mountain on my right. I decided to take that road up to get some pictures of the scenery.  I then decided I would drive up as far as I could go where I could turn around safely. I found that spot and turned around and stopped to get my pictures.  From this spot I took 11 pictures, a few east up the valley and a few back down the road I had just come up.  I finally got back in my truck and headed back down the hill.  It was not until after my vacation when I returned back to California that I reviewed the pictures after they were enlarged on my computer at work.  I noticed on three pictures a spot that I thought must have been on the lens. All the other pictures had nothing on them. One was taken up the valley to the east and one to the west.

To the naked eye, it was about the size and brightness of Jupiter, slightly less.  My attention had been kept because this star had a pulsating twinkle to it, where it would twinkle white, red and green colors while keeping a white color to it.  The twinkling was rather fast, not a slow changing in colors, but pulsating.  The object was always stationary and did not move.  The first 10 minutes I looked at it with my naked eye.  I then went in the house and looked at it again for 10 more minutes with 8 X 21 binoculars, no change in size but still had the same pulsation to it.  I then went inside and spent 10 minutes looking at online star maps and satellite tracking maps on Nasa.gov, went back outside and it was gone.  I never saw how it disappeared.  I will attempt to look again in the sky tonight at the same tim! e to see if it appears again.((ADDENDUM TO REPORT FROM WITNESS))Disregard last entryFollowup on previous entry from day before.

I hadn&rsquo;t even gotten a half mile from my house when I saw a triangular shaped craft floating slowly above tree line next to me, to the north.  It was moving in a south easterly direction.  The only thing in the are it was coming from is forest.  The direction it was going is forest and rivers.  I don&rsquo;t remember what prompted me to look in that direction but, when I saw it I pulled my vehicle over and got out.  My girlfriend was following me in her car and I attempted to flag her down so she could see it too but, she just waved at me.  I stood on the side of the road and observed the craft for about 3-4 minutes until it was out of my sight.  There was no sound being emitted from the craft.  I was racking my brain trying to figure out what it was; it wasn&rsquo;t a modern aircraft that I knew of because there is nothing I know of that can move that slow and stay in flight except helicopt! ers, but they create a lot of rotor wash and noise.  The craft had 3 lights on it, that I could see. I could only make out the shape, not the color as it was dark so all I could make out was a silhouette from the moon light.  I can only speculate on the size, I guess it was about 100m in length.When I got where I was going I told my girlfriend what I saw and asked her if she had seen it.  She hadn&rsquo;t and she thought I was just waving at her.  Her mother and friend asked me if I had any missing time. I guess that&rsquo;s a sign of abduction, who knows.  There wasn&rsquo;t any missing time. Once it was gone from my sight I got in my truck and drove off.I was in highschool at the time, now in the military.  I am totally guessing on the year.

It looked almost transparent in the center, and glowed blue around the edges, looking almost jellyfish-like. I stared for a few minutes, stupefied.

As when they started they were parralell to one another the light on the left then came down below the light on the right and once again they hung there just like like for what  had to be 20 more mins.  After a while they changed position again back to being paralell with one another.Then the fireworks show ended and what couldn&rsquo;t have been more than a min after they began to change color and in an instant they were bright little yellow orbs but it wasn&rsquo;t so much that they got dim or changed color but more like they got father away from us very quickly.

While tracking this satellite we unexpectedly observed a very large burst of bright white light that illuminated the whole night sky in the area we were looking.

Their heads where big, and it was plain as day that they where not from this planet.  This memory pushes my intrest in the UFO phenomenon and i would really want to know what it was i saw", "The UFO was glowing white,red,and green and had others next to it, also moved upwards and had airplanes next to it.The time that I saw the crafts was around 11:30 pm. We had just got back from 4-wheeling and we had a barbacue.  I was sitting on a ledge and looked up into the sky.  At first i saw 2 crafts about 10 feet away from each other.  Both were blinking red,white, and green.  I then saw another one about 30 feet above both of them.  After about a min or two both were then moving upwards at a slow pace. It seemed as if they moving towards the one above them.  I then saw a helpicopter or airplane fly towards the objects, it went right through it as if nothing happened.I then looked to my right and saw another object.  Of them origin, same shape and color.  I then looked to my right more and yet again saw another helpicopter or airplane and it was heading towards the object.  I looked back and the objects had not moved.  The two below the one were once again moving upwards.  Yet again another airplane or helicopter was seen this one however just flying to the north.  I then ate and sat back dow nand looked up in the sky....... they were gone.  I then went home to go to sleep.  During this whole event my father was right next to me and numerous times i said look up, what do you think it is. He responded I dont know.  He said he has never seen it before.  I explained it to my friend over the phone who said that it must have been extremely weird.  He beleived me. I beleive that i saw was a UFO, and i do believe that there aliens out there.  One more thing is that today 7/2/10 i went outside and looked up and as i was sitting on my porchi looked up and saw the same object as seen before, i went back inside before i got to see what happened to it.  That&apos;s my UFO sighting and i believe that its true.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Then I went to my folks in Franklin Sq, NY (about 60 miles West) and they said they saw the same thing.  It was not fireworks, because it moved staight across the sky untli it faded away.", "Multiple orange/ red flying orb/fireballs over clinton twp 10:30 p.mMe and my mother were by Manchester estates hoping to watch some fireworks when around 10:30 pm we noticed something we had never seen before in the sky.First we had seen just one large orange/red circle that looked as if it was on fire.  Trying to explain what we had seen we assumed it had to be a hot air balloon which would explain the fire.  After watching it for about 5 minutes a second and third one appeared to the west of it i think it would be.  I would also like to add that there were about 10 other people that were there trying to figure out what they were as well.We then decided to drive to a nearby school and ended up seeing 2 more of the &quot;fireballs&quot;.   We did not however see any fireworks so we went home.  Upon driving up to our house we noticed another one in the sky appearing to be flying north.These objects were going fairly quick to be a hot air balloon but were at a steady pace and height. There is no way it could have been a meteor.  They were definitely flying and not falling.  There was no noise or visible trails left by them.Neither me or my mother believe in aliens. However there has to be an explanation for what these are.", "07/23/10 duel lights( no strobes)above the Orlando area ,multiple helicopters around object(s)There is something looming over orlando right now.it consists of two bright lights both moving independant of each other.

I called the Orange county sheriffs office to be directed to the FAA in which I was recorded.the object/s shut its lights off and made a strange noise.  I grew up around military aircraft and my step father (retired military) witnessed the event and said it couldn&apos;t be flying under current FAA guidelines because it must have a strobe(which is not present)  I am going to drive to a better vantage point", "I took my son to the store about 9:00 pm on the evening of July 4th, 2010.  We left the store around 10:15 pm. My store receipt reads that we checked out at 22:10:13.It was the fourth of July and there were many fireworks in the area.  We were driving west.   As we turned south toward our neighborhood, I noticed a red and orange fireball just above the trees to the west.   It seemed to have a red center with a orange misty glow around it.  It was about the height of a street light and from our point of view, the outer glow looked like the size of a basketball.  It was difficult to tell if the &quot;glow&quot; was part of object or due to viewing it through the windshield.I traveled a block south and turned west on a street toward our neighborhood.   I turned a street earlier than I usually do to get a better look at the object.  When I came to the next intersection, 1/2 block distance, we saw the object above a house to the south.  We turned south.  I told my 11 year old son to keep an eye on it as I drove.  I traveled the length of two more blocks (still going south)  and then turned west again.  The object was now above the houses on the south side of the west bound street.  We drove two blocks to our house.  I pulled into the driveway.  My husband was in the yard with the kids.  I jumped out of the car and pointed it out to my husband.  It was south of our house in the sky at about a 45 degree angle and getting small but still too bright to be a star - and it was orange red.  We  watched it get smaller assuming it was getting further away.   It took several minutes before it disappeared.I went inside and the family continued to shoot  fireworks.  I would estimate I was in the house ten minutes when my  son came in and said &quot;Dad needs you.&quot;   When I asked why, my son said, &quot;The orange light is back&quot;.   Sure enough.  In the same spot it disappeared it appeared again  It looked like a very bright orange star.  I watched it for several minutes then came inside.  My husband reported it moved slightly to the west and then grew small and disappeared again.What drew our attention to the object was the  fourth of July fireworks in our area.   As we were driving home and nearing our neighborhood, we were watching the fireworks.   A large firework in that area lit off but this orange ball didn&apos;t move.   We expected it to explode and it didn&apos;t.   At first I thought it was a street light on fire or a fire in the trees.   Then as it floated above the houses, I wondered if it were a parachute type firework that was on fire and I was concerned about where it was going to land.When we first saw it, it was floating about the height of the street light and below the trees.  It climbed to float above a one story house.  Soon it was above the larger two story houses and when we finally saw it in the distance it seemed to be very high in the sky.We zigzagged in a south and west pattern to our home.  The object seemed to move south - southwest.  My vehicle was moving slowly at a 15 mph estimated speed.  The object moved ahead of us and I would assume it moved a quicker speed than our vehicle,  but not much given that it dissected our route.", "2 fireballs in the sky in springfield ohio july 4 2010july 4 2010 around 1030 1100 oclock we seen what looked like 2 fireballs in the southwest skies traveling northeast.we were having a 4 of july party and most of us seen them.  as they flew 1 disappeared and the other kept flying.as it passed over us the fire glow faded away but u could still see something flying it had no blinking lights and made no noise.unless wright pat has some new stuff or they unidentified flying objects because it wasnt no airplanes helicopters hot air balloons i never seen anything like this in my life.  my  wife seen them 2 of my kids my brothers cousin his baby mama friends people down the block.  i am no longer a believer im a knower", "Very bright  colorful lights.While walking my dog, I notice a strange light in the sky with red, yellow lights.

My wife and I were told about him by a female friend living in Chicago, who had become his acquaintance. The call lasted approximately one hour, during which time he explained his origin, how he came to this planet, his people&apos;s purpose in being here, and how he currently occupied the body of a man born on earth.During the conversation he also answered a number of my questions: about his view of our civilization, the amount of time he and those of his particular race had been on earth, the number of his people living among our population, and certain questions re: history and current events.The gentleman was astonishingly clear and logical in his expression; almost like a scientist or professor.  He also seemed almost Spock-like in his lack of emotion.Should you wish to have a more thorough report I can send in more detail the topics of our conversation.  It has been about thirteen years, but I believe I can recall a number of points he made.  Thank You Sincerely((name deleted))((NUFORC Note:  We have met with the source of the report, and we deem him to be a serious-minded source.    PD))((ADDENDUM FROM SAME INDIVIDUAL WHO SUBMITTED REPORT))Peter, I am going to break the rules as far as filing this more detailed report of my conversation with the gentleman from Chicago.  I apologize in advance, because I know you are highly disciplined in your work...It is just that I&apos;d like to get this to you via your personal e-mail (In truth, I&apos;m a real amateur on the workings of theinternet.)As you will read, I will include the names of both the extraterrestial being, as well as the man whose body he purported to occupy (who is now, as of about a decade ago, deceased.)  I will leave it to your discretion as to whether you wish to include  that purportedly occupied person&apos;s name.Tacco and I sat down together to put in place the clear memories of what was shared.  We know that we&apos;ve lost certain things that were said - to our great regret - but what is written to you is quite accurate according to the gentleman&apos;s statements and claims.----------------------------------Recollections of A Call from an Extraterrestial Who Gave Us the Name &quot;Shimikus Etua&quot;In the summer of 1997 I received a call from a Philippine born woman in Chicago - a long time friend who once babysat for our children - with regard to an older man she had met.  The gentleman, she told us, identified himself initially as a &quot;Eugene Randall&quot; and lived in the Chicago suburbs.  She, being of an extraordinary open and pure nature, invited him to her family&apos;s residence to take more time to visit.  As a matter of fact, Mr. Randall visited our friend and her family quite regularly after the initial meeting.It was in the course of these visits that Mr. Randall told our friend that he, indeed, wasn&apos;t of this world, and identified himself  as, I believe it is called, a &quot;walk-in,&quot; by the name of Shimikus Etua.After a number of these visits by the gentleman, our friend called us to share the matter.  At the end of our phone call, I asked her if this person would mind calling me directly.  She said she thought it possible, and that he seemed quite open to share with those who could be open to him, and said she&apos;d ask him.  Several nights later, we received a call from Shimikus Etua.The following is a listing of recollections, and personal impressions I had from the phone call:1.) My first impression was that I was talking to a very serious and almost professorial individual who didn&apos;t express much emotion.  He seemed almost Spock-like.  There was no feeling of his being delusional or inconsistant.  He spoke in measured tones and answered my questions without hesitation or wasted words.2.) Shimikus (from now on &apos;S&apos;),  said that he came from a planetary system somewhere in the vicinity of what we call the North Star.  He said that he&apos;d traveled to our planet on one of a few very large &quot;mother ships.&quot;  I believe he mentioned that he&apos;d actually been born enroute to our solar system.3.) It was hard for me to believe, but he gave his age as &quot;about 3000 years old.&quot;4.) When I asked about his civilization&apos;s belief in a supreme being he immediately answered in the affirmative.  He then went on to explain that there was a time when his people were not good (I believe he even used the word &quot;evil), and that they tended to be self destructive as well as destructive to other civilizations.  However, long ago, before the journey to earth, a &quot;priest&quot; among his people began to teach a path of goodness, that, somehow had a great impact for the good.  His people went through a tremendous change, and left behind their negativity.5.) S mentioned that his people are more than a little concerned with the elements of self destruction on our planet, and wish to help us evolve as a species as they did long ago (I took this to mean, in the sense of &apos;consciousness&apos; and spirituality.)  When I asked how his people look at us, he hesitated for a moment, and then said that it is how we may look at &quot;primitive tribes&quot; in our own world.6.) He explained that those among his race who are now on the earth have come here with the help of earth people who are aware of them, and who have voluntarily offered their bodies and personae as vehicles for these aliens.  S spoke in glowing terms of Eugene Randall, who had offered himself for S.  (note: I could see that this whole matter of earth people contributing their bodies was entirely of their own free volition, and not anything like a hostile take over, ie, the 1950&apos;s horror classic, &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers.&quot;)  S also mentioned a Russian man, who, years ago during the Soviet period, had done what Eugene had done; the same admiration and gratitude was expressed for his courage and sacrifice.  (I don&apos;t remember the details of the Russian man&apos;s story.)7.) I asked how many of S&apos;s people were on the earth in the capacity mentioned above.  He estimated it to be about 8,000.Living in Seattle, I asked if he knew how many may be in the Puget Sound area.  He said he didn&apos;t know, and that they are not all in good contact with one another (I got the feeling that this race of people has been among us for a very long time, according to hisconversation.)   He did mention that there was a way for me to findsomeone if I wished; he explained that there is a symbol that his race uses, and went on to explain it:  It is two squares, one over the other, something similar to the Jewish star of David.  Only the squares are juxtaposed: One drawn straight up and down, and the other rotated so that the corners of the second square extend out past the middle of each of the first star&apos;s mid-lines - so you end up with an eight-pointed star shape.S told me that if I put this symbol in my car window, I may be approached and asked about where I learned the symbol...&quot;that may be one of our people&quot; he told me.8.) S expressed the serious concern of his race for our use of nuclear power, and said that even the &quot;peaceful use&quot; of nuclear reactors is very harmful to the cosmos.  Nuclear war was just a horror, as he expressed it, not just for us but for the others in our cosmos.  He said we didn&apos;t begin to understand the problems nuclear energy creates.  He also mentioned a concern for mid eastern wars, and the use of chemical weapons.  Though I didn&apos;t learn just how, S said that his people have ways to counteract the weapons we build; he mentioned their spoiling of chemical weapon stockpiles in Iran.9.) (I had some trouble getting this) The flood of Noah was mentioned: S explained that one of their larger spacecraft had lost its bearings and crashed in the arctic regions, causing a tremendous and sudden meltdown of ice, and subsequent flooding of portions of the globe (I assumed a tremendous explosion and release of energy.)  This, he said, was a contributing factor to the flood.10.) Situations of co-habitation with earth people: It was also mentioned to me that there was a history of sexual co-habitation between members of S&apos;s race and earth people.  In particular, he mentioned that there were cases of this in the Philippine Islands (modern name), and that quite a few hybrid children were born as a result.  Lineages continue to this day.  An interesting note is that S mentioned our former babysitter who he had first met, and who had called us about him, was of that hybrid lineage.11.) I asked if there are any other extraterrestial civilizations near earth at this time.  He said that there are, and that, unlike his own people, they don&apos;t all have their personal problems worked out.  While his own civilization has only the desire to help us develop in a positive direction, there are others who would use us for cruel experimentation - almost like animal labs, and even  practice self gratifying sexual abuse with our people (certain horrible abduction experiences? - my reflection).  S mentioned that his people try to drive off these evil races when possible.12.) A humorous incident:  S has a brother, he told me, named Andronicus.  He said that one day, in downtown Chicago, they were in an elevator in a high rise building, and somehow, were in their original forms...A businessman suddenly entered the elevator, looked at them in shock, and blurted out, &quot;Where did you come from?!&quot;Andronicus, who was just as shaken up, reacted with, &quot;Well, from my mother!&quot; (S did mention that if I saw him in his original form, that I may be startled, though I got the sense that it is not that far from our own earthly bodies.)13.) S visited our friend, the Philippine woman, many times in the form of Eugene Randall.  She told me in a call sometime after my call with him, that he came to her home one afternoon to help celebrate her birthday.  After a while he expressed weariness and asked if he could take a rest.  She put him on the bed that she and her husband slept in.  Soon, a group of her church friends came by to say happy birthday, and saw this &apos;unknown man&apos; on her bed.  They became outraged and spread gossip about her.  When she later told S about what had happened, he became sad and upset at the same time.  He told our friend, and I paraphrase here, &quot;How long have our people been here on this planet working to help you, and still you don&apos;t understand the meaning of friendship and trust!&quot;*Several years ago, our friend called and told us that Eugene Randall had been found dead in his apartment by a neighbor.  What of Shimikus? I have no idea, nor does she.", "triangular formation of five orange glowing spheres on fourth of july about the time of fireworks.On fourth of july, myself, two friends, my girlfriend and her daughter went to the highest point in our city to watch the fireworks.  From this vantage point we could see about eight different shows.   When we first reached the top of the hill the fireworks had not yet begun, but as I scanned the horizon anyway I saw what looked like the orange lights of an oil drill rig out far in the ocean.  What was strange about it was that there are no oil drill rigs ever visible in my area, also it was far above the horizon which made me sure that it was airborne and was not floating in the ocean.  At this time I had pointed the object out to all the members in my group, they all confirmed this: we all saw five perfectly round spherical looking orange lights that seemed to be in a triangular position aimed in our direction( it would have been pointed northeast from the beach of orange county)we were staring westward out over the ocean.  As the show started we all noticed the lights raise up into the marine layer clouds.  During the show it seemed to poke out once but only with three lights visible. When the firework show was over, we noticed that all five lights in triangular position were once again visible and that it still seemed to be pointed in from the coast(north-east).  We stared  about 15 minutes at this until we decided walk home.  Back at home, I myself looked at the horizon since my interest was peaked, but the lights were completely gone, I noticed this at 22:30.  During the time of night we had these sightings there was a layer of clouds over the entire night sky so that the stars were not visible.  The last sighting of all five orange lights in formation was still easily seen through the mass amounts of smoke added to the cloudy sky after the firework show.", "UFO Red Lights Sighting in TitusvilleWhile sitting due east of Kennedy Space Center, I notices a bright Red light in the North at the horizon over the tree line.  It was a solid red light unlike the flashing airline lights.  I did not notice any white lights at all. I watched the lights get closer and I called my wife to look at this strange aircraft.  My sister in law joined me and we both watched as it got closer.  I went in to get a pair of binoculars and looked at it through them.  It looked like six red spot lights in a v shape.  I went back inside to get my camera and called my wife to look at this.  She came out and was watching it as it got more overhead.  Before I was able to get my camera turned it moved rapidly to the west and then stopped and vanished.  The sky was cloudless and it was just after sundown.

It was approximately 11:55 PM and the weather conditions were mild despite the humidity.  We had been launching fire works for about 10 minutes when the lights in the sky were noticed.  My wife, who is a paranormal investigator,  was filming the fireworks when she turned the camera and caught  phenomenon on video.

Finally after witnessing this for about 25 minutes it reduced from 3 separate circular light patterns to only one. T he pattern of the counter clock wise movement changed as well. Finally, it faded away.This happened about 1 &frac12; to 2 hours after scattered thunder showers.  At the time of the witnessed light movements, the sky was clearing away.  There was no storm activity; not lightning or rain.There was no sound.  No flashing or colored lights.

Report Includes Two Sightings by Others On Same Day.After I was done mowing my neighbors lawn at 4:15 p.m., I went outside for a cigarette.  I decided to look up for some sky gazing, despite the sun being the only thing hanging in the sky.The sun was shining behind some maple trees, decreasing its luminosity to the point where I was no longer blinded if I looked at it.  I could see bugs and pollen flying through the air, but I also saw something else as well.  Two metallic white / silver spheres caught the sun&apos;s light.  One proceeded to move North East, and I watched it fly to the horizon.  It seemed to have a sort of darkness around it, like a haze. The sky just seemed darker around it.  The other objects, still catching the suns light, hovered for a few more seconds and just vanished.I submitted the report to MUFON.  That day, another report was submitted by a man about how he and his wife and kids saw &quot;dozens&quot; of silvery spheres in Leesburg hovering in the sky over a Costco at about 5:00 PM, an hour after me.  They watched them for about a half hour, and saw some of them glow.  Their report also states that single spheres would split and become two, and two would become one.  They were moving North.Later that week another individual submitted a report to MUFON with pictures.  The individual saw a silvery white sphere flying North.  This report took place an hour or so before me in Richmond.That is three reports of silvery / white spheres in one day, over the course of a couple hours.  This is my report.  I don&apos;t know if the submitted theirs here or not but for investigation purposes, theirs and mine are on MUFON.  I am very sorry if NUFORC is a competitor of MUFON.  I just want to this story out to as many people as possible.The next day, somewhere between 4 - 4:15 PM I went out to the pipeline behind our house for another cigarette and in curiosity I looked up to sky at the spot where I saw the objects the day before.   My curiosity was peaked even more so because of a very low flying and very slow flying Blackhawk helicopter that flew over the pipeline.  I didn&apos;t think anything would come of it but I was wrong.  This time I watched a black sphere for a minute fly under one of the only clouds in the sky.

There were two or more bright blue lights and it was glowing slightly.  I saw it really close to the freeway (way too close for it to be an airplane), but suddenly I couldn&apos;t see it anymore.  I looked in the direction it was flying and I saw something in the very far distance, but I&apos;m not sure if it was the same object or not.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

PD))", "Unidentified Balls of light fly over Belleville after 4th of July celebration.On the night of the 4th of July I witnessed something in the sky that I could not explain.  Yes, I understand that everyone is shooting fireworks into the sky.  However, what I witnessed I do not believe were fireworks.  I was with a group of friends, some adults and some children.  We were firing off fireworks on a dead end street.  Lots of people in surrounding areas were doing the same. We had just fired off the last of the fireworks and things became quiet for a few minutes.  As I walked into the street I heard one of my friends say, &quot;Hey check out thos!&quot;  As I looked up into the sky, I was expecting to see some more fireworks exploding, only these did not appear to be fireworks.What I saw in the sky that night were small, round, what I considered to be balls of light.  They were a yellowish orange color.  At first there were only 2 that I could see so I continued to watch them.  They were moving constantly at the same speed from the south to the north. These objects were moving horizontally not vertically.  Everyone in our group became fixated on these things. Within seconds we saw more balls of light following. I really started to pay attention at this point.  I asked my friends if they had any idea what they were, although no one had any good ideas.  These things just kept coming from the south and fading off to the north.  I started to take some pictures on my phone because I had no idea what these were.  I don&rsquo;t have a video phone so all I got was still pictures. I wanted to narrow this down to somehow explain this.  These things were not making any noise that I could tell, they all stayed in the same position as they moved by, and they were not moving! fast.  From the time you first saw one it would take at least 1 to 2 minutes until you could not see it anymore.  There was no smoke or con trails behind these objects.  They did not flash or have any lights on them.  These things were round in shape but you could not see any &ldquo;hard&rdquo; lines on them.  They were on what seemed to be a straight line path going from south to north. I did not count them because of the sheer volume of these things.  There had to have been over 100 of these.  They all trailed pretty close behind one another and just kept coming, yet they were not in any pattern or formation.  I would guess that these objects were trailing across the sky over the distance of at least 5 to 10 miles.  From start to finish we watched these things for every bit of 10 minutes. I actually called my girlfriend to ask her if she could see the same thing in a neighboring town, she could not see what we did.  I talked to other friends that were just about 1 mile away from us and they ! said they saw them but thought they were hot air balloons.My friends did not seem to be concerned about this and were saying that there was probably an explanation.  I myself was not satisfied with this. When I got up the next day this was all I could think about.  I started to look on the internet for answers but got none.  I have lived next to an air force base all of my life and have seen many aircraft in the sky yet what I saw that night I cannot explain and I wish I could.  I actually thought that since this was such a huge thing going on in the sky on the 4th of July that it would be all over the news and in the news paper, yet there were no news stories.  I believed that thousands of people had to have witnessed this also, there has to be video of this somewhere, and credible people had to have seen this.What I witnessed that night I still can&rsquo;t explain and I am still looking for answers.  I do not assume that these were &quot;UFOs.&quot;  However until I can find out what they were; they are still UNIDENTIFIED!  I remember clearly what happened that night and I am willing to tell anyone, I just want some answers.", "Light over eastern MA moves NW to SENoticed light moving NW to SE in clear sky.  Constant velocity, very high altitude, and faded after about 2 minutes.  I concluded something entered the atmosphere.  Not a satellite or airplane, certainly not a meteor.  Much brighter than satellites, comparable to other major night sky stars.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.  PD))", "Groups of bright orange/amber lights in the evening sky July 3, 2010On Saturday, July 3, my mother and I had been watching the local lake association&apos;s fireworks display from the comfort of our living room.  Our west window had a perfect view of the fireworks that were launched over the lake.  After the &quot;grand finale&quot; at about 10:40, I got up to put the dog outside one last time for the night, and went our our back door.  I looked up towards the western sky and saw several pairs of bright orange lights moving from the WSW horizon (roughly the &quot;8:00&quot; position) in a NNE direction.  The lights were each at least as bright as Venus, which was still visible in the western sky at that time.  They just immediately struck me as very odd due to the orange color -- had they been the traditional white/yellow light of airplanes, I would have just assumed it was a group of planes traveling together in some sort of formation.I immediately called out to my mother &quot;Quick, look out the west window, there are UFO&apos;s in the sky&quot; -- only half jokingly, because the lights were just so wierd.  At the very same time, my mother was calling out to me &quot;What are those lights?&quot;  They struck her as very odd, too, her comment was &quot;are we being invaded?&quot;  I went outside to get a better look.  Over the next roughly 10 minutes, there were probably a total of 8 to 9 pairs of these orange lights, traveling from the 8:00 position on the western horizon to the area of the Big Dipper constellation, which was in the northwestern sky perhaps 3/4ths of the way up from the horizon.  The lights appeared on the horizon generally about every 60 to 90 seconds, and at most times there were probably 2 sets of them visible in the sky.  It took each pair of lights perhaps one and a half to two minutes to move that distance -- they appeared to be rather slow-moving.When the lights got quite high in the sky, most of the way towards the region of the Big Dipper, the lights dimmed and then finally went out entirely and the objects were no longer visible.At perhaps 10:50, about 10 minutes after the first objects appeared, there were no more to be seen, and I thought they were gone. After about 5 minutes, another 3 or 4 pairs of objects appeared following the exact same trajectory.  The last of these disappeared and I waited another 2 or 3 minutes and went inside -- I noted it was 11:03 pm when I came inside at that point.I have no idea how high or how far away these objects were.  When the lights first appeared, I should also note that I could see at least 3 planes in the sky in the same general region of the sky as these lights.  One of the planes was very low, with a single white light and moving from SE to NW, possibly to make an approach to Oakland Pontiac International Airport about 3 or 4 miles to the nother.  The other two planes were probably commercial passenger jets -- higher up, and flashing white, red, and green lights, one traveling from the NW to the SE, the other very high and traveling almost due west to due east.The unknown orange objects may have been low enough to be at the altitudes that small private planes fly at, or, for all I know, they may have been in orbit.  I should note that it was a very clear night, and even at that late hour there was still a glow of twilight on the western horizon, so it&apos;s possible, I guess, that if these were objects in orbit the light may have been the last rays of the sunlight bouncing off the objects.  I have seen the space shuttle in the International Space Station before, and those actually move in a similar manner to these unknown objects, but on those, when I saw them, the light was a very yellow light similar to Venus, not orange.  So, still kind of odd in my opinion.I couldn&apos;t detect any noise from the objects, but as I said, I have no idea how far away from them I was, and also, it was a very noisy night, with a lot of fireworks and firecrackers still going off, and a noisy party somewhere a street or two over with rock music playing on a p.a. system and people laughging and hollering.I find it hard to believe that a lot of people would not have seen these objects.  Since it was Saturday July 3rd, a great number of people were having parties and get-togethers, and it was a perfect, warm, clear, beautiful evening, and there was a lot of activity in the area, a lot of cars on the road, and so forth.  Since over 1.2 million people live in Oakland County, Michigan, I find it really hard to believe that a lot of people wouldn&apos;t have seen these lights, and I find it even harder to believe that they wouldn&apos;t have struck others as odd, too.I truly don&apos;t have a clue what these objects may have been -- some kind of squadron of old planes or ultralites traveling to an air show?  Military planes?  Had the lights been white/yellow, I would have thought so. I did ask my brother-in-law, who was a cargo pilot in the airforce during the Vietnam era, and who still is a private pilot, and he stated that planes would only have white/yellow lights, plus the blinking red and green wing lights on larger planes, but I suppose even he could be wrong.  Satelites?  Any that I&apos;ve seen reflecting the sunlight were a more white/yellow light as well.  So, what they were, I truly don&apos;t know.  I just know I haven&apos;t seen anything that color before moving like a plane moves, and definitely not in pairs and groups.  I carefully watched the local news that night and for the next few days, checked the local papers, and looked online, because I thought this might be a newsworthy event, or at least someone might offer an explanation of these lights.  Since then, I&apos;ve done a lot of searching online, and I haven&apos;t found any references to this event.  It still baffles me because the lights were just such an odd color of orange, so unlike any aircraft I&apos;ve seen.", "Fireball with red pulsating aura moving north north east creating a slight to moderate wooshing soundSitting on my front porch facing west I look up in the sky to my left (south) and i see a bright orange ball of light three times the size of a star and larger than a landing light of a large jet (like a ball of fire) coming at me from the south south west moving to the north north east (my left to my right as i look at it more closely i can see a red pulsating aura around the top side of the object.  As the object drew closer too me, I could hear a slight to moderate whooshing sound (not like the sound a jet engine would make) it then past almost directly over head then past me heading north north east.  When it moved a short ways past me the wooshing sound was no longer audible the object then made a slight arc to the north north east and continued a short ways.  The object was still quite visable when the fireball faded out and turned into a red point of light then went out of sight.  (This happend in a span of about 5 seconds)   The object looked the same coming at me, overhead and going away from me", "flying obects in ia skymy family and i were driving one day in des moines ia on i 30 and saw i huge black line in the sky and as it was fading away an airplane soon followed suite im guessing to say &quot;oh that was just an air plane...&quot; if anyone reported it which i would say someone would have because it wasnt at all a cloud it was a huge straight black line not a cloud. Then about a week later my family and i were walking nearing when our sun was setting there were no stars out yet but  my family and i love the sky and were admiring the clouds and sun when we see a moving object just gradully moving along the sky it slows down the stops moving my husband and i are saying omg ! its to far away to see the shape of it though but i do not think there is flying objects humans have ccreated that can just stop then it is going moving faster now then simply fades away no where near our horizon 2 weeks later which would be today i see the samething around 2 30 pm on my way home from work th! en after i take my son to eat dinner we play outside its roughly 8pm and i see 5 more objects that move slowly dont create plumes behind it if thats what it is called this objects can stop speed up and move backwards as i figured out today 2 of them that were going the same directon today were closer (finally!!!) so i got to see a shape there smaller in front the back is bigger there are no wings and seem to be reflecting the suns light so no diffent color but looks silver and they all just fade away not towards the horizon and not behind clouds i just would like to know whats going on in the skys i dont believe the goverment should have a say in what mankind gets to know and for us normal humins that want to live in peace and just want to celebrate life with other living things its not fair to hold that information away from us", "A light with a slight glow.We noticed the craft hovering on the west side of Middletown .

This &ldquo;star&rdquo; (first being spotted WNW) began moving west at a very slow rate and becoming more orange as it furthered itself in the distance.  At roughly 11:15pm we got out of the lake and I went to see if I could still see the star, I could barely see it.  In the time it took me to walk 15 feet back to my girlfriend, I looked back in the sky and there was what looked to be a fireball in the sky.  It was NNW in the sky and roughly a 45/50 degree angle off the water, about 40 times the size as the brightest star in the sky.This fireball was incredibly bright, with a yellowish color.  We had talked about how it was weird and possibly a plane.  I looked at my girlfriend, made another statement and looked back and there was a second fireball (about 25 times the size of the brightest star in the sky).  These lights hovered in the same exact spot for about 8 minutes or so.  One began to move while the other stayed stationary. The first fireball moved directly north, then directly east and looked exactly like a plane, then began to take a square shape and continue moving east.  The second fireball remained in place for about 5 more minutes and was still in the same position when we left.I&rsquo;ve lived on Lake Erie my whole life and I have seen orange orbs that seem to be unexplainable. Objects moving far faster than a plane would move.  However I haven&rsquo;t seen anything like this before. I was blown away when I used google.com and saw others were talking about this fireball in the sky.  I hope my information has helped and I will be sure to post any further sightings I see.", "Group of 14 see three seperate UFO&apos;S over Streamwood, IllOn the 4th of July myself and a group of neighbors (14) total saw three separate objects fly overhead.  The first object appeared from the s by sw going east by Ne. Elevation 2-3K feet up airspeed 300-400 MPH.  It was red/orange in color with some white light apparent on top. It lit the clouds up as it passed. Flew on a straight line, no sound at all.  As I first saw it made me think of a flying burning car. It had a rectangular shape as it crossed my view.  But all of them appeared to be more round then anything.I called the police and asked if anyone else was reporting what we just had seen and was told no.About 2-3 mins later the second came in a bit more east then the first.  Looked like the same craft.  I thought it had turned around- It followed the path of the first on.  IE it turned a bit to do it.  Again i called the police and was told no one else was reporting it.  They sent out a officer about 7-10 mins later.While waiting the third appeared this one much more eastward then the previous two.  It looked identical to the other two.  Again it turned and followed the other twos path.  I did whip out my blackberry and start shooting.  Got four shots one bright. the other three show it getting smaller as it went away.  Time between pictures was 5-6 seconds so it was moving rather quickly.People in surrounding suburbs described the same thing.These were not lanterns or fireworks flying by.  It was weird how you could see the clouds directly above these crafts.", "Yellow/Orange LightsOn 4th of July at about 10:45-11:00pm I witnesses two orange/yellow fireballs traveling W/NW.  I was visiting my cousins and we were outside shooting fireworks until about 11:30.  These particular lights caught my eye because they seemed to be much higher and traveling much faster (and more deliberately) than anything else in the sky.  I thought they were flares with the usual red color distorted by smoke traveling horizontally dues to a light wind we had.  After reading some of the other area sighting, however, I am having second thoughts.The lights resembled the video of the Phoenix lights I have seen in luminosity and color.  The traveled though the air, one following the next, at the same velocity and same altitude.  I only saw them briefly and didn&rsquo;t think much of it at the time and went back to blowing stuff up.  We shot off and watched a lot of fireworks that night but these lights definitely caught my eye due to how unusual and out of place they were.Later that night on our way back home to Bellingham I saw a single light, just like the two I saw about an hour earlier in Bothell , in the Marysville area while driving on I-5.  Identical in every way except that it was alone and appeared to be stationary.  I, again, wrote it off as a flare, even commenting to my wife how thick the firework smoke must be to distort the color so much.With the other reports I&rsquo;m starting to think what I saw may have been something else since it resembles what other witnesses report seeing around the same time frame in the same vicinity.", "Orange glowing cube near Beaver Dam, WIMy son and I were returning home from the Wisconsin Dells Saturday night when my son became increasingly animated about seeing a U.F.O.  I pulled off of Hwy. 33 at the next intersection, got out of my car and spotted a faceted cubic shaped object with a very bright amber light underneath illuminating the craft which appeared to glow orange.  It was almost directly overhead at this point, traveling West to East, and climbing at about the same rate a private plane would.  At this time a State Patrol squad pulled up along side of me and the officer lowered his window and asked &quot;what&apos;s wrong?&quot;   I said &quot;My son spotted a U.F.O.-  Take a look&quot;  He craned his head out of the window and said &quot;Sure enough, the Air Force must be doing some testing tonight&quot;  As the object ascended in the distance I got back in the car and traveled at normal Hwy. speed in it&apos;s direction but was not able to regain sight again.I&apos;ve reported this incident to Milwaukee T.V. stations, and they all claim no other reports were filed.", "I was walking my dog before the 10:00 news, looked up at the sky and saw an orange glowing object.My sighting occurred on Sunday July 4, 2010 at approximately 9:55 PM.  This was at Saylorville Lake in Polk City, Iowa, at Prairie Flower campground, Coneflower Loop.  I was taking my dog for a short walk and glanced up at the night sky, as I always do.  It was overcast, so I didn&rsquo;t notice any stars, but there was a glowing orange object.  I had to stop and stare at it as long as I could see it, which was probably 2 or 3 minutes.  It looked to me to be kind of a disc shape, with an oblong oval shape up through the middle.  It was glowing orange.  It looked like it had a red light on top momentarily.  It didn&rsquo;t have a real crisp shape.  I&rsquo;m not sure if that was because it was glowing or what.  I was facing the West and looking up at about a 30 degree angle.  I&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s right, but it wasn&rsquo;t directly overhead, but slightly down.  In relationship to the size of a full moon, I would say it was about &frac14; that size when the moon is high in the sky.  I was! n&rsquo;t sure if it was above or below the clouds.  It didn&rsquo;t move, but faded away.  I wasn&rsquo;t sure if clouds just blocked my view at that point or what.  A car drove up, so I moved to let them by.  They commented on how strange the sky looked earlier.  I agreed and told them I was looking at my first UFO.  I was thinking they thought I was crazy, but the lady stopped me the next morning and said she saw what I was looking at after I had walked on. A few minutes after my initial sighting, just up the road a bit, I looked up and saw it again!  I watched it for a bit longer this time.  It was in the same area and looked the same, except I didn&rsquo;t notice the red light on top this time.  It did move slightly back and forth and then disappeared. It didn&rsquo;t frighten me.  It captivated me!  I have looked at and admired the night sky all my life and have never seen anything like it!  I have even lived in the Mojave Desert, where there are no city lights to interfere, and other than the moon and stars, have only seen planes and the occasional satellite.

It was hard to judge the size because we did not know the distance away of the object.  It travelled slowly south southeast at an upward angle from the horizon of only around 20 degrees, maybe less.We do not know the visual origin of the light as it only caught our eye when already in the sky.

After throwing the valve, I looked up at the night sky and saw an amazing array of lights moving from the southwest to the northeast over our neighbor&rsquo;s alfalfa field, approximately 400 yds away and only 100 to 200 feet off the ground.  Four things struck me at once:  this thing was HUGE, slow, low and absolutely silent.I saw six white lights in a straight horizontal line, plus there was one blinking, smaller red light above the far-right light.  At my relatively close range, I estimated the thing at two to three football fields wide.  I&rsquo;ve never seen anything flying remotely as big as this, in my life, or heard of any plane so large.  The whole array was moving very slowly, maybe 15-30 mph.  I had the feeling I was looking at the trailing edge of a huge wing, or perhaps the edge of a disc.  It moved slowly along its trajectory, headed towards town, where there is an airport.I thought:  &quot;If this is a plane coming in to land, it&rsquo;s gigantic, must be some secret government job, but why is it silent and illegally (and dangerously) low?&quot;  As it moved along,  the bulk of my barn blocked it out, so I walked rapidly to the other side of the barn, towards town, and there it was again, following its course, and I watched it disappear over the hill, with no change in the light array.Very quiet, very low, very slow, VERY large.The next day I told my brother about it, and he told his son, who happened to see the same thing, with eight witnesses, 15 minutes after I did.  My nephew only saw four white lights in horizontal array, and guessed it was two craft flying in formation, but like me, wondered why they were so low, so slow, and dead silent.  He said they seemed to meet up with another, smaller, moving, bluish-colored light, and then turned from their course and moved towards the southeast and that when they did, super-bright lights flashed for an instant, like a prism turning, and then they moved slowly out of sight.I hold ((deleted)) degrees in ((deleted--arts and sciences)), including ((deleted--multiple degrees)) from the University of ((deleted)), and a ((deleted--advanced degree from prestigious overseas university)).   I have never seen anything like this in my life; it took me aback for an instant, but then I rapidly started to catalog and process what I was seeing.  I have an open mind towards unusual phenomena, and believe that the unexplained represents a major frontier for science.For what it&rsquo;s worth, I live within 10 miles of the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, now undergoing cleanup, where eight or nine deactivated plutonium production reactors, and one live power-generating reactor, sit in a row along the Columbia River.

We just had a storm and there is a great deal of cloud cover.  I found this strange since since this was below the cloud coverage. It was circular with one light to the left two lights in the middle and one on the right.  It was as if I was looking at the bottom of the craft.  I watched this craft for 40 minutes.  This craft was huge.  I have been seeing a great increase in crafts over Mingus Mountain and have calls from other neighbors and friends of what they are seeing as well.  I have been watching this activity for years.  With this particular craft it has been by far the largest one I have seen. What this craft did was move up and down and just hover there.  There is no way possible that no one else could have missed this since there is a freeway there.  It was extremely low and stayed there for a long time.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  Date may be flawed.

At first I thought that their house was on fire because the object had the color of a campfire, rather dull, and pulsated slightly, as a flame would.  Then as it crossed the sky, I realized that the object was moving rather slowly and without sound. It was too low to be an airplane and too slow.  It was about 300 feet in the air and traveled at the speed of a hot air balloon until it disappeared over the tree line.  It was traveling SE to NW, and I observed it for about a minute.

It appears suspended/fixed for about 3-4 minutes at a time, then continues to move slowly, further west. I have been keeping an eye on it, trying to discredit this object as a mere, bright star or a planet (Venus perhaps).   Last night, 7/20/10, this object appeared brighter than ever.  It looks just like what an airplane&apos;s headlights would look like at night if it were coming directly at you, however, this object does not appear to move at all.  The curious thing about it is, it twinkles with a barely perceptible reddish hue. It will also dim to the point of being unnoticeable as if a dark cloud were obstructing the view. Interestingly though, there has been little to no cloud cover over the last few days.  I have tried to take video/stills with my phone but my camera does not fare well in low light conditions. But at the same ti! me, my camera cannot pick up any other star in the sky let alone a dot of light.  In conclusion, I can&apos;t discount the fact that planet Venus could be the culprit as I have little experience with astronomy.  But if you were to see how bright this object is, you would most likely say to yourself, &quot;That object is much too bright to be a planet or star.&quot;  I just want someone with experience to take a look at it and prove me wrong.((NUFORC Note:  Venus.

There were nearly 20 of us present including several children under the age of 10.  At 22:15 one of us noticed an orange light in the sky almost directly to the east of us maybe a few miles away.  The light was moving above the tree line but quite a bit lower than an airplane.  There was absolutely no sound at all with the light.  It moved slowly towards us then veered slightly to the south and disappeared.", "Flashing red light in south western sky emits light orbs and is seemingly pursued by a fighter jet.It was about 11:30pm central and I was outside in my backyard on the phone with a friend, looking at the stars as I frequently do when I&apos;m outside, and I notice a flashing red light sitting in the sky to the south west.  I continue on with my conversation just watching it when it starts to move east still flashing. I ask my friend who lives about 7 blocks north of me to go outside and look, he sees it as well but dismissed it since he has work in the morning. So we get off the phone and I continue watching it, it then changes direction from moving east to moving west immediately without slowing and appeared to continue at the same speed it had been going, which is when I decided to go inside and tell my Father to come out and look.  So we go to our back yard and continue observing it, it then starts moving from west to north.  We watch it for a little while, every now and then the light would just stop then resume 10-20 seconds later, not in sequence, just at random times this would happen.  It continued doing strange maneuvers such as ascending and descending quickly, changing direction without slowing, sometimes stopping altogether, and changing speed sporadically from very slow to fast. It stays in about the same general area, to the south and to the west turning, moving back and forth up and down over that area.  We were already amazed by how it was changing direction immediately with no change of speed, it didn&apos;t slow down it simply started moving the opposite direction in an instant, and did that numerous times.  After a while of this it is in the same area, still south west but slightly more west, and it stops as it had done a few times before.  This next part happens over the span of 3-4 seconds:  When it stops the light goes off, also as it had done numerous times beforehand, and suddenly emits a very very bright white orb of light about twice the size of the initial flashing red object we had been observing, and I&apos;m talking ! really bright, this white orb seemingly splits into 2 orbs of ! light, o ne descending and one ascending which both dim and go out very quickly. As I said that happened over the course of 3-4 seconds, and was quite extraordinary. The object then resumes moving, and is heading west to a point where the tree line behind our house was blocking our view so we couldn&apos;t see it. Over the course of the next 10 or more minutes we would see it over the tree line a few times, moving south, sometimes north, and still flashing. At a few points in time over the course of the whole observation when the blinking would cease, rather than us not seeing it which had happened a few times, it would appear as just a solid red light moving, then continue flashing. The flashes were slow the whole time they were happening, not in perfect sequence but each was about one second apart, sometimes slightly faster sometimes slightly slower. So at this point we&apos;re only seeing it every now and then over the treeline, until it moves farther west to the point where we don&apos;t see it! at all for about 5 minutes. It had never made any noise. There are many fighter jets at our airport currently, they fly over many times a day, they are much louder and fly much lower than the commercial planes that fly over town do, about the same altitude the propeller planes fly at. One takes off from the airport which is about 1 1/2 miles west of our house, we saw it ascend from the area of the airport, it was flying low, looped around east over the very edge of town not far from our house with all of it&apos;s lights on, and as it turned south west the engines got much louder, and took off fast in the direction of the object we had been observing until it too moved far enough that the tree line prevented us from seeing it. We continued watching  for a while and neither returned. It was right about 12:25am when we decided to go in since it was late and the event appeared to be over. I&apos;ve returned outside numerous times over the course of the night and it has not returned, an! d obviously decided it was worth reporting, in hopes somebody ! else may have seen this.

At first we thought it was an airplane but then it stopped, that puzzled us so we kept watching and it has moved a little bit from where it stopped.

I was camping with my girlfriend and another couple that were friends of mine. In the early hours of July 7th, just after midnight, my girlfriend and I had decided to take a walk to the lakeshore area to have a view of the stars.  We had left my friend at the campfire alone, his wife had recently retired for the night in their tent.  It had been fairly cloudy the previous night and this particular night was much clearer, so I wanted to get a good view of the stars before we were to leave the campgrounds the following afternoon.  We walked to the shoreline area and sat at a bench that overlooked Lake Michigan from a distance.  The bench looking north, over the rocks and weeds that led to the vast waters of the lake.  The sky was fairly clear and it was still night. I remember commenting to my girlfriend on how beautiful the stars were.  My girlfriend was looking for the Pleides constellation but couldn&apos;t remember exactly! what it looked like or where to find it.  As we sat there, I noticed that some clouds were moving in from the northwest and we wouldn&apos;t have much time left with the clear sky.  The clouds seemed to be moving in, fairly quickly.  I turned my head to look at the southern sky and saw a satellite moving across the atmosphere and I pointed this out to her.  I jokingly told her that for all we knew it could be a spaceship disguised as a satellite.  She didn&apos;t seem to want to go along with this joke and she repeatedly told me that it was a satellite.  I told her I was just kidding and told her it was a satellite.  At this time, I began turning my head to look back towards the lake.  My eyes quickly caught sight of a very bright white light coming in from the northwest, almost as if it came out of nowhere. Instantly I stated to her, &quot;What is that?&quot;.   We observed a very brilliant and bright white light coming in from the northwest heading in a slightly southeastly direction.  This light did not pulsate or flash, in anyway.  It was a steady light that moved briskly across the night sky, almost as if it was gliding.  Also, the light or object made no sound.  During its path of flight, it&apos;s altitude did not seem to change.  It&apos;s difficult to judge how high it was in the sky, but it appeared to be flying very low.  Perhaps a 1,000 to 2,000 feet.  It steadily glided past us.  My girlfriend attempting to tell me that it was probably just a plane, but I saw no flashing lights of a plane that I&apos;m used to seeing.  I could make no shape out behind the light.  It was so solid and bright, that if did come from an object, the light completely engulfed it.  This light continued to glide past us and over the treetops of the campgrounds, directly to the south of us.  From this vantage point we could see the back end of this moving object and the light was just as bright and brilliant from the back as it was from the front.  At this point, the object slowly disappeared into the cloud or mist cover that just hung over the treetops, and out of our sight.  As it began to fade into the low cloud&#x5C;mist cover, the white light began to fade.  I&apos;m uncertain but I thought I saw some solid form to the object, catching sight of perhaps the back end of an object, but like I said I can&apos;t be sure.  I thought I caught view a small orb like object that seemed to be attached to a larger object.  Then, it was gone.  All in all, this episode lasted about 20 seconds, from the time I first saw the object &apos;til it disappeared over the treetops. Most importantly to me, though, was that there was no sound.  This object was absolutely silent.  This object flew very low, as far as plane standards go and I&apos;m still amazed that there was no sound!   I&apos;m completely baffled by the brightness and silence of this object.  I&apos;m left with something that is absolutely mysterious to me.", "We saw about 10 glowing objects floating in a similar path in Southwestern sky 7/31/10 about midnite.I was in the backyard of my daughters house close to midnite,when I saw a glowing object raise into the sky.  Then another and another all in the same flight path.  I ran in the house to get my daugthter she came out saw the objects and ran back in and got her camera.  In all their were at least 10 glowing orbs that all followed a southwestern path and then disappeard.  I do believe in UFO&apos;s,but I&apos;m thinking someone set off some sort of glowing objects maybe with parachutes or something.

And then I get a little interested in that and I look again and I see that it dipped down to where I couldn&apos;t see it.  I kept looking over to glimpse it...I thought I lost it but I kept looking anyway because I kept seeing bits of it through some bushes.About 10 sec pass until I see it again, and it&apos;s fairly low to the ground; it looks like it&apos;s moving quickly so it must be have been somewhat close.  Maybe 50-70 yards away.  So I see it again and it pops up and this time, I saw more lights on it.  Each corner of the triangle had white lights and there are more along the edge that were turning on and off in a random pattern...some would flicker, blue ones flickered, but could have been other colors too.  It was black as the night sky except for the pattern of lights on each edge of the triangle.  And I could see this by the time it swooped up from a lower position.  So it would swoop up and then it would flip or tumble and then swoop very low to the ground.  It would swoop and tumble and traverse through the air while tumbling.  Like it was a black triangle flipping end on end.3 big bright white lights would light up on the edge of it.  And they would get really bright every time it would swoop down.  It would probably be down for 3 sec at a time, then it would go up again and tumble again.  And when it would tumble, it would stay up for about 10 sec at a time just doing random things in the air, flip up over end, go through the air at the same time, looked very random.Dip back down, flatten out...looked triangle the whole time, then it would go down and the 3 white lights would swell and look like head lights.  Then would go back up and other lights would come back on.  It did this about 4 to 5 times that I saw and then I got to the overpass and called my girlfriend to tell her about it...looked behind me on the phone and saw it again.  From that point onward I didn&apos;t see it dip down again.  I took the next off ramp (W Kamm Ave), took the overpass and parked. I could still see it but by that time it looked like a normal plane in the air because of it&apos;s lights.  It traveled away, north, for about 2 minutes until it was out of sight.The most incredible thing about the sight was how close to the ground it would get.  I thought it was landing at times and then it would go up again.  The 3 bright lights that shone down seemed to illuminate the ground, like it was scanning something.", "Pyramidal-shaped Craft Over Lakeville North High School FieldOur family attended the Fourth of July fireworks show in Lakeville, Minnesota this evening.  My entire family and several other people sitting around us witnessed a light brown flying object with a glowing golden ball in the center.  This thing was not an airplane or firework debris, as it slowly flew across the length of the entire sky over our heads in a curved line at the same altitude.  It flew from a west direction towards the east, but then curved northward, again at what appeared to be the same altitude throughout.  The top of this thing spun around, and one side of it was black with something that protruded from it (you could see this black side with the protruding thing spinning slowly as it flew across the sky.)  It had no smoke, no sound, and this protruding thing swung around the top of it only randomly and very slowy while the bottom of it did not spin.  The best way I could describe the protruding black thing was that it looked like a large tel! escope with a dark shiny window in the center of it.  I say it was shiny window because you could see light reflecting off of the center of it, but the rest of the telescope thing itself didn&apos;t reflect light.  The entire object was pyramid shaped, but the top of it spun around slowly while the bottom of it seemed to remain stationery.  A glowing orange ball was right in the center of the bottom of it.  There were at least twenty five other people around us who looked up with us and watched this thing as it slowly flew by.  I have never seen a ufo before, but I have never seen anything like this thing that we saw tonight.  It happened at around 9pm at Lakeville North Highschool, about an hour before the fireworks began.", "I lived on the beach in Carpinteria at the time of the sighting.  The reason I am writing to you is that I have never heard of the type of sighting that I had.  I was in the back yard with a friend watching the stars when I saw something out of my peripheral vision.  I turned to see a rose colored rectangle shaped fog or cloud comming towards us.  We stood completely still.  There was no sound, it stopped right above our heads and stayed there for 20 seconds or so.  The object was not visible to us, just a fog, the only thing I can relate to would be what Star Trek called cloaking.   The fog object was rectangle in shape, rose pink in color.  We watched it as it went over the ocean towards the Channel Islands which are about 20 miles from my home.  The craft flew over the ocean toward the islands and disappeared within 10 seconds.

What is it?&rdquo;   Everyone (more than 15 people&mdash;adults and children) looked toward the eastern sky to see what it was.  We observed what appeared to be a white light that was moving very strangely.  It would go to the right, then the left, circle and up and down.  It was able to stop abruptly before it changed directions.  I&rsquo;m not sure exactly how far away it was, as there was nothing to accurately gauge it by.  It also appeared to have lights that changed from white to blue to red or purple.  Finally, after about 10 minutes it just seemed to disappear.

It was evening but not 100% dark yet, both apartment lights had automatically come on by this time.  I looked across the street at our neighboring apartments to see some lights floating above the building.  The lights matched the color of the apartment lights which were orange (that industrial orange you see everywhere).  I thought I was seeing things so I covered the apartments from my view with my right hand...  I then saw what it was that was floating above the apartments.I was amazed to see 2 UFO&rsquo;s they were round, and both had 3 lights shining, the lights were round and placed in a triangle pattern at the bottom of the UFO.  They were literally 3 stories from the ground.  They hovered around each other, in very close proximity to each other, without making a sound.  They did this for what seemed to be 1-2 minutes before accelerating to speeds of, I can&rsquo;t even make an educated guess at how extremely fast they took off toward the east.  They took off almost parallel to the earth (if that makes any since) in other words they didn&rsquo;t go straight up they left at an angle.  Their speed literally went from maybe 1-2 mph to an excess of 200 mph in 1 second. They both left at the exact same time as if they both knew it was time to go.  As they left,  they made not one sound, they were gone and I haven&rsquo;t seen them again since, although I wish I would catch another glimpse of them because they do fascinate me.  I can only imagine the view from someone in that apartment complex, to have walked outside, looked up and seen 2 UFO&rsquo;s hovering above them only 3 stories from reach.

I just Googled: &quot;orange triangle light glow over salt lake city tonight disappears&quot; which led me to another site.  I thought I would find others who saw this. someone suggested this site to report what I saw.  If I thought it was going to disappear like that I would have taken a picture.Well to the right of the full moon from my perspective, maybe 20 degrees, I just noticed a very strange orange flame like light that appeared to be heading North toward the Avenues (it was to the South of me). I presumed it was odd colored forward lights to a plane flying low in the Valley.  It was odd from the start.  It was like a triangle in the center surrounded by a flaming orange with almost a tail of the same flaming orange. I stared at it for 2 minutes expecting it to eventually make sense.  But it didn&rsquo;t. It didn&rsquo;t move much really.  Never any noise.  I was expecting and listening for an engine noise that never came.Then it started to fade. I thought it was turning away, but then it faded, still visible but smaller.  Then it totally disappeared.  I thought maybe it went behind a cloud.  But there were no clouds in the sky in that area at all.In total I witnessed this for about two minutes.  And at arms length, it would have taken a full fingernail to cover it up.The Orange balls of light I see here described by others in other areas sound very similar.((ADDENDUM SUBMITTED BY WITNESS))Possible explainations of what i saw in Salt Lake City last night((name deleted)) in Salt Lake City 24 hours later:  I&rsquo;ve tried to make sense of what I saw last night and came up with two plausible theories.  The first, which I have disqualified is that I was witnessing a reentry by the Space Shuttle at a much greater distance than I originally perceived and at an angle more or less directly toward my position.The second, is that I was watching some sort of burning balloon.  I had this notion in my mind tonight and then saw some you tube videos on Chinese lanterns.  If that is what I saw, it was quite large and was either on fire entirely, or was supporting an enormous flame before burning out.  This does however explain the orange flame color, the lack of sound, the slow movement, and the ultimate disappearance if it were to burn itself out.Still, I wish someone would confirm they saw what I saw last night, or someone would confess to launching the thing.  Like I say, I saw it for two minutes before it disappeared.  It could have been there much longer before I noticed it upon admiring the full moon.((END ADDENDUM))", "Silent orange objects flying in the night sky in Dearborn, Michigan.Myself and two others witnessed what looked like two balls of orange fire flying through the night sky while enjoying a fire in the back yard.

I have to say I believe it was watching me watching it.  Just a feeling I was getting.  This was no big giant craft not a triangle no flashing lights the one light just stayed fixed on.

My father even talk&apos;s about seeing a cigar shaped UFO while fixing a roof for my grandparents when I was 3 years old.  He saw me on the front lawn when there was a bright light.  My father and his twin brother saw the craft and the light.  I dissapeared for 4 day&apos;s then just showed up on my grandparents front lawn with no explimation.  This was in Chesterfield, UT, June 1960.Then March 1973, my ex-husband and I were driving from Tucson AZ to Salt Lake City.  I was driving and he was sleeping in the back seat.  I remember pulling out of Flagstaff AZ and watching the light behind me turn red.  Next thing I remember is being in Park City Utah. I don&apos;t know how much time had passed because we did not have a clock or watch with us.  No gas had been used and my exhusband was bleeding out of his nose.I for whatever reason was bleeding from my virgina as if on my period.  The bleeding quit almost immidiatly. Five years later I was almost 5 months pregent when I suddenly found myself in the bathroom with blood all over and no longer with child.  I did not go to the doctor for fear of being told I was crazy.  However I do remember holding a little boy that was moving and his head was too big and his neck was extra long.  Why I would remember that I don&apos;t know.I do know that my exhusband was very upset when at the next appointment when the doctor said that I had miscarried.  I have had a history of losing babies.  While I have four children I have had 4 miscarraiges or what the doctor indicated was a misscariage. Each time I was almost 5 months along and then no longer with child. No memmory of losing the baby.  In one case twins.No known reason until recently.  They tell me I have Protine S Diffency with clogaophthy.  And some other unknown genitic disroder they do not understand.  They see it the blood however have no idia what it is.  It is killing me.  Why no one understands.Normally the craft is extreamly large when I do see them.  When they do apear they are large enough for occupation and are disc shaped.  The one time I saw more than one UFO the disk was chasing a craft that looked like a cigar.  There was also a boomarange type craft almost acting like a wing man to the disk shaped craft.  There seemed to be artilary being used because I saw what seemed to be a direct hit to the cigar shaped craft.  They all just winked out.  This incident happen while I lived in Amhurst OH in the summer of 1974.Many times in Tucson AZ we have UFO activity when the Airforce will send aircraft afther the objects.  This happens at least once a year.  We have even been listening to the radio outside and heard reports about a possible UFO then nothing.  I have even been speaking on the phone with my sister when I&apos;ve seen the UFO and then all sort&apos;s of aircraft from the base chasing the UFO right over my house.In May of 2000 I saw a strange craft above the apartment building I was living at and even had a wittness.  A man that also lived there.  He moved the next day without a word. The craft looked to be the size of a 50 gallon drum.  It just floated there.  No sound. No lights.Now the crafts are extreamly small.  No larger than my finger nail.  The 1st time I saw one that small was in Salt Lake City, Utah when I went for a funerl in March of 2008.  Then in July 4th, 2009 in Phoenix AZ.  June 29, 2010 in Tucson, AZ I saw it again. I&apos;ve seen it six times sense then. I am very delighted yet concerned.  Each time this happens seems to be when a storm is comming about or just ended.  There will be small flashes from the object of different colors.  They hang around for about 10 to 15 minutes.

One of the miniture UFO&apos;s actually landed on my little grandaughter.  She is 21 months old.  When I tried to grab it my hand went right through it.  I picked her up and brought her in the house.  The craft just hovered at the door.  Why if my hand went through the thing does it stay outside.

They emitted red and orange light over their entire surface, almost as if the light was being reflected from their surface.  The orange and red light was hazy but it spread in every direction; similar to the same effect that takes place when one squints while looking a street light at night.  The moon was entirely full and these objects were easily detectable.  They moved very fluidly as they flew to the northeast.  They made no sound and they flew as if they were all separate entities; flying closer and farther apart.  It seemed as if they were gliding because they were almost dipping in the sky, but they also rose.  They flew very smoothly, but it seemed as if they were suspended at times and even slightly moved backward.  I yelled to both my girlfriend and her friend to look into the sky and they were immediately taken aback by the occurrence as well.  My girlfriend took a picture on her Iphone and the figures&rsquo; arrowhead formation is unmistakeable.They flew out of view to the northeast and another object of the same description emerged from the southwest.  This object, too, flowed very smoothly but seemed to have slowed down more than the other three and stay suspended for a longer period of time; about two seconds.  It was difficult to see how large the objects were because they were so far away but they were about the size of a penny on its side at arm&rsquo;s length.

During the show (they were small fireworks) a orange orb of sorts was hovering right above the treetops off in the distance as if it was watching the display.  It was still, pulsated orange/red (I thought it was a cellular tower at first but then I realized that HEY we are out in the country, there are only trees out that way)  It moved slowly westard, sat another few moments, moved eastward, sat a few moments, faded out, reappeared slowly 2-3 minutes later, sat about 2-3 minutes, and slowing faded out of sight.  I would be shocked if the party people did not notice it, but you never know, the wiskey runs a little freely around the 4th).  I have seen this particular orb/UFO three other times over the past 2 months with the same mannerisms.  My honest opinion about this particular episode was that it was indeed watching the fireworks display.  You can almost tell it was intrigued by the display as if a small child was peeking around his fathers legs to check out a large dog.  It is so exciting to see our alien friends coming out of the woodwork, every night is a new adventure when darkness falls on NE Ohio!", "teriffying and amazingi remember it was like yesterday i was with my step mom and her family and we had a little picnic outside in the front yard and i was siiting down and i remember i was staring at this cloud for about twenty minutes and i finally stoped and then i went inside to use the restroom and then after that my cuzin asked me some thing so i turn around and i see six big bright lights for at least three seconds and then i stood up and then it disapeared like so fast it was so terrifing and amazing and then after that i stared at the same cloud for another thirty minutes and i could not control my self and finally i went inside and fell a sleep on point when i went inside later that day and that is it.((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoax, we believe.

Grabbed my binoculars and had a clear view of them as they passed overhead.  Almost looked as though they were engulfed in intense orange flames, more brilliant in color than any orange you can imagine.  Totally silent, no strobe lights, no white lights, just two huge objects engulfed in a glowing brilliant orange flame-like color.  Afterwards huge military aircraft were seen flying thru the skies as though patrolling the area but the objects were long gone by then.", "5 Red/Orange lights, turn to 3, then disappear on July 4th, Wakefield, MAI spotted 5 orange/ red objects in the sky, for about 5 seconds before they went behind a batch of trees ( 3 trees) These objects were in the shape of / or a ladder i guess you can say.About 15 seconds later, the top light emerged from behind the trees, and proceeded across the sky. This light was in a perfect line going across the sky. It moved slowly at times, and few times picked up a little speed. I told my girlfriend to take a look and she began observing as well.About a minute later, the second light emerged and started a similar path, never moving up or down. The light was a bit dimmer than the original 5 cluster sighting.The top one moved a bit slower, while the second one looked as if it were catching up to it.A 3rd light came out, and went across the sky about half way towards the 2nd and then seemed to almost stop in place.We kept watching the 2 lights that had appeared first. The first moved slowly across the sky. The 2nd faded away, but then seemed to get a bit brighter and literally reappearing.  This happend about 3 times, before staying away, while the first continued across the sky until going behind a patch of clouds, and our attention being redirected to the fireworks beginning.During this time, the lights varied in distance from each other.  We saw planes going across the sky, and were much faster than these lights, so a plane is out of the question.  You could have drawn a straight line across the sky like a ___ and the lights would have never varied from the paths.", "Bright circle of red / orange light seemed to circle the house.After watching fireworks, I continued to look up at the night sky.  I saw a huge circle of red / orangish light at a distance moving toward the house.  It was small at this time.  We then went around the house to sit and talk on the patio.  Then a friend said to look up to the sky and see the large bright light.  It was the same ball of light only much larger and closer now.  I continued to watch it as it got smaller and then suddenly disappeared from the night sky.  It was silent, not a helicopter or a plane.  No blinling lights and no noise.  It  had flown on somekind of path around the house....seeming to circle the house but could not tell the distance.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was myself, a 31 year old female and my five year old daughter, my brother and his two children ages three and five, and my parents who are both in their fifties.  We all live next door to each other  in a very rural development at the base of Green Mountain which is known locally for UFO sightings.  It was about 10:35 PM and we had just finished lighting our fireworks.  The sky was clear and we were just catching one last glimpse of the fireworks being lit by the neighbors and getting ready to round up the kids and to say goodnight.  As we were watching the eastern sky we saw a round object very similar in shape to a balloon appear and it was heading in a westerly direction.  It was mostly red with a bright orange glow on the bottom third of the circle.  At first, we actually thought that it was a helium balloon that someone had lit on fire and set free.  But, ! the object was not acting like a balloon would.  It would speed up, slow down, hover for a bit, change directions slightly and then suddenly veer off.  We watched it for about three minutes over my brother&rsquo;s house and then we noticed that coming in from the south was another one exactly like the first.  This one was moving very quickly and heading right for the first one.  When it was next to the first one they hovered silently together for about five minutes before they went straight up into the sky.  Needless to say we were very disturbed but frankly we weren&rsquo;t sure if we had seen a UFO or some strange balloon trick by Fourth of July pranksters.  It wasn&rsquo;t until last night when my brother was fooling around on the internet and found some reports of sights that we were sure of what we had seen.  I personally have not read any other accounts or seen any videos of similar sightings, but I will be looking at them once I get this report filed to see how similar other sighting ! were to ours.", "large bright stationary light, red/green/white flashing - 7 witnesses form different locationsHovering/stationary  green/red/white flashing with a pattern- looked like low aircraft/helicopter but no noise, stationary for at least 1/2 hour. -3.3ish  Magnitude. large for the perceived distance.

We used our binoculars to see it more clearly.It appeared to be in a sphere shape but in looking thourgh the binoculars, it had many lights around the middle.

I looked up on a clear starry evening and a movement caught my attention.  At first I thought it was a plane of some sort, but something about the size and movement didn&rsquo;t make sense compared to a normal aircraft.  I also realized there was no sound which I would expect from a jet of such size flying so close: it appeared about the size of two fingers held at arm&rsquo;s length.  I stood still for several minutes watching and waiting to hear the roar of jet engines, but nothing.  The speed seemed peculiar as well, at first going very slowly overhead, then progressively faster as it got toward the tree line.((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that date is approximate.

MUFON says this is impossible.The first of four appear directly over the City Of Reading, PA.  It is NOT VENUS. It is BIG and BRIGHT looking, through binoculars, like a kryptonite headlight.  When it first appears it sometimes looks like a white circle with light beams coming off it.It goes through about 20 minutes of &quot;development&quot; during which time it becomes larger, brighter and drops lower in altitude.  During this time, also, it develops a metallic protrusion at the five o&apos;clock position...we often refer to it here as the ((deleted)).Around 9:30 the second, third and fourth appear very high in the sky and much farther out.

Throughout his routine, he is approached by INTRUDERS that look just like stereotypical flying saucers and the like. These are not visible to the naked eye but are captured quite well by 14mp and 900mm Pentax SMC lens.The INTRUDERS seem to use JFV1 as if it were a New Jersey Traffic Circle.  Sometimes they seem to be in conflict.  JFV1 often contorts into ugly shapes when they are moving too fast or too close...very weird but they are definitely communicating.STRANGE PHYSICS...When taken out-of-focus JFV1 becomes OTHER clear and IN-FOCUS OBJECTS usually in the form of a nonagon.  Surfaces of the nonagon can be presented looking like a bucket of garbage or even the scene of PA countryside from an airplane.

We saw two red lights in the direction of the carnival that were slowly pulsing.  They stayed in the same position for the duration of the fireworks and when the fireworks ended they faded away.

It was flashing three huge lights that changed from green to blue.As soon as we noticed the UFO our neighbor was unable to start his car. We immediately called my mom my brother and my grandma to see.  They said it was a UFO and ran to get there cameras.  The craft was completely visible but wasn&apos;t able to be captured on camera.

I observed this at approximately 9:30 pm CDT.  I live in an area where air traffic is common (near Forbes Field) where the 190th Air National Guard Refueling is located.  It is not uncommon to see Refueling aircraft fly over, as I live close to the flight path.  I know what an aircraft looks like at close range and what I saw was not an aircraft (plane or helicopter).  I first observed this object and quickly noticed it was unusual.  At first it appeared to be a meteor. I called to another family member to come see this object.  It was a bright orange and appeared to be somewhat triangular to diamond shaped.  It was hard to distinguish an exact dimension or shape because it appeared to be flying in a haze or smoke from fireworks.  Our weather that evening had been stormy/humid and there appeared to be some fog or haze in the sky.  However, the object was first vis! ible many miles away, and was clearly seen, so I am not sure why there appeared to be this &quot;haziness&quot; to the object when it was overhead.  As I stated earlier, the object was moving from due west to due east.  It flew directly overhead.  It was hard to determine its height, because I really couldn&apos;t determine its size and make a relationship guess, but it appeared to be 800-1000 feet high.  Again, because it was difficult to determine size and height, its speed is only an estimate...approximately 300-400 mph.  Again, I watch aircraft coming and going from Forbes Field (mostly shortly before landing and after take-off), and I&apos;m judging the speed of this object in relationship to those observations.  I heard no sound from the object at any time.  I observed the object for 30-40 seconds, then went to a different location and watched it continue moving east for another 15-20 seconds.  It appeared to go into a cloud bank because it disappeared quickly and somewhat unexpectedly. ! It didn&apos;t just fade away but disappeared abruptly, either int! o a cloud bank or whatever.  It did not quickly change directions...just disappeared suddenly.When I first observed it, I thought it might be a meteor.  It&apos;s speed, however, was too slow and it was relatively close to the ground.  There was no tail or anything that trailed behind.  My immediate impression was that I had seen something I couldn&apos;t explain.  I thought, because so many people were out with fireworks that evening, that I would here something about this on the local news that night or the next day.  I&apos;ve heard nothing...until out of curiousity I &quot;Googled&quot; it.  I had been thinking that all those drugs as a kid finally had taken its toll and I was seeing things..lol.  Anyway, I was somewhat releived to see that other shared the same experience.  Hopefully this description will help you.If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me and I will try to better explain my observations.  Good luck.....", "My husband and I didn&apos;t believe in UFO&apos;s until we actually saw one!It was a warm summer evening, around 7:30 P.M.  My husband was home and my babies were in their cribs sleeping.  I went to the bathroom window to remove my clothes off the clothesline.  I had to stand on the edge of the tub to take in my clothes, and in the far off skyline, I noticed a very large orange sun which meant it was going to be very hot the next day.  I stopped what I was doing and looked at the sky, and  admired it.  Often in the daytime, when hanging out my clothes, when it was clear out, I could actually see the top of the Empire State Bldg.  Anyway, as I looked at the skyline, I noticed blinking lights, and the object was zig zagging coming closer and closer.  It was quite far away, so it was small, and the closer it got, the more curious I became.  I went into the hallway of our apartment building and went up to the roof.  As I watched the object get closer and closer, I called out to my husband and he came up to the roof.  As the object came closer, we could see it was silver and it looked like there were lights of different colors going round and round, like the top of a police vehicles light.  I ran down and got my neighbor and she came up and we looked up in the sky.  As the object approached us, it kind of tilted and it then looked like a round shaped disk, and the sound it emitted was a swishing sound.  It cam around and went to the left of  us, and it stopped.  When it stopped, the swishing sound stopped and their was a humming sound like a motor.  I noticed windows in the center of the object, and what we thought were different colored panes, was instead, there was some sort of lights changing colors and it was rotating inside of the craft.  We noticed then two rods, on each end of the craft.  They were facing downwards.  We looked up mesmerized and we asked each other if we could figure out what it was, and we were just dumfounded.  After what seemed like 10 or 15 mins. the rods disappeared and the object which had become an oval shape took off zig zagging and wit! hin seconds it disappeared from sight.  When the object took off, the motor stopped and there was a swishing sound.  We were dumbfounded.  We went down to our apartment, my neighbor who didn&apos;t speak English, but Italian, I spoke with her as that is my language and she said she never saw anything like it.  My husband went into one room and I in another and we both drew what we saw.  We drew the identical thing.  We decided to call the Civil Aironautics Bureau, and they kept me on the phone about an hour asking me questions.  They asked me not to call the newspapers or the radio media.  We didn&apos;t call anyone else nor did we tell anyone else.  The very next day, we looked in the newspaper to see if there was any article of what we saw the evening before and there was none.  We we eventually moved away to upstate N.Y.  This was in 1963.  After living there awhile, one evening we watched T.V. and saw a program which showed a couple who claimed to be abducted on board a UFO, and they had been hypnotised and they described the object.  We could hardly believe our eyes when we saw the same object we had seen that evening in the Bronx.  We then knew we had seen something that was from outer space, a UFO.  From then on, I know in my heart that there are space vehicles of other planets.  I no longer feel those who  report UFO sightings that they are imagining or not being truthful.  Thank God my husband had been home that evening and saw what I did, for it he wasn&apos;t there, he wouldn&apos;t have believed me.  This is the truth, and even though it was a very long time ago, it is something I will never forget.  One more thing, when the object took off, it went into the direction of Orchard Beach.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))", "there were two ufos that just appeared in one spot and the other just dimmed out and disappearedWe were sitting outside and saw a huge flash of light that lit up almost half of the sky and lasted for about a second and a half.  We thought it might have been some kind of nuclear weapon because there was no way that it was lighting it lasted too long.  Then about 4 or 5  minutes later there was a white flash in the middle of the sky and a object with a red light rotating going right to left and below it there was a white light going the other direction.  Then we noticed another object that was sitting in the direction that the first one was moving in.  The second object was moving from left to right in the sky and then it just stopped.  Then it continued to move across the sky and speed up and move up and down and stop more and go from left to right and stop more then we were looking at it and it just went dim and disappeared.This was such an amazing thing to see we were all shaking for like 5 minutes.  I was not a believer in ufo and we were talking about it earlier that day and i am now a 100% believer.

The sky night is beautiful there and we often go out in our field and checkout the night sky.  My mother little sister maddie my brother dino and my friend tommy were all sitting out on lounge chairs talking and trying to find constellations in the sky.  It was about 11:35 and I noticed a whit sphere shoot out and dissappear from  what looked like the brightest star in the sky that night.  I tried pointing it out but they had all missed it but we countinued to watch the orange looking star after a bit they we stopped watching because nothing more happened.  About half an hour later when I looked at the star it appeared to be getting bigger and soon we could see it moving away from the tree line and picking up speed.  At first I pointed it out but not everyone could tell if it was moving or not but it started moving a bit faster and soon had moved a large distace over the sky and finally fell directly above us and just sat there in the sky.  It sat directly above us for about ten minutes until it stared to kind of shimmer a bit aof red beneath it and then accelerate almost straight up and turning solid red.  It did not stop util we could no longer see it at all.  We all without a doubt knew this was not a natural  as it only took about a full minute and a half to make it from the treeline untill directly above us and the just stop from such a fast pace and sit there not moving directly above.  I can tell airplanes and satelight immediately and watch the night sky quite often and it was a cloudless night.  Anyways after seeing it leave we headed back to the cabin to tell my dad and other sister and when we got there had realized three hours had gone by and did not remember being there that long and my mom was a bit mad because we had to wake up early.

We were talking about getting some pizza when she said, &quot;Oh my god, what are those?!  They&apos;re glowing!&quot;  I thought she was pointing at the fireflies flying accross the road, so thats what i said, &quot;Fireflies.&quot;   She sounded scared when she said, &quot;No! In the sky!&quot;   I looked up and almost drove off the road as i gazed at the two orange glowing balls of flames folating up and down in the sky.  They looked four times as big as a normal sized star at night time. (There were no stars out at this time.)  She says, &quot;Could they be hot air ballons?&quot;  First off i thought...  Its 11:00PM, what kinda ballons would be out this late.  We drove DIRECTLY under them.   My girlfriend stuck her head out the window and could still see them.  If they were hot air ballons, the basket would have covered up the flame.  Also, we saw no sign of a balloon above the flame.  I took a hard left turn into the Hilliard Darby High School parking lot so i could get out of my truck.  My girlfriend started praying as i stared the objects in the sky.  Looking into the sky, if you put your fist in between the two balls, thats how far apart they were. I took a 15 second video of it on my phone.  I could see the Orbs on my phone as i recorded, but when i went to watch it the next day, all i saw was a 15 second clip of the black sky.  After i took the video, i called my dad to give the UFO sighting number.

As best as I can remember, this event occurred during the summer vacation after I completed the 7th or 8th grade.  It&rsquo;s hard to be exact on this point as so many years have elapsed, but I can be certain of the month, August, because that&rsquo;s when my father always took his two week vacation which we spent camping.My Aunt, my cousin, and myself were enjoying live music, a country band if I remember correctly, in an enclosed pavilion at the campground when we decided to step outside for some fresh air.  It was a very warm August evening around 20:30; the air was very heavy and thick, as most August evenings are, and I remember taking in a deep breath of the cooler outside air.  We had walked a bit from the pavilion, making small talk, and found ourselves among a stand of pine.  I had glanced up, for no particular reason, and spotted a very large, orange colored orb hovering right above.I pointed up immediately and said &lsquo;Look!&rsquo;.My cousin and Aunt both looked up and stared in amazement.  The orb was very large and seemed as big as a three-story house.  It&rsquo;s hard to say how far away it was, but I remember thinking to myself that I could almost reach up and touch it.  I think I may have actually stretched out my hand.  The orb had a very distinct glow to it, that&rsquo;s honestly, hard for me to articulate.  The best description I can come up with, and I&rsquo;ve thought about this from time to time over the years since the event, is that if you could imagine a giant pumpkin that&rsquo;s been carved very close to the rind, and then a large lit candle place within so that it appears that the surface is emanating light, rather than a direct light source&hellip;if this makes sense.The event lasted maybe 30 seconds, the object never moved, never made a sound, and then it just blinked out and was gone.I looked up at my Aunt who was still staring with her jaw gaped open, and said, &lsquo;Did you see that!?&rsquo;.My Aunt was silent, but my cousin said, &lsquo;I think it was a firework,&rsquo; as if to provide some kind of reasonable explanation.  I said in return, &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no way that was a firework, I think it was a UFO&rsquo;.We all walked back to the pavilion in silence.  We never spoke of the event after that night.There is one more detail here that I&rsquo;m not totally sure about, but when we returned the band was wrapping up, and I could swear that when we had left they were just about to take a small break, not finish for the night.  I&rsquo;ve heard of &lsquo;Missing Time&rsquo; since the event and I&rsquo;m not saying that&rsquo;s what happened.  I just wanted to note this point because I remembered at the time thinking that is was kind of strange that the band was packing.I&rsquo;ve always wondered if anyone else had ever seen an object such as this one during the summer of 77 or 78, so I decided to share this event with you folks.  I&rsquo;ll always remember the amazement and utter awe I felt that night.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

You could vaguely see the silhouette of a structure that it was attached to.  It would slowly bob across the sky (sort of like a bouncing ball during a sing-a-long broadcast or karaoke-style television program would have used to follow the words).  The shape of the structure was really hard to make out because it was very high in the sky.  But, it moved too quick from left to right or side to side back and forth each way to be something like a star.  As I type this it is still out there.

I was facing approximately, North, North-East.  At the time of the siting, I looked up about 45 degrees and saw a light in the sky.  Then there was a second light to the left of the first one. I first thought there these were early stars, but the sky was still quite blue, the star Antaries, which usually came out first, directly above, was not out yet.My first thought was that I was seeing an aircraft, or a satellite, or a space station.  I commented to my friend about seeing two lights.  Then the one to the left started to move to the left.  As it did, two other lights appeared about these first two.  They were closer together than the firs two.  Then the second light that moved to the left disappeared.  Thie direction would be toward the North West. Now there was just the three.  Then the upper two lights disappeared followed by the first light.I was puzzled because, these lights really looked like faint stars, but it was too early for stars to appear. The final formation of these four points of light could be labeled like the geometric figure known as a trapezoid.  The lower left point of light was the one that moved away. I tried to see if the other three moved in any direction. They did not. They only disappeared.Thirty minutes later when the Great Dipper came out I tried to get my bearings to determine which part of the sky these lights appeared. This was approximately above the constellation of Cassiopeia.  But not as high as the North Star.This siting was so unusual that I got up from the dinner table and started mentioning to my friend that there were some lights in the sky and that one was moving. It was shortly after standing up that the other two higher lights appeared and then disappeared. My friend also got up from the table.

The source was moving wards the north-northeast in a smooth steady motion, which I estimated given its relative distance of roughly one quarter mile from my position to be traveling at between fifty and seventy mph.As it flew, the source appeared to make a small, very smooth deviation from the straight course it had been following when I initially noted it, and in a long lazy arc came to a complete stop in the sky approximately at an angle of sixty degrees above the horizon, wherein it seemed to perform a complete stop and then in a matter of seconds faded away to nothingness (this effect may have been achieved by the source moving away from me on an easterly course, gradually being lost from view, or by some other means).I was able at the time to motion capture approximately fifty-nine seconds of the source objects flight using a Kodak EasyShare C813 8.0 MP camera, which when played back seemed to indicate that it was spinning, and was not entirely orange in color.  Instead, brilliant instances of white and a very brilliant and distinct blue hue were also in evidence.Sadly, due to my initial attempts at sighting the camera on a moving object set against a black sky and under less than ideal circumstances, the initial footage is shaky, but still clear enough for it to be clear enough for analysis.  At the time of the incident, the sky was heavily overcast with broken slow moving clouds.  There was a full moon, and the source appeared to be moving along some distance below the cloud base.  I wish to point out that the route on which the object was seen is part of the regular flight path for aircraft coming into Southampton Airport, yet it was moving counter to the established route and was seen to be carrying lights ((which were not)) consistent with known aircraft.((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))Peter,My apologies, that was an obvious and somewhat unfortunate mistake on my part. The date should read, July 31st 2010, not August as you so rightly pointed out.  Also, be advised that a small typo should be amended, it is &quot;yet it was moving counter to the established route and was seen to be carrying lights consistent with known aircraft,&quot; which should read:&quot;...yet it was moving counter to the established route and was seen to be carrying lights which were not consistent with known aircraft.&quot;Thank you.  If you are interested in the footage, it is just under 60 seconds long and in MOV format just under 18MB long. If you know of any reliable means wherein I can send that securely without correuption and at a lower file size, I would be interested in hearing about it.  Thank you for contacting me.  I have an additional comment to add.  I have only just learned from my father who lives at the nearby village of Fair Oak, Hampshire, some seven and one half miles from me that on the night of August 25th, approximately 22:50 hours, he observed two independently operating orange spherical light sources.  In the course of the observation, the objects travelled an undisclosed distance, probably no more than one quarter miles knowing the viewpoint that he had, and from south to northeast.  The sighting was terminated when one of the objects stopped abruptly in mid-flight and shot straight up at considerable speed, followed five seconds later by the second, both subsequently vanishing from sight. I can attempt to obtain additional details, but this is certainly curious given the nature of the object that I personally observed and managed to capture in motion.Thanks.((END ADDENDUM))((NUFORC Note:  All requested corrections have been made in the text above.

I was a fence line detail and paused for a few minutes to stretch my legs and was watching the flight corridor to SEATAC.  I noticed an airliner coming into view and then noticed a very fast approaching aircraft approaching the corridor from the southeast at about the same altitude.   I at first thought it could have been a private jet just coming into the corridor to line up for approach to SEATAC.  As this situation progressed I figured the fast approaching aircraft would bleed off speed and fall in line. But as I watched I noticed no active beacon or navs and thought it a little weird that this thing would already have his approach lights on.

I did not hear a sound coming from this object so I would say that it was above the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere but not as high as the International Space Station (ISS) as I&rsquo;ve spotted that a few times on separate occasions and on one occasion I saw the station also pass almost directly overhead like this object.  I cannot be certain how high the object was but that is my impression.The object appeared to be a flame although it was different from a typical rocket in that although it remained relatively constant it had a slight flicker to it like the flickering of a candle only a more rapid flickering with more of a sustained luminescence.  The flame appeared to have an edge on the forward side and came to a point at a length of about twice its width.  I could not discern a physical object in front of the flame as I was looking for something in front thinking it was perhaps a missile or the space shuttle.  The light of the object was about half as bright as the ISS at its brightest when I had seen the ISS at about a year ago passing directly overhead.I saw only the one object and it&rsquo;s motion was continual and followed a straight path and it was moving at least twice as fast as the ISS (or perhaps the same speed but maybe half the distance?).  This object literally appeared to be rocketing across the sky.  It&rsquo;s size from my perspective was about 1/8th the size of a full moon as it passed overhead.  There were 4-5 other witnesses across the street about a 100 feet away from me.", "fireball flying in the sky with visible flames.Bright flaming fireball moving horizontally at small planes speed.No sounds, fireball visible for 5 to 7 minutes.

There are no cities in this area, very wooded area, i may have been the only witness, i watched the sky smoking a cigarette just as subject floated into place.

Sometime between 9 pm and 10 pm, my sister and I were sitting side by side on the second floor porch of our beach house looking towards the ocean when we saw one small reddish, slightly orange light appear out of nowhere.  It reminded in the sky for a few seconds, then disappeared; poof it was gone.  Brief seconds later it reappeared in the same place then suddenly become two and moved apart slightly, then disappeared: poof gone.Brief seconds later the single light reappeared and then quickly blinked out.  There was no sound.  They seemed very far away  The lights were not the same red as lights on airplanes or helicopters.  My sister is in her mid- 40&apos;s, very intelligent, very down to earth.  I was surprised when she said, &quot; I saw them too.&quot;  2.  Later, after 10 pm, my two sons (14 and 17) and my brother (early 40&apos;s) were sitting on the same 2nd floor porch looking towards the ocean.  My son (17) saw a large, saucer-ish shaped object, about the size of the moon only not the moon, not round, not white, but red on the outside, fading into bright yellow on the inside.It appeared out of nowhere. It slowly (but still in brief seconds) moved to the left and remained there for 2 seconds.  It slowly (but still in brief seconds) separated in 5 objects, reddish orange in color, saucer-ish shape.  but smaller than the original mass.  It was as though the large saucer-ish shaped light was covering the 5 smaller masses and it disappeared to uncover the 5 smaller things.  Then they disappeared from the outside in: they went from 5 to 3 to 1 to none.  My son (14) had the impression of a red light that &quot; looked sort of like fire&quot; that &quot; looked like it sort of came in&quot; and then &quot; went out.&quot;   My brother was not looking in the same direction and missed all of this because happened so quickly.  My sons both have good heads on their shoulders as far as I know.  My brother is ultra logical.  I was down stairs.  My sons came and got me and I went back up to the porch.3.

We also saw beams of light across the sky often appearing to be blue. There was also this area that we called &ldquo;the group&rdquo; because it looked like a cluster of dim, glowing lights.I am sure these could not have been planes because we watched for hours and the objects were still in the sky around 6 o&rsquo;clock am.  Planes go over our area frequently and the lights and slow speed were just a few things to prove they weren&rsquo;t.

We were not quite ready to go home and wanted to continue our conversation about &quot;girlfriends.&quot;  The weather was cloudy and misty.  We could see sheet lighting in the distance.  My car windows had droplets of water on them.  I sat in the driver&apos;s seat, my friend sat in the passenger&apos;s seat of my Ford Escort.The creek bridge had cement guardrails that were almost perfectly level with where the car windows started.  I suspect this was a purposeful choice by the architect. The road continued on north to a T-section about 1/4 down the road.  Beyond that intersection was a large hill that spanned for miles in each direction.  Approach to the creek bridge was as if going down a slight hill, and the incline continued on for awhile and then began sloping up again toward the T-section.  We were of a slightly higher altitude than the cornfields directly to the left and right front of us that bordered the creek.  The border of the creek was a slight hill that blocked view of the field beyond to our right (2 o&apos;clock).  Over our right shoulders at about 4 o&apos;clock (direction), was four-story tall mound/hill left over from an old gravel pit that had trees and brush all over it.  This mound followed the other creek border for about a half a mile to the east.So from our perspective, we could not see the field to our right front, nor see beyond over the hill over our right shoulders.  The creek was essentially bordered on both sides with land that stretched out as far as the eye could see.  It was here that we watched the lighting in the distance.   I could see the lightening from tens of miles away over the top of the distant hills, but there was additional light coming from closer up.  At first I just dismissed it as ball lighting, but I could see the light illuminating the mist just above the hill.  I could not see into the field where the light seemed to be coming from, just the effects of the light on the trees on the border of the creek.  I stopped my friend from talking and said, &quot;Friend, why is that lightening going on and off with a beat.  Nature is not that exact.&quot;  I began snapping my fingers to the rate of the light from the field going on and off.  On, snap, off, snap.  It was a perfect beat (I am a musician).  I tol! d my friend to roll down his window and just as the window rolled down, a craft popped out from behind the hill.  It was level with us, and we were approximately at most 10 ft from the craft.  I could have easily jumped on top of the craft from the side of the bridge without straining myself.I was speechless.  At the time I was morally opposed to the idea of alien spacecraft.  My family were strict Christians who specifically were taught at our denomination that humans on Earth were the only organic life in the universe.  I was 100% against the ideas of aliens existing.  Yet, here before me and my friend was this totally silent craft, about the size of a large SUV, hovering, silently.I broke the silence by startling loudly, &quot;THAT IS NOT A UFO!&quot;  At the time that I said that, the craft was just a little past us.  The craft was almost directly to our right, but a little farther past us at that point.  It abruptly changed course (as if it heard me) and either turned off its lights, put on a cloaking device or did something else because it seemed to just go right into the opposite hill, but more likely it just went &quot;dark.&quot;  I revved up my engine and drove away very fast.  My perspective on everything had just come crashing down in one fell swoop of time no more than 3 minutes long.I got to my house, where my friend&apos;s car was, and he asked me to follow him back home (because he was too freaked out to go over that bridge alone).  So I followed him home.  By the time I got back to the bridge, my fear had gone down, and I was filled with wonder.  The storm had passed, so I parked on the bridge again alone, turned on a Cure CD and sat Indian style on the roof of my car, searching the landscape and the sky for anything out of the ordinary.Nothing.  Silence.Oddly, it was from that moment on that I started to experience the phenomenon known as &quot;synchronicity.&quot;  As I drove back to my house that night, I though, &quot;what if when I get home my family has been abducted!&quot;  I got home and went to my parent&apos;s bedroom and listened for breathing.  Nothing, so I turned on the light and the bed was empty and made, at like 2 a.m.!  I ran to my sister&apos;s rooms and they were all empty too.  I was freaked out so I just collapsed in bed, thinking in the morning this will all be resolved.I awoke to a call from my mother that the family left town unexpectedly that evening to visit relatives.Description of the craft:  Closure took over in my perception of the craft, so my brain processed the craft as looking like the time machine in Back to the Future (big fan at the time).  It was the only way my brain could process a floating silent vehicle, that and it also did look a lot like that craft.  It had a metallic brushed reflective surface, with an area like a car where the &quot;people&quot; were transported, and then a front and back section much like our engine and trunk section.  It as the classic saucer shape, but without the dramatic flaring sides.   It had lights in various places on the exterior but it all happened so fast and I was so stunned that I couldn&apos;t tell you the exact placement, but my friend who had no such &quot;stunned&quot; effect because he was already a believer, said he saw lights in the back, front, top and bottom of the craft.For now, any contact, I would prefer it to be done via email.((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident in 1992 is approximate.

After sitting up and turning round I looked out of the window and this is what I saw.Approximately 50 yards away directly in front and almost level with our floor was hanging in the sky motionless and silent an &quot;Alien spacecraft?&quot;  Well, it was saucer or maybe cigar shape.  It had two rows of windows there were &quot;People?&quot;  Well that&apos;s what they looked like to me,  All wearing what the nearest I can discribe looked like those early Beatle jackets without the collars, some dark ones and some were wearing white.  The ages of the occupants appeared to range from 10 to 60 years some men had beards there where also women.  I went to wake my wife but then noticed she was already in the same position as me looking out.She started waving at them, they waved back some smiled, they were sort of coming and going to the windows.  After what seemed like 15 minutes it either shrunk or sped off rapidly and in silence.((NUFORC Note:  Date of event may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

We were fishing facing the south direction.  My brother in law said, &quot;Hey man, I just saw 2 shooting stars.&quot;  Immediately he said, &quot;Dude, what the hell is that.&quot;  I turned and looked in a south facing direction and my eyes locked on a bright orange glowing object.  It appeared to be in a triangle with a flat shaped nose.  The visibility last night was unlimited.  There were clouds to the east of our location and the object was definitely below the cloud height.  The object was glowing the entire time as it moved across the sky.I would estimate the height of the object to be about 1200 feet off the ground.  It moved very fast, steady and very smooth as it flew across the sky.  It was absolutely 100% not an airplane.  Being in the Air Force for almost 11 years I have seen my fair share of aircraft and this was most certainly not one.  It made absolutely no sound.  I would estimate the object to be about 2 1/2 miles away from where we were.  The sighting lasted approx 25 seconds.  From the time I first viewed the object to the time I could no longer see it had moved about 110 degrees across the sky east to west.  The object was moving in a west direction down the shore line of Oahu.  We were right beside the airport when this happened so I know Honolulu International Airport picked this object up on their radar.  I wish everyone could have seen this as it was truly amazing!!!", "Bright white light flew across sky and immidiately went straight up making a J shape and disapearedI was looking at the sky and suddenly a white bright light that looked like a comet flew downward across the sky and immediately turned straight up and made a J shape and disappeared.It was so bright that it lit up my whole backyard as if it was daylight.", "Single Electric Blue gumdrop shaped object appeared with a flash and appeared to land.This report is to document a sighting of an unidentifiable object in the sky that was witnessed by myself.  I have a part time job delivering the AnnArbor.com newspaper on Thursday and Sunday Mornings.  I typically start delivering my papers at around 2:00 am.  I have ~150 customers and I have a very set routine of delivering my route.  On the Morning of July 22, 2010, at exactly 2:40am (I just remembered that I called my wife when this event happened and I verified the time when I called her).  I called my wife at 2:42 am and told her about what I saw and that I was coming home because I was too freaked out to continue delivering my papers.There is a street called Louis Lane in Hamburg, MI.  It is a residential street in a generally rural area and the street is probably &frac12; to &frac34; mile long and is in the shape of a horseshoe.  The street is along the north side of the main road (Strawberry Lake Road).  Imagine breaking the horseshoe shaped street into two parts, the eastern half of the street and the western half of the street.  I always begin delivering papers on this street on the eastern portion of the horseshoe and am facing north when I pull into this street.  I pulled into a customer&rsquo;s driveway, threw the paper up by the garage, and reversed out of the driveway to continue on my way.  When I began to proceed, I saw a flash of blueish light (like lightning) along the northern horizon.  I looked out my windshield to see if a storm was maybe on its way, but it was one of the clearest nights this summer.  However, at that moment a second flash was closer and brighter and my NPR radio station cut to static for may! be 5 seconds.  This was really creepy, but I continued on my way.  At this point I was rounding the top of the Horseshoe and was facing west, I looked out my driver side window which was facing to the south and that is when I saw what really made me think about it being a &quot;U.F.O.&quot;   The object that I witnessed was about 20 degrees off of the southern horizon, just above a line of trees.  The object was less than 100&rsquo; in the air, it was glowing electric blue in color, it was approximately the size of a quarter and was definitely close, I&rsquo;d say within a &frac14; mile distance.  The object moved westward while it descended behind the trees and appeared to land.As I watched the object disappear behind the trees, I continued to drive slowly and was now facing south and was now on the western portion of Louis Lane.  I put my car in park and turned off my lights and continued to look south towards where I saw the object disappear.  I stayed for maybe a minute and witnessed some intermittent blue colored flashing coming from the direction of the object.  I called my wife at exactly 2:42 am and told her what I just saw.  I told her that I didn&rsquo;t want to finish my route at night and was going to wait until day to finish.  I was pretty scared, so I got out of the neighborhood, and drove east at 75 mph down Strawberry Lake Road, until I got into town.I stopped at the Hamburg Township Police department and seriously considered walking in to report what I saw, but I didn&rsquo;t.  In Hamburg, MI, there is a 24-hour ((deleted)) gas station that I always stop at before I start my route.  I always ((speak)) with the guy who works midnights, his name is ((name deleted)).  On my way back home, I stopped to tell ((name deleted)) what I saw.  ((name deleted)) was in some disbelief, but he said that it was kind of strange because there was a very brief loss of electricity at the gas station at around the same time that I told him what I saw.  ((name deleted)) said that it could be the Police helicopters, because they look for people growing marijuana at night.  I expressed that I didn&rsquo;t think it was a helicopter, because the whole thing was glowing electric blue.  I then drove the 10 miles back to my house, eventually went to sleep and finished delivering my papers when it was light outside.I am a ((deleted)) student and attend ((deleted)) school in Ann Arbor, MI.  I told a few students what had happened earlier that morning, and two of my classmates, said that they were up late and also experienced the brief power outage at around the same time.  However, these guys live in the city of Ann Arbor, and I was nearly 15 miles north of the City of Ann Arbor when this happened.The event that I witnessed was very brief and I left before I could see anything else happen.  Just thinking about this event still makes my skin crawl.  I used to prefer delivering my papers when its dark, but I seriously don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m ever going to start my route until the sun comes up.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he seemed to us to be sober-minded and credible.  We also received a telephone call from a woman in Harper Woods (Detroit) about what sounds to be the same event, but we have not received a follow-up written report from her.

However , I must admit that I felt slightly ridiculed as someone had written his own evaluation of what I saw on that report by  adding the following lie to it &quot; possibly Jupiter in the southern sky&quot; .  The trees where the UfO was silently floating are  30 ft away from my house!  One cannot put a planet in those trees!  The ufo was directly behind the trees, moving and changing its appearance. I saw the perfectly bright lights in detail and its pulsating lights.  Planets do not move, display lights and change appearance.  This was a moving object not  Jupiter.  I feel slightly insulted by this odd addition to my Report. It should not be there.     Best, ((END ADDENDUM))((NUFORC Note:  The witness may be correct, but we believe it is the rare UFO that hangs around for an hour and a half.

It was glowing and moving in a straight line SE to NW.  The orb started at an estimated 150 feet and moved to about 20 feet, when it disappeared below the tree line.  The orb moved in a very controlled manner, in a straight line on an angle towards the ground.  After the object disappeared below the tree line the glow disappeared and wasn&rsquo;t seen again.", "Thought a commercial airliner was about to crash...While driving East on route 55, just west of where it intersects with the Taconic State Parkway, my wife and I saw what seemed to be a commercial airliner in a completely vertical position, only a few hundred feet off the ground, and heading towards the ground so quickly that both of us fully expected to see or hear an explosion.  When it disappeared behind the tree line, it seemed to us to be maybe a half mile away, and we sped up to what we thought would be the scene of a crash site.Of course, there was no crash, and we tuned in a local radio station to see if there had been an airplane crash in the area.  There was none.This area is across the Hudson River from Stewart Air base, now a commercial airport, and we are both very used to seeing fairly low commercial and military planes, including the huge C-5 Galaxy military transport planes.We only saw the lights for at best 3 seconds, and other than the fact that there were several colored lights which seemed to be along the fuselage of what we thought was the plane (which is unusual) the only thing we could reasonably come up with was that it was a large commercial jet.  Both of us agree there were white, green, and red lights.I&rsquo;m reporting this because it isn&rsquo;t possible for a plane of that size to be going that fast in a vertical position straight down, that close to the ground, and not crash.  Neither of us can explain how that would be possible, so we&rsquo;ve questioned if what we saw was a plane.  This is not the only time I&apos;ve reported a sighting to your website, but this is certainly the shortest sighting, and yet still very strange.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The light appeared to be about 2500 feet above the ground and then seemed higher in the sky as it moved towards the southwest.   We could not hear any sound coming from the light.  In Ipswich, it would be very unusual for light aircraft to fly this late at night and this low, and we would have heard the engine.

It was a block like disk/saucer.  It had a kaleidoscope of different colors with in each square surrounding the circumference of the craft.

Hard to estimate the altitude, but it looked pretty high. It was definitely not a plane and went way to fast for a helicopter.

I was out alone snowmobiling, at about 7:30 at nite, when I stopped to view some faint Northern Lights, when I was South of Fairbanks, Alaska, about 2 miles, clear sky.  I noticed  an unusual star formation of 5 shiny objects, in a perfect Pentagon pattern.  That is what caught my eyes, as there were a tremendous number of stars visible, due to the very Clear Arctic sky.  After some 2 minutes or so, I saw them all converge, at the same time, into the center of the Pentagon, at an upward angle, leaving a shiny trail behind each one, like a flash.  After several seconds, after they formed what appeared to be a single object, the single now larger object left up an upward angle into space, at an amazing speed. leaving what appeared to be a streak of light, until the object got smaller, and smaller, then eventually disappeared in some 5 seconds or so!   Amazing!  The objects appeared to be silvery shiny, and very small, for altitude,  I would guess some 15 to 30 miles!   I wish I had a digital camera!  How the objects went from a Pentagon formation, into one object was amazing, all moved at the same time, and converged at the same point, all together, then after a few seconds, the now larger silvery object, traveled out into space at about a 80 degree angle, very fast, leaving just one solid streak of light as it accelerated away.I have done a lot of work on Weather Balloon systems, Radiosonde Tracking Systems, called WBRT&apos;s, for many years, and have tracked these many times as part of my job.  I have also seen several visible rocket launches on experiments by the Univ. Of Alaska, ESSA, etc., in tracking Aurora Borealis, Northern Lights.  I had a good background of electronics, radio, and radars, etc., and Weather Observations.I have talked to Eskimos in the Arctic, at Point Barrow, Nome, Kotzebue, and Barter Island, of some of their sightings over the Arctic Ocean.  This was the first, and only time, I have ever seen anything so unusual, that I could not identify.  I have worked extensively with certified Weather Observers at many airports, and very familiar with Weather Observations, etc.Now, I am retired from NOAA NWS, having worked on their new WSR-88D NEXRAD Doppler Radars, with their towers, having Fiberglass Panels, in the shape of a Pentagon!

It did not seem to be a light on the front of the object like an airplane; the light did not project in one direction like a high beam on your car either.  It seemed to be illuminating from within.  I told my Fiance and friend to pay attention to it and be quiet so we could listen for the sound of an engine. We heard nothing.

In shape it appeared to be circular, perhaps because of distance.I have taken courses in astronomy and have seen many satellites and meteors over the years.

When I looked up, I saw 3 lights, red, green and blue in a triangle formation rotating in a clockwise direction.  The lights were pulsating/blinking very fast.  The object was moving from East to West towards the Tappan Zee Bridge.  At first I thought it was an airplane, but I very quickly realized that this was something like I have never seen before.  It moved at the same speed as a plane but I could not hear any noise.  After about 30 seconds, I lost sight of it behind the trees, but appeared to be heading towards the Hudson River.  When I first saw it, I was facing North- North - East, and it was at about a 60 degree angle.  The lights were larger than those on airplanes.  I would imagine that someone on the Tappan Zee or I-287 would have seen it since I live so close to the highway.", "Ufo over Western Washington July 16th, 2010My daughter and I were outside and this object went above us heading straight due north.  It was a light silver colored disc with a bottom that was about half the size of the craft. The half round bottom looked as though it may have been translucent (it&apos;s color was grayish and slightly opalescent.  When the craft passed over what was probably SeaTac airport, it became very, very bright and looked like a star.  But only roughly 6-7 seconds later, it dimmed again and we could still see it&apos;s disc/orb outline. We watched it as far as our eyes would allow for.  My daughter mentioned the uncanny lack of air traffic as this object moved over the airport area.   About two minutes after we could no longer see it, we saw a plane come from the airport area.  We did not observe the object come from the South; it seemed to just appear in the sky out of nowhere.  It was east of us when looking north.", "See-thru UFO&apos;s?My &quot;sighting&quot; if you want to call it that, happened 12 years ago.  I just recently found this website and thought I would post the experience.  Again I&apos;m not sure what I saw but I know it wasn&apos;t anything that could be explained at the time.One night I decided to go outside and cool off on the patio.  I looked up and started to star gaze to pass the time when I noticed that the stars&apos; pattern flickered in and out almost like someone was moving a huge rectangle of glass across the sky.  The size of the anomaly was pretty decent, about the size of a large passenger air plane.  The weird thing about this is that there was no sound distortion in the air, so I knew it wasn&apos;t a plane or big helicopter, and there was no wind so it wasn&apos;t as if there was some strange item blowing across the sky.I watched the glass-rectangle thing start to cross the horizon, it looked almost as if it paused, then moved again in stops and starts.  I decided then to go inside to grab something to assist in viewing it better like my binoculars or video camera, but when I came out the pattern was gone.  There were no lights, no oblong shapes, no sudden heat, and no repeat of what I saw. Just thought I&apos;d send this up in case anyone had ever seen something like this before.((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.

Of course we found plenty and as we were driving I noticed like a dim orange constant shape in the sky.  It was much higher than any of the fireworks and it was either very slow moving or just hovering.  I believe it was very slow moving.  I pointed it out to my wife and we watched it for a few minutes ..  But then went back to gazing at the fireworks with my family.  I saw it again upon returning home.

We are all professionals between 35 and 56 years old.  We were watching fireworks around the lake from the dock.  We saw 3 separate sightings of similar UFO objects about 15 minutes apart-they were NOT an aircraft that anyone could identify-no flashing lights typical of aircraft, movements were not typical of planes, and no airplane noises were heard.The objects sight came from the horizon at the south-west (the first object came from a point furthest to the west compared to the other two) and traveled northerly up the lake pulsating a orangish/red glow. Their sizes at their largest point was about twice that of Venus, which was visible just above the western horizon and at least as bright if not brighter.  Each time, their altitudes were at least a few thousand feet (guessing-based on the height of the surrounding hills from the water).Most of their movements were similar in character to each other with erratic speed (fast then slow) and motions -veering off to one side or the other, sometimes instantly reversing their direction - sometimes appearing to stop or hover along their mainly northern route before continuing. None of the movements were super-fast.All three sightings ended similarly in that they appeared to stop in about the same location to our south (distance unknown and very difficult to even guess) although their routes to get to that area were slightly different.  After being stationary a few seconds-they got brighter and brighter then began to move south and upward slowly (in relation to our position) as their light dimmed and then vanished.  The second object re-appeared briefly (and dully) after a second or so of turning south disappearing, remaining visible for one or two more seconds again - which helped to verify that it was still moving after we lost sight of it before it then vanished.The first sighting was approximately 5-6 minutes long, with the second and third being a little over 4 minutes.", "Strange disappearing/re-appearing object over Sioux cityobserved 1 object moving in a straight line east to west above 4th street.

This is about 8 miles North of Omaha, Nebraska.On the night of the fourth of July, I was standing out at the end of my driveway taking pictures of fireworks with a Canon 40D SLR with a digital image stabilizing lens that is 70-300mm zoom.  (About $3000.00 worth of equipment). I was not using a tripod, but hand held so I could move around to catch the fireworks.The front of my house faces straight West.  The night had a broken cloud base, more open than clouds.  At approximately 9:55 pm I noticed a reddish orange light to the South, South west from where I was standing about 2 to 3 miles away coming from the Bennington Nebraska area.  It was moving very slow to slow to be a plane and heading almost straight North.  It had no blinking lights at all. It was just above the cloud base.  I had my camera set on manual mode and was running the shutter speed between 4 and 8. I took a few pictures of the light and after zooming in on it I could see that it wasn&rsquo;t one light, but three real close together.  We have had helicopters come by and at about that distance before and we could not hear a thing when normally we could.  After watching it for about 5 minutes, I went back to the house to get my wife and show it to her.  Of course she saw it also.They continued to travel North until they were just South of my location, then took a 90 degree turn to the East for a very short distance (guessing &frac12; to 1 mile) then another 90 degree turn back to the South.  Looking at the night sky it would be like the directions of the eraser end of a new pencil.  After watching them head back South about &frac12; the distance from when I first noticed them.  It was like someone threw a light switch and the lights went out.  Gone.  Way before they would have flown out of sight.About 10 to 15 minutes later I saw them again straight in front of my house, looking West.  They looked to be about 1 to 2 miles out.  There were different times that through the camera I could see that they didn&rsquo;t stay in a group, but would spread out in a line.  If it was one object I would see a leader and then a trail, with the lens settings I was using,  However you can see the trails, but with three balls in the trail.  A leader, one in the middle and one towards the end.  I took 55 pictures of them in all.  They kept heading in a Northern direction and it looked like they would have gone just North of Blair Nebraska.  Some pictures came out pretty good, some not, due to the speed of the lens or my movement.  The entire time that they were visible was about 20 to 30 minutes.", "August 3, 2010   Around 7:00 pm I was watching TV when my TV was making a weird sound.  It only makes this sound when a cell phone is around it.  So I got up to get my cell phone and it was turned off so I got back on the bed when I turn my head to the window and it was round with like 20 to 30 lights around it.  My girlfriend rose up to me screaming &ldquo;look out the window you see that&rdquo; so I ran outside to see a better close up and there it was in a distance but this time it was only a bright light instead of a lot of them.

We walked I would guess 3 miles then us 4 including myself saw two &quot;balls of fire&quot; in the air about 30 yards off the road we were walking on. They did not appear to be large, maybe the size of a basketball. They moved quickly in all kinds of directions. Not sure how to explain it. We got scared and started running down the road, until we were a good distance away from the &quot;fire balls&quot;. We stopped and watched and the 2 fire balls continued to move quickly in many directions but never really leaving the same area. We were still scared so decided to run again.

It&apos;s very possible if the two were connected-the object could have been tilting to give this effect.  The object made no sound whatsoever. Nobody felt paranoia only exitement and extreme wonderment.

At first it looked like a hot air balloon possibly on fire, but then it was moving too fast to be one and looked less like one the closer it got.  There was a darker center to this object.  Size wise, the object would be more comparable to the size of the moon than to any stars from our perspective on Earth and much larger than any meteor I have seen.   It was about the size that a dime looks when extending your arm fully and looking up at it.  It was closer to the ground than a plane would be flying, but higher than a bird would be flying in the sky.  The object was not at all comparable to fireworks, remote controlled airplanes, etc.  It had an orange glow emitting from it which looked almost like fire does, although I could see no flames. It moved toward the Northern sky and disappeared out of sight.  At first the glowing object was stationary but then it started moving.  The flight pattern was mostly horizontal, although it did rise straight up and go straight down twice and it moved diagonally in the sky once.  This all happened in a matter of 30 - 45 seconds if not longer I would guess.  It was much quicker than a plane would be viewed moving in the sky, although it did hesitate a few times.

They proceeded to move SW from that position very slowly in a somewhat erratic pattern (not like a helicopter or plane).  They moved from the horizon to near their original position from earlier. The 2 lights hovered in the same position for another 5-10 minutes.  They would move closer together or apart from time to time.

As I was traveling downhill I saw a row of lights at what I thought were on the mountains/ hills ahead of me.  I thought it was a new building or athletic field all lit up at night.  As I was descending the hill I realized it was in the sky. All of sudden there was a flash of yellow light and the object was gone.  The flash was just centered around the object.  It did not light up the whole panorama of the sky like a sudden flash of lightning does.  That&apos;s when I realized I had probably just seen a UFO.

I looked up in the sky and saw what appeared to be two bright stars.  I stayed out longer than usual and had a second cigarette when I noticed, what I thought to be stars, were now moving slowly in all different directions.  I went back inside studied for another hour and went back out to the balcony to have another cigarette once again I noticed the two bright lights in different locations but still moving slowly in all different directions and at times they would suddenly stop and stay in one position for a few minutes and start moving slowly again.  This continued until 4 AM and then they suddenly disappeared.  This has continued at least 2-3 times a week from February to present day July 31, 2010 around midnight again.

He didn&apos;t know what to make of it and then proceeded to tell me not to wake him up again.

He agreed that this was a strange red light indeed.  We live below a flight path of the airport so we often see incoming planes in the distance, but usually the planes we see have many red and white lights that are constantly flashing.  This object had one big red glowing light (perhaps a distant orb but all we could see was a bright red light).  We talked about the possibility of a satellite, but it was so red, and seemed much closer.It moved slowly across the sky.  There were occasional fireworks coming from either side of the sighting, but the object was in a clearing between the two houses launching the fireworks.  The light moved too slowly, too horizontally, and too straight to be a stray firework.After a minute or two of watching it move across the sky, I ran into the house to get my glasses.  The light was moving slow enough that I figured I would have time to get my glasses before the view of the light would be blocked by the trees.  To my surprise, the red light had stopped completely in its tracks. My husband and I continued to stare at the red light, as it seemed to hover in one spot.  It was completely still.  We discussed the possibility of a distant helicopter, but it was silent and completely unwavering.  We probably watched it for 2-3 minutes before the light got smaller and dimmer and suddenly disappeared.  It did not seem to MOVE away.  It seemed like it just faded into nothingness.", "unusual lights on a summer night in missouriWe saw two lights that appeared to be in perfect sync with each other moving across the sky.

It was approximately 9:25 pm or so when I sat down at the table and I was watching the neighbors down the block blowing off some fireworks in the distance.  I got up and walked to the back of the yard so I could see if I could see any other fireworks going off.  As I looked over the front of my house, I seen this object coming toward me. It was orange in appearance, and was almost like glowing, like an aura around it or something. It made no noise what so ever.  It was almost silent, but looked almost like it was spinning the body part of it, but was just moving forward.  It was the strangest thing!  I started freaking out, and yelled for my boyfriend.   As he came over it was now almost right over the front of our house. It wasn&rsquo;t very high in the sky maybe a couple hundred feet above our trees.  He ran into the house, and tried to grab the camera, but by the time he came back it was alre! ady over our neighbors house, and hidden by their trees.I kept watching in the sky, turning in circles hoping I would see it again.  Maybe 2  minutes later another one appeared in the same direction the first one appeared to of come from.  This one was way up high still in the sky coming down from the clouds.  It seemed to stay up in the clouds as it moved along heading toward my direction kind of diagonal though along my fence line.  An airplane was coming in the sky toward it I believe it was maybe like 9:28-9:30 pm or so by now not sure. As the airplane headed toward this unidentified object it went back up in the sky, and the lights seem to disappear, or go off.  The aircraft then was over the spot where this craft was, and went passed it. I thought it was gone but then it came down out of the clouds but behind my house in the sky.  This time the craft came down and had it&rsquo;s lights out and seemed to be a bit bigger than the other one that went over my house.  I could clearly see this space craft because of the street lights behind m! y house in the court. It was clearly a flying saucer, disk shaped.  It was grey, silverfish looking,  and was flying quietly. It was moving very slowly like hovering, or scoping things out.  Then it began to speed up and looked like it was coming down.  It was flying like it was looking for a place to land, or  something . It disappeared on the other side of the block past the trees where I couldn&rsquo;t see.I didn&rsquo;t report this to Local police department. I know how people get treated, when they report these things to police departments, and say they see UFO&rsquo;s. I know what I saw, and it wasn&rsquo;t no airplane, fireworks, none of that. I got a good clear view of these objects, and I am positive about what I seen.There has to be others here in town that seen this.

I determined speed at 3 to 500 m.p.h. using aircraft as a reference since im near Nashville airport approach path.  You could see aircraft in the distance diverting south on approach away from the objects to Nashville which is not their normal approach path.

He says that he woke up suddenly which he never does- he is a very sound sleeper.  He looked out the window and saw a rectangular object flying over the clearing area.  From his window he was looking at the underside of the craft which was emitting an orange/amber light.  The craft was traveling from east to west and seemed to be moving quickly.  His window was open and he said the craft made a soft noise that sounded like a skateboard on pavement.Earlier that night, sleeping in the front room, I heard but did not see two helicopters passes about one half hour apart moving west to east.

To fully view the light we continued through the densely wooded area to an opening on top of a hill.  The front seat passenger and rear seat passenger tried to identify it as a star, however, it was visibly much larger than any of the other stars in the sky, including Venus and Jupiter.  Also, it was a different color than either of the planets and due to the size, appeared much closer.  As we rounded the road to the top of the hill, about a mile and a half away from sighting the first light, the rear and front seat passengers turned to face the object, which had now drifted to the Northeast.  Upon relocating the object, and getting above the tree line, they noticed another light to the East.  I, the driver, was also able to see the objects clearly.We were only about a half a mile from McHardy Road, which runs North and South; we decided to turn North onto it to get a better view.  While turning and advancing down the road the sky became more visible as the trees receded below us and about three more orange objects were clearly visible.The two passengers kept their eyes one the objects as we proceeded another half mile North on McHardy before pulling over and stopping the vehicle.  It was then 12:07 and we exited the car to watch the objects.  At this time, we decided to call the NUFORC hotline and report the sighting; also there now appeared to be seven orange orbs in the sky.  During this time, the objects seemed to drift or float toward the Northeast slightly, and nearly one by one they faded out.  It did not appear that they moved beyond our visible sight, just that they were fading and no longer present. It took approximately three minutes for the entire group of lights to completely fade (12:10am).About thirteen minutes passed and the lights failed to return so we decided to get back into the car and head East in the general direction of the lights.  We traveled into Manly, Minnesota, before deciding to call it a night and turn back.  (NOTE: although many of the streetlights in this area were similar in color, what we witnessed were very clearly in the sky and above the horizon, also they were moving) The next day we phoned the National Weather Service and found that the wind direction was going South at three miles per hour that night, and not to the Northeast, the direction in which the objects were moving.All three of us are students at reputable Universities and involved in noteworthy activities on campus. None of us were under the influence of any legal or illegal drugs or alcohol.", "Craft with large yellow/reddish color light observed over Great Falls MT on July 4th, 2010To whom it may concern, I am a middle aged police officer and my wife works for an investment firm.  In my career I have seen many strange things, but this observation clearly tops them all as far as being unexplained.   On July 4, 2010, at approximately 2145 to 2155 hours, I was sitting near the bank of the Missouri River on the 300 Block of River Drive North in Great Falls Mt.  I was sitting with my family waiting for the city fireworks display that was set to start at approximately 2200 hours.  We were sitting on the east side of the river facing westbound where the fireworks display was going to be launched.As we were waiting for the show I noticed an aircraft flying eastbound over the city (Est. elevation 10,000 feet high).  Normally this would not be note worthy because we were sitting under the flight path of airplanes landing and taking off from the Great Falls International Airport.  This particular craft caught my attention because it appeared to flying too high to have just taken off from the runway.  Normally, I have noticed flights that don&rsquo;t land at the airport fly on the outskirts of the city.  Also, I noticed an extremely large glowing yellow/reddish color light underneath the aircraft.  The light took up the whole diameter of the craft.  The light appeared to be the approximate size of a Boeing 747.  I observed no red or green tail or wing lights on the craft.  There was no apparent spotlight shining in front of the craft.  I also could not hear the craft&rsquo;s engine.  It should be noted it was extremely windy and this could have had an effect on the sound waves reachi! ng my location.  The craft also appeared to be flying slower than a jet craft would have at that altitude that was not planning on landing.At this time, I pointed the craft out to my wife.  At the same time we both said we have never seen an airplane or helicopter that looked like that.  We debated over whether a satellite would have the same characteristics.  During this time there were approximately 15 people that were sitting near us on the riverbank.  Several of them were watching the craft also.  Some of their conversations were similar in nature to ours (Unknown names of the other witnesses).I continued to watch the craft as it continued eastbound until I lost site of it as it headed east past the city.  Great Falls has Malmstrom Air Force Base, Homeland Security Base, and the Montana Air National Guard.  My job has allowed me some access to these bases on occasion.  To my knowledge, none of the aircraft they fly looks like this.  After hearing about similar related sightings of this nature on July 4th on Coast to Coast, I felt compelled to pass on my observations.  I hope this information will help, I just wish there could be an explanation for what we observed.", "Fireball in the SkyIt was approximately 10:00 pm eastern time.  My wife and I decided to take a night walk, with our kids (10 and 2), into town.As we walked south, through a parking lot, we (my wife, daughter, and myself) noticed a fireball way up in the south sky.  It was heading in an eastwardly direction at about the speed of a jet liner at around 30,000 feet.  At first we thought it was an airplane out of Detroit Metro Airport, but it started to get brighter and then dim again.The longer we watched it the more we realized it was not an airplane.  It was too much like a fireball. It didn&rsquo;t leave any kind of streak or trail.  It was almost like something was burning up while entering the atmosphere.  I tried to take a picture, or video, with my iPhone but it was not visible on the screen when I tried.We assumed it would be on the news when we got home, or on the internet (news) the next day, but we found no stories about it.", "Saw unknown persistent light in the sky and then a gray object that arced away when the light stopped.I was out birding Saturday evening at Valley View Preserve.  It was about 935pm.  There were scattered fireworks going off to the south and the northeast but I think it was still a little too light out for people to start setting things off in earnest.  The sky was clear or had a few clouds.  I was looking at and scanning the tree line with binoculars for perched owls when I saw this persistent orange-yellow light in the sky south or southwest hovering in the same spot at maybe 45-50 degrees above the horizon and not flickering.  The light was maybe 2 or 3 times larger than Venus in the sky and certainly way smaller than the moon.  I had no idea what it was but eventually figured it was either a) some kind of firework b) the back of a distant plane/jet or maybe c)the launch of some kind of rocket or something since the last weird thing I saw in the sky, that was kind of similar to this event, was part of an NSA Atlas rocket launch.After a few minutes of shining in exactly the same spot in the sky, the light stopped and I saw this gray, blurry object slowly arc a very short distance east from where the light had been until it faded away or I just lost track of it in the increasing darkness.  The gray object, which I figured was the emitter of the light, was roughly the same size as the light or maybe slightly smaller and possibly top-like in shape.  I watched the whole sequence with and without binoculars but don&apos;t recall the binoculars giving me a much better view of the event except that they more clearly revealed a non-flickering light.  The light was shining for a few minutes and I saw the gray object for probably less than 30 seconds.I don&apos;t know what it actually was but still think it could have been one of the things I thought it might be.  If it was a firework, I&apos;ve never seen anything exactly like it before.  The light looked sort of like a Roman candle if there was just one flare, no smoke trail and the flare stayed in one spot in the sky instead of moving in an arc.  If it was a plane, there should have been blinking lights on the object after the light, it should have moved in a more direct way and I should have heard some sort of sound.  I don&apos;t recall hearing any sounds that I could attribute to the light/object.  And if it was some sort of rocket, it didn&apos;t seem to leave Earth&apos;s atmosphere and was a little different than what I saw before.I had actually completely forgotten about this until Peter Davenport appeared on Coast to Coast AM and am submitting this report per his request.  And I&apos;m not looking at any of the other reports until I submit mine.", "Orb shaped light, steady orange/yellow color, 250+- ft. high, steady speed hoz-hoz, UFO to witnesses.My son, my daughter, and I were watching a public fireworks display on the 3rd of July,  (2010 of course) at apx. 9:PM, on Eddycreek Bay, in Lyon County, Kentucky, when we observed a ball of light passing overhead.The light was not connected to the fireworks show in any way.  The distance between the show and the orb was at least &frac12; mile when we spotted it.  (Judged buy the distance across the bay.)  After the first light passed into the tree line, completely opposite direction of the show, another orb of light came from the horizon behind the fireworks.  It also passed in the opposite direction of the display.Then on July 6th, at apx. 11:PM, my daughter and I saw the same type of light while sitting on our porch; apx. 5-7 miles from the area of the fireworks show on the 3rd.All three orbs were deep yellow to orange in color.  Their luminosity was steady, no pulsation, no fireball or comet-tail appearance.They passed at about the speed of an ultralite, from one horizon to the other.I&rsquo;m judging their height above the ground to be roughly the altitude a search plane might fly.  They definitely did not fly as high as a  passenger plane.None of us could hear a sound coming from it.All three orbs appeared to be about the size of a pea, held at arms length.  So what size that might be, relative to their apparent distance, someone with a degree in the sciences will have to calculate; I am not well educated in that area.", "Orange glowing balls form a triangle in Lee&apos;s Summit, MOI was visiting on the back deck after dinner with six friends when one of them asked us what kind of a light that was over the trees.  I looked, and at first thought it was a star, but it was orange.  Another one blinked into focus, and the two got brighter and moved toward eachother.We talked and discussed if they were moving, what color they were and mentioned that we had not seen anything like that before.  Then another orange glowing ball was seen below the tree line and rose up to join the other two.The three orange spheres made a triangle with the two points on top and the third on bottom.  The top left point started fading away and was gone in a matter of a few seconds as the third light was getting brighter.  The second light started fading shortly after that and was gone.The third light hovered for maybe a couple minutes or more...long enough for us to completely look at it and discuss the other two&rsquo;s disappearance...then slowly started fading too.  The third on faded more slowly than the others.The incident wasn&rsquo;t exceptional or fantastic by any means...just three glowing orange balls that moved, hovered and dissipated above the tree line and off in the distance.

The sky was clear with just a few scattered clouds. I had originally gone out to see what was happening, as about an hour earlier, a pair of Blackhawk helicopters were circling the area, extremely low with only their battle lights on.  I ended up looking at the stars after they left.  At 2152 hrs I noticed what seemed to be a satellite approaching from the south, about 30 degrees above the horizon. It was moving rather slow for a satellite and moving towards the northwest.  It started as a dim white color but began increasing in size and intensity.  Just when I thought I was about to see a good iridium flare, I realized that instead of flaring and then subsiding, this object was continuing to increase in size and brilliance.  It became huge, larger and brighter than Saturn visible to the west, and the color was now an unusual shade of light green around the edge and brilliant white in the center.  It appeare! d to be self-illuminated and not reflecting the sun.  It remained at its brightest for several seconds, then it suddenly went completely dark for a fraction of a second, then returned with full brilliance.  Concurrent with this display, I noticed a small, white object shooting off to the west at a slight downward angle.  The white object looked like a small, very slow meteor leaving a short trail.  It appeared slightly below the green object and quite a bit to the right of it, but the trajectory of the white object in relation to the green object gave me the impression it had shot out from it. (It is possible that it was just a meteor as there was nothing unusual about it other than its appearance and proximity to the green object.)  The green object, after re-appearing, remained illuminated for a about a second, then rapidly diminished in size and became completely dark. It did not just blink off but seemed to &quot;power down.&quot;At 2202 hrs., I saw a two more objects one after another, almost directly overhead going from south to north. They performed similarly to the large green object, but did not become as bright and they remained white in color.  They too grew in intensity, flashed on and off several times and then went dark.  I checked the Heavens Above website and discovered that there were NO iridium satellites visible from my location on that date, and the other known objects that were visible were not overhead at the times or locations of these sightings.", "At around 10 p.m. on July 17, 2010, in the area of Dayton, Ohio, my husband and I were traveling I-75 South and had just exited the Centerville-Miamisburg exit 44 and turned left.

As it was approaching, it split off into 3 different balls of light that seemed to be about the sizes of very large stars and they continued to have the same color.  They hovered in different parts of the sky and hovered up then down (not simultaneously) and then finally just down until we could no longer see them because of the obstruction of view and the fact that we were driving in the opposite direction.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she sounded to us to be a quite serious-minded individual.

I saw something streak north in the sky; I thought I was seeing a shooting star (I have only seen about 4-5 in my lifetime), but then it went behind clouds, and I could see it partially obscured by the clouds, and continue in a straight, maybe barely arcing path.There was no accompanying roar as if it was a plane or jet, and it was not as fast as a shooting star, but faster than any plane I have seen.  My roommate was in the car (passenger seat), but he did not see anything, and I kept asking him if he saw it, and he said no.  It was only one object I saw.I grew up around the space center in Clear Lake, Texas, and have seen shuttle launches in Florida when I was a kid, and my best description is if a shooting star had a bit of a trail that disappeared as soon as it was made.  It was traveling South to North, and was too bright and constant to be a star, along with being too big.  It flew just behind some clouds, continued on and then disappeared.I do not know what to make of this, but this is not the first time I have seen something weird in the sky here in Montana.  I Arrived in Bozeman December 23rd, 2009, and last Friday (July 16th) I saw a very strange object in the sky that I mistook for a star, until it moved, leading me to believe it was a plane, but then it moved in very tight curves and zig-zagged.  After about 1 minute it disappeared, but then I could only see it with peripheral vision, and could not observe it if I looked directly at it.  My roommate was outside with me as well, and witnessed and confirmed the object, it&apos;s movement, and then it only being observable with peripheral vision.After tonight&apos;s incident, I checked online for other stuff like that, and came across your website.

I would be surprised if no one else saw it because there were 300,000 people on the beach last night (July 24, 2010) for the fireworks but around 9:00 PM while sitting at Kits beach we saw two lights (almost like slivers) in the Northern sky.  One faded out and came in at a different location, while the one sat there for sometime before moving to our right and disappearing behind the mountains.  The one was visible for at least 10 minutes.  We asked the people next to us to check it out and we all scratched our heads as to what could sit there above the mountains and then move so gradually out of site. Not sure if you have heard anything else on this siting, the fact it was still light out may have prevented it from being seen by most people.

My two nephiews and I were walked up to the roof to watch the amount of Yankee fans that came for the Old Timers Game.  Sure enough, as I last stated here back in July of (I think it was 1999), we witnessed them again, the first one appeared to us like fire directly above our heads it just spun around in a circular motion then just disappeared. The second seemed like a star but it was too high up to say anything about it and was moving very rappidly also not in a steady motion.The third was astonishing. It was amazing but we were not surprised due to the fact we saw them before plenty of times just spending time up on roof-tops. It was close to the Supreme Court&apos;s roof just hovering straight across in a very slow-motion.It was an oval egg-shaped like object, about the size of a full-sized van and an orange or fire like color to it with no shine or light, just creeping across the sky.What got us was that about 3 minutes to the direction it headed towards there appeared to be a crime scene.  All of a sudden a Police helicopter flying in circles around the area and about 20 Police cars.Then we saw a fourth heading towards the same direction but this one appeared to be white.   A fifth was coming behind him, this was to the left of us while the other to the right of us.  This one startled us a little because it was very close, seemed to be coming towards us at head level then it rose up at about 50 feet above our heads, this one was very clear to us.  It was definatley oval, saucer like, with two blue lights going around in circles on the top center of it.  The lights were not bright at all, perhaps they weren&apos;t lights.  It then changed shape, seemed like two legs came out the backside of it then it crumbled like liquid metal and again back to it&apos;s solid shape and headed to the same direction as the other four.Five minutes had past and the sixth appeared behind us this time above the Yankee Stadium heading straight towards our direction also at head level and slowly towards the last fives&apos; direction.  Then about two minutes later, five in a V shaped formation headed straight across the sky for about ten seconds and just vanished before our eyes, again towards the same direction as the last six before them.I stopped wrighting to the National Ufo Reporting Center because I wasn&apos;t getting any answers.  I was going through a lot of great disturbing confusion and wanted to point the finger at all the wrong places.  Instead I decided to ask, what ever I was looking at, for answers.  This is all I wanted to share for now, it makes no sence what-so-ever for me to dwell into this because the life experiences I have had lead me to believe and understand that folks all over the world will always be blinded by the truth and wouldn&apos;t believe it if these crafts were pointed out to them.  Yet a large amount of us believe and preach that there is a God but don&apos;t have enough faith to understand the huge fact that heaven is directly above our heads, in space, there are millions of angelic and demonic beings, or just normal like you and I, watching over us or just living their lives out there in different worlds.  We don&apos;t have all the answers as facts because we all need to find faith in order ! to get the answers we want or wait untill we die.  That&apos;s what makes us God&apos;s favorite creation, remember that we are a creation from above.  I searched for many answers during my first experiences and I found many answers with nobody&apos;s help.  There will be a time when they will reveil themselves to us with or without the approval of our so-called-leaders.If you believe what I am saying and search for aswers using faith from God then they have a special place for you.", "One red fireball, and seemingly teardrop shaped object.It looked to be in a teardrop shape.

I immediately told my Mom and pointed it out for her to locate as it continued across the night sky.  It looked very similar to a star but as it got to be directly over head it went from a star like glow to a much more intense brightness that I could almost characterize as gleaming.  As the object moved off in a North Western direction it&apos;s intesity lessened and then in a blink of an eye it just disappeared.

The object from tip to tip seem to be as wide as the lights on the tips of an jet.  The object that we saw was orangeish in color. It was bright, but not overly bright.  The sun had setted.  The object did not make any noise, but seemed quite high. The object to me appeared as if it might have been a plane, but enshrouded in fabric, such as a balloon and lite up.It did not appear that it had any light.My wife said it looked like a fireball, without a streak.

At first the lights moved quickly but randomly, never out of the cloud area that we could see.  Then they started a pattern, like an x or a cross pattern.  They would meet in the middle like a bump, then back out to edge of clouds then around edge to return to center over and over. They moved very quickly but stayed in same spot in the sky.

It&apos;s hard to judge altitude of things in the sky but they were not as high as a commercial airliner flying transcontinental and not as low as air traffic around O&apos;hare, my guess is between 7 and 10 thousand feet.  The Objects appeared to be sphere shaped, orange light with possibly red at the top of the object, the lights did not blink, steady but not brillant.  As the first 2 came toward us we saw anothe coming up from the southern horizon in the same path as the first 2,they were about 10 to 15 seconds apart and took about 1 minute to come into view and then disappear to the north.  We then saw a fourth then a fifth coming in exactly the same line as the others, then came 6 and 7 coming but these 2 were side by side going exactly the same speed staying even with each other all the way across the sky. After those two the last 3 came at a longer intrevals but all in the same line of flight as the others appearing to move slow then gaining speed as the were over head. the last one made a small arcing move to the west then corrected and went north northeast.

I am not schooled in aviation, but the object appeared to be moving far below the normal altitude of the everyday commercial and miltary flights that are frequent over my location, for Hartsfield Airport and Dobbins AFB. It resembled a cigar shape/zeppelin,  It made no sound and appeared to have no running lights on the underside, but looked like the top was either on fire or illuminated with an amber-orange haze that surrounded the top half.

During that show, it was mentioned that a UFO reportedly touched down in Dover, Massachusetts, in the early 1970s, with reported ground sightings.   As such, a friend and I may have seen the UFO entry as it approached Dover.  The following it what we witnessed.My friend and I were setting up a telescope to begin some experiments with astrophotography.  It was during the late fall or early winter of circa 1970 in Newton Centre, Massachusetts.  The time was about 9:00 p.m. and it was a clear moonless night, no wind but cold.  As I was adjusting the telescope mount, my friend said, &quot;Look at that!&quot;  I looked up and between a large clearing in the trees was an object silently gliding across the sky at about 45 degrees above the horizon out of the NNE heading in a southerly direction  The object had the shape of a pie pan being viewed from edge on or in other words a trapezoid geometry.  It was tipped up almost vertical (maybe leaning 10 degrees to the right) with the shorter base of the trapezoid on the right and the longer base of the trapezoid on the left.  The length of the longer base was about the diameter of a nickel held at arms length.  The entire surface of the trapezoid was a pale yellowish color, which appeared to deepen to a yellowish-orange as it passed out of our site and behind some trees.   The object made no noise nor emitted any visible exhaust trail as it glided across our view.  Interestingly, it did appear to interact with the air as its movement was one of a wallowing as if it were spilling air as it moved along.    Neither of us had seen anything like this before or since and cannot explain it based on anything we can account for.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

At first I thought it was firework ambers that were still in the sky, but they seemed more of a white bright light, with an orange tint to them with a halo glow around them.  The 3 circular lights moved around each other and changed positions a few times while I was watching.  I slowed the car down, the lights were much bigger than any other stars in the sky.

I went and got my binoculars and when we looked through them I was amazed to see it had strange shape wings and a upper fuselage with what look like 4 engines on the tail.  All this was in the inverted position like it wanted to land some where.  I call for my son to view this and he also wittiness this.  I watched this for 10 to 15 minutes, then craft went up at least 2000ft and then started moving to the north west as it picked up speed.  The craft seem to be in the 40 to 50 ft range; tall. I could tell because it was fairly close to the TV towers, each painted section is 100 ft so I could gauge this a bit.  After this was over I&apos;m sure others saw this since we live in North Oklahoma City.  Also there was no enging noise, the craft was a matt black as best i could tell.

We are located at the outer limits of approach aircraft.The object appeared as a bright reflective object, located N30E, approximately 30 to 35 degrees above the horizon.  I was located in our backyard swimming pool, the bright object and relatively stationary appearance caught my attention.  I have seen high flying aircraft, rising party balloon, birds during the daytime.  But this object did not fit those observations.  This object was somewhat stationary and seemed to rise like a balloon, but never this bright and never a shape which seemed to rotate, vary in brightness and shape.Object seemed to hover and slightly rise in the sky until it just vanished.  At one point when the object seemed to nearly disappear, observation what I thought was a much larger triangular object, just catching a straight edge about twenty diameters in length as compared to the bright object (no color, bright white starlike).  It disappeared shortly thereafter.  I looked for it but never saw it again.

It had 8-10 dim orange/red lights. It was also witnessed by two other people, and was visible for 15-20 seconds.  We had binoculars, and could easily see that it was in fact a single craft.  What shocked us most was that it made no noise whatsoever. The size was hard to judge but if it was around the size of a commercial jet, I would judge its altitude to be around 3-4 thousand feet.

At first, I thought it was a weather light then the pulsating stopped and became somewhat constant except for a subtly changing glow.  The circumference of the illumination would grow and shrink.  There also appeared to be dark cloud-like forms (some were cigar shaped, some shadows changed size &amp; shape) shifting and moving around outside of the halo.   At least ten times these shadow forms moved fast in front of the glow, completely eliminating the light.

As a friend and I were entering the rear gate, I looked over at him and something caught my eye.  I told him and he looked over and saw it too.  We pulled off the road onto the dirt shoulder and saw a car behind us also pull over.  We sat there for maybe 10 min. and watched this saucer type UFO (rounded dome on both top and bottom and the saucer type middle) hanging over the middle of town.  An illuminated cloud surrounded it.  After a while, it all of a sudden swooshed back really fast heading south west it just flew faster than anything we had in 1978 or now.  The illuminated cloud hung there for quite a few minutes the cloud dissipated and was gone. The Gentleman I was with and I talked about what we saw.  We both saw the exact same thing.  I&rsquo;m assuming the car behind us saw the same thing since we both did.  Being a small town I expected something would be published in our local newspaper but it never was.  After so long of not finding it in the newspaper I decided to put aside and not mention it.  Our town at that time had maybe 12000, 13000 people and some one other than us must have seen it.In 1996 while still living in Ridgecrest I was headed west on hwy.178 and then south on hwy.14 to pick up 178 again after a few miles.  While I was climbing up the hill a light caught my eye.  It was speeding fast and was a completely round bright light.  I watched as it went behind the peaks and then into the clear and then back behind the next peak.  OK, I feel really stupid seeing two UFO&rsquo;s in my lifetime but I did. I still remember the name of the man I was with and know where he went back to his hometown.  He was a very nice honest person and so am I.  I would even be willing to take a lie detector test.  I visited Roswell NM in April and after seeing all of the information there I decided to inform someone. I&apos;m 65 yrs, old and not in great health.

It is several acres of park ground with an outdoor stage for concerts, etc. We were seated in lawn chairs on the west side of the park/stage area.  A few feet to the west of us is a street, on the other side of which is Addison Airport for small planes.  As part of the festivities there were flyovers by vintage war airplanes, circling the park area.  The wind section of the symphony was playing music on the stage as the vintage planes occasionally circled the park.  Our chairs were facing the stage, a few yards to our southeast, with the airport behind us.  I do not know the time, but it was still light, approximately 8- 8:30 pm.I happened to notice and began to watch something bright orange, somewhat circular in shape, approaching from the behind the stage (from the south) travelling in a straight line to the northwest, crossing over the Addison airport.I pointed it out to my friend and we both watched as a 2nd object appeared behind the first one.  The two objects flew silently in a straight line from south to northwest.  There was nothing unusual about the flight pattern, only that they were bright orange and that I had never seen anything of that color before, and that they were somewhat circular in shape.The vintage planes had been flying at a lower altitude where you could clearly see their shape.  The two orange objects were a lot higher in the sky, but low enough to appear an approximate 4 inch diameter as we viewed it.  They moved quickly.  Our line of sight was about a mile, and it took a couple of minutes for them to disappear from view.We both watched and commented about it.

They were definitely not airplanes as we know them.I have never seen any kind of ufo before and I didn&rsquo;t think any more about it until I heard your report on Coast to Coast that there were many such sightings on July 4, and I mentally noted that we had seen these objects on July 3, but at a July 4 celebration.There were several hundred people at the event, but I only know of my friend and I who actually watched these 2 objects.", "I was sleeping over at my grandmars and I hered somthing so I went to to my grandmas room to see if she was o.k. and then i saw this cone shaped craft land in the field next to the lake then I watched it out of curiosity  It flashed a beam of light and then i cant remember what happend i just woke up with head aches and neck cramp.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a hoax.

The object was not obviously metal and did not reflect light and if I guessed how far off the ground it was I would think roughly 300 ft but no more, and the size was large and if it landed it would have likely took up the width of the median and both sides of the roadway.It was bell shaped and the bottom of it had three lights (I believe 2 blue and 1 red) and shining down from the center was a single white beam of light that was uniform size from where it came out of the object all the way to the ground.  The object was hovering without sound directly above a section of ground between Old Mars Hill Hwy and the ramp that takes vehicles from Jupiter Rd up to 19-23S with the light shining directly down between Old Mars Hill Hwy and the ramp.  There was some dust or vapor that appeared to be moving inside the beam of light.I might not have believed my eyes but there were cars pulled over on both sides of the highway and people were looking at it, the way I would have liked to, but my boyfriend who was driving was so scared he wouldn&rsquo;t pull over and only slowed down enough to get a good look.  I do not know how long it hovered there.Even now, the guy who is now my ex-husband says that yes he saw something, there were cars pulled over and yes it scared the hell out of him.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was about 10X the size a star would appear.  We all watched as it moved steadily toward the south before disappearing over the trees to the south.Just as the first light moved out of sight, the second one appeared.

It was almost right above me.  It moved slowly and I followed it as long as I could before I had to get my attention back on the road, about one min.  I didn&apos;t pull over, I really didn&apos;t know what to do, I just immediately started calling people.  It was way too big &amp; way to lit up and much to low to the tree tops to be an airplane.

It was a somewhat chilly night for July.  We were in the grass next to the lake and a playground.  7 of us in my family saw a bright orange fireball moving across the sky from the south to the north about 3-5000 feet above the ground.  There was a lighter foggy border around it but all you could really see was fire underneath the object, which was unseen due to the dark night sky.  It was about the size of Mars when it&apos;s closest to the Earth.  The object was seen for about 10-12 minutes and then went behind a cluster of trees and wasn&apos;t seen again.

As I headed back into my house, I noticed an extremely bright light in the sky behind my house.  I was immediately struck by the brightness of the object because it had just turned dark.  I observed it for a moment or two, wondering if it was a planet.  When I realized that there were no other stars in the sky yet, I became more intrigued.  I, therefore, decided to observe it longer.  5 minutes turned into 10 minutes, and I called my husband outside to ask him what he thought it was.  He first thought it was a planet or the &quot;north star,&quot; but as he observed it longer, he thought it was &quot;a little strange.&quot;  The light was not moving and made absolutely no sound. After approximately 10 minutes, my husband decided to go back into the house.  I, however, remained transfixed, and continued my observation for approximately 30-40 minutes longer before I decided to go ba! ck into my house to get my camera.  At approximately 9:15-20 p.m., I took photos of the light.  During the entire 40-45 minutes of my constant observation of this light, it remained in relatively the same spot in the sky.  [It is important to note that we live less than one mile away from the Mercer County Airport and literally see planes landing on the runway (running west to east) through the trees in our backyard. This light, however, was directly north, and during my observation of this light, continued to see planes fly in front of it.]   As I began to take pictures of the light (which visually remained static) I noticed that when I found it in my camera viewfinder the object appeared to be MOVING very rapidly in a haphazard way.  When I moved my eyes away from the camera to observe the light, it appeared perfectly still to my eyes! I took 8 pictures of the light on May 15th.  After I took my 8 pictures, the light simply disappeared. During my observation of the light, I was ! not frightened, simply intrigued and highly curious about what! I was o bserving.  It is also important to note that I was seeking some confirmation that it might be an airplane flying south, however, at no time did I observe flashing beacon lights.The light appeared again in the same relative spot in the sky on Sunday, June 6th, 2010 at approximately 8:00 p.m.  My husband and I were returning home and I noticed the same very bright light as I got out of our car.  It was earlier than the previous 5/15/10 sighting, and the sky was somewhat lighter.  Again, there were no other observable stars yet in the sky, thereby highlighting the intensity and oddness of this particular light.  I immediately retrieved my camera and took 7 pictures of the light. I observed the light intermittently (i.e., I kept coming outside from the house to check on it rather than strictly observing it as I did on 5/15) for approximately 40 to 50 minutes.  Just as in the first sighting, the light remained static (to my eye) and remained in the same relative position in the sky. The final time I checked, it was gone (approximately 9:00 p.m. or so.)   Since my two sightings of this intense light (and subsequent review of my pictures), I am HIGHLY curious about it and am hoping that someone can explain what it is to me.  I now find myself looking for the light every night, but have not seen it since the 6/6/10 sighting.  Further, I did check the flight data on the ISS, and it was nowhere near my position in New Jersey on either 5/15/10 or 6/6/10.((NUFORC Note:  If in the NW sky, probably Venus.

As usual, after getting out of the car, I stood there a while and look at the stars.  I was looking N/E and caught a flicker to the East.  I looked and saw, what I can only describe as, a fireball.  It was moving so slow that I actually watched it for about 30 seconds.  30 seconds!  It was moving easterly on a steady path and had a faint, but visible tail.  Whatever its distance was from my eyes, I can assuredly say that it looked the size of the full moon.  I could actually see movement in the color probably due to excessive heat. It was kind of like looking straight into a jet&rsquo;s afterburners.It was either a HUGE object or it was very, very close.  From my viewpoint, it looked like it was at a level where I would normally see jets coming in for a landing, but I&rsquo;m sure that was just an optical illusion.I saw nothing coming off the object like pieces or sparks.  It was round, clean and almost photoshopped-looking except for the faint pinkish spray of the tail.If this was a meteor, it was far too close for my comfort and there was nothing at all mentioned on the news.This is the second time I&rsquo;ve seen something like this. The first time, in the late 70&rsquo;s, was not nearly as spectacular, but just a thrilling.  As we were driving back from Newport Beach at 3:00am, that object went right over our heads, like a plane going down, then shot up at a very sever angle and out of sight, all in about 10 seconds.  No sound at all. Neither of us talked about it.  The people in the car driving next to us also saw it.  I looked over at them and they just shrugged.If I were to have taken a picture of either object it would have looked exactly like the gas bubble (without the fiery outer layer and red tail) on the &lsquo;In the News&rsquo; section of the C2C website, under &quot;Black Hole blows huge gas bubble.&quot;I&rsquo;ve never seen ball lightening in California. In any case, I doubt it would be as big as these objects.I am a Staff Assistant for an Engineering of a Municipal utility.  I worked in the aerospace industry for 10 years, loving my company and every minute of work.  I have been intrested in everything to do with space, planets, astronomy,and etchnology since I was 1st grade - all due to a large panaramic picture my teached had posted on the Science Wall that dipicted the birth and death of planet Earth.  I didn&apos;t quite accept that particular concept of Earth, but it was colorful.I keep binoculars in my car just so I can look at stars.  (Unfortunately I wasn&apos;t about to take my eyes of the May object to grab the binoculars.I now keep them under the front seat.)   I often get up at two or three in the morning just to go outside and look at the sky.  It&apos;s very calming, but somewhat hard on my neck.

PD))", "Formations of glowing and non-glowing spheres hovering over a Kansas city.Of course, this 4th of July involved fireworks. Note that what I am reporting as &quot;fireballs&quot;, &quot;glowing lights&quot;, or hovering spheres, are not the likes of any firework which I am familiar with.Around 9:15 p.m., a friend and I sat on my back porch watching fireworks displays from various neighborhoods around us.  We set off a few of our own, but nothing big.  Neither of us had any alcoholic beverages that day or night, nor do we do drugs; our states of mind were as sharp and relaxed as possible.When looking south, during a lull in the fireworks, we both noticed (and promptly pointed out to each other) 4 objects in the dark sky.  We were looking at about a 35 degree angle of elevation.  The objects seemed to hover in place, making only minuscule adjustments to hold formation due to strong winds.  They glowed with an orange-red light, the closest approximation of which I can make is the HTML Hex code #CC1100.  It was not an extremely strong glow, in that I could not see it illuminating any objects on the ground, trees, or even that much of the smoke present from the fireworks.  However, it was clearly bright enough (or close enough) to reach my friend and I with no problem.  They were arranged in what looked from our viewpoint to be the shape of a rhombus or diamond shape, but I cannot say for sure due to our angle and imperfect depth perception concerning their distance from one another.  They seemed to act together, as though they were all present for the same cause or of! the same force.Other similar formations could be seen from the front of my home looking northward; one directly north and one in the north-northwest.  The latter formation was at a greater distance from us, causing the glows to appear smaller and sort of blend together, creating uncertainty on the number in that formation.  We could only assume that there were also four there, as this is how the others were arranged.The formation to the south was still closest to us, and we mainly observed it.  It remained still, emitting no beams or objects, but the objects seemed to alternate positions every 45 min. or so.  About 5 min. after a rotation, the object closest to us (on a the point of the rhombus) darted towards us significantly. It hovered now above the pond directly behind my house.  It faded in color and luminescence as it neared, becoming completely matte black by the time it reached us.  It hovered there, and had it not been for fireworks on the horizon and city lights illuminating the haze, it would have blended easily into the night sky.  We had a Nikon D5000 with an external flash and telephoto lens, and immediately started fumbling for it to try to capture it on camera.  The camera would not boot up.It usually takes about half a second to turn on and become ready to shoot, if that.  But it wouldn&apos;t. The battery was charged, for we tried two of them, both of which had been charged that day.  It was in the right way and there should have been nothing to interfere.  In the dark, I tried to use my lighter to see if there was some fault or something that could prevent it from working.  It was a push-button or electronic butane aerosol lighter, where one clicks a button down, creating a spark, and igniting a jet of butane fuel.  The fuel came out as usual when the button was depressed, but the spark would not work. Neither would my friend&apos;s.We took this to mean that after going into some sort of less detectable mode, it also activated a device that shut down certain electronic capabilities within a reasonable proximity.  Unable to capture it, we could only stand in awe.  It looked to be about 15 ft. in diameter, and rotating a bit in one direction before reversing its spin. It spun fairly slowly, almost like it was just drifting there.  After about 3 min. of suspension, it flew back to its formation.  It did not change color, but by the time the craft got back, the formation was then the same shade of matte black.  It was unbelievable how...black it really was. It seemed to just suck in all light.  There were minor indentations around the craft, visible when not luminous, around the &quot;equator&quot;.  Just short dashes, impressed into the material. This allowed us to notice the rotation before.After reforming, the formation flew northward at unnatural speeds.  There was no time for acceleration. It was just...going.  It went from a stop to its desired speed immediately and remained steady at that speed until arriving near the northern formations.  They joined to form a loose squarish shape. This larger formation flew northward while gaining altitude at a steady pace.  I can&apos;t imagine why only the one formation would go into its &quot;undetectable&quot; or stealth mode while in the larger formation, but it remained that way during its exit.My friend has done no real research into ufology or related fields, and previously was just oblivious.  He had no opinion.  He always took a tolerant, but non-believing, attitude towards matters like this. I have read numerous books, online articles, and viewed a vast amount of serious multimedia on the subject, including photographs, video recordings, and audio clips.  I don&apos;t consider myself to be a serious researcher by any means, but I do take matters of this nature seriously.", "Strange quick moving light spotted over Temple, PAOn our way to pick up my girlfriend from work, me and my mom saw what we thought was a star.

They were all floating in a straight, diagonal line.  Slowly, one by one the lights began to disappear until there was only one left.  Then, the lights all started to reappear one by one until there were 4 again.   All while this pattern was happening, the whole formation was moving downwards.  After watching it for about a minute, it eventually reached down to the earth but we couldn&rsquo;t see it anymore as it was hid by the trees.  Every 5 seconds or so, a faint yellow light was seen behind the trees, as if the UFO had landed.We know it can&rsquo;t be planes or helicopters because planes do not flicker their lights on and off, they do not maintain this weird formation, and there is no runway near this location.  Lantern kites were also ruled out because like I said, they don&rsquo;t just flicker on and off, and they were high in the sky.

I was looking in the direction that the flash appeared to originate from, in the southwest portion of the sky near Douglas Park, (a new commercial and housing development near the Long Beach Airport) and saw a vibrant but undiscernible arc or point of green light low in the sky, slightly above the rooftop level of a house across the street. One friend of mine, who was facing the other direction, also saw the flash but observed that it lower in intensity and appeared to have come from behind him.Several friends of mine living in an area in the general direction of the flash--in the Lakewood Country Club--reported having lost power at the time, several minutes later via facebook. The flash event lasted only a brief second, and neither I nor my companions heard any sort of noise in the seconds following the anomaly.I suspect that the flash was caused by a copper or thallium-containing iron meteorite, which would explain the green color of the flash, the lack of accompanying sound, and EMP which knocked out power.

I am quite accustomed to seeing satelites, shooting stars and assorted aircraft, but last night was different.  I live outside of town and am very secluded.  The nights are gorgeous since there is no light polution.  I sat outside for about half an hour and was able to track several satelites.  I had just finished tracking my last satelite, watching it disappear above me over my house.  I immediately dropped my eyes back down to the horizon, looking southeast.  There is a large hill in front of where I live and it is covered in small pine.  Suddenly above the treeline appeared what I first thought was a star.  It hadn&apos;t been there a minute before.  It shown intensely bright, and I could not figure out what star, at that intense a magnitude, would be coming up in that place at that time.  It was way brighter than anything else in the sky.  I continued to think it was a very! bright star when I suddenly realized it was moving very, very slowly.  Then I got excited and thought perhaps I was looking at the ISS.  I have no idea how high it was, and there was no noise connected to it.  I watched it for about a minute as it traveled about the length of my hand - if I were to extend my arm.  It suddenly stopped, unlike anything I have ever seen.  It hung motionless and grew even more intense in its brightness, and then began to slowly dim until it became just a pin point of light, and disappeared.  The only way I can describe the object is that of a very bright, white light - like a huge star.  I have never seen anything act that way.  I would be curious to know if anyone else saw the same thing.", "Glenview july 27 .2010 approximately  at 9 pm . saw fireball on the top of Jewel -Osco  for 3 minMy son and I were in the parking lot sitting in the car  next to Jewel Osco in Glenview.  My son who is 9 years old pointed the sky and told me to look at the sky.  Then he asked :Mom, look, what is that?  First I thought it is a hot air  balloon, later I saw a fire inside of it.  It was red and orange color and it was circling around.  After 3 min it disappeared among the trees.  I took a picture of it but it is not very clear.", "Early morning fireball-like light formation hovering near Akron/Canton Airport .On the morning of 7/29/10 at 5:15am I was taking my dogs for a walk when I witnessed 4 fireball-like lights in the sky in the general vicinity of the Akron Canton airport (about 8 miles from my current location).  They were winking on and off intermittently (no rhythm to the intervals)  and appeared to be changing location slightly from their formation. They were just above the southern horizon in respect to my location which is in the Uniontown area just south of the Hartville flea market..I proceeded to wake my wife up and she then witnessed the event. We watched the objects hover until&rsquo; about 6am, when they appeared to disappear over the horizon. In respect to our location, the lights were about the size of a burning cigarette tip held at arms length. They appeared to be moving very slowly to the south as we watched them. The entire elapsed time of the event was 45 minutes, although they were probably there longer (before I saw them).", "An orb of energy?I once believed there was a scientific explanation for everything, not anymore.  Ive tried to debunk this in every way possible, nothing fits.  I thought about reporting this to the state police but thought they may think I was crazy.  If I hadn&apos;t seen it for myself I&apos;d say it sounds crazy too.  My sister inlaw and I were in the living room watching tv with no lights on when all of a sudden the picture window in front of me lit up, at first I thought it was lightning, but it wasnt right because it was bright green.  I noticed the neighbors house directly in front of ours was lit up also, the rest of the neighborhood was pitch dark as it should have been.  In the center of the circumfrence of green light there was a dimmer transparent ball.  The ball never changed its color it stayed the same, while the outer part dimmed, went bright then dimmed, then bright, then just seemed to collapse into the ball.  It then just dissapated.  A strange electrical sound like nothing I ever heard came 2 seconds after the light was gone and lasted only 1-2 sec.  The light was like looking through a view finder with a green slide.  I&apos;m 100% sure the light came from the sky above our house.", "July 4, 2010 13:00- A group of us headed out in a Pickup truck to watch fireworks on a mountain side.22:00-23:00- Fireworks watched.  Our group headed back down the mountain (2 people in cab of truck; 3 passengers in truck bed.) 24:00-   We arrived onto main backroad.1 person observed a &quot;shooting star&quot; that was vivdly colored.  White cross/ship like shape with blue spark streams surrounded by purple colored spark streams.  Altitude estimated ATMOSPHERIC.  A second person saw the second half of the 3-4 second event, both coincided seeing the same colors/duration.Approx 1-2 min later a &quot;star&quot; was seen expanding, exponentially( x &gt; ^20), in a fireball like event.

PD))", "Orangey-pink orb that appeared to have a bright flame burning inside traveled over a lake SW to NE in a straight line.We are out in the yard at the shore of a lake.  When we looked up there was a round, orangey-pink orb that looked as if there was a bright flame at the bottom of the orb.  The orb moved from southwest and traveled northeast across the lake in what looked at a deliberate, straight line leaving no tail.  It seemed to be at the height that a small aircraft would travel.  There was no sound.  As it got half-way across the lake, it entered the clouds and was gone.    About 15 minutes later, it happened again, identical in appearance, height, direction, speed, etc.    We didn&apos;t see it the rest of the evening.", "UFO follows planeMe and my husband were having a smoke outside on our porch swing, when he pointed out the possible UFO..It was broad daylight, I don&apos;t remember what time, but I&apos;m guessing around 4:00 PM. There was a plane in the sky, far away enough to just look like a white spot, but close enough to see it&apos;s lights, red and white I think.  And it was leaving a white trail behind it, like normal planes do. It looked like a typical commercial aircraft.  But below it, there was another object.  It looked like a white spot in the sky. It had no lights at all, and it wasn&apos;t leaving any kind of trail behind it, yet it was keeping up the same exact speed as the plane.  We watched it for awhile trying to decide what we were looking at, and eventually I decided to run inside and get my camera.  By the time I got back outside, the UFO was in front of the plane quite a bit, and too difficult to locate through the lens of my camera. We never got a good shot.This reminded me of another sighting I had witnessed a week or so before.It was in the same area of the sky, and also in broad daylight.  Again, I was on the porch smoking, and a small flash in the sky caught my eye.  When I looked up, there was nothing there. I watched for awhile to see what might have caused it, and a couple seconds later I saw it again, what it looked like to me was something (that I couldn&apos;t see) was reflecting the sun.  That&apos;s all it was, a bright white reflection that lasted a few seconds.  Disappeared, Re-appeared, and then was gone. I wasn&apos;t looking through a window, or anything, so I don&apos;t know what was reflecting the sunlight, but there was very obviously something up there.A few nights after that incident, my husband and I heard a helicopter really loud outside our house, he went to see, but I stayed in front of the TV..  He explained he saw what looked like a military helicopter, because of it&apos;s green color, flying around the vicinity of our house.  The strange thing though, is that it had a search light on, and instead of searching the ground, it was searching the sky.All of these things happened just within the past 2 weeks. I decided it was one two many incidents to not mention anything.", "When space ships decend out of the stars and come down to earth very slowly, hardly anyone notices.July 7th 2010, 10:00pm  Walking down a street in western Seattle, I looked to the sky and saw a large bright gold object crossing the sky from east to west.  I watched it because it was unusually large and near to the earth.  The object suddenly began to fade away at a rapid speed and then turned red and disappeared altogether. Later that night, I saw four or five other bright objects zoom through the sky at an insane amount of speed.  Some of the objects would disappear and then reappear and others would turn from gold to gray.  At about 3:00am on the 8th of July I saw a brilliant light that appeared to be a golden magnetic energy rise from the earth until about two hundred feet off the ground at which point it stopped emitting the gold light and began to blink in a manner very similar to a commercial jet.  The object then blinked a pattern of red, green and blue lights, turned in my direction and then flew over my head.  I was unable to discern its shape.  It then flew away and as the distance between it and me increased, the blinking lights made the object look like a shimmering star.  But if you scrutinized it closely, you could tell it wasn&rsquo;t a star, but some form of advanced technological cloaking device.  Then I noticed there were other &ldquo;stars&rdquo; in the sky that blinked in a similar fashion.  As I watched these objects, some of them moved slowly through the sky, while others zoomed at very high speeds.  Then they objects would settle down again and mimic the stars.July 8th 2010, Dusk.Due to the prior night&rsquo;s events, I found a good viewing spot (the top of a hill in Wedgewood) and began watching the sky much earlier. From this vantage point I witnessed hundreds of these &quot;stars&quot; crept across the firmament and descended ever so slowly from the real stars to earth.  They moved so slowly that if I hadn&rsquo;t been anticipating the event and patiently watching, I never would have noticed. But I did notice.  And as the ships reached Earth the sun went down.  But just before it was totally dark, I caught a brief glimpse of one of these ships.  To my surprise it resembled a very sophisticated space-plane. It hummed soothingly.  The other ships then came in my direction traveling slow and low, but keeping their lights in a fashion as to mimic commercial jets.  Occasionally the light pattern would change into a sudden brilliant display of undulating red, green, blue and gold lights.  The ships then circled around Seattle for an hour or so, at which point some of them scattered! out in all directions, while others settled in the sky and mimicked the stars.  I stayed up all night watching the ships that remained.  Some had three lights and appeared to be triangular; others had four lights and appeared to be square. I got some footage with my cell phone.  But the quality is pretty low.  Also, they knew when I was about to take a picture because almost every time I raised my camera, they would change from what they were doing with the lights back to a commercial jet pattern.  I talked out loud and it was as if they could hear me.  For a while nothing particularly obviously out of this world happened. So I said, &quot;Okay, I&rsquo;ll but my camera away.&quot;  Then the ship nearest me did a good deal of rapid blinking and all of a sudden, to the south, I saw a golden light arise over Capitol Hill.  It neared me. When it flew past, I saw that it was another ship that had just come in.  Then I walked home and went to bed.", "Reddish/orange light observed moving low in night sky West to East; no flashing or sounds.Was done observing local fireworks display around 10pm when noticed in western sky a reddish/orange light moving in the sky eatward/towards my direction.  Wife and I observed the &quot;light&apos;s&quot; movement continuing eastward/southeat at a consistent speed/pace.  No blinking lights (like a plane would have) aqnd there was no sound from the moving object either.  Would guess height was equivalent to that of a low-flying plane.", "Two crafts were seen one dissappered and another in a V shape one flew above me and my family while fishing at lock 21.me my mom dad brother and sister went fishing at lock 21 and wern&apos;t catching any thing so we were looking at the stars (there were no clouds). my dad joked to my sister watch out they might come and take you. 15 to 20 mins later i spotted a moving white light(not blinking) it was traveling west fairly slow and suddenly dissappeared. then about 10 mins later we saw another white light but it was coming towards us. we wacthed as it passed right above us. i could see an almost V like shape with the light at the tip. it moved side to side and forwards and made no noise. not a minite later the wind picked up and the bugs stopped biting. maybe 2 mins later we saw 3 planes going in the same direction.", "Three large bright orange craft travelling low and at speed in the night sky over lincolnshireThere were three craft travelling South to North in a line about ten seconds apart.They  were flying fast and low but there was no sound.They presented as cylindrical with bright orange and red colours.It was 11.10 pm and both my partner and I witnessed them.I got a photo of the last one", "3 round red lights moving in formation (line) from the West to the East.While waiting for fireworks to begin, I noticed 3 red lights at a high altitude moving from the West to East.  I observed the objects with red lights moving in a straight line formation.  There were no flashing lights on the objects to identify them as aircraft.  The objects appeared to be round in shape.  I could not hear any sounds coming from the direction of the objects.  The objects were moving at the speed of a jet aircraft.  As the objects were moving towards the West, the first object climbed at a rapid rate of speed until out of sight.   The other two objects continued moving west until fading out of sight.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

At first the light was Southeast of my home in Fremont (Seattle neighborhood)I estimate it hovering above Gasworks Park area.  I thought it was an airplane.  My family and some friends walked south down our street to 34th Ave and Stone Way in Fremont to watch the fireworks show. It was then approximately 9:50 pm and I noticed the same light in the sky.  This time the light was in a southwest position near the Aurora bridge and possibly 2 miles high in the air, I would say equal distance above Lake Union between Queen Ann hill and Fremont.  It seemed to hover in this area for 5 minutes and was much larger than an airplane light.  My family and friends commented on this orb of light with some other people waiting to see the fireworks show.  This was definitely not fireworks or other aircraft.  It stayed in one spot for 5 approximately mintues and then moved straight up in the sk! y.  The light was so bright it could be seen through the light clouds and was gone in about 10 seconds maybe less.  The light orb did not travel in any direction, just straight up.  I did not see the light again.", "Object was low to the ground, over residential area, with solid red and green lights, green light shut off when it began moving.I was driving home from work and I looked up and I could see a solid red light with a solid green light in front of it.  I watched it for about 30 seconds and it seemed to be moving very slowly.  I saw the green light turn off and the red light came to a stop.I got close enough that I thought at first it must be a cell tower or something.  I got right next to it and it started moving quickly.  I turned into a parking lot to watch and rolled my window down so I could see a little better and it sounded like it was very low to the ground.  The sound coming from it was very similar to the sound a hair dryer would make but it was higher pitched.I know it wasn&apos;t a plane or a helicopter because it was too far from a hospital or airport to be so low.", "Slow moving silent bright white lightMy husband and I were enjoying looking at the stars and noticed a single bright light moving from the NE to the SW over the Renton WA area.   We had just seen 2 planes leaving Sea Tac with their blinking lights, this object had a steady white light that did not blink.  It moved slowly in a straight line. Did not change speed or direction.   As it moved past us and to the SW we expected to hear the engine noise but heard nothing.   Silent. It continued to the SW and the light dimmed until we could no longer see it.  Possibly a low orbiting satellite?  The light seemed way too bright to be from orbit. it seemed lower like the same elevation the planes were on.((NUFORC Note:  International Space Station overflight.

It was a glowing orange ball (orb?) heading on a north by northwest trajectory and was about 200-300 feet in the sky.  It was totally silent, was going very straight and swift, and was quite bright.  The light intensity was steady, never flickered or changed intensity at all.  It never deviated in elevation as it came overhead and passed over us. We were almost under it.My one daughter was actually crying it was so odd.  The thing that baffles me most....I never saw anything like it before.  I really wanted to say it was a Chinese sky lantern or a homemade hot-air balloon....but I never saw one ever like this.I used to make and fly model hot-air balloons....I even sold plans on how to build one in the classifieds of a particular magazine.  I&apos;ve made them out of clear dry cleaner bags and tissue paper, etc.  I&apos;ve flown probably 60-70 model hot-air balloons in my lifetime (I&apos;m 43) and never seen anything like what we saw on the night of July 2.  Me and my wife are avid sky watchers and definitely know what meteors, satellites, planes, ISS etc looks like. This defies explanation to us.What we saw, and we were CLOSE to it.... was a bright round orange light inside what seemed to be a perfectly round glass sphere...  I guess that would be my best description.  I would guess...and this is just a guess based on my experience...to be around 7-8 ft in diameter.  Perhaps what seemed to be a glass sphere surrounding the ball of light could&apos;ve actually been just the &quot;flare&quot; effect of the bright light.Also.... we had a county fair going on that night.....but this came from a direction that it couldn&apos;t possibly have came from the fair...I&apos;m puzzled to explain it.", "A green heat light traveling east to west.This was not a UFO but more of a light wave?..  Hard to explain but if you can imagine the heat effect on a summer day on a hot street then this is what I saw in the sky at night.  The color of this &quot;wave&quot; was florescent green.  It looked to be half the distance from horizon to horizon in a straight line.  It moved from east to west.  It was not the shape of a laser but more a see through green heat wave that distorted the clouds as it passed.  It started out very large and ended in the western sky at a small point of light the fizzled out.This is very hard to explain.The more I think about it, might of been a meteor above the clouds but this heat light took 10 seconds to go from horizon to horizon.", "UFO with white-ish strobe light hovered above us then took off.I was hanging out with three of my friends in a walgreens parking lot and all of a sudden we saw what we thought was a police car&apos;s strobe/search light cross threw the parking lot.  We just thought it was a cop making sure everyone was behaving and not loitering outside the store.  We decided to get up and walk down the block for whatever reason.About seven minutes later, we heard a very faint noise above us and saw the &quot;strobe&quot; light again as we were still walking towards the boardwalk.  From what I recall, the light was white-colored (it was sort of like what a helicopter beam light looks like when they&apos;re searching for someone).  The beam of light went over us and we all saw it touch the sidewalk.  After this the ufo or whatever it was started to take off slowly then reached a faster speed as it flew off into the distance.Keep in mind that all of us were completely sober when we saw this.  Also, when we looked up we couldn&apos;t really see what color the actual flying object was, but it had a green square colored light on the bottom of it.  Behind the green square of light was the weird white-ish strobe light thing that would actually reach down and hit the sidewalk.The next day, I later found out that my friends from Rockport, MA, saw the same exact thing!  It freaked me out a lot that night, but I think it was quite the experience to see something so cool in the sky late at night like that."]
