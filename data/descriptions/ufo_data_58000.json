["Bright yellowish lights in a triangle to diamond shape in the west skies over Cotulla Texas!There were four lights in the sky, in the west mid section of the sky.  The lights appeared one after another and formed a triangle shape then the fourth into a diamond shape and moved upward very fast and then formed into a straight line and separated in different directions.  The lights were yellowish orange like in color and very bright.   All this took place in about one and a half minutes. Shortly after there were what appeared to be two jets at a very high altitude following the lights.  The reason I thought they were jets is because there were blinking lights and the color of the lights were white.  This is not the first time and we are not the only ones who have seen the lights.  Other people have told me the same story at work when they saw the light.  Every time we see this it&rsquo;s almost the same thing in event that happens.", "Missiles?Me and my cousin went to the park to play on my uncles motorcycle. We noticed three red flashing lights in the sky some distance away. They pulsed light and were very bright. They were going far too fast to be airplanes, even too fast to be jet fighters. If anything, I&apos;d say they were missiles but they looked like they were flying in formation and didn&apos;t have a trail of smoke behind them.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

After the event it seemed to take about ten min. to get into Kettleman City, traveling on Highway 41.  If the direction of the road that we were on was 12 o&apos;clock, the lights were at about 12:30. The lights were in a triangle position with equal distance between, if they were connected on the perimeter.  There were seven lights that were red and that did not blink like an airplane.  The lights then began to move an incredible distance in a short amount of time, going from the 12:30 position, to the 2:30 position within 5 seconds, and then stops.  It seemed 20 miles off now, and about 10 times closer than when first spotted with the lights in the same formation.  We then pulled over off the road to try to get video on the cell phone and that is when it elevates straight up, what had to be a couple of miles, stops for 2 seconds, and ! then accelerates off at about 3 o&apos;clock until the lights faded out within 2 or 3 sec.  It seemed odd that before we got back on the road after about 2 min., that no cars passed by us.  It was odd because about two miles before we saw the lights, we passed two slower moving cars going in our direction.I drew a picture of the lights when i got home. If you want to contact me i could fax the drawing. I told two people i trust the most about this and I&apos;m not bringing it up again. It didn&apos;t go over to well, just not worth it.I own a construction business in California.

We live in the downtown area and were looking west towards the mountains.My fianc&eacute; pointed out a dim orange light very high in the sky.

He was looking through the zoom lens and said they looked really big in relation the foreground.  The men present also said there had been at least 15 lights earlier but  some had already dimmed.As we watched, we saw a small plane heading south to the Ogden Airport.

One of the men who was there first stated he saw them &quot;pour out&quot; of a spot in the sky 10-12 minutes earlier.As I studied the balls of light I could see that the orange glow was of nothing like I have ever seen.  It seemed to have an organic quality with a rich color and no pulsing.All of us felt we were being watched.Then to our amazement the lights snapped into geometric star formations.  Most of them drew into the Orion constellation.The remainder of the spheres spread out over our heads.  When they moved in this way, we all felt uneasy, as it was such an intelligent action.At that point all of them started to fade their color and with the naked eye you could see a dim metallic surface on the spheres like the way the dark side of the moon glows.

I live in Crestline, California. My training started at 8:00am so I had to leave Crestline about 7:00am.  As I was leaving my home, traveling East along Lake Drive, close to Lake Gregory, I spotted three objects in the morning sky. It was a clear day and the sun was rising. I was about a block from having to make a right turn onto Lake Gregory Drive towards Hwy 18 when I spotted 3 flying objects.  I immediately slowed down and glanced in the rear view mirror for just and instant to see if there were any cars behind me.  I knew I had to make a turn at the stop sign and would possibly lose sight of them, so I milked the moment and took my time getting to the stop sign.  The objects were right in front of me and I had a perfect view through the front windshield.   2 of the objects were jets and the other was a bright glowing ! disc or sphere like UFO which was traveling right in between the 2 jets, flying about the same speed.  The jets had their after burners on and I could see the exhaust trail very clearly behind them.  The UFO on the other hand had no after burner or exhaust of any kind.  They were about 2:00 high and about 30,000 to 40,000 feet up.  The jets were small in comparison to the UFO which seemed to be about twice their size. The UFO looked like a bright planet or star, which is what I thought it was at first, but then I realized because it was right in the middle between the two jets and moving along with them, it could be neither.  Because the UFO was so bright, I thought the UFO might be reflecting the morning sun but the jets undersides were not reflecting the sun so I deduced that the UFO was lit up on its own accord. I could very well be wrong about that but I figured that the jets being a much duller silver would have been lit up by the sun as well, but they weren&rsquo;t. I couldn&rsquo;t ! tell if they were Military jets but they appeared to be so. Th! ey defin itely were not passenger planes and they were moving much to fast.  At first the UFO was centered on each side of the two wings of the both jets then as a few seconds passed, it lagged behind a little until it was near there tails.  I could make out the UFO more clearly then the jets because it was very bright and much larger and round. The contrast was exiting. I estimated the distance between the two jets and the UFO to be about a &frac12; mile to a mile on each side. The UFO seemed to darken a little from a bright starry silver to a shiny metallic silver. At one point it looked as if it had blinked off and on very quickly, right before it disappeared. It also seemed to get brighter right before it blinked out. This happened right before my eyes as the two jets kept on the same direction. I was amazed when it did this but this was not the first time I have seen UFO&rsquo;s and I have seen them make this kind of maneuver before.  In fact I have seen them much closer as close as 100 feet! .  Back to this sighting, I was glued to this UFO the whole time then it was just gone. This happened right before I made the right turn onto Lake Gregory Drive. I watched a bit more and waited to see if the UFO would blink back in but it did not. As I continued to visually follow the jets I felt a thump as I went off the road onto a burm that was on the right. This happened about a block after I made the right turn. This spectacle had my full attention and I was fortunate that I didn&rsquo;t hit anything on the right side of me other then dirt.  I put on the brakes and came to a stop along side the road, still not taking my eyes of the 2 jets. The 2 jets kept on flying in the same direction with the after burners still on and then gradually they disappeared over the top of the mountain ridge. This took about another minute. I also noted that the exhaust contrail behind the jets were the same, which was about two inches long, so I assumed they didn&rsquo;t change there speed during the! entire sighting. The jets also did not change direction or di! stance f rom each other the entire time. I concluded that the jets where either escorting this UFO or chasing it. In any case because the UFO fell behind a bit of the jets and the jets didn&rsquo;t slow down with it, it appeared that the UFO was in full control of the situation. I continued to watch a bit more after the jets and their exhausts contrails were gone hoping the UFO might appear somewhere else, but it didn&rsquo;t as far as I could see. I had to get to my training class and drive a little faster to make up for the lost time. I did not tell anyone at training but I did tell my family when I got home. Later on that week, I told a couple friends who are UFO buffs. It was an interesting sighting to say the least.", "Chemtrails and UFO over Utrecht March 13, 2010http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5IbyF04P0k  Chemtrails being sprayed over Utrecht, The Netherlands, March 13 2010 between 11 AM and noon.Note plane going by at 1:21 leaves only a brief trail, but then at 2:28 another plane goes by at what seems to be the same distance and altitude, leaving a thick trail that stays.

While enroute, my son calmly asked what the white things were in the distance. I did not know what he was talking about until we were at a stop light. I saw a round and tight formation of about 20 or more small bright blips. While at the light, I noticed they moved together in a manner that could be best described as a &quot;school of fish.&quot;  The formation of light would all glow a white hot bright for a few seconds and then the bright glow would quickly dissipate.  But you could still see them. When they were not glowing brightly I could make out what appeared to be a dark spot on the top what appeared to be an avoid shape as the sun reflected off of a dull metallic surface of each one.  The best way for me to describe the shape and color of the surface would be that each object appeared like an upside down brushed stainless steel cooking Wok.  Then in perfect unison, they would all glow white hot ! again, similar to what a high intensity headlamp would appear like.The most interesting thing about this formation, is that they all maintained separation from each other and did not appear to be moving in front or behind each other like a swarm of bees might appear like.  The formation did move gradually at times, but appeared to hang in the air and slowly gain altitude.  I could not believe this happening in broad daylight with local airtraffic all over the place.  I then opened my sunroof as the roof pillar of my car began to obstruct my view, but at this point it was unsafe for me to continue taking my eyes off the road.

Me quede observando el objeto y r&aacute;pidamente se fue.  Le avise al vigilante de la planta y no me crey&oacute;.  Pasados unos 10 minutos y estando dentro de la sala de c&aacute;maras de seguridad este, volvi&oacute; a aparecer repentinamente y en la misma zona donde nos vimos.  Todo qued&oacute; grabado en las c&aacute;maras de seguridad de la empresa.", "White glowing object appears, moves very fast, and then dissappeared.I saw an white glowing object appear and move very fast in a straight line approx. 15 degrees through the sky,then dissappear. I was facing northeast, and the object m oved in a south east direction. this object was glowing white.", "Bright Orange light that slowly fadedClear Sky. Bright Orange light appeared in the Western sky.  Bright enough to make me and three other people take notice.  It moved slowly but then stopped.  There was no noise. I stood and watched the light for 2 or 3 minutes during which it slowly faded but did not change its position in the sky.  We get a lot of aircraft movement over this location every night and I am used to seeing these, but this was different.  This is why I am taking the time to report it.", "IT WAS DURING THE SUMMER OF 1977, THE HOUSE I LIVED IN DID NOT HAVE AIR COND,WE HAD A WINDOW FAN IN OUR BEDROOM TO CIRCULATE THE AIR THRU THE HOUSE,WELL THIS FAN WOULD SOMETIMES GET OFF BALANCE AND WOULD START VIBIRITING AND I WOULD ALWAYS GET UP AND SHAKE IT AND IT WOULD STOP VIBRATING,WELL THIS ONE NIGHT IT STARTED VIBIRITING AROUND 12.00  OR LATER, SO I GOT UP TO SHAKE IT IT WAS SITTING IN A DOUBLE WINDOW,WELL I LOOKED UP AND THEE WAS THIS SAUCER ABOVE THE TREE TOPS JUST SITTING THERE DEAD STILL IN MID AIR IT WAS MAYBE 50X50 ROUND I COULD NOT SEE THE TOP OF IT.

My friend (which I dont want to involve but he is alive and I dont have permission yet) both of us were very excited of course and pulled off the road to &quot;let it sink in&quot; so to speak of what we had seen. The whole thing maybe lasted 5 seconds and it is not much to go on but we did see something and dont have a clue to what it was... sky was clear, it was night time it was warm weather windows were down, it was not a reflection off dash board lights on th! e windows, I was in the passenger side and &quot;friend&quot; was driving.((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

This bedside lamp was the only normal source of light in this room. It was off but there was still much light. This had never happened before.I had a fast impression of someone being next to my bed. I saw, momentarily, what I perceived to be blue jeans on a man&apos;s lower body then, with the light still on, but no one next to me,there was suddenly a lot of noise and commotion.In the next instant, &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; record played very loudly, presumably from the little portable record player in our living room. My room shared a common wall with the living room. When it went on, I sat bolt upright in bed. My first thought was that someone was there to murder us but I dismissed that idea with the thought that murderers probably didn&apos;t make all of this commotion-a killer would be quiet.The music was turned up so loudly that I couldn&apos;t believe that my siblings would do something this unusual and dangerous, knowing how violent our parents were. Whichever child was doing this was risking a horrible beating FOR SURE.I touched my bedroom wall with my hand to prove to myself that I was awake. The wall was solid and normal and I could see and feel the paint. I believed I was awake and I laid back down, in terror. Someone was present and making a tremendous amount of ruckus. I was shaking.Then there was a staticy feeling in the air. The room was now dark, the music stopped.I went into shock when I then saw 4 grotestue, blue, wrinkled troll-looking beings in what looked to me to be blue overalls. They were lined up in front of my closet. I thought they looked like drums because they were as stout as they were tall. They weren&apos;t tall like a human, they were maybe 3 1/2 - 4 feet tall9maybe smaller) and so wide they were like squares.I must presume that the light must have been back on for me to see them so clearly, to be able to make out color but I didn&apos;t think about the light. I was rapidly processing that these were real aliens and this event was really happening, then I was paralyzed.I felt like every molecule in my body was being pulled through the soles of my feet. I fought with all of my will but could not stop the paralysis or the pulling, which was happening very fast. I was totally and completely terrified.The next thing I can remember is being on a grate-type bridge walkway that went into a building or something large. I had the thought that &quot;this is definately happening to me and no one, not even my mother, will ever be able to help me. I wondered if they were going to keep me.Then, things get confusing in my own ability to be sure of the order of any of the following things that happened.In the place with all the grating, someone was somehow, maybe telepathically telling me that there was a problem somewhere. I was shown a darkened room with giant preying mantises just walking around. I think there was a window or something between me and them because they didn&apos;t seem to notice or care about me in any way.Then I was shown a cloaked being in the same room I was in, who I automatically presumed was an old what-ever-she-was because she was very wrinkled and seemed very weak. I was shown this from a perspective of first being behind &quot;her&quot;, to her right. I saw the dark cloak then the being who was at my side walked me up to look at her face. He told me more about the problem these beings had but its vaque to me. My impression was that whatever the problem was it had led to her appearance and weakness.I remember being in a smaller craft, seeing the stars go by very fast through a window, feeling very alone, and once again realizing that this was real. I definately thought then that I was the only human in this craft. They didn&apos;t treat me like a child. There was no comfort offerred, no food, no water, no blanket and no one to help me. It was all matter-fact, like in this transport the beings were just performing a normal routine thing.Again, I&apos;m not sure of the order of events as I only have snippets of scenes in my memory.I remeber walking, with no resistence and not much fear, concern or even interest now. I just went along willingly. I don&apos;t know who was with me at this point but my best recollection is of someone short.We passed two human-looking beings to our left. There was a little girl with dark brown or black hair just kind of standing to the left of a large glass cylinder. A human man with dark hair was in the large cylinder. It looked like a large test tube. They didn&apos;t take any significant notice of me and oddly I now realize, I didn&apos;t make any effort to communicate with them. We never made eye contact. I never even tried to.As we kept walking, he(?), the being, now on my right, continued telling me I don&apos;t remember what-until he had me look down at small horizontal portals or screens that showed different military things including an arial view of a large rocket with smoke and &quot;things&quot; flying around it. My impression was &quot;war&quot; I felt sadness and I definately said or thought loudly &quot;If you know all this, show me how I&apos;m going to die&quot; and he did. He showed me a larger vertical screen and I watched myself, as an adult woman with long dark hair walking alone into a high floor of a ski chalet. There was a large picture window and I looked out upon a beautiful scene below of trees and lots of snow.Now, at this point, I feel more like I&apos;m living it rather than watching it. I walked toward the main living room type area. Maybe 8, 10 people were in the living room, most sitting on sofas and some just milling about. I remember thinking that there should be no problem here because I knew most or all of the people. I started to walk to a sofa to sit down and a man just came up behind me and slit my throat. It felt like a true event happening in real time. I felt like I was blacking out, dying, and my last thought in this scenario was &quot;I can&apos;t believe this could happen. I know all of these people. Why isn&apos;t someone helping me? Was this a plot they were all in together?&quot;.Then I was back, standing in front of this vertical scene, with the being who had no emotion about my death scene. None. I asked so he showed me. It was just a matter of future history, nothing personal on his part in any way.From there, things are very &quot;fuzzy&quot;.I felt like I was lying down, in a different place, kind of flooating, then on(?) a white table, with doctors around me and the table, mostly to the left side of me. I felt euphoric-a feeling I would now liken to a narcotic only more exaggerated.One of the doctors said my name!  I felt something like a metal rocket-shaped &apos;thing&apos; being inserted. I was somehow okay with this!  The next memory is of me in a small spaceship, traveling in my parent&apos;s yard to my bedroom window.The being piloting, to my left, was very blond and looked almost like a human male adult but my sense was that he was not human. His skin was too white-opague and his demeanor was like &quot;nothing&quot;. There only seemed to be room for the two of us in this craft but I could see all around us. I think he telepathically mentioned ants and aloe vera as we flew over some. I&apos;m not sure if I really remember the aloe vera-ant thing or if I conflabbed it.We were very low to the ground. We neared my window and I thought &quot;Oh, we&apos;re going in my window&quot; but we did not.Still in the small craft, I remeber vividly that I felt very raw (emotionally, not physically), invaded, disappointed, very saddened. Something had been taken from me, from my body. I felt a sad emptiness and the being imparted to me &quot;Its done. There&apos;s nothing you can do about it&quot; My regret seemed to surprise or confuse this being. Maybe even irritation would describe his affect. This was the only millisecond of &quot;feeling&quot; that I received from him. &quot;Disturbance of the norm&quot;  I heard two whistling, spinning noises, I felt cold, I felt a little spinning then I SAW my own bedcovers UNDER me as I flew into place in my own bed.I don&apos;t recall waking up that morning but I obviously did and just went about the morning like it was a normal day.I remembered later in the same day that this had happened. I was walking from my elementary school lunchroom, in line with my classmates, headed back to class when I remembered. I knew the word schizophrenic and knew if I told my mother she would take me to a psychiatrist and that would be what they would say.I knew it had really happened but believed I was the only person in all of history that this had happened to or would happen to.I made my mind up on that sidewalk that day that for my own protection, I could never tell a living soul.I have no idea if this was one event or numerous events that my mind has spliced together. I only remember the paralysis and sucking through the feet feeling happening one other time. I was even more terified the second time and totally determined not to go again. With all my will and strenghth, I moved my right little finger and the paralysis was broken.I&apos;ve never had the feeling again, never been taken anywhere and have had no conscious awareness of any aliens anywhere since then.The most important thing I can tell you is that when I returned home from school that day and went to use our restroom, I had a straight red line from my naval to my pubis. It was shocking to me but also forced me to admit the reality of this whole thing to myself. The red line looked like a perfect surgical incision had been made and closed but there were no suture marks, no staples, no apparent source of closure. The red line was perfectly straight and is visible to this day. It has become a thin brown line visible from about 3 inches from my naval down to the top of the pubis. I definately welcome inspection of this &quot;scar&quot; by medical researchers. No doctor or boyfriend has ever noticed or commented on it.Later, maybe 5 or 10 years later when I first read of animal mutalations, I had chills and anxiety. I felt certain this was the work of the beings who took me.I was a straight A student but a compartmentalized nervous wreck from then until recently. I could not become truly emotionally connected to anyone and I lived in complete terror that something like this would happen to my own daughters.When they came to take me the second time, I felt I was marked in some way or how would they know to take ME again?  Since in the death scenario I had long dark hair and was an adult - once I became an adult I dyed my hair blond, kept it short and knew I would never live in or go to places with ski chalets and snow.Now 54, I find myself in Colorado because I need to live near my oldest daughter who lives here. She is my primary care giver and I truly need her help - so I&apos;m here. I have a devastating terminal disease.Prior to this disease I now have, I lived only in hot places -FL and NV I was so determined to not live out the death scene.I have neuromyelitis optica and I am now blind. My immune system is shredding my nervous system one cranial nerve at a time. This began in the 80&apos;s.It is a very rare disease and one of the few conditions that causes both blindness and paralysis in the patient, then leads to death by the failure of the intercoastal muscles. I hated the beings my whole life. I hated that they took an innocent, already traumatized child without even asking the child. It was a violent kidnapping in my opinion.Now that I am aware of so many stories similar to mine, I&apos;m calmer in one respect(I&apos;m not the ONLY one) but now, I&apos;m very concerned for all humankind. What is going on?!  I have been diagnosed with PTSD from chilhood abuse and adult onset PTSD from going blind. A more correct diagnosis would have been lifelong PAS, I have no doubt.To clarify one of answers regarding number of craft seen-I said 3. I may have seen one from the outside, in my yard, during the same event but everything else was inside a craft. I count them as 1-the grating &amp; preying mantises, the little girl, the death scene and the medical stuff 2-the craft in which I was flown rapidly by a military type &quot;crew&quot; and 3- the tiny ship from which the blond took me across the yard and into my room.I had a horrible childhood in every possible way because of the on-going anxiety and terror from this event, the constant beatings from my adoptive parents and a year of molestation by my 5th grade teacher.I became a life-long loner.In the 90s, I told one friend and both of my daughters of the event. All three said they believed me, which makes it possible for me to tell you now.I also told a boyfriend who was a paramedic and is now a nurse in a infant and children&apos;s trauma ward in LV. He did not believe my story was real but does believe that I believe it. He believes that this is a cover story created by my mind because I cannot accept that I was raped as a child. He doesn&apos;t believe in UFOs and thinks we are alone in this vast universe.I was NOT raped as a child. Beaten by parents, molested by a teacher but there was no rape event.I can&apos;t really care if anyone believes me or not. It doesn&apos;t change any of what happened.I feel like my whole life was stolen from me. I&apos;ve not had one day since the event that I felt normal or that I fit in anywhere. There is some relief in knowing that people, lots of people worldwide, now know of these kinds of abductions and that there is at least investigation being done now.I used to pray that one day there would be a registry or someway to tell legitimate researchers and scientists what happened to me in the hope of one day really understanding why they picked me.Because I believe it neccessary for my good mental health to forgive them, I do, to a point, but I still hate the little, blue drum-like ones who took me with absolutely no regard for me, my terror, my youth.I like to think that if they ever came along now that I wouln&apos;t be frightened of them. I think I would be bold and demand some answers this time.I worry about, but also look forward to some kind of event where all the abductees are made known to the world so people will know that this really happened to lots of us and perhaps, is still happening to some people, especially children.I believe I saw 6 different kinds of aliens : 1-the horrible little blue drum-like ones who took me, 2-the preying mantises,3- the &quot;crew&quot; of the shuttle 4-the &quot;explainer&quot; who walked me past the two humans and showed me the &quot;war&quot; pictures and my own alleged death. 5- the doctors and 6-the very white man who took me home through my ceiling.Very oddly, I have no direct recall of any of the &quot;greys&quot; with the big eyes, claimed by so many abductees but I also can&apos;t tell you what the&quot;crew&quot; or the &quot;explainer&quot; or the doctors looked like at all. I don&apos;t know why I can&apos;t remember something this important, but in 40+ years I&apos;ve never remembered their faces.I was adopted at birth from McDill AFB and have speculated that the doctor who knew my name might have been a human military doctor.In 1979 I had to have an emergency surgical procedure (a right oophorectomy) because my right ovary had become gangrenous from &quot;torsion of the tube&quot;. No eggs were visible in this ovary upon removal nor upon follow-up microscopic examination. No doctor was able to explain this or determine where my eggs were,  or if there had ever been any in that ovary.I had a normal pregnancy in 1980 and gave birth to my second daughter. She has extra vertebrae in her neck and was born with eyes so almond-shaped I worried for a time that she might be mongoloid. She is not.In 1983, following the 1979 removal of my right ovary and a 1982 surgical procedure to eliminate some of the remaining left fallopian tube to insure contraception, and with my partner having had a vasectomy, I was told that I was pregnant again. I lost the baby and all the attending physician would tell me is that the baby was not normal. I was not shown the baby.In 2008, following 7 years of total menopause and having no partner for 8 months, as my boyfriend had died, I was again told I was pregnant. I was 52 years old. I was hospitalized for 3 days and all 12 blood pregnancy tests came back positive, as well as all urine tests. The hospital lab was in a bit of an uproar about &quot;the old, blind pregnant lady with no partner&quot;. I was released into the care of my family practioner who administered a blood pregnancy test in her office two weeks later. It came back negative.(The emergency room doctor seemed extremely interested in the fact that I had torsion of the tube in my 20s but he never elaborated. He just seemed very excited and interested in this fact. So much so that I wondered then and I wonder now, WHY was this of so much interest to him? As his name is on the medical record as the admitting doctor, I hope one day someone will ask him why this was a big deal to him. No other medical professional has ever raised an eyebrow when I mention it, yet he was incredulous and focused on it at length. He then performed an ultrasound and determined that my womb was empty. He admitted me, baffled).Because I had chemotherapy in 2007-09 for this neuromyelitis optica, my doctor believes I was experiencing endocrine changes. I think this is likely correct as I have had no other encounters since the 60s of which I am aware.Truthfully, I think the neuromyelitis is a result of both the chil abuse and the abduction. I think it was all too much for my nervous system. I see a very qualified neuro-opthomologist who has no idea at all why I have this disease.I&apos;ve never had the courage to tell any medical professional treating me or any mental health professional of the abduction because I believe they will label me &quot;insane&quot;.I&apos;m not.I have been troubled and anxious for 40+ years. I have attempted suicide too many times to count (okay, 5). The most recent event, in 2008, was a compulsive act that I felt was not entirely of my own accord.Suddenly, one afternoon, I wanted very much to put a screwdriver through my left wrist, which makes absolutely no sense to me. I did not do that but with almost an uncontrollable intensity, I took an over-dose of Wellbutrin and Prozac. Somehow, I took just the right combination for the drugs to balance each other out and though I spent the night in intensive care, I had almost no effect from the 15 pills or more that I ingested. No nausea, no vomiting, no convulsions, not even a hiccough. I can&apos;t believe how out of control of myself I felt while taking the over-dose. It was a manic event that still doesn&apos;t make sense to me. Never have I heard of &quot;death by screwdriver&quot; and I&apos;m no handyman. Usually, I don&apos;t even own a screwdriver and have never at any other time thought about a screwdriver in any odd way like this.I am a mother. If I were really going to intentionally kill myself there is no doubt that I would leave lengthy letters of explanation for my adult daughters. I would make logical plans, I would give away treasured momentos, I would say good-bye to those I love, yet, I didn&apos;t do any of this. I just felt  this over-whelming impulse to put a screwdriver through my own wrist. Instead, I took lots of pills very quickly. I remember counting 12, 13, 14...like they were M&amp;Ms, instead of strong medications.I was a medical professional myself (an EMT and medical writer) and NEVER would I do this.And yet, I did.The other 4 attempts prior were clustered from 2001 to 2004 and were also compulsive acts. No planning, just action that seemed to be out of me instead of from me. I tried to jump off a mountain (my daughter decked me to keep me from doing this), I ran out into traffic (everyone stopped), I went to a desolate location in an attempt to die from exposure and starvation (this was clearly going to take a long time and be painful) and I asked someone I didn&apos;t know to get heroin for me so I could over-dose. I took twice the amount they said would be dangerous and waited. All I got was a headache.Obviously, I&apos;m not very good at suicide.I don&apos;t think I will ever try again because now, if I felt the compulsion, I would resist totally.Enough of my life has been taken from me by others.Once I made the connection that the US military was probably involved in this, which was only recently, I began to feel much stronger but also even more angry. What do I think? I think I was taken by aliens but that the doctor who knew my name was human and that both were somehow benefitting from whatever they did to me. I truly think I was selected because I was an adoptee from an AFB and was already traumatized.Obviously, all of the medical information I am recounting is verifiable through medical and hospital records, which I&apos;m happy to provide to any legitimate researcher. I welcome the opportunity to have truth serum administered and would agree to be hypnotized by a medical professional. In both scenarios I would ask that a video recording be made of the entire questioning procedure and I would want a trained UFO researcher present in both cases.Its taken my whole life to put these snippets together. I remembered some of it that day but was an adult before I realized why I always had to have a rectangular white dining table. I could almost remember but not quite, then one day in Sarasota, FL, following the purchase of my 3rd or 4th white rectangular table, I remembered. I was on one. I think it possibly emitted white light. How else would I know it was white if I was lying on it? I don&apos;t remember anyone removing my clothing, nor do I know how my clothing was returned to my body.Unlike the other stories I&apos;ve been reading on the Internet, I was not shown any babies or told anything about hybrids. I wasn&apos;t asked to touch or hold anything or anyone.I now think they took eggs from my right ovary and I think they left the fallopian tube and ovary malpositioned which resulted in the torsion. It might have been intentional because the gangrene certainly made it impossible for doctors to tell what had happened to my right ovary and eggs.I believe they take children because we are closer to their size.Even now as I write this, I feel sick to my stomach and sweaty.I would give most anything to know the whole truth of what happened to me - and apparently others- and WHY.Finally, let me say that I am a professional writer and have been virtually my whole adult life. If I were going to make up a story, I promise you, it would make a lot more sense than this. I WISH I was making it up.Though it happened to me, it remains almost too incredible for me to believe but the scar is still there.Before she passed in 2003, my mother and I spoke of the scar. All she really said was &quot;yeah, you have had that for a long time.&quot; I don&apos;t know why she said this because NEVER did I show it to her or tell her about it in any way. She never commented if and when she really ever saw it, yet she acted like &quot;yeah, aliens, no big deal.&quot; No surprise, no questions.I thank you with my whole heart for providing this forum to people like myself who have kept this horrible secret inside ourselves for our whole lives. I hope someone will contact me and help me sort it out.Due to the blindness, phone contact is the best way to reach me. I would accept a collect call but I only have a cell phone and they don&apos;t permit collect calls. I can&apos;t read my own e-mail and must have others read it for me. I would prefer not to have to talk about it with anyone except a valid researcher.Thank you very much - and if you are connected to the military in any way DO NOT contact me. And I better not have any MIBs hanging around once I submit this to you. I am so NOT even kidding. If I am contacted by ANYONE except a UFO researcher, I WILL DENY that I wrote this and swear that it never happened.If you are truly valid UFO researchers, I hope you will know by content that this DID happen. Please give me a chance to provide the little proof that I have (the scar).((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

It also was flashing from blue and green and sending laser lights to the ground. It then emitted a humming sound.

The object first appeared to be glowing, but after a closer look, it seemed to be aflame.It did not appear to be moving quickly, and I did not see it leaving a &lsquo;trail&rsquo;.  I thought that it was an emergency flare, but I think that a flare is more of a &lsquo;glow&rsquo; than a &lsquo;flame&rsquo;, and this looked more like a flame.The object seemed to be about 60 degrees up from the horizon when I first spotted it, and directly ahead of me (90 degrees) when I lost sight of it (or at the point it &lsquo;flamed out&rsquo;).  I hope that I am using the right terminology here.It seemed to have lost some elevation as it moved away from me, but without knowing the altitude of the object, there is no way to know how much elevation was lost.The object either &lsquo;flamed out&rsquo; or moved behind clouds at approximately 8:09 pm.After arriving home, I called 911, but they had received no other reports of the object.", "bright orange, flickering, upside down teardrop shape, moving fast, no audible noise over s.w.

It was moving from West to East, inside the atmosphere. No flashes, no strobing, just a single white light, much brighter than any stars in the sky.After watching for about 30 seconds, I had determined that is clearly not a plane or a satellite.

It continued on and seemed as if it just suddenly got bright and seemed to be stationary for a brief second and then slowly faded away.While watching all this 2 planes passed into our sites, so we could easily compare them to an airplane.

My brother, his wife, and myself were smoking a cigarrette, and her little brother was staring at the horizon in a northwest direction.  And he spotted 1 dim light off in the distance that seemed real low.  It begin to move and disappear behind hills as if it were traveling over the prairie close to the ground.  As it came closer I say still around 3 miles away it split into 2 dim lights, and they both seemed as if they were slowly zigzaging back and forth.

On my way to the path, I saw something strange moving through the air, I could barely tell what it was and I incorrectly (or maybe correctly) thought I saw a UFO. I concluded that it was just a plane but there were more lights in the sky around. I&apos;m about 45 min from Ohare so I know that my area has some looparound flight paths near it, and there seemed to be a ton of planes circling, you could almost always see one or two along a path at any given time or place (even later at the coffee shop many miles away there were still planes everywhere in the sky.)  There may be some back up because of the weather, it seemed like a storm is brewing in the air.  But on my way down the path, I saw another light in the distance, in a different direction that seemed... out of place. Once I got to where I could see clearly, it already had enough time to leave! . I kept on walking and about five minutes later I felt something change in the air. It was like the atmosphere had changed yet I was not consciously aware of it yet. It was more like instinct that made me turn my head, and I&apos;m glad I did. I saw something strange looking come out of the area behind me and to my left. It was a collection of three lights and one blinking one. I would have thought it was another plane except it seemed different, something felt wrong about it. As it passed over me, it took about 15-25 sec to pass from the horizon to my back left to the front right, I saw what it was. It was very hard to focus on it or to look at what it was. It felt like, consciously, I could only observe my surroundings instead of rationally comprehend or pick apart details. I know what I saw but it was hard to get anything to register, I couldn&apos;t pick it apart like I could shapes in a cloud. It was hard to see but it was only a few hundred feet above me, it was triangular and! had large lobed sides. It seemed outlined in something glowin! g white or translucent but shrouded as to not be too showy. As it passed I could see that there was something on the bottom, I&apos;m not sure if it was energy pads or whatever that was the light, but I could tell it was not an airplane, it was low enough to see, but still high up. The memory is a little hard to remember of how exactly it looked, like I said, it seemed hard to focus on. As it was going into the distance I noticed it was in a new shape. The triangle seemed to turn into a T shape of disconnected lights but I never saw he conversion, only before and after. That may have been due to distance, but I do have pretty good eyesight and don&apos;t often make up shapes like that. As it passed a few hundred feet over me, it wasn&apos;t loud. It sounded like it was a jet that was much much further up, but even that sound seemed... artificial. As if it was something that would not be noticed in the background of air traffic noise, but when looked at sounded... off. And the object was much too c! lose to have normally been that quiet, if a jet was that low, car alarms would be going off and the ground rumbling. As it glided over me, for I was in the center of a very small village with noone else around as far as I could see, the hum of the electricity seemed to temporarily change. I don&apos;t remember if the frequencies got higher or lower but I remember hearing a distinct change that only happened as it was passing over the building that had neon signs. What&apos;s odd is that I tried to tell the friends I hung out with multiple times about the sighting but no matter how hard I tried, the conversation would always get wildly diverted. I tried, but I couldn&apos;t slip it in in the few hours we were at Caribou Coffee. Even when I would do my best to specifically bring it up, the person I was trying to tell, the UFO junkie, kept suddenly getting compelled to finish a thought from 20, 30 minutes earlier in conversation. I could get not get a word about that in edgewise, even though! if I blatantly said I saw a UFO we would have been talking ab! out it a ll night. As I walked home from Denny&apos;s (yes, too many different restaurants,) about a good mile from home and at the top of a hill next to which is my house in the expansive valley below it, I could see helicopters everywhere. Even If I couldn&apos;t see bright lights like I could from some of them, there was always one around. I would look into the sky and see a flash of some helicopter or something very far off, an impossible distance to identify what, but it was the artificial flash of a helicopter. They were everywhere. Cops too were hurriedly congregating, I saw three suddenly rush into a meeting place and I was walking across the street from the storage facility they met at. They got out of their cars and talked about &quot;I saw blah&quot; &quot;It was seen&quot; &quot;blah blah seen.&quot; I  couldn&apos;t really make out what they were saying, but they were all sharing about something they saw. It may have been in relation to a criminal act, but events were weird as is. (What&apos;s weird is that the UFO remi! nded me of a dream I had a while back about UFOs. I almost never have dreams about them and I know that it wasn&apos;t a real abduction, just my unconscious playing around, but it still looked similar to my abduction dream.) Oh yeah, plus there were a ton of other aircraft around, but this glided by pretty quickly and in it&apos;s own direction, not one that is a flight path. It was foggy and hazy tonight everywhere, but this was mostly below the clouds.", "Green glowing fireballs in the woods near Bankson Lake in Lawton, MII thought I had entered a report to this website a couple of years ago.  I do not see my report, I guess I&apos;ll send again.  On two separate occasions when I was 16 years old, in the summer of 1997, I saw green glowing fireballs in the woods of Lawton, Michigan.

I don&apos;t know what I saw.  I know it absolutely terrified me because I didn&apos;t know what it was, and it seemed to move with an intelligence, that is what really frightened me.  That it did not seem to be moving randomly or as something seen in nature, but like it was exploring and moving in a very deliberate way around the trees--up very high, down very low, close to our window, farther away.  Each time, there were 2+ balls, although I can&apos;t say exactly how many, because we were in a! cabin looking out the window and not getting a full vantage point.  Basically we were frozen in fear in our beds, watching out the window. The approximate size of the balls I would compare to an appliance like an average size washer or dryer or stove.  Even just writing about it and thinking about it makes me feel a little freaked out. I just did not get a good impression from these things.  Both times we saw it, it was sometime between midnight and 1 am, when we were staying up late talking with the lights out.  Both times we watched for awhile until we had the courage to jump up and turn the lights on (with the lights on you couldn&apos;t see out the window into the blackness).  Both times I checked the woods behind the cabin the next morning, and saw nothing but the most unremarkable leaves, trees, brambles...completely homogeneous, unremarkable woods for as far as you could see!!

I then noticed a small circular object flying along side it.  The circular object slowed down to a speed much slower then the plane and disappeared behind the clouds.  At this point the plane flew over head, and I went outside for a closer look.  About 5 minutes passed and I then noticed the same object emerged from the clouds, stayed at the high altitude and started to fly south west at what looked like at a slow speed.  I could see the object better when it was directly over my house because it was heading closer to the sun.  The object looked like it was rotating because every time it rotated there was a brief reflection.  The Object stayed at a slow pace for 5 more minutes heading south west until it was no longer visible.", "brillant flash of lightAt approximately 2100 hours on february 12 my wife and i were laying in bed and we witnessed a brilliant flash through our blinds.  I got up and looked out the window to see a brillant green flash.  I ran around to my back yard and witnessed it 5 more times but could not pin point were the location of this flash was.  At that point I contacted the ufo report hotline and the operator told me that i should contact the authorities and possibly the electric company because it could be a transformer blowing out. We were experiencing a freak snow storm that night and I contacted both the police department and the electrical department and they said they had no reports of either flashes of light or any surges of electrity or any power outages.  At that point I was at a loss for what it could possibly be.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded to us to be an exceptionally serious-minded individual.  He emphasized how bright the light was, and how many times the flash occurred, approximately 20 times.

I was looking at the stars facing southwest, when something caught my eye. I quickly looked over and in 1-2 seconds I saw 4 lights moving at an incredible speed past the roof of my house. I quickly ran around to the side of the house to see what it was.For the next 2-4 seconds I clearly saw 3 lights forming a triangle speeding across the sky directly south. There was also a light right in the middle of all 3. There was a large distance between the lights, because at the speed they were moving, they stayed in perfect unison probably 5-6 miles apart from each other.I&apos;m not sure whether or not these were rim lights to some large craft, but it seems unlikely since the distance between them stayed in a perfect triangle. If this is the case, the craft must have been absolutely huge.The speed of this object was approximately (and I&apos;m guessing here) 10-15x faster than the airplanes I observed in the sky over the SF Bay Area during the minutes after the sighting. I can&apos;t stress enough that this thing was moving INCREDIBLY FAST!  The night sky during the event was very hazy, with the lights from San Francisco making it hard to see the stars. I lost sight of the object in the haze traveling southward. The lights also appeared to be speeding up.For the past year, I lived outside the city, and saw many shooting stars during the night and early morning. I am absolutely certain that these lights were not shooting stars.

We had a visibility of 180 grades, with the direction towards the South in front of us; therefore the West was in our right and of course the East to the left. The night was clear and we were looking west where the international airport of Margarita Island is.  We were looking, just above the horizon the lights of the airplanes. It was at that instant when I saw three lights coming from the west, from the same place the airplanes were flying. The lights were moving with an incredible speed towards us. I only had time to cry: What the hell is that? When the lights already were flying over our position. At first I thought that there were three separated war planes, but when the object was on us, I could see the figure of the object like that of a perfect isosceles triangle. It had three white lights in the vertices, the colour of the UFO was very dark (Could be bla! ck). It was huge, could be the size of half football&apos;s camp. It made no sound at all. The UFO disappeared flying in the direction north-east.

I ran downstairs to grab my camera and ran outside but it was gone. My mother said it left just a few seconds after I went downstairs.  I have seen a variety of craft but never anything like this.

I looked up from my driveway to see what I first thought was a night bird, but as my eyes followed it, I could see it was a horizontal triangle with three lights.  Because the night sky was filled with stars, I could see the shape of the object as it blocked the stars&rsquo; light.  The triangle appeared to be about 200 feet up, moving easterly in an almost-straight line, wobbling slightly, not always quite level.  It moved at the pace of a soaring bird, coasting through the air.  It seemed to be about five feet wide.  Three round lights were evenly spaced in its corners, the same color as the stars, pale bluish-white, with indistinct edges.  The triangle itself appeared to be grayish, though that may be only because it was against the dark sky.

I was waiting at the crosswalk and had nothing better to do other than look up, when suddenly, I noticed these lights traveling at great speed.

I was accompanied by two friends  (A women in the back seat and a man in the front seat.We were just beginning to emerge from a hail storm when a very bright, white light came into view in the upper right of my windshield moving westerly at a very high rate of speed.  I knew immediately that it wasn&rsquo;t any kind of conventional aircraft.  As I looked at the light I asked my friend, &quot;What the hell is that?!&quot;  Looking at it, my friend replied, &quot;I don&rsquo;t know.&quot;  I am a private pilot and have logged more than a thousand hours in small single engine aircraft. The first thing I noticed was the lack of navigation lights on it. The light was less than 1500 feet above ground because it was flying lower than the clouds that produced the hail storm.  I estimated these clouds to be around fifteen hundred feet and the light to be about a thousand feet above ground level.  It was also less than half a mile to our right.  So it was very close when I first saw it.  I figure it was moving at several hundred miles per hour.  Probably around mach 1. Yet there was no noise.  The ball of light seemed to be the same size as a small single engine aircraft.  But it was so bright it is really hard to say with accuracy.It made a slightly ascending  ten degree right turn then turned back to the left about fifteen degrees and leveled off at about fifteen hundred feet above ground level.  In less than a minute, it was already quite a distance away, perhaps as much as ten or fifteen miles.  It seemed to slow down as it approached Aberdeen.  Since we were traveling in the same direction, it remained in sight for maybe as long as ten minutes as we moved toward Aberdeen.  It in fact seemed to be hovering over Aberdeen at one point.  But it is hard to tell from that distance whether it was over Aberdeen and whether it was still moving slowly or hovering.As we emerged from the hail storm the sky became partly cloudy and the stars came out.  Even being several miles away it was much brighter than the stars.  As we approached about five miles out of Aberdeen the light finally disappeared from view.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he seemed to us to be an exceptionally competent witness.  We have invited him to obtain data regarding the height of the bottoms of the clouds, to establish the maximum possible altitude of the object.

I watched for a few minutes but saw nothing else and went back to the dog walking thing. After several minutes I turned around and looked at the spot where I had seen the flashes and saw a large ball of light that I at first thought was a star. Then it became clear this was not a star and was blinking. The blinking reminded me of a old rotating police light. The light was white and I could see flashes of blue or green in it. There was another smaller blinking light underneath and to the west of the larger light that wa! s moving very slowly as if it were searching for something. I walked back to the house and continued to watch the lights and got my mom to come outside and look. She agreed that the lights were odd and did not look like any aircraft.

I pulled my car to the side of the road and stopped.  All at once the light totally encircled my car it was very bright almost blinding and made me feel dizzy and nauseous.  I remember hearing a whooshing sound and feeling static in the air.  Seemed just a few minutes and it was ahead of me moving up the road.  I began to follow its direction and past my road, when it shot up into the air, then up over the lake, then was gone.  I guess it was probably about the size of a semi-truck only round about 15 to 20 feet across.  I pulled over again and sat there awhile wandering what?--again what was that?  When I arrived home, my sister asked me what took me so long to get home.  See it is only a 10 to 15 minute drive.  Evidently, this time my drive home took over 3 hours.  Now from the time I saw the object till the time I returned driving home, seemed to me only maybe 5 to 10 minutes.  I told my sister what had transpired and that I was getting scared because I had no idea what happened during the time I was encircled.  She said I sounding crazy.  But then we decided, I should call the police.  I did and they gave me another number to call because they said they had other sighting reports.  I called the other number the police gave me and gave them a full report of what I had experienced, They thanked me and said they would contact me if they needed more information-they never did.  Now, I still don&apos;t know transpired during the time my car was encircled by the object.  Till this day my hair and skin tingles ! when I think about my experience.Thank you for your time", "UFO caught on Google Maps.I was looking at property to buy on google maps.  In the picture that google took there is a very curios ufo in the sky.  There is a exhaust plume and a craft, the curios thing is that you can see an exhaust area where the ufo seemed to appear out of nowhere and then accelerate.  Anyone interested in seeing this should go to Google Maps, type in Lumpkin Road, Oroville, Ca.Use the satellite view and go to the first bridge over the lake, then go to street level and point north and up.  It is VERY visible and very intriguing.((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))", "Airplane-like light which seemed to spawn larger, brighter, stationary lights as it moved.Around 7:30 PM last night (Friday, 12 February 2010), my father was walking down our driveway to get the paper. It was extremely dark out, and the sky was very clear. As he was partway down the driveway, he noticed a group of lights to the north at an elevation of perhaps 45 to 60 degrees (Vermont&rsquo;s mountainous horizon makes this difficult to judge). They were blinking like the running lights on aircraft, but as if there were three or four aircraft passing right next to each other while heading in different directions. This apparent cluster was what caught his attention, but a moment later he observed the appearance of another light.This light, slightly to the south of the cluster, appeared much larger than the others did, my father estimating its apparent diameter to be at least four times that of the largest stars and planets from his perspective, with intensity to match. He described it as being a light orange-yellow color that made him think of a motorcycle headlamp. He wondered if it was from an aircraft&rsquo;s landing lights, but after a few seconds, it went out in the way that an incandescent lightbulb does when switched off. At this point, he saw that the group of smaller lights was no longer present, but one remaining light had moved south and was heading away from the point where the large light had been.The light moved south, still blinking every second or so. After a few seconds of it moving on this path, another large light appeared at the position of the smaller one. The smaller light kept moving, but the larger light remained completely stationary, not drifting or arcing in the way a flare or even a helicopter with a spotlight might. This happened twice more over the next few seconds, so that there were three large lights marking the smaller one&rsquo;s previous path.The small light made a &ldquo;u-turn&rdquo; back towards the north, blinking all the while. My father described as being as if a car going at a reasonable speed had made a 180-degree turn, but an aircraft going an equivalent speed for his viewpoint would have needed a much larger turning radius. After the smaller light had traveled some distance from the others, all three large lights went out simultaneously, in the same lightbulb-like way the first one had. Through all of this, my father had not heard the slightest sound, except for a large jet that approached from the south after the light finished its turn. The entire incident took less than a minute. At this point, he ran inside to get my mother and myself, but by the time we got outside the light had disappeared, and the jet passed over our house to the north.My father has excellent vision and hearing, a good knowledge of the conditions that can cause many aerial phenomena, and a great love of stargazing, but he has been at a loss to explain what he saw. If the bright lights had not appeared, he would have not given what he observed a second thought, but their intensity and utter lack of movement were like nothing he has ever seen. He has drawn a diagram of the lights&rsquo; path and thoroughly explained it to me, but I, too, cannot explain it. The only thought that occurred to me was that he might have seen some sort of ball lightning, but he witnessed an instance of ball lightning in his youth and said that it was not at all like what he saw. He also inquired at the nearest airport, but their only explanation was that Black Hawk helicopters have recently been in use nearby. We found this suggestion unlikely, as the helicopters that frequently pass near our house are particularly loud and my father heard no sounds save the engines of! the jet that appeared just before he ran to find us.In short, we are absolutely stumped as to what he might have observed.", "Larger craft dropping off smaller crafts that lingered for over 5 hours.I first saw a strange light in the sky that very much looked like an approaching helicopter.  It caught my attention because it was orange, where usual helicopters have a white glow.  I stared at it for a few seconds and then it started dropping smaller white lights, and my first reaction was that it was dropping bombs.  I didn;t think it was a UFO at this point, I thought it was an army helicopter or other army aircraft.  I left my room to go get my mom;s camera and returned with her and the camera only to find that the mysterious orange light was gone.  I looked throughout all the windows in the house, it was nowhere in sight.  I thought about it and brushed it off as a helicopter dropping flares because it was the only logical explanation I could come up with.  This was at approximately midnight on March 27, 2010.About an hour later, I woke up and my window was still open.  It was then I saw that the smaller crafts that were dropped were all clustered and flying around in unusual patterns in the North West sky out of my window.  I looked at them for four hours and couldn&apos;t figure it out.  I&apos;m positive that they were what came out of the orange glowing craft.  They would fly diagonally, horizontally, vertically, and make turns that couldn&apos;t possibly be made by any aircraft here on Earth.  I seen them appear from point A to point B.  There was no trace of light as they flew because it was so fast.  They, like the orange UFO, were silent.  I watched them from 1:00 AM to about 5:00 AM then I thought I had enough and shut the blinds and tried to sleep.  I didn&apos;t see when, or if, they left, but I did hear a loud and unusually low jet fly by a little before sunset that woke me up.  I checked, and didn&apos;t see them anymore after that.The orange UFO was high in the open sky, and the white smaller ones were unusually lower than the mountain range that is outside my window.  Both the crafts looked like simple circular lights.  It was an extremely windy night so the sky was clear.I don&apos;t see how I could be the only one to see this, I&apos;m sure others seen it as well.  It lasted for hours.  My moms camera and my phone couldn&apos;t focus on the objects, so no pictures came out that would show anything.", "glass like,you could see threw,craft was 20 feet in front of me,as i stepped closer, a ramp out of the side of the craft opened up and i jumped back. as the ramp stopped coming out a femal voice spoke to me in my mind,go on in and i will be right there.

We passed a mall in our state called &ldquo;The Warwick Mall&rdquo; and we a giant flashing light in the sky. I slowed down so we could keep looking because I knew it didn&rsquo;t look like a plane. It got closer to us, enough to see the shape was like a tall saucer, and there were two lights in the front like headlights. Then I saw smaller lights around the rim. My friend I were starring at it in disbelief for about 10 minutes. Ironically the Warwick Mall was just flooded by a bunch of rainy weather that just happened in RI so the whole thing is damaged and closed down. I feel like &ldquo;they&rdquo; or &ldquo;it&rdquo; was looking down at that. They were hovering right over it and then passed over me on the highway and we lost sight.

It made a high-pitched whining noise with two tones, maybe an octave or two apart. It seemed to me to be no more than maybe 50-100 feet overhead.  It moved rather slowly and quite majestically.  At the time I had assumed it was a weather monitor or some such.  There is an Air Force base in Tampa, so I supposed it was something to do with that, however, the unusual alphabetical characters makes me wonder what it actually was.

The details of encounter were told to me by my father, who is now deceased, and I&apos;m sure he would have wanted it to be reported to nuforc.My dad had a house a few miles east of Eureka, CA in the little village of Kneeland. Kneeland is up on the mountain overlooking Eureka and Humboldt Bay, and is where the local radio and TV stations have their transmitting towers. It was some time in the late 1960&rsquo;s and my dad was out on the deck he had built onto the back of his house, that overlooked the canyon that is the Jacoby Creek drainage.On this particular day the weather was nice and he was admiring the great view, when he spotted an object that appeared to be hovering over the canyon and moving sideways, back and forth. Seeing as he had a telescope on a tripod sitting near him on the deck, he decided to grab it and get a closer look.What had appeared to be a cylindrical or cigar shaped object moving back and forth, was actually more of a disc shaped object, silvery or grayish in color, that was flying in a circular pattern when spotted through the telescope.He watched it circling for about another minute, give or take, when suddenly it took off at an angle, upward and out of sight at a very fast rate of speed, and disappeared into the clouds. No sounds were heard at any time during encounter that could be attributed to the object.He never saw the object again but he told me that there had been at least a couple other people who reported seeing the object &ndash; reported to who I&rsquo;m not sure &ndash; perhaps the local newspaper?

Story:  Upon arriving home from work one day in June of 2003 at 6:15 pm or so, our biggest cat (Midnight) was wanting out and was standing by the back door.  I opened the door . . . my next recollection was of looking up and seeing a rectangle dark space with three pipes attached beside it that were approximately three feet long and reattaching to an object, and I thought; what the heck! My field of vision expanded and I saw a ship hovering above my back patio just missing the top of our mimosa tree in the back yard.  The object was approximately 30 feet by 30 feet but was not a silver disk, the front (that was the side that was forward when object moved to the west, then zoomed off, I assume it was the front) was over the covered patio to the west of the open patio 5 feet and covered the length of the open patio plus 5 feet or so (just measured area with tape measure 30ft x 30ft).  This object had attachments, plates and bolt, and there were antennas sticking forward in the front.As I stood there I heard a low hum, almost too low to hear, resonated from the object and it started to move slowly to the west, I walked east into the back yard to get a better look.

Evening dark sky partly cloudy. One witness was at his work walking his normal route. As he walked outside of the building he was in. He looked around at his surroundings and a very bright red light in the sky caught his attention. He looked to the south eastern sky and saw a group of red lights. They were blinking or turning on and off. It seemed to be in a pattern then turned randomly and one small white light in the middle of them all on for the duration of the sighting. It was slow moving to the north west from the south west. The witness looked at the lights and could not make of it any conventionally known craft other than experimental. The planes that usually fly by have red, white and green lights that are flashing or blinking in a sequence. These did not match of those seen normally. And military aircraft run infrared or red and green lights. At about 21:09, the witness took some video and pictures with his cell phone but are useless due to th! e poor technology in cell phone cameras. The red lights were traveling north west to the San Gabriel Mountains near Azusa, CA when it makes an abrupt turn north. And goes north over the mountains and seems to be exactly leveled with the peaks of the mountains which are around 6,000 ft. And was not seen again at about 21:11 hours.No body or fuselage could be clearly seen with the red lights. The red lights all seemed to be attached to something other than being in formation separately. One white light in the middle of the other lights that seem to be on at all times but very dim. The red lights seen were 2-3 red lights at front of the group of lights, 2-3 on the sides of it and 2-3 at the rear. The witness thinks the object was a triangle shape due to the position of the lights. The altitude would be an approximate of 7-15,000 ft. No sound was herd from the lights. Nothing else unusual was seen that night.The witness is has seen many commercial aircraft in the area before and is knows what to look for in normal characteristics.

I could not pinpoint the direction of flashes. At first I thought it may be lightening, but I had my moonroof open and I noticed that the cloud cover was broken and scattered at the time and there were no thunderstorms in the area. I thought this was odd, but I quickly disregarded it.The traffic flow on the interstate began banking to the right and heading in a west bound direction. After about 1.5 miles of going westbound, I noticed what appeared to be a commercial jet making a landing approach from over the bay waters, with landing lights. It made its approach over the shoreline in the general area of Bayshore and Hyde Park.  However, I then noticed that it seemed to be taking a long time for this jet to make its approach. I then slowed down and the lights seemed to be at a standstill and hovering  just short of the opposite lanes of the interstate expressway at about 300-feet in altitude and a quarter mile downrange from me. At about this time I then realized that what appeared to be landing lights took on a  rapid &ldquo;twinkling&rdquo; appearance as I closed distance on it. I then reduced my speed even more to get a better look and as I did, it went from a hovering standstill and then quickly &ldquo;scooted&rdquo; across all 8 lanes of I-275 in a matter of just a few seco! nds. As the object crossed over the interstate directly in front of me and all oncoming traffic, I then noticed that the entire middle of the object from end to end was illuminated in what seemed to be a grid of yellow, green and blue lights in a rotating pattern.  At this point, I thought It might be a blimp, but as I drove past it, to my dismay, I could clearly see that the lights were rotating around the circumference of a circle. There was no noise or any other anomalies.After it quickly &ldquo;scooted&rdquo; across the interstate it then stopped and hovered over an older and darker section of the city with few street lamps and when it did, the colors became very vivid and seemed to pop out visually and become brighter as they rotated rapidly around its circumference. I also noticed that rotational speed of the lights seemed to have varied becoming faster after it passed over my direction on the interstate.  As the object hovered in darkness, it then became apparent to me that this thing was big. I cannot even estimate a size in feet, but visually, It was the size of a nickel held at arms length in your hand.  As I was attempting to make a phone call to my spouse to tell her about what I saw (She has also seen lights of this description in the past), I looked over twice to see if it was still there and it did not move after it crossed the interstate.  Based on the rotation of vivid multicolored lights around its circumference and its ability hover, then! quickly pick up speed and have no noise, I am confident that this was not a regular aircraft.  I am at a loss to figure what it was and I am not sure if the flashes of light I had seen a couple of minutes earlier were linked to what I saw.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

For those that have seen something spectacular, like what I&apos;m about to describe, it can be a particularly tedious burden.  Even your best friends and family that you trust with your life may struggle to comprehend and accept it.My Dad and I were standing by a lake behind our apartment in the suburbs of Columbus, Ohio.  I was about 25.  My Dad would have been about 48.  It was late, very late.  Clear night.  Dark.  But, even though it was about 2-3AM and dark, there&apos;s a glow from all the lights in the area, which almost makes the dark night a little luminescent...  it&apos;s a little easier to make out stuff against it&apos;s background.  Not as if what we were about to see was difficult to see.This wasn&apos;t just a distant group of lights.  This wasn&apos;t one of those sightings that could have been something else.  This was an extremely close-up, almost to the point of being scary sighting.It started as I was looking up at the beautiful night.  I said in total panic/excitement as it approached, &quot;DO YOU SEE THAT, DAD...  TELL ME YOU SEE THAT...&quot;! It was coming across the sky at a fairly slow rate of speed....  maybe about the same rate as a car on a backroad....  about 40mph.  Seemed slower, but I&apos;m guessing that 40 mph looks slower at about 1,500-2000ft.  The excitement was indescribable.  As it flew from the left(going west) it nearly crossed rt above us.  You could easily see the structure of the craft.  It was like a dark black against the lit up gray nt.  It was a perfect triangle with slightly rounders corners.  Just inside the outer rim in each corner, fitting perfectly, there were perfect circle lights.  Subtle lights as in an extremely soft white light bulb.  As it got closer the lights appeared to have movement, possibly circular, almost gasious in appearance.  There was NO sound as this object came to a halt nearly right above us.  Sat hovering still for about 20 seconds, pivoted on an axis about 90-100 degrees, and then flew away in a fashion that is very hard to describe and accept. After pivoting it sta! rted to move south at the earlier slow rate of speed, only this time, within seconds, it accelerated at an astronomical rate.  Going from right over our heads to out of sight in about 2 seconds...  the first second slowly moving... and then out of sight about 1 second later.This is when the harsh reality sets in.   We both went back inside the apartment(about 60yards away), and pondered what we should do.  Our hearts were still racing.  SHould we call the cops? No Way.  The Paper? No.  It didn&apos;t take long for us to realize that our sighting, as clearly defined and unquestionable as it was to us, would sound crazy.  I think i remembered reading something in the paper, maybe the day after, that talked about multiple sightings of a simliar craft around Bellfountaine, Ohio.This sighting was something that Dad and I both took extremely serious for a long time.  But, after years of realizing that our little secret was actually better kept that way, it still haunts us in such a profound way that it has literally changed both of our views of religion and science.  What we saw WAS NOT human.  It was NOT built by humans.  It was NOT being flown by humans.  Could NOT have been flown by humans.  Could NOT have been built by humans.  It was unquestionably a craft from another world.  This is information that we have shared less and less as time has passed since the event.   It has changed our very lives, but it&apos;s not something that we bring up very often.  I think we both regret not being able to talk about it more.   We both regret that more people didn&apos;t see what we saw.  I guess for some people there&apos;s sightings that could have been something else.  This sighting was nothing else.  It was exactly what we thought it was.  It will always be.  I should ! feel very priviledged.  Not many people see something like this that is so clear and undeniable.  So unlike how the event comes off when it&apos;s told to anyone else.  Everyone else wants to explain away what we saw - if only they had been there to see there was no explaining away this &apos;ifo&apos;.  That&apos;s the way i refer to it...   because I have identified it as something not of this world.My Dad was a minister of 30 years.  After the event, he stopped preaching and basically dropped religion altogether.  The event had a similiar effect on me as far as religion.  I just want to yell at the skeptics, but you can&apos;t.  If I had a clear tape of the event, and took it to the media, it would probably get dismissed away as &apos;such a great sighting that it couldn&apos;t be real&apos;.  And that&apos;s the sad reality of things when it comes to ufo sightings.  The media and the government have made it so taboo.  It&apos;s crazy.

At the beginning and end of the sighting may have been about 45 degrees.The sighting lasted about 45 seconds.It did not leave a visible trail.The Hays County Sheriff, Austin American Statesman, and KVUE TV said they have had no other reports of this incident.", "Glowing fireball type orb with a tail of some sort, with strange movements, and then unimaginable speed to disapear.My dad was driving in our truck and I was in the passanger seat.  We were stopped at a left turn signal on Indian River Rd.  While we were waiting for the light to change out of the corner of my eye I saw a bright circular object, at first i thought it was the full moon, but it was not the moon.  I looked at the object and I was glowing bright white to orange to redish colors, almost as if it was on fire.  There was also a tail somewhat like a comet&apos;s tail coming of of the back of it.  The way this object moved though could not have been a comet, or a rocket.  My dad was watching it as well once I pointed it out to him.  He is a high level navy Senior Cheif and now works in a control tower for a nearby base.  The object sometimes just floated, there seemed to be no sound whatsoever, and then it would make complex movements left to right, diagnoly, straight down, up, any way it wanted.  This lasted about 2 minutes.I looked at the car in front of us and noticed the couple in the car were also pointing to the object in the sky.  Soon after the object made some more maneuvers.  Then as if having the ability to accelerate to what I believe to be the speed of light, the orb, craft, object whatever it may have been.  Shot off at an amazing speed and in a matter of 1-2 seconds completely disapeared.This image has stuck in my head ever since and I dont think I will ever get an explanation for what we saw that night.  My father contacted Langley to see if any launches were scheduled for that day and there was nothing.My father works with many top officials now that he is retired and now a civilian working on base in the control tower.

The skys were clear, both mornings, I saw what looked like a star, except it was moving very fast.  I watched it go from north to south over the mountains, as i watched it ,i saw another one coming from the south heading to the north.  They passed each other and i watched them till they were out of my sight. As I pondered over what i just saw and was trying to explain it away in my mind, I saw another,now my mind is really racing. I watched it till  it was gone. Then another,going north. This time I said in my mind if this is really happening then make that moving star go faster.  That, whatever it was, shot off and was gone in a second. scared the crap out of me and i went in side The next morning i went out hesitantly, and saw the same, moving stars. I had this feeling that the star new that i was watching it, and i swear that i saw this star move up and down. I did not believe my own eyes so i thought in my mind to move in a circle and it did. Right away too.  Still, i am not convinced on what  was happening. I thought  show me more  prove to me this is happening. I saw 2, what looked like shooting stars in about 1 minute.

I live in a semi rural, wooded, small town 40 miles to the south west of stockholm, Sweden.  I was out cross country skiing alone in the wooded countryside around the town in the proximity of nearby houses and a golf course.  It was pitch black but a very clear night.  Stars were clearly visible.On coming out of the woods to the open golf course a light in the sky caught my eye approximately 300/4000 metres in front of me.  It immediately struck me as unusual and I stopped skiing wondering what it could be.  The light was well above tree level but did not appear exceedlingly high in the sky.  It was about the size of a very large light bulb (although it may have been larger had it in fact been higher in the sky-it was this which that was difficult to determine-height and size).  Colour-orange with a green haze around it.  It made no perceptable sound what so ever.  It moved slowly overhead above me and proceeded on in the opposite ditection.  The whole time the speed seemed absolutely constant, i.e. slow.  I watched the light move over me and off in the other direction.  On looking back to where I had first seen the light an identical light proceeded in an identical fashion on the same trajectory, overhead above me and off.  I wathced the two lights which appeared ! to climb into the sky until they were no longer visible.

It was  at a slow pace and as soon as it got about 20 feet into the air it stopped in mid air and hovered in place with the beam still on for about 45 seconds and then it turned off its beam and started to come toward us.  As it passed over us it was only about 10-15 feet above us.  As it was paasing above us it turned a set of lights that was around the edges.  On the edges it had lights. They would go in sequence and flash red, blue, green.  While it was passing us it had a low humming sound. It passed slowly by and then! it shot off and was gone.

I continued to watch it, thinking, &ldquo;Wow, what a bright light.&rdquo;  I really was brighter than any plane light I have ever seen.  It was only one color (a yellowish white, not a bluish white).  It was then I thought why is there no flashing?   The light stayed solid the whole time.Then as I kept watching, I waited to see if it would change or get closer or keep going to the side so I could see what sort of plane it was.  But, I was amazed to notice that it never moved.That really startled me, so I really now strained to keep an eye on it for about 30 more seconds&hellip;no movement.

I have seen at times two lights, seemingly independent of each other, drift up and down over the ridge line.  Sometimes as I turned the corner and my vehicle was pointing directly towards the light(s) they would either slowly descend behind the mountain or gradually fade out.  Other times the light(s) would just sit there and remain until I reached the farmhouse.

The sun had set and the sky was mostly dark now. I was smoking a cig, and watching the normal path of air traffic that flows into Seatac airport.  I just happened to be looking at a patch of ski to my south, when I noticed a flying V- shaped bommerrang craft flying lower than normal air traffic, about 1500 ft, traveling directly east at a high rate of speed.  It was completely dark..no aircraft lights at all and completely silent.  If, I held out my arm, it would take my entire hand to fully block the object. It blended in perfectly to the night sky.  It was more like watching an invisible shape blocking the sky behind it as it moved.  I watched the object travel from west to east until it disappeared in the distace and darkness (about 15 seconds).

One was leading and the other was always trying to catch up!,,the leader was also waiting for the other now &amp; then.They both passed me about half a mile away at still roughly 100 feet high, thats when i seen two more!and it got a lot more interesting!!.They followed more or less the same flight pattern , i couldnt work out what they were and i was puzzled because they were silent i thought they may be hot air balloons but it was a crystal clear night with tons of stars out and perfectly calm,not even a whisper of wind!.Then to my surprise the leader of this second pair deviated and travelled straight toward me,as god is my witness ive never seen anything like this in my life on tv or in the flesh!,,it was amazing!!!, it stayed at roughly the same height and stopped moving and just hovered in front of me but it was really close!,id say about 60 feet away horizontally. I witnessed in crisp detail what this thing looked like even at night!,ive got a good sense of perspective and id say it was sixty to eighty feet in circumference completely round and covered in what looked like huge bunsen ! burners and individually these were changing fast from low to high flame,i realised this was what all the flickering was at a distance!. I could see the object behind the flames was dark in colour maybe grey or black, i was amazed to see these jets so big and very close yet completely silent!!.Then after hovering there for about 40 seconds it began to make its way back to the other one and they both travelled the same path as the first two till they all came together roughly two to three miles from where i was standing.Thats when another puzzling thing happened, one of them moved away a bit from the rest then stopped and in about five seconds just faded out, then one by one each of the remaining went to the same spot as the first and disappeared the same.Id consider myself an excellent witness &amp; will never forget that night!,hope someone out there witnessed as much as i did as it would be great to get the sighting verified as a genuine ufo sighting.", "Amber lights appearing in the skies over Wendell, ID 8:00PM 02/02/2010My friends and I were heading west on interstate 84 when we observed a string of round amber lights, one appearing after another at a diagonal upward angle to the last, just ahead of us seeming to be oriented somewhere over the farmland between Wendell and the Bob Barton road. We decided to try and get closer for a better look but since it was dark our phone cameras were insufficient for pictures. We witnessed the object(s) a few more times, each time rerouting our course adjusting for the change in position of the object. Finally we gave up the chase after seeing no other signs of the object for over ten minutes. Also, its important to note that as one light would go out another would appear. Sometimes the string would get to be three or four lights in a diagonal upward row. I have witnessed this before, but my last encounter I owned a radar detector. Each time that the lights would appear, my radar detector would go off as if someone had just shot me with a radar gun. Full blast.

When I returned into the kitchen, I heard the motor from the spa in my backyard turn on.  It does this automatically and I am used to this.  The inside of the house was quiet;  I did not have any appliances on.  The time was around 7:15 pm.Immediately after noticing the spa turn on, I heard a louder, unrecognizable noise that seemed to drown out the otherwise noisy spa motor.  I was curious and mildly alarmed by the unfamiliar noise.  Puzzled after a few seconds and the noise still continuing, I stopped what I was doing (replacing the liner on the kitchen trash can) and opened the patio door a few inches and paused.  I confirmed the noise was from outside.  I quickly stepped outside, and when I was about four-five feet from the house, looking in the direction of the noise, I saw an unidentified object flying low in the sky, above the row of house on my side of the street, moving above the homes along Crisp Avenue, then Klein Avenue toward Flagship.I am familiar with how helicopters sound as I used to have a neighbor who owned one and flew it regularly from his home across the street from me.  I was also an EMT and know the sound of helicopters up close as I have loaded patients onto medevac copters.    This object did not sound like a helicopter.  It was too slow to be a plane.  It was hard to determine its shape but it appeared to have at least four lights at opposite points, at/near the craft&rsquo;s outer perimeter.  The shape of the craft had a ring or circular silhouette.

Hoping to see it and photograph it, I ran downstairs with my iphone, out the front door and out onto the street.  I did not see it, nor could I detect the sound anymore.  I ran back inside and upstairs again, this time to retrieve my wallet.  I jumped into my car and started driving slowly on the streets of Mare Island with the top of my convertible down.

My spouse is a software analyst, and I am a homemaker. We had just arrived that afternoon with plans to stay for the weekend.We were admiring all the stars that appeared in the sky that night, when suddenly to our left a bright red light caught our attention. The light was so large we were asking each other &quot;What is that!?&quot; for we both knew there was no power lines, storm towers, or any form of electricity of that kind for at least 40 miles, and the light was coming from a distance of about 10 miles. The light blinked twice holding the large red illumination for about 3 full seconds each. My spouse said,&quot; It cant be an airplane&quot;. I replied, &quot;I know, look how huge it is&quot;.The red light then blinked fast about 3 times before it went out. To the right and left of the bright red light were two bright white lights (one on each side, about as bright as the brightest stars). The lights seemed to be about 10 feet apart; which may have seemed close, but they were such a great distance away, the distance could have been greater. I actually thought they were stars until I noticed them starting to blink rapidly right after the red light went out. The two lights were blinking alternately and then simultaneously before they both began to move in simultaneous motion as if they were connected. (One could form a straight line between the lights to measure how precise the movement was). The lights, moving as if one object, proceeded to what is my left, in the sky, angled itself so that the lights still seem to be connected then the lights faded quickly as if it were just flying into the distant sky at an extremely fast pace.", "Very Shiny and Reflective Saucer seen on the South side of Craig, Colorado Summer of 1995  I was unaware there was a site such as this to post your experiences.  My buddy and I had agreed not to report what we seen for fear that we would be laughed at.My parents live on the west side of Craig, Colorado, and I left there to pick my buddy up at his place which was a townhouse also on the west side of Craig.  The weather was a clear blue sky without any clouds so to speak.

As we were driving I noticed a guy walking along the highway that was looking in the direction of the object also.  I said lets get closer to it and we drove east and turned south on to Ranney Street.  We pulled up underneath the craft around the area of 1st Street.  I estimated it to be about 100-150 feet across and it looked like the common description of a saucer.  It had an eleva! ted center area and was disc shaped and was made of a very reflective and highly shiny metal.  I could see the sun reflecting on the side of it extremely bright!  I collaborated with my buddy the whole time to confirm what I was seeing.  At a distance it looked like the object was sitting in space on an exact point without moving at all.  When we got closer I could tell the object was rotating about a central axis like a top at an extreme speed.  It was holding exact position without a bobble and didn&apos;t make a sound.  We sat there and looked at it in awe when it started rotating faster and faster!  I said it&apos;s speeding up on its rotation right?  My buddy said yes it is.  Then it began to change shape flattening out like a cigar with the elevated center area completely gone and then in an instant it vanished completely!  I asked my buddy am I seeing things or did it just vanish!  He exclaimed yes it vanished completely.  This first time seeing the object I guessed it lasted ! about 12 minutes.  I looked further south and said there it is! again! We sped south to the intersection that heads east to the golf course and airport.  It was hovering like before and we sat there and looked at it again and like before it changed shape and vanished!  This time the viewing was for about 5 minutes.  Then we seen it again east of the airport so we headed east and as we got up on it began to change shape once again like before and in an instant it was gone.  It never reappeared after this time.  The whole duration of us watching the object was probably around 20 minutes.  We honestly couldn&apos;t believe what we just saw.  If I was to see a UFO I always thought it would be a brief passing in the night.  I&apos;ll never forget this that&apos;s for sure.

Witness stated that as they drove southbound (actually SE toward Atlanta) he observed a steady circular glowing light moving E to W (left to right) about 45 degrees above the horizon. The course seemed to be more or less straight and horizontal, but as it approached the extreme right of his field of view (about 2/3s of the way through the duration) it seemed to gradually arc slightly downward.THE DURATION OF THE OBSERVATION WAS ABOUT 4&frac12; TO 5 MINUTES, THE LIGHT DID NOT APPEAR TO BE MOVING AT THE SPEED OF THE MANY REPORTED FIREBALL METEORS.The traffic began to slow down and backup as they watched, as if other drivers were also observing this event. Witness thought that he lost sight either by it going into the distance or perhaps some obstruction eventually blocking the view. During further discussion, witness stated that he did not notice any burning-like effect, no glowing debris breaking away, no smoke or luminescent trail or terminal burst. It just appeared circular, steady, glowing bright blue-green, no fuselage-like structure observed. No electromagnetic or physical effects were noticed. Also observed was a large aircraft, perhaps large airliner size, moving rather fast in the distance, but unknown if related to the original observation. Witness stated the light&apos;s size was about that of three (3) lunar masses, but he could not specifically equate to the lunar diameters or mass. He estimated about the size of a quarter held out at arms length which is about three lunar diameters = about 1 1/2 degrees.GPS Coordinates for I-75SB @ I-575 Interchange: 33&deg;59&apos;53N and 84&deg;33&apos;39W.A check of the data base at the &apos;Center for Orbital and Reentry Debris Studies&apos; revealed no scheduled man-made reentries for the time period of the event described herein.

As indicated in the NASA mission profile below........&quot;STPSAT-1 will track the &apos;CARE&apos; dust cloud for DAYS or even MONTHS.......first space viewing of an artificial noctilucent cloud.......visible ONLY when illuminated by sunlight from below the horizon while the earth&apos;s surface is in darkness......&quot;  --------------------------------------------------------  Description of mission from the NASA web site, Wallops Flight Facility;  &quot;Night Time Artificial Cloud Study Using NASA Sounding Rocket09.19.09 A NASA Black Brant XII rocket launches carrying the CARE experiment Credit: NASA View Larger Image A rocket experiment that may shed light on the highest clouds in the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere was conducted from NASA&apos;s Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia on September 19, 2009. The experiment was launched on a NASA Black Brant XII Sounding Rocket.The Charged Aerosol Release Experiment (CARE) was conducted by the Naval Research Laboratory and the Department of Defense Space Test Program using a NASA four-stage Black Brant XII suborbital sounding rocket. Using ground based instruments and the STP/NRL STPSat-1 spacecraft, scientists will study an artificial noctilucent cloud formed by the exhaust particles of the rocket&rsquo;s fourth stage at about 173 miles altitude.Ground based cameras and radars were based at various observation stations along the Atlantic coast and in Bermuda. Because of the optical observations, the launch required clear skies not only at Wallops but also at the multiple observation stations.The Spatial Heterodyne IMager for MEsospheric Radicals instrument on the STPSat-1 spacecraft will track the CARE dust cloud for days or even months. The SHIMMER instrument has previously viewed natural noctilucent clouds for the past two years. The CARE is the first space viewing of an artificial noctilucent cloud.Data collected during the experiment will provide insight into the formation, evolution, and properties of noctilucent clouds, which are typically observed naturally at high latitudes. In addition to the understanding of noctilucent clouds, scientists will use the experiment to validate and develop simulation models that predict the distribution of dust particles from rocket motors in the upper atmosphere.Natural noctilucent clouds, also known as polar mesospheric clouds, are found in the upper atmosphere as spectacular displays that are most easily seen just after sunset. The clouds are the highest clouds in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, located in the mesosphere around 50 miles altitude.They are normally too faint to be seen with the naked eye and are visible only when illuminated by sunlight from below the horizon while the Earth&rsquo;s surface is in darkness.A team from government agencies and universities, led by the Naval Research Laboratory, is conducting the experiment. In addition to the Naval Research Laboratory, participants include the DoD STP, NASA, University of Michigan, Air Force Research Laboratory, Clemson University, Stanford University, University of Colorado, Penn State University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology/Haystack Observatory&quot;.End NASA mission description.9Dec09, this investigator spoke with Dr. Paul A. Bernhardt of the Navy Research Laboratory, Plasma Physics Division, Washington D.C., 202-767-0196, bern@ppd.nrl.navy.mil  Dr. Bernhardt was the chief scientist and supervisor for the NASA &apos;CARE&apos; rocket launch from Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia on 19Sept09.This event was described to him, and he was asked if the resulting experimental noctilucent cloud could have drifted near or over Georgia in the days after the launch and experiment. He responded that things at that 100+ kilometer altitude (ionosphere) were very different and winds below would not influence the cloud. However he stated that it is feasible that the cloud, or a part thereof, might have drifted over Georgia or vicinity, but would definitely need to be illuminated by sunlight (as stated in the mission abstract) to be visible to the human eye. When asked, he replied that the color of the cloud at the time of the experiment, immediately following the launch, was blue. During additional comments, he stated that another type of experiment connected to research at Clemson involved a release of TMA or trimethyl aluminum. TMA chemically reacts with oxygen thereby creating a bluish effect or cloud that is self-luminous.A check of the various science departments at Clemson indicated that the TMA launchs were from several years ago and no recent activity was noted.The witness in this case stated that their observation occurred about mid-night on 24Sept09. This FI is of the opinion that the sun, being almost directly on the opposite side of the earth, would not provide any light in the ionosphere over or near Georgia to illuminate a cloud such as that created in the &apos;CARE&apos; experiment. Orbital satellites are not visible after about 10-11PM and until about 5-6AM, thus the lower altitude of any said cloud would likewise be in the earth&apos;s shadow.General information-only descriptions of this event/time/date were forwarded to Peter Davenport at NUFORC and the independent TUFORC (Truckers UFO Reporting Center)in an effort to locate any potential motorists/witnesses in the event vicinity on 24Sept09.Potential witnesses reading this request at NUFORC and TUFORC will hopefully contact MUFON of Georgia.From the NUFORC data base:  Occurred : 9/24/2009 00:00 (Entered as : 09242009 0:00) Reported: 11/24/2009 11:02:55 PM 23:02 Posted: 12/12/2009 Location: Marietta/Kennesaw, GA Shape: Other Duration:5 minutes MUFON of Georgia is, as of 24Nov09, investigating CMS report #20271 which occurred on 24Sept09 at about 12:00 midnight.Location of witnesses: I-75 southbound at its intersection with I-575 in Cobb County Georgia (which is just a few miles north of Kennesaw and Marietta Georgia). This Interstate intersection is also about 20 miles NW of Atlanta.A dramatic observation took place at this time and date from the described location. MUFON of Georgia is seeking additional witnesses.If you observed any unusual aerial activity on that occasion, please contact Tom Sheets, State Director-MUFON of Georgia at ; After 1Jan10, contact Ralph Howard .Please note that like NUFORC, MUFON will keep all witnesses anonymous.NOTE: MUFONGA will post a full and complete report here at NUFORC as soon as this MUFON investigation is completed.Tom Sheets, SD MUFONGA  --------------------------------------------------------  During the week of Christmas, this writer was back in touch with the witness to remind of the importance of interviewing the two co-witnesses (family members) and obtaining the sketch of how the event appeared through the vehicle windshield.In a 23Dec response, the witness advised that things had not been going well, citing a family death, a serious illness, as well as his aformentioned extreme financial distress. He did state he would arrange all of this as things were resolved. Nothing more has been forthcoming as of 22Jan10. As cited in the below email to the PAO of the nearby Dobbins Air Reserve Base, the PAO had failed to respond to the email request, as well as several phone messages left for him during November and December. One message was also left in the Operations Center of the 94th Airlift Squadron, the major unit utilizing this base. In mid-January, this writer emailed the PAO again explaining all that was needed was some information regarding the night of the event.....anything that the squadron may have been doing that might have been observed by the witness and mistaken for an aerial phenomenon. Furthermore that if this could be done by a simple phone call, it would prevent the red-tape of my filing under the FOIA. On 19Jan10, this writer received a phone call from a XXX XXXXXXXX who stated he was the PAO. He was immediately rude in tone, condescending in nature and openly hostile to the purpose of MUFON. He stated that the reason I had not heard anything from them was that they ign! ored anything to do with &apos;UFOs&apos;, &apos;space&apos; and such things. Furthermore, when such things came in they just put them aside and went on to something else or words to that effect. This writer then gave him a short &apos;MUFON 101&apos; explanation, concluding that there were members within our organization that militarily far out ranked him and his associates and that our goals and objectives were based in science and so forth. Before concluding, he indicated that nothing had occurred that would have caused such aerial activity as observed by the witness, but his statement was couched in terms that clearly indicated he would NOT have told us even if something HAD occurred that could be mistaken for an aerial phenomenon. This PAO was directly opposite in attitude when compared to the last such request from this investigator which went through LtCol. XXXXXXXXX of the Georgia Air National Guard......... LtCol. XXXXXXXXX being a true gentleman and professional, and very helpful. At this point, 22Jan10, the aerial event described herein exists only through the claims of the primary witness. The data in this report was discussed with him in several long phone conversations and emails. He appeared rational and cooperative throughout and had initially told this writer that his situation at home was degenerating as the holidays approached and was due to the economy, his frustrating search for a better job and various health matters within the family. At such point in an investigation, this writer has an expectation of having successfully interviewed corroborating witnesses and receiving a witness sketch.This has not been accomplished due to the reasons explained. In classifying this case, the probable cause used to do so is WEAK in this investigators opinion, but the witness will be given the benefit of a doubt in anticipation of him providing the needed information as his situation improves i.e. the case being re-opened at that time in hopes that the corroborating witnesses will have come forward. This case is classified as Unknown-Other, but subject to being re-opened when the additional data is received.

Sheets of Fayetteville Georgia here, State Director for MUFON of Georgia (Georgia Division of the Mutual UFO Network....the largest and oldest international scientific group researching aerial phenomenon). We are currently looking into an event that occurred on 24Sept09 at about 12:00 Midnight. This occurrence was observed by multiple witnesses that were traveling southbound on I-75 at it&apos;s juncture with I-575 in Cobb County, putting their position a few (+) miles north of the base at appx. 33&deg;59&apos;53N and 84&deg;33&apos;39W, looking generally SSE or SE. A brilliant blue-green round light appearing to be the mass of 3 lunar diameters was observed moving from E to W about 45&deg; above the horizon. This light did not move at the speed of the commonly observed fireball meteors, bolide meteors, or even returning space debris. It was under observation for about 5 minutes (a long time as these things go) as the vehicles drove south on I-75. The light seeming to move E to W (left to right) at a more or less horizontal angle (perhaps the reported movement of the light may have been an illusion due to the forward motion of the Interstate traffic). The traffic began to slow down and back up due to the dramatic nature of this observation. We are currently scrutinizing the experimental artificial noctilucent cloud that was created by NASA on 19Sept09 after the Black Brant XII launch from Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. NASA has advised that this cloud may be visible after dark for weeks or months when the sun is illuminating it due to! the extremely high altitude. It is possible that this extremely high altitude cloud could have drifted over Georgia in the days after the launch and thus was illuminated after dark by the sun hitting it from the daylight side of the earth. That is one possibility we must check. Anyhow, I wanted to ask if you could advise us if the 94th Squadron, Lockheed, or any other entity from the base might have been conducting training, flight operations, or tests of any sort that might have been responsible for what was observed. If so, we don&apos;t necessarily need to know the exact type of operation if it might be classified or confidential and so forth. We&apos;re just in the process of our elimination procedure common to all of our investigations. About 95+% of everything reported to us is eventually proved to be prosaic, mundane everyday occurrences, natural or misunderstood man-made etc. However, the remaining 5 or so percent does often get classified as unknown. As well, did your office receive any calls from the public on or about 24-25Sept09 regarding observation this event?  Any help you can provide will be much appreciated. (NOTE: I left a message on your office recorder on 25Nov09 for a call back).

We parked on one of the cemetery roads and my boyfriend says &ldquo;look at those helicopters&rdquo;  We got out of the car to see what we thought were five helicopters flying up and at an angle in the sky.  Almost at the same time we realized they all looked like they were on fire.  I pulled out my camera and video taped it immediately.  When we cam home I googled what UFO sightings look like because we weren&rsquo;t sure.  The first video we pulled up was the same exact thing we had seen but it was in Scotland two nights prior.

My sister has a trailer for camping and when we go to visit, the trailer parked beside the house, becomes our bedroom.We went to bed and after a while I began having some sinus problems and got up to work on the problem. I decided it was time for some fresh air and stepped outside and was soon joined by my wife checking to see if I was ok. From the front door of the trailer we could see some stars but decided to move to the west end of the trailer where the view was better.Clear starry night, some light pollution since we were in a city, but because it was 1:30am all was quiet and the stars were plentiful. We saw an airplane off in the distance traveling northwest with the navigational strobe lights flashing and it soon ranged out of sight.Then we saw another airplane approaching from the south with headlights on as planes do for night landings, and the Portland airport was about 16 miles due north. At first I had a feeling that the airplane was not quite &quot;right&quot; but did not think too much about it. As we watched it approach closer to us from the south, I thought &quot;those landing lights are really bright.&quot; Indeed, single lights could not be seen but the whole front of the plane facing us was lit up with very intense beams. As the plane moved through the sky it was eclipsing stars--as it came between us and a star the star of course would vanish, it then reappeared as the plane moved on.Then it happened. The very bright lights of the plane, in two second steps, began fading. Fade, fade, fade...step at a time until no lights were on.  All this while, and this was most interesting, the plane slowed to a stop.  When we first saw it the plane was at about a 15&ordm; angle above level and now it was nearly 60&ordm; above level and very close.  I estimated it was a thick tapezoid hovering less than 4 miles away over the Willamette River.  Even though the bright lights were out, a faded outline could be seen for more than a minute.  Once the headlights were completely out, we saw that there were no navigation lights flashing.  The plane had mostly vanished from the sky, at least no bright lights to say it was there.  Also, no stars were being eclipsed in any direction from where it stopped and turned off the lights.  About a minute after the lights were completely out, there was a quick small flash, smaller than the outline area of the plane, and then it actually vanished.  Actually vanished because the starlight it blocked now shown through and no star eclipses were in any direction from that point.  If my guess on distance is accurate, then the craft would have been at least 200 feet across. Plane? I don&apos;t think so.", "quiet glowing spherical light floated close then floated awayTonight, March 26th, I was walking my dog and looked up in the sky to see an orange glowing light that appeared to be a short BEAM of spherical light.

It was about 100 feet up from where we were standing, and made absolutely no noise.  It had a tail of light. It streaked down towards the city, moving much too fast to be some sort of human aircraft, and way too low, plus you would be able to hear the engine from that distance.  We only saw it for about 30 seconds before it streaked away.  It seemed to be able to stop very quickly and hover directly before hitting the ground, but didn&apos;t slow down, for it disappeared quickly.  It seemed to be lit up from the inside, glowing yellow.", "Venus-sized blob of light transverses early morning skyAt about 5:00 AM I was walking north when I noticed a bright blob of light about the size of Venus in opposition transversing the sky west to east. It was at about a 70 degree angle at about 11 o&apos;clock or slightly to the left. I was up on a hill overlooking a small flood plain and watched it until it crossed over the horizon passing through the first hint of dawn.I would have reported this sooner but mistakenly thought that I had found an explanation. Since it went on a straight path and did none of the spectacular maneuvers UFOs are famous for I thought it might be an unusually bright satellite. Research showed that a certain kind could be as bright as Venus and decided that that was the most likely explanation. I have, however, since read that this type, the name of which presently escapes me, will only briefly appear that large and that it will quickly resume appearing the size of a normal satellite once it flashes. Since this one retained is brightness and size for the duration I think I may well have spotted a genuine UFO.((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

(about 3 inches long, measuring with my thumb and first finger). I went outside to look at them closer and they just hung there.  I thought they were going to make letters so I ran in to get my camera and ran back outside.  They had moved to the North about the same distance in the sky, one then started to move from vertical to horizontal, to the left, very quickly.  Then it disappeared directly to the North.  I was only able to snap 2 shots and only captured the image in one photo.  The photographic image shows an additional circular globe.  All the images then just disappeared.", "thought it was space shuttle lift offHave not spoke about it since because when I first saw it with my friend at the time , &quot;which since we have not spoken or seen each other&quot;, I told a few people and they pretty much thought I was crazy. But how could two people see the same thing not once but twice in one week.  Once with my friend and the other with my then girlfirend who thought I was crazy until she saw it her self.Me and my friend were at mellaluca lakes in port st lucie fl. at around 10:30 pm we looked toward our left ,(toward kennedy space center just north of st lucie) and we noticed something we thought was the shuttle lifting off at night, because of the orange glow coming from underneath as if it were a lift off. The strange thing is that it was acending very slow and straight up not at an angle like the shuttle does and as sure as I said that to my friend the light shot straigt up what looked to be at least 3 miles up in the blink of an eye I mean rediculously fast.Before I knew it the thing started coming our direction I had to be at least 5 miles away and was over the lake we were at within 2 to 3 seconds and when we saw it hover over the lake the whole sky reflected off of it ,it was about the size of a vw bettle and there were two lights on top long ones moving back and forth. It was very quiet no sound but the crickets and frogs man, dont know what it was but my bud s! tarted shaking and upon trying to start his car I asked him not to beacause I wanted to know if what we were seeing was real. Had him decribe what he was seeing and it was exactly what I was seeing so I know it was real.  I stepped out of the car and proceeded to walk toward the lake edge to get a closer look at it hovering( 50ft or so in air) as I opened the car door and stepped out it straighted it self out went side to side across whole lake which was at leat half mile wide, zig zagged about 7 time and shot straight toward palm beach county in the blink of an eye. Never believed in UFOs but have  since.  Saw it a week later after everyone said I was crazy. Standing out back my house was the second and last encounter. Looked over toward the lake ,( by this time my girl had already said she had enough and she didnt know if she believed me. About ten min later looking toward  the lake we both noticed a bright light which appeared to be a spot light on a small plane. Almost out! of my mind at this time because I thought I was going crazy f! or what me and my friend saw just days before. Anyway looked like a spot light on a small plane started to get brighter and brighter so I took my lighter and started flickering it just because I guess , but as I did it me and my girl noticed the spot light start to flicker as I did with my lighter. Kinda creepy my girl started to wonder at this time because the more I flickered my light the more the spot light did the same as it came our direction over the pine trees. As it got closer we heard what sounded like a prop plane single engine. At this time my girl pretty much called me crazy and said ,&quot;see it&apos;s just a plane man i agreed and said your right. All of a sudden the plane noise changed to a helicopter sound. My girl started to weird out about this time and wanted to go inside.I told her hell no please stay i said everyone thinks I crazy. She agreed and at this time the noise coming toward us change into distinctly what sounded like a jet engine noise,but the light coming towar! d us was moving slowly. Until right about 5 seconds later there it was no sound just quiet. No more plane sound no more helicopter sound no more jet sound just hovering over a 40ft pine in my back yard. It sat at an angle with this weird  feeling we were being watched. My girl started crying and I asked her what do you see? Her reply,&quot; I see it I beleive&quot;, and continued to cry. I told her to go in the house and get my mom and her husband and to quietly walk out the back door to see. She headed toward the house while I just looked in awe. I heard them come around the front of house instead of the back ,looked over to tell them to hurry, looked back up and saw it fade out of view in front of me and a little flickering light appeared and began moving so fast and in ways no plane we have could have moved with such precission and no sound. Unfortunately my mother and her husband did not see it as we did. I was still called a lier even after my girl told them what she had seen. N! ote we were not believers until these events occured. As for m! y friend he was the smart one he never told anyone and said he wouldnt.. We have not spoken since the incident nor have I ever seen it again.I know this is very old sighting but please tell me I am not crazy or else how could I remember it as if it were right in front of me now. This happened when I was sixteen and am now 36 . I know I saw something i could not explain.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

This was approx. 5:15 AM, when I woke up to get something to drink from my throat being too dry. This object I say was for sure not a star, it wasn&apos;t the planet Venus, and it sure wasn&apos;t swamp gas lol. I saw a spherical amberish red light in the sky. This light was stationary and extremely odd looking. It was simply said, a true &quot;fire in the sky.&quot; The light often dimmed and then would come back lit, at times, within a fraction of second, this thing would shine extremely bright. The best way I can describe it was like a superconducting light bulb that just would shutter immense light at a very short period of time. Then, there was a second &amp; third one. Fading in &amp; out.Anyway, after knowing that this was something unnatural, I ran into my bedroom and got out my 8mm camera BUT the battery was dead. So, secondly, I grabbed my digital picture camera and jolted outside. With only having limited disc space and recording time, I started filming. Let me tell you, this object was wild..I was pretty captivated by it..but that would soon change.  Here&rsquo;s a link to the short video I filmed:  http://s67.photobucket.com/albums/h313/euphoria5150/?action=view&amp;current=Dustins_UFO_video_clip.flv  After taping my short video, I watched it, instead of just one bright object, the camera was showing three of them, different colors and dimming on and off.  This blew my mind, right, so I looked back up into the sky and there was only one object. As soon as I did, something happened&hellip;something rather frightening. Just as if, this &quot;thing&apos; could sense what I was doing and where I was at, it plotted a course toward me. Within seconds, this light was getting a lot larger and it was apparent that distance was the factor. Yes, this UFO was coming directly toward me. Now, don&apos;t get me wrong, it didn&rsquo;t make any cool Arial movements or swoop down toward me. It came directly toward me like it was following some GPS flight plan. Best way I can describe it, like seeing a white light at the end of a dark tunnel...just getting larger and larger and larger. Within about eight seconds, this thing was half the size of the moon and still coming directly towards me.Once that light started coming toward me, I totally didn&apos;t feel very &apos;warm&apos; about it. I thought. After that, the object stopped in air again and remained stationary for a while. I ran inside and was peering out the window, the objects were gone.. That&apos;s the kind of fear this thing gave me. Let&apos;s just say, I didn&apos;t get any sleep last night...none at all.  I will be happy to post the video that I took before this thing started coming after me. No, I didn&apos;t take any more video after that, my shaking hands couldn&apos;t even hold up a piece of paper at that point.This was a true story, I&apos;m a Rhodes State College Graduate &amp; I have extensive technical background. I have never seen anything like this and it&apos;s I&apos;m so very passionate about.  Hope you enjoyed my experience, because I didn&rsquo;t!

I visualized in my mind my exact location.  First I began far out in space looking at the entire United States, and then I moved into Oregon, then to the Coast, then to the Bandon area.  After that I repeatedly drew my zipcode in my mind.  Then, in my mind still, I traced the roads that lead to my property.  When I had finished giving this mental beacon I watched the sky.  At approx. 6:45 pm I witnessed white lights dancing on the horizon.  Each time they made a sudden flash or sharp turn I would hold my lighter up and flash back.  Soon they were coming closer to me.  When they passed behind a cloud nearly above my head I did not see them for 10 seconds or so.  I looked back at the horizon to see if they had retreated there and when I looked back up in the sky above my head I saw a blazing orange trapezoid (sides longer than top ! and bottom) appear approx. 300 ft. up just inside the bottom of the cloud layer.  It&apos;s size was equal to a baseball at arms length.  It got very bright and slowly dissipated.  I had not been frightened when I saw them at a distance on the horizon, but once it was right above my head I became very frightened.  Just as the trapezoid vanished another light with the same color appeared in the trees on the property adjacent to ours.  I knew there were no lights conventional lights where this light had manifested.  The orange light flashed 5 or 6 times.  At this point I was too afraid to continue with the experience.  Later, I kicked myself for not investigating.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))((ADDENDUM FROM ANONYMOUS SOURCE)) This is an adjunct to my sighting report of January 21st, 2010.  As reported, I witnessed a fire orange trapezoid shape illumined in the sky approx. 300 ft. above my head and 30-40 ft. in front of me following an observation of three white lights dancing on the horizon.  Just as the trapezoid disappeared a light of the same color lit up a patch of forest on an adjacent property where I knew there should not be any source of light.  Obviously this was quite shocking for me.  The next day I walked up to the same spot I had been standing the previous night.  I was questioning my sighting and sanity because it was just too vivid and close.  It is one thing to see lights dancing around far off in the atmosphere, but it is quite another experience to have something happen directly over your head at a close distance.  So I went up there again to see if I could see anything else in the daytime.  I watched the sky where the trapezoid had appeared for five minutes or so and decided that I would go back to the house.  When my eyes retreated from the sky and came down to Earth I saw something very strange on the ground directly below the spot where I had seen the trapezoid.  I approached the strange spot on the ground.  It was the body of my dog that went missing approx. 2 months previous.  I was shaken when I put all the events of the past 24 hours together.  It is my feeling that this is not at all a case of animal mutilation, rather, it is my strong conviction that I was led to the spot for a sign of intent on behalf of whatever force was controlling the lights in the sky.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was coming back to get into the house when i saw a lot of lights, they were like in a trapezoid like formation.  I try to identify the lights but i couldnt.  When they get closer, then i didnt know if they were independent lights or parts of a huge craft.  I couldn count them but were at least 8.  They keep moving and then they just fade.

I had time to stand up and look at it, then I went out on the back porch, which is on the north side of the house, to see if I could see it anymore, but it was gone.

Tonight as I drove up to my sister&rsquo;s house which is in the exact same spot where we saw the light&rsquo;s over a year ago, they appeared in the sky again. This time the lights appeared one after another in the west mid section of the skies. The colors of the light&apos;s were yellowish to orange and very bright. As they appeared in the sky they formed a triangle shape. When the fourth light appeared, it appeared beside the triangle form then they faded out in the same spot where they stood.  They did not move like the lights that we had seen before. This took no more than one minute. Then there were again, what looked like jets, very high in altitude.

I looked almost completely vertical from my standing position and noticed a brilliant ball of light and I would say &quot;star-like&quot; in appearance racing across the sky from west to east.  It travelled at an unbelievable rate of speed. I saw it moving and I always see either planes or falling stars or just familiar objects in the sky.  I had to take a deep breath and gather my thoughts. I immediately reached for my phone to attempt to record a small portion of video.  By the time I reached down and the fraction of a second i had to take my eyes off of the object it just disappeared.  I would also like to say that the altitude of this object seemed to be in the range of deep space.  It really looked like a star to me but it never appeared to get closer to me, like a falling star.  It appeared to stay at the same elevation during the entire observation time and just zip across the sky like a vehicle under some sort of propulsion.  It really got me to think of what the object was.  I would say that it was an unidentified object in the night sky.  It was nothing I have ever seen before and I am a sky watcher, and not for UFO&apos;s just because I love nature and enjoy the sky clouds and at night stars and the moon.  It was just weird and wanted to post something to see if anyone could either explain this object or maybe someone else saw the same thing I did.

I exited at the Tarentum exit.  At the stop sign at the bottom of the ramp I looked to the right about 45 degrees.  Out of the front windshield just above the tree line I saw some whispy clouds.  They were orangish colored from the setting sun.  In front of the clouds coming over the trees heading due north was a very distinct chemtrail that was also orangish. (Sun reflection)  I have always been a sky watcher.  Especially since becoming aware of the chemtrails.  I&apos;m the type of person that notices things others wouldn&apos;t.  I don&apos;t drink or use drugs.  I consider myself a credible witness.I had to make sure I stopped because there was a cop car to my right watching the stop sign.  I noticed I was having trouble focusing on the chemtrail.  Normally they start as two trails coming from the wings and they quickly blend into one wide trail.  This one appeared to blink from one to two tightly side by side.  Everytime I blinked it was one then two tightly together.  At that time I could not see the plane making the trail which seemed odd.  I made a mental note about where is the plane.  It was time to move so I drove on making a left turn towards New Kensington.  This placed my back to the trail.Having to wait for the lights to change it took a few minutes to cross the bridge. My destination was at the end of the bridge.  I pulled in to the parking lot and headed to the back lot.  This again placed me facing the direction of the chemtrail.  I was looking to my left at a 45 degree angle.  It was still orange, thick and very defined.  Now I could see the plane.  It was sorta shaped like the U2 spy plane.  Very odd looking and black.  Normally the planes are white.Thinking back now about where I first saw the trails and their angle in the sky and now looking at them again something seems not right.  It&apos;s like they jumped over toward the east closer to my location but were still heading north.  I parked and got out.  I was watching the plane and couldn&apos;t wait for it to come toward my location.  It&apos;s present heading would have put it directly in front of me moving from left to right.  I really wanted a better look at the plane.  The trail it left was very thick and was not evaporating like a (vapor) contrail.  I knew this trail would last and I wanted to see how it spread out.  I went inside so I could unlock the door from the inside.  This took 1-2 minutes.  I came back out with great anticipation figuring the plane would be just about directly in front of my line of sight.I opened the door and stepped outside and the plane had  vanished.  The chemtrail was completely gone as was the plane.  I looked in front of the path the plane was on...nothing.  No evidence of the thick chemtrail it left behind. Everything was completely gone.  No cloudlike formations and no plane.  The plane with the speed it was traveling would have easily been somewhere in my field of vision without turning my head.  The thick chemtrail from my many previous observations would have lasted hours and spread across a wide area of sky.When I saw the trail after entering the parking lot it looked like the chemtrail started a few inches behind the plane like it may have just been switched on, again a little odd considering the time it took to cross the bridge.  I should have been able to see it stretch way out behind the plane.Remember the trail blinking and changing from one to two?  And the trail seemingly shifting positions to the east?  No plane visible in front of the trail and then it was.  The plane was not as high as they usually fly.  At first I thought it was very high and that&apos;s why I didn&apos;t see it.  When it did appear it was big and much lower than they normally fly.  And looked black.There is no way the plane changed direction.  I would have been able to see it make any turn.  From that vantage point you can basically see horizon to horizon.  It literally vanished into thin air without a trace like someone flicked a switch.  I think it may have been jumping locations in the sky.Reporting a UFO is one thing.  The government can dish out a swamp gas cover story.  Reporting disappearing planes puts it in a different ballgame.  I&apos;m afraid I&apos;ll get a visit from someone.How did they make the chemtrail instantly invisible too?  Stealth on steroids?  Cloaking?  Keep looking up.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The other hung in the air for about 5 minutes and did not move.  The sun hit it and you could tell it was a metallic object.I went over to the maintnence workers and asked if they saw what I was looking at and they did.

From the moment I stepped outside, my dogs were acting jittery, and I too felt like I was being watched. So I looked around at my surroundings, and saw no one. Then as I started to mumble to myself that it was probably just nothing, I heard like a whirring kind of noise. So I rechecked the area and no one was in sight, that is until I looked up. In the sky maybe 90 feet over, and above my head I saw the believed UFO. I stared at it in silence, and disbelief  for a few minuets when my dogs got worse.  It looked like a round disked, circle shape, with a rounded hump, or top, on the surface of the aircraft. Outlining the shape of the bottom surface, were glowing, no flashing red, and yellow-orange lights. It was flying in a downward angle as if to land in the vast abandoned cow-field not so far away. So I ran inside and asked my sister&rsquo;s boyfriend if they (humans), had designed a mo! del like the one described above.  He simply shook his head and said no.  I was scared, and shocked.

Before climbing into my tent, I hit the &quot;head&quot;, which was a patch of bushes at the back of the site.I paused to take one last look into the clear, starry night.

It was no larger than an average star. There was no sound, and no other lights. Moved in a steady, unwavering path. It appeared to be quite a distance, perhaps orbital distance, but that&apos;s just a guess. I would say that its speed was twice that of a commercial airliner at that altitude.

Suddenly, it was gone! I kept looking, further to the right, trying to pick it up again. No, it was gone.After desperately trying to relocate it, I looked back to my left again. Again, I spotted a bright white light, larger than the first, and traveling the exact same path. It was the same as above, but larger, about thrice the size. I followed it as well. When this second one reached the same, exact spot as the first one, it too disappeared from view! I was shocked! It was right there, and in an instant, gone.Again, it was a crystal clear night. There were no clouds. There was no sound.Early that night, and on other nights, I had watched jets cross the night sky, only to disappear beyond the horizon. These two craft, simply disappeared.

It was during the school year almost at dusk. The remaining daylight showed what I remember as a huge craft that looked like what I seen off of Star Wars. It was going as slow as we were, almost as it was floating. it stayed with us until the turn off of Old Richmond Road. It was like it was using the road also. I remember yelling to my Father to follow it. He looked as he seen a ghost as my Mother told him no. Other cars and trucks were driving fast to follow. I remember that like it was yesterday.

It is just a little North of the town Ogden, AR. I hate to admit this, but I got a little lost down further I drove. It has been years since I have driven that route. I got turned around several times and seemed like i went around in circles. I knew what community I was in just not were exactly i was. A while after driving very slow on the gravel road I felt like I was being followed.

It always originate around my parents home community of Arden. It seems not only to follow me from there on that road but stays a good distance behind me on every road I take leaving from that area. I have driven out to the wooded area called Gum Flats, which is a very wooded area that covers a lot o! f land from Foreman, Ar to Wilton and Ashdown, AR to see if I ! could ca tch a show like i did when I was 9 years old.

It is very different almost like a marsh like swamp land with its fair share of large remote and hard to get places. This stretch of land is between Ashdown and Foreman is covered with crops and cattle farms. A very large if not more is very remote and has lots of wildlife including lots of water beds and creeks that leads for miles. When some of it felt familiar I got fed up and started to feel like I should stop these kids or so called buddies from playing these jokes on me. I have only been without a job for a month but i started to ride the old back roads again a lot to ease my mind and plan my future. I figured my friends was doing a little joke to keep me on my toes. I guess I was wrong, when I cut down a narrow road and turned around very quickly, it was almost a little bigger than one lane. Being far enough down the road that had a fence r! oad on both sides, I should have caught a glimpse of the back end of any vehicle if it had turned around like I did. I drove very fast to catch them but did not see or hear any sign of a vehicle or people present. I knew that there had to be something following me because when i went down a long straight road that had a street light at where i started the road that left a perfect light on the road i saw on down a shadow that broke the light and moved a little left and right. With no trees to do this and still being straight I new they were behind me fixing to fool around again. I never heard a sound when I stopped and killed the engine no gravel crunch, no sudden stop and slide that is when I realized I told no one that I was there. Feeling like a fool i started back on the road and saw a shadow in the distance like a house or barn with a yard and cars. As I got closer I saw a reflection of a dull metal gleam from my headlights. It was like a normal reflection off a metal b! uilding but shinier and the shine seamed to go away and come b! ack. I t hought I lost my mind and should call a local friend to help me get home so i could get to bed. When I got close to the house it had a dull brown or tan color that could not have any kind of reflection. In middle of that what i thought would be me mentally breaking down finally going mad like my girlfriend has been accusing me of being when I told my Lighted Jokes Following story, I realized I knew the bridge I was driving upon.I took the side road that is numbered County Road 9, which I have been on many times also have a few friends that live on and near the rough road. Feeling frisky and Awaken I turned my Stereo full blast on the best song I cold find on my Flash drive that had the loudest base also when this flash drive is in my player it has a bright flashing blue light that is random flashes. Grabbing the New L.E.D. flash light I bought earlier I turned it on and shined it out side in many directions randomly and switching directions very quickly. I also was driving n! ot straight but from one side to the next staying kind of centered on the road, like i was bouncing from one ditch to the other. Slowly getting closer to the houses that live closer to the highway 32 which this road leads I came around a curve that is not sharp 2 lights flashed on almost like the flash light i played with and the flash drive that was flashing. My first thought was I was seen acting a fool on the road by our local Wildlife Officers of the Law making sure our wildlife friends was not being harmed by poachers out of season (great job fellas!) After seeing two I noticed they were getting brighter, when all of a sudden 8 to nine more flashed on creating a shape that looked a lot like I have seen before but did not grasp at the moment. I still blamed my good buddy for taking a joke to far, so I went toward the lights thinking they where in a tree stationed waiting on me. It was not to far away when i saw no tree and this Huge U.F.O. floating above me it was like ! a stealth camo it was dressed in because all i could see was t! he brigh t lights and what looked like its paint or body of the vehicle was bending light so it looked like the sky around it. when I stopped the car and turned off the radio it also stop approaching me it was huge like a large non perfect oval hole in sky with lights. I wanted to get as close as I could to touch it, when I drove a few more feet the lights went out and I still saw it there like it was trying to hide with the camo paint job that reminds me of the movie Predator, where I still saw its shape but it tried to blend in the sky. I saw it glide slowly to the field to the right and what I thought land, without having a great light I could not say for sure. I stopped and started to get out so I can see what I can learn about this thing that haunts me. Without emotions or feelings I was full of a urge to finish this 24 years of wonder. Then thought to myself what if something happens to me no one would know because I did not inform any one about me being lost and driving all ov! er these back roads. I sadly left and went down to my friends with a thought of finding out what that is if I even have to walk for days in the marsh, camping and getting cold, wet, and finding out why it messes with me. Maybe I am at the right places at the wrong times and they feel threatened by me. First question my buddy got was if he was involved. He looked like he got pale and told me no, and if I remember one night about 4 or 5 months back when me and my brother visited we went to a old property and he saw lights above the trees move around and we did not listen or look cause we thought he was playing. &quot;well same lights&quot; he said and seen them off and on around the same place. The way he talked with his tone I did believe him. Next day i rode with him and my brother to my cousin&apos;s house to get a stove. I only would go if I could see this road in daylight. He drove faster than I liked, but I saw the grand scale of how much wet lands I would have to cover to end this my! stery. Moving the stove I fooling around told my cousin I know! you are involved. he said &quot;for what&quot;. I said Causing the lights to flash in front of my car. He got scared and was loudly say those things are for real many times and said it was about midnight the night I saw them when he was scared by them back in the house and went to bed thinking he was seeing things.      I do not believe in the other worldly aliens. I like Sci-Fi but outer space beings do not make me think they came to earth for deserts, swamps, and cattle to probe. I have seen many aircraft flights that were over my parents home were we lived since I was in 2nd grade. They have been large and small copters with many jet engine aircraft making the same path over the house. I was even Nearly Knocked off my feet by a Bomber I think was a F-1 it was big and very loud it flew right above the ground at tree top level. With many bases around and lots of remote land that maybe no one can reach. Our Military Force may have a very quiet stealth machine that has new camo like armor and! super flight abilities. I would like to know why we have not seen one in combat it seems like the tech has not changed since i seen 25 years ago or that of what I researched. the lights from the early 50s is the same shape and size. I know i am not the only one to see this ship. I am not scared to tell my story, because I want to put it out in the open and I will find this thing or many things if it is one of many that breaks off from a larger ship to do test runs in isolated areas using its stealth shell and flight controls to see if it can be spotted by civilians who drive or live in these areas. Also my vehicle did not get shut down by e.m.p. at the time we were face off, but the day after my electrical systems started to act up. first my radio was reset of all my settings like the battery was unhooked or reset. my electric windows and locks did not work also my transmition will not go in gear. When I checked engine over my battery was leaking acid like it exploded from! a short. I now am without a ride so I am even more ready to f! ind this thing and face it to find my answers as well as what other would like to know.

I watched it for about 30 seconds as it traveled at a normal speed for a plane when without warning it instantly accelerated at an alarming rate, left a short dull light trail and disappeared.

We decided to see if we could see anymore so we turned around looking in the sky.  We found a total of four in a diamond pattern but very far apart.  We looked online to see if we could find any answers since we were obviously a little spooked but found nothing.

AKA county rd.[529] on there way to TOP&apos;s appliances which is at the corner of [529] and NJ state HWY 27. Now I know this has taken an incredibly long time to reported by I can remember there accounts of this very vividly. And no, this report is not intended as a joke or hoax.They say simply that they saw trapezoid shaped object with clearly distinct multicolored lights momentarily turning on and off while the object was comming from starboard (meaning from their right side facing front) and going in a generaly port direction (to their left) while making sharp right angle turns and &quot;whipping in different directions&quot; that&apos;s exactly the way they described it&apos;s movement ... They estimated it&apos;s size to be comparable to a typical 737 type passenger jet airliner and it was at a consistantly continuous altitude of several thousand feet above the ground (close to the same height as a airliner usually is in that area). They both insist that it could not be a reflection because they actually pulled to the right hand shoulder of the road and watched the thing go by. They say that no other vehicles were passing by in either direction when they were stopped. Unfortunately in addition to having no other witnesses to their account they do not have any phy! sical evidence of it either (photo&apos;s or anything else). There location where they pulled over was just in between the camp Kilmer U.S. Army reserve center and a small strip mall.

We started the night looking at the Orion nebula.  I have a book of star charts and had my head in it trying to see what else in the area would be interesting to look at.  My cousin pointed to an area in the west southwest sky (Taurus the bull)  I pulled my head from the book to look in the direction she was pointing.  From the left of Taurus +30 deg heading due north toward Polaris were three dull green lights traveling at a rate at that of a satellite.  We were only able to track the lights for about 10 seconds before they were lost behind the trees in my backyard.  I immediately began looking for a logical explanation as to what they were.  I have been actively stargazing for the last five years and in that time I have seen many satellites.  Never have I seen satellites traveling in this pattern(unless NASA has launched some sort of weather satellites I wasn&rsquo;t aware of).  The pale ! green color was also an abnormal color which I have never seen in an orbiting satellite.  To put it simply this event has rendered me clueless as to what myself (Age 31) and my Cousin (Age 9) saw.  One other side note as to the shape of the lights; they were orb shaped.  they were like what one would see when the space shuttle would pass over head bit at a much lower magnitude in brightness.  As for the distance apart from each other;  If you would hold your hand at arms length and make the victory symbol(or peace sign)and measure the distance apart from your index to your middle finger, that&rsquo;s the distance they were apart.  From the ground they looked like the following demonstration:    (  .           .             . )   Please do not treat this as a false report.  If anyone who reads can present to me a logical explanation to what we saw, I invite your reply.  I am not reporting this looking for attention in any way.  I, for now am treating this event for what it was: an! Unidentified Flying Object.  Until it is otherwise identified! it will remain a UFO, Not aliens or visitors from far off, but simply a UFO.  Thank you for taking the time to read this report. Sorry, one more side note.  there were no aircraft in the area, and no beacons or strobes to indicate that they were aircraft.

I was curious as to what it was since it was not moving, but standing completely still in mid-air, too high in the sky to be a cell phone tower.  As we proceeded to get closer, the light, we noticed, was actually 2 spot lights.  At that point we thought it was a plane, the lights being the 2 wing lights.  I began to notice a &quot;shooting&quot; type light, flickering from side to side, from one white light to the other.  I know that a plane&apos;s wing lights flicker, but they don&apos;t shoot across the plane&apos;s wings!  At this point, I was sure it was an alien craft.  I kept my eye on this thing the whole trip, and as we came to the stop light, we were directly beneath it, as it hadn&apos;t moved the entire time we were driving.  I actually rolled the window down and looked up into the sky to witness yet another light, which formed a perfect triangle with the other 2 light! s, and was sitting still in the sky as of yet.  I said to my friend, &quot;This is a UFO, an alien craft!&quot;  As I said this, the craft then (after 15 minutes of keeping my eye on it) began to move slowly with the wide end of the triangle as the front of the craft, shooting lights and all, and headed south toward the Monee/Peotone area.  I took my eyes off of the craft and then immediately noticed 6 or 7 more identical lights in the sky around the Frankfort/Mokena/Tinly Park area.  They were the same color, brightness, and height as the previously seen craft.

Second-hand account of taped interview with eye witnessThis reports describes a second-hand account of a sighting at Crestview Elementary school in North Dade county, Florida, circa 1966/1967.In 1971 as 6th-grade student at Crestview Elementary our teacher played a tape recording of an interview she gave regarding an event at the school a few years before.  The teacher was Mrs. ((name deleted)) first name not recalled) and the interviewer is unknown.During the interview, Mrs. ((name deleted)) described a unidentified aircraft landing in the broad, open field north of the school.   She discussed strange features of the aircraft (specifics not recalled) and the fear and panic that gripped the school during the initial moments after landing.   She also recalled the arrival of &quot;military personnel&quot; at the school shortly after the landing.   The aircraft was still on the ground while soldiers patrolled the corridors (note: the school was a single story school with open-air corridors around a central courtyard.  Several classes - included Mrs. ((name deleted)) at the time - had wall-to-wall windows that looked over the field to the north).   After a considerably long-time (several hours), the aircraft departed at a incredibly high-rate of speed (&quot;almost instantaneously&quot;) and the soldiers also left.The taped interview lasted 30-45 minutes and afterwards Mrs. ((name deleted)) took questions from her class and reiterated several points she made in the interview.

Planes  take what seems like a full minute to go from horizon to horizon these or this took about  6 to 8 seconds. I say this because I don&apos;t know if it was one craft or three.

We were on Mercury Blvd. on the East side of the EAFB dry lake bed. Think Space Shuttle landing strip runway that runs West to East in front of the notorious &ldquo;South Base&rdquo; Birk Flight Test Center.  We noticed a very large black triangle shaped craft coming off the runway and slowly gaining altitude.  We pulled over in time to have it come directly over our heads.  It appeared to be quite &ldquo;thick&rdquo; almost as though it were a balloon with somewhat puffy panels on its sides.  Underneath were very bright lights that reminded me of recessed counter top lighting.  Once it passed us it gained altitude VERY RAPIDLY and it blended in with stars above and was no longer visible.  It was way cool indeed.  We were speechless for a bit and felt very lucky to have seen it. Our thoughts were that the lights somehow adjusted to the star patterns above and also adjusted for altitude for viewing angles.  It was completely silent.  Obviously we assumed this was a re-con craft because we watched it carefully and lost it not to be found again.  We are talking seconds here.  It was definitely not an alien craft.

As I shut the door and looked up into the clear sky, I was shocked to observe something I can not explain. In the sky to my 11 &apos;o clock traveling from west to east was a blurred almost invisible formation, only one; with what looked to be three tailing lights [tail lights?]. The lights were dim and blurred/covered partially as if what ever was making the rest of the craft [invisible] was having trouble or could not fully cloak the three tail lights. I know that this craft in fact was not invisible because as it traveled off at about a couple hundred feet above tree line, it blurred the stars it passed under from my point of view. I only saw the craft for what seemed to be a full ten seconds and in that 10 seconds the unknown craft covered 25 degrees of the sky from over my head towards the eastern sky, but I did notice there was no sound at all in the sky&apos;s at the time it w! as passing.

These lights were about 500 feet in the sky and only a few blocks down from where we were standing. The lights were next to each other and the one in the middle was the biggest.  About 5 seconds after I initially saw the lights two of them separated from the middle and disappeared, then the middle one dissappeared.  The lights appeared to be heading west.After telling my friend what we saw, we decided to take a drive out of town to the west to see if we could see anything.7:48 pm- Heading west, a bit past the golf course we saw one big bright light then a smaller light separated from it. The lights were to the south. After we drove past a hill that blocked our view the light was gone.7:53- After finding a place to pull over on the highway me, my friend, and my girlfriend all saw three bright lights in the sky about 500 feet high to the east.

I noticed something small, bright (reflecting light) and spherical in the sky outside my window.  It remained in a stationary position just inland of the coast. From my position I estimated it was pretty high, as the Long Beach air traffic was flying well below it.  Yet for ten minutes it did not move, so I ruled out balloon and blimp.  I tried to record it with my video camera, but the reflectivity of the object and the distance of it made recording impossible, it simply wasn&apos;t registering in my view finder...  As I put my camera down it began moving slowly toward Seal Beach (Naval Weapons Station) direction.  By 16:15 pst it was out of my visual range.  There was only one object.My background is irrelevant to the sighting.  I am not ex-military or law enforcement, and I have only seen a UFO one other time, with two friends in 1994.  Turned out to be a prototype for a DRONE the military was testing over the neighborhoods of Lakewood, CA.So this could be anything.  I am simply reporting it.

I usually don&apos;t belive this kind of stuff but this is something I definately have never seen before.My dog was barking uncontrollably so I went out on my deck to see if a bear or coyotes were in my yard.  While out on my deck I saw 2 lights directly on top of each other hovering in the western sky.  The two lights moved simultaneously so I&apos;m assuming they were on 1 object.  The lights were white then subtly changed to a blue hue and back to white.  The lights hovered, then moved right very fast and stopped then moved left and up very fast and stopped.  Each time the object stopped it hovered for a few minutes before moving again.At that point, I saw a red light flying very fast toward the object.  I thought the red light was an airplane but it moved significantly faster than your average passenger jet in the sky.  The red light flew directly at the object until the red light was hidden behind the object and I never saw it again.The object kept moving fast and hovering and then in an instant it flew directly downward below the tree line and I couldn&apos;t see it.  My husband, who is a die hard skeptic of all things supernatural, saw it and admitted that it was unlike anything he had ever seen.

They called to the house to have my wife come out and look at these lights in the sky.  She went out on the back deck and then called me out.  When I looked to the south, there were 3 bright orange lights in a triangle formation low in the sky.  They moved off to the southwest and the lights got dimmer and then just disappeared.At the same time, several more of the bright orange lights came from the SE, low on the horizon.  They moved very slowly, but not in a straight line.  It was more of a jagged line.  It was not normal.  There was a commercial aircraft flying due south at the time that was definitely higher altitude than these lights.  The lights slowly moved from east to west then headed south and disappeared.  My wife got some pictures of them on her phone.  One group of 3 and one group of 2.It was very eerie.  There is absolutely no way these were any type of normal aircraft.

It was very late, possibly midnight or later.  It was snowing lightly.My family was just leaving my aunt&rsquo;s house at a Christmas Eve get-together, exchanging gifts, etc.  It was very late.  It had been snowing lightly but steady enough that there just a dusting of snow on the car.  My father cleared the windshield off quickly with his hands.  I remember this because he didn&rsquo;t have enough to make a snowball to throw.We started toward the end of the street (St Charles Street, facing southeast).  At the moment we came to the street&rsquo;s end (St Egbert st) a very, very large black/gray delta shaped object appeared over the tree tops (there used to be a field there, now occupied by homes).  The delta shaped object was very low, perhaps just two hundred feet, and moving slowly enough that it was almost hovering &ndash; heading or facing northwest.  It was large enough that it obscured most of the sky.  It was silent.  The leading edges of the delta shaped object were brightly lit in what at the time seemed the strangest possible way.  A single light on each of the two leading edges ran the entire length of the leading edge.  It emitted collimated &lsquo;sheets&rsquo; of light, which slowly swept across the ground, homes, and trees from each leading edge.I was in the rear left seat, with a clear view out the car window.  My brother, three years older, had jumped across the back seat and his body weight was on top of me while he gawked out the car window on my side.  I remember my mother saying something, sounding emotional, frightened.  It was at the moment my mother said something that everything seemed to spiral down to some dream like state, like being drugged into unconsciousness.I became aware of four beings, three males and one female.  The female was speaking, or more like singing to me.  It seemed the three males were &lsquo;singing&rsquo; to everyone else...I mean everyone else in the area around the ship and car.  I became aware of the presence of our car from another perspective, perhaps looking down at it from some altitude, at the tops of the homes and trees.  The female voice kept singing to me.  It was the sound of a lullaby but had intense imagery and concepts attached to it.  I understood that I was to take it all in.Then I gradually became aware of being in the back seat of the car again.  My brother was no longer on top of me.  My parents were sitting perfectly quiet in the front seat.  There was no sign of the object.  My mother looked at my father and nudged him.  He looked at her, then grabbed the wheel, and just started to move, (the engine was still running) then suddenly stopped.  There was about three inches of snow on the car.  My father had to get out and clear the windshield and front of the car before we could go on.Around 1985 I asked my brother if he had any recollection of the event.  He stammered and said he had, but thought it was just a really weird dream or dreamlike memory.  My father had no idea, in fact, didn&rsquo;t remember Christmas Eve at my aunt&rsquo;s house.  My mother couldn&rsquo;t remember the event.  Oddly, my cousin, who was in the house that we left that Christmas Eve night, remembered that something weird happened, but couldn&rsquo;t remember what it was.  When I asked what kind of weird, i.e., walls melting weird or can&rsquo;t remember where she put the keys weird, she stated that she had dreams for many years of that night but wouldn&rsquo;t go on about what kind of dreams.  I felt that she didn&rsquo;t want to talk about her weird dreams.I&rsquo;ve been looking over the years for a record of a sighting in that area and time, would have been Christmas Eve, 1964 or 65, but have found none.  Seems inconceivable that no one else saw this event.  The area is very close to Philadelphia Int&rsquo;l airport.  However, at that time of night, the airport and tower would have been closed.  I&rsquo;ve wandered if the three male singing voices were a type of sedating effect over the general area.There is one sighting noted 12/24/65 in Davidsville, PA of a &lsquo;light,&rsquo; nothing more.I note that this doesn&rsquo;t seem to correspond to any of the typical sightings noted over the years.

An upright cone shaped, triangular craft was heard, with a very loud rocket type sound. It was heard by 1 child in a home, and viewed by 2 children playing outside.  The children stated it was &quot;Apollo&quot; coming down over the house.  The cone shaped craft was dented and had lights, it also had 3 landing legs with pods on the bottom.  The craft was descending over a home.  The sound emitted was very loud, and similar to a rocket engine blast.The other child came outside, but the craft rose quickly and was only a small speck that disappeared in the clouds.  The craft was descibed as metalic with multi-colored lights along its cone shaped length.  There was no smell of rocket fuel or exhaust, and there was no alteration to the structure of the roof or vegetation.

This is the second one and occurred about a week ago at my current location, Hyderabad, India. I was on the terrace of our place resting on an arm-chair. The only reason I was even looking up at the sky was because of the angle at which the armchair reclined. I noticed a bright light in the western horizon, and as it was still twilight the object was the only &lsquo;star&rsquo; I saw in the sky.  Even as I watched , it suddenly seemed to grow in size and intensity, moved &lsquo;up&rsquo; in a way that I cannot really put into words (a sort of beaming, if you will) for a little distance at normal speed, then disappeared abruptly.

This is one of five of my sightings and the most spectacular one out of the five.My friend and myself were heating and air installation employees who worked for Climate Control out of south boston at the time this took place. We were working on the sears building roof top,installing the last flue pipe on the job site that day.The sky was completely clear blue sky, no clouds anywhere, perfect visability! We had just picted up  our tool belts and heading towards the roof top stair door, i noticed a craft that i had mistaken for a small airplane at a glance in the distance that had hovered around the old Dan River Mills smoke stacks located closest to the worsham st. bridge area, down in that direction.After catching my attention i noticed that the craft was moving in our direction, straight at us. The moment that i realized this object was not an airplane was when it began to turn on its side at a 90 degree angle with no drop in altitude and not in a turn such as an aircraft would do.The object turned 90 degrees on its side and then it turned back to a level position as it was moving towards us on the roof top of the sears building, and keep in mind, this object was just a little bit higher than we were at eye level.Once the object returned to a horizontal position it was close enough to be fully visable with much detail.Once the craft leveled ot to a horizontal position i yelled out to my work mate and i pointed str! aight at it in total shock and disbelief. At that moment the craft turned upwards on its side at a 45 degree angle and shot across the sky at a speed so fast that the object became a streak of white light accross the sky, and there was a noticeable point of exit at the end of the streak of white light. Where the object streak ended in the sky there was something like white stars of light that shot back towards the direction of the streak of white light.Also this streak of light was not a vapor trail it was a split second exit, aweome and unbelievable.The craft was a disk shaped object with small areas on the top side like dark rectangular shaped indentations and the same on the bottom side of the craft as well.The object was a beautiful gold color like the sun and the classic disk shape like in the old ufo movies.The object had an appearence of a somewhat dulling effect of the light around the object but plainly visable.

March 3rd north of Fairfield, Iowa being observed by 4 jets.My son stepped out for a smoke at 7:10 pm Wednesday March 3rd and happened to see a comet like object crashing to the east of the Fairfield airpor, surrounded by four jet airplanes.To the eye it appeared about an inch across, was fiery red turning to bright green as it hit.He expected to see and hear an explosion and sound but there was none.Many other people driving in its direction must have seen it.There was no report of it on the local TV news.  I notified the papers and they didn&apos;t print a story.It may have been satalite debris that did not burn up completely on reentry and was being tracted by NASA who calculated its crash location and sent the Air Force jets to observe where it hit.

The sky was absolutely clear, with a sliver of a Moon that looked like a big smile, and tons of visible stars. I had spotted a satellite moving directly overhead moving from south to north, and we watched it until we couldn&rsquo;t see it anymore. Just then, my wife says, &ldquo;Look , there&rsquo;s another one!&rdquo;, and points due west. I turned to look, and I saw a  very, very bright white light moving from the west toward the east. The light had a blue tint to it, kind of like an LED light bulb is, as opposed to an incandescent bulb which is much more yellow.When I first turned and saw the light, it was at around 45 to 50 degrees, moving fairly quickly west to east in a straight line, it&rsquo;s path just south of us. If I held an aspirin tablet between my fingers at arm&rsquo;s length, that would be slightly larger, but reasonably comparable to the size of the light. It was by far the brightest thing in the sky.  As the light moved to about 85 degrees, almost directly overhead, it never deviated in intensity, flashed, or seemed directional in any way, like the headlight of a low flying airplane would. It then began to move in a wide arc toward the southeast. As it did, it began to slowly dim, until it was the size and intensity of  any random star in the sky. In fact, it now actually did look like a satellite, except for the fact that it was turning toward the southeast. We watched it for another few seconds, and then it just winked out.My wife and I were discussing what we had just seen, still facing the direction we had last seen it. I was excited, as I have witnessed the same type of light on two other occasions from my backyard (which, incidentally, faces due west), but I was always alone without any other witnesses.  As we were talking, there was a sudden bright flash of light, similar to a camera flash, at about 45 degrees, just a bit east of where we saw the light blink out, maybe 15 - 20 seconds before. We both looked up and saw what appeared to be 2 satellite sized lights moving  SE to NW in a path that would go directly over our heads. They were moving parallel to each other, although one was moving slower. As we watched, the slower one started to &ldquo;pulse&rdquo;. It was going from looking like a satellite, to slowly dimming until it was completely dark, and then slowly brightening back to looking like a satellite again. I then realized that the faster of the two actually was a satellite, as it continued ! across the sky in a straight line at the same speed. The &ldquo;pulsing&rdquo; light now started moving in a more northerly direction rather than northwesterly as it had been. It began moving slower and slower until it eventually stopped, hanging at about 55 -60 degrees in the eastern sky, doing it&rsquo;s pulsating thing. As I turned back toward the northwest to see if the other satellite (which by now had passed by us) was still acting like a satellite (which it was), we noticed a small plane flying directly toward us at around 700 ft headed toward a small landing strip a mile or so down the road. I immediately looked back to the &ldquo;pulsing&rdquo; light. It grew dim and bright a few more times, then it stayed steadily bright, and looked like an ordinary star.The plane served as a comparison to the original light we saw come from the west. First, the plane&rsquo;s headlight was very yellow in color and much dimmer. It also had obvious green and red flashing lights, and it was loud; very easily heard over the breaking of the waves, whereas the mystery light was completely silent. Also, the plane&rsquo;s presence gave me a sense of how high the light was. I guesstimated the plane to be at about 500 - 700 ft and descending, which made me feel like the first time we saw the light, it was about twice that height. The second time, it looked as high as the other satellite, even though it was only 15 - 20 seconds later. My wife told me that when she first saw the light and said, &ldquo;Look, there&rsquo;s another one&rdquo;, it was the size of a satellite, and in a fraction of a second, it was super bright and huge, which is right when I saw it the first time.After the plane flew by, the light, which was now stationary, and looked like an ordinary star, faded out and we didn&rsquo;t see it again. I also wanted to say that during the first part of the sighting, my wife had a feeling of dread, and had started to cry. She kept saying, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo; over and over. I, on the other hand, was excited, and was extremely happy to have a witness with me.", "A big ring-like object with bright lights in AtlantaI saw a big circular ring with lights floating in the sky.

I noticed in the eastern direction what, at first glance, seemed to be a jet or rocket. However, it was not moving as fast, it was remaining completely parallel to the horizon. Plus it did not have the trail of smoke that lasted forever trailing behind it. It seemed to have a light, quickly vanishing tail. I watched it for a few minutes before I ran inside and got my husband to come look. He followed quickly behind me out the door where I pointed the still there object out to him.

The light was huge (Maybe 5x that of a star)  The night was clear so there wasn&apos;t any clouds obstructing my view. It seemed to be hoovering, so I just continued to watched it.  I was on the phone with my friend who lives on the other side of town and told her to look outside and see if she could see what i was seeing.  She said she could see it and said it deffinetly didn&apos;t look like a plane. And then it started to do the most strangest of things.  It started to sway back and forth.

Though I could not judge the distance or altitude well, the &ldquo;apparent and relative&rdquo; speed and size was like that of a landing light from a military airplane or the International Space Station at it&rsquo;s brightest passing overhead.  It was noticeably brighter and slightly larger than a planet or bright star but I noted no atmospheric aberration giving the sensation that it was a small object moving by at a close distance (a few hundred feet away).  This struck me as bizarre because my logic dictated that the object, like an aircraft at that motion, should be a mile or two away.  At one point, the object began to slowly undulate and decelerated to a stop within about five seconds, then emitted an apparently solid &ldquo;column&rdquo; of light from the bottom.  The light column did not continue ! downward to the ground, but ceased in mid-air about two to three degrees below the object.  Also, this emitted light was shimmering with several colors (ie. Purple, green, white), and was minor in magnitude in comparison to the luminosity of the main object body and was relatively difficult to see clearly.  After about ten seconds, the light column and fireball disappeared and in it&rsquo;s place began a bright white and random strobe pattern.  The object then accelerated to the north again, achieving extremely high apparent speed until it disappeared from view down near the north horizon.  (I had just enough time to run upstairs from my south side downstairs porch to see the last few seconds of it passing into the distance from my north-facing second-story kitchen window).  I also noted that the light portion of the blinking interval cycle was very fast or &ldquo;instantaneous&rdquo; compared with strobe lights that I had seen before this.  Total U.F.O. observation time was about two minute! s, and lastly, there was no noticeable sound coming from the o! bject th roughout the sighting. I have lived near a major US Air Force base my entire life and have spent 34 years around many different aircraft of which I feel that I have become very familiar.  This object, which I only passively noticed far in the distance from the corner of my eye, very quickly struck me as odd and out of place.  I had a strong feeling that this object, if not a human-piloted or controlled craft, definitely exhibited signs of intelligence or intelligent control, possibly even aware of my observing it.  I was transfixed throughout the sighting and found the experience beautiful, fascinating, unsettling, and frightening.", "Orb hovers for more than an hourI was golfong at Rio Hondo golf course.

As I continued to look around, another one appeared higher and to the left of the first.  And finally a third appear almost directly overhead.  The second and third one stayed for about 10 minutes.

It was like I previously stated, a triangle shaped craft, but made no sound. And at the low altitude the craft was at, and the speed it was flying, I would assume I would have heard some noise. Not far ahead of the craft was and airplane, I believe to be a commuter. The craft made a very sharp, almost 90 degree bank, and headed towards the planes direction.

We were facing East and the object moved from North to South right in front of us before disappearing into the horizon!", "Witnessed a cylinder shape object, very close, moving slowly, deep humming sound,  illuminated portals showing mechanical rooms.Event Location: On Farm about 1 mile North of Cowley, Wyoming  I was 27 years old, mother of  three small children.  I was sleeping and began dreaming of an airplane, it was flying closer as the sound grew louder until it flew through the window.  The dream was so real, it startled me fully awake, then slowly coming to the realization the sound was still there.  From our farm looking west, B-52 bombers could frequently be seen flying quite low in a north-south direction.  What I was hearing was consistent with a large group of low flying heavy bombers directly over our house going East to West.I went outside and stood on the steps looking up and to the west.  It was a moonless night and the only lights were the millions of stars seen in the clear Wyoming skies.  I could detect a smooth flying motion overhead moving west, and the sound remained a constant deep droning/humming sound.  I continued to watch still thinking it was a large number of large airplanes, but I was curious why they would be flying in such close formation so late at night and in the middle of nowhere. It was unusual, but thought they must be moving a fleet to the West Coast following the end of the Vietnam War.I wondered how many there were as I could not distinguish individual shapes, so I began looking intently for indications of wings and lights that should be at least on the tips.  I could detect no wings, no lights, no silhouette of a wing shape.  All the while the massive  object continued slowly on its westerly trajectory.  There were no lights either on the craft or in our yard to help illuminate to assist in giving a better indication of size, color, material, shape, and distance.As I continued to watch, a portal came into view.  It was in the underside of the craft and illuminated with a soft florescent light.  Over the years, my memory has become a little fuzzy on whether the color was green or blue, but it was a very pleasing color to the eye, not harsh and I lean to it being a pretty blue florescent.  The light made it easy for me to clearly see inside the portal.What I saw was an immaculate mechanical room.  There was what looked like a large boiler with pipes connected to it.  Everything was the same color, but the shapes were very distinct and familiar.  Very Earthly.  I continued to watch as the portal slowly moved out of sight.  It was interesting that the light was obviously very bright and illuminated a large room, but did not extend outside the craft.  After the portal passed from view, I could no longer detect where the portal was.  There was no glow of light emanating from beneath the craft.  I continued to watch, and after a few moments another portal came into view.  The light was the same and the room&rsquo;s contents appeared to be identical to the first room seen.  Another mechanical room, with an identical &ldquo;boiler&rdquo; and connecting pipes.  Everything I could see appeared identical to the first portal.I continued to watch trying to see any details that might be visible, but it was so dark the shape was determined more by the absence of the stars.  It was long and cylindrical, there were no sharp edges.  I had a clear view to the West for about 15 to 20 miles.  The craft was so close it shut out all of the night sky as I looked north and most of the night sky as I looked west.  It was very low, but not able to determine exactly how low, and traveling very slow, but not able to indicate how slow except that I was able to get a very good look inside the portals.  So, maybe between 5 to 15 MPH.  Again, there was never a change in the sound, it was a continuous deep, humming or droning sound.  I never changed my opinion about it being consistent with large airplanes flying over head.  It was flying level in a true East to West direction.  I never saw the beginning or end of the craft.  What I did see was larger than a football field, but did not see the craft in its entirety. ! There were no unusual odors, no unusual wind movement, and there was no disturbance of animals (cattle, dogs, etc.) that I was aware of.  Everything was silent except the sound indicated.I started to become uneasy, even a little frightened and decided to go back inside.  My children were sleeping and I was just beginning to understand that what I had been watching was very extraordinary and there was nothing in my reference that explained it.  I sat quietly in the living room, did not turn on any lights to look at a clock, and just waited for it to pass. I did not look out the window, I did not want to do anything to bring attention to myself, our home, my family.  I continued to hear the sound for sometime after I went back inside and was relieved when the sound finally ceased.   I do not remember that the sound faded away as planes would as they went into the distance, rather it just stopped and became quiet.  I do not know the total duration, but it was several minutes from the time I first became aware of the sound in a fully conscious state to when it finally ceased.I did not tell anyone about this experience until some years later.   I looked for something that would explain what I had seen in logical terms.  I married a retired Air Force Pilot with thousands of hours flying time and over 4 millions air miles.  We attended many military air shows together, and I would look for anything that resembled what I had seen.    Over the years I never saw anything remotely like what I had seen years earlier.  My husband Bill was the first person related my experience to, followed by my children after they were grown.  I have also since told a couple of my siblings.  I told my brother after he related an experience he and my mother had with light orbs following them on a deserted highway traveling late one night in Wyoming.This is the experience I had as I remember it and choosing to report it officially while the details are clear.  It occurred on a moonless summer night, approximately 27 July 1976, probably after midnight.   I am positive of the year, the month was most likely July, but may have also been June.  My young brother was in the hospital in Billings Montana when this occurred.

We see many planes and helicopters in this area so we know how they appear in the sky; these lights were much more brilliant - both were as bright as a rising Venus at certain times of the year. I could not detect any sound.As they dropped below our sight, they kept the same vertical alignment, same distance apart, and moved at the same rate of speech.  It was as if an invisible string was attaching the lower light. What is this?  My husband thinks it was helicopter. I am not sure.", "my lady &amp; I witnessed a orange light floating like a balloon moving. then stopped moving, for about 20sec nothing happened until a streak of light shot out from directly under object like a fireball disappearing. then the object started flickering proceeding to float farther away when it divided up into into about 4-6 individual lights. from that point the indiviual lights started blasting off one by one at a 45degree angle like a fireball towards the sky dissappearing.", "Round ball of light type object floating silently over the trees around the river.I shot this video in my back yard on Feb 14, 2010, at aprox. 10:20pm in Redding, Ca, USA.

As I drew closer to it.It started to move off over the eastern Whitby very slow and over western Oshawa ,Ontario.  This one is a new one for me. Could it have been military?  It was that big whatever it was  and even kind of spooky-due to the distant spread of the three white lights. It was definitely not a helicopter, it was way too long, not to mention the lighting sequence. Theruby red light seem to be rotating in flashing. I flashed my head! lights on and off twice, while driving. It appeared to flash back, but not so brightly, there was a difference in its lighting tone.

I watched this bright light for about 5 minutes as it moved over the Bridger mountains between Bozeman and Livingston Montana.  While I was watching it, I was comparing it to a plane in the sky flying NW.  The plane was flying faster and at a higher altitude than the light.  The light was flying very slowly and did not have any of the standard marking lights that airliners have.

That&apos;s when the big jet flew over, and I ran out of the house to look at it.When I came back in, I sat down with my wife and we worked together to describe what happened.  We kept talking to each other about the details, trying to explain what we saw, and we couldn&apos;t explain it, only talk about it.I&apos;ll let my wife type now!  Thanks!   Report from wife:  First of all, let me preface this by saying I never thought I&apos;d be saying or seeing anything like this, but I did, along with my husband, and we feel we should tell someone who won&apos;t think we&apos;ve gone off the deep end!   LOL   You may share our story if you want to, but we would strongly ask to remain anonymous.  We could accurately be portrayed as a middle-aged (ugh! LOL) married couple in Modesto.  My husband is a professional whose name is recognizable to those in his field, and I hope you understand and respect our need to remain anonymous to anyone other than yourself.That being said, here&apos;s what happened:  (pasted here from what I wrote directly after seeing whatever it was we saw.  My husband and I &quot;compared notes&quot; as I typed, and are in agreement with everything detailed in the following account.)  Jan 13, 2010 approx. 11:20 pm PST, in Modesto, CA, my husband and I were in our backyard to take the dog out for the night.   The sky was very clear, and we were looking at the stars while waiting for the dog to &quot;go potty.&quot;   My husband suddenly said, &quot;Look!  What IS that?&quot; and pointed up, towards the NW sky, but somewhat overhead.There was something flying very steadily, at a moderate speed - hard to say exactly how fast, not knowing how high the object really was, or how large it may have been, given unknown altitude.  But, we had the impression it was somewhat low-flying, and fairly large in size.It was completely silent.So much so, it was almost dream-like in a way.  It just didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;compute&rdquo; that something could be doing that and not make a sound.It was definitely not a balloon, moving too evenly and directly.  No &quot;wobble&quot; or any variance in its trajectory or speed - very smooth, perfectly straight line, perfectly consistent speed.  It flew directly over us on its path.  I have no doubt whatsoever it was moving of its own power.  And this is hard to explain, but it was as if it was maintaining its level, speed and smoothness with no effort - as if gravity, air resistance or any of our conventional laws of physics were not an issue, if that makes any sense.There were no definite lights, however the entire object was dimly luminous.  It was certainly the source of the light itself, it was not a reflection or a beam of light.  Nor did it project any illumination or beam of light.  It just was kind of phosphorescent.  There were no visible markings at all.  It was not really bright, but sort of similar to how a light looks when turned low on a dimmer switch, or even less.  It didn&apos;t have finely exact definite edges - it was dim enough to appear somewhat diffuse, though the shape was completely discernable, and incomparable to anything known.   And it was definitely a solid object.The shape is difficult to describe - somewhat diamond gem shaped, but more rounded, sort of like a horseshoe crab shape without the tail.  We both had the impression we were looking at the bottom of the object without being able to see the sides.  The same perspective one would have if they held a plate or bowl overhead and could only see the bottom.The object continued on an absolutely straight path, traveling SE, and eventually we lost sight of it, after about 30 or 40 seconds from initially sighting it.What&apos;s strange, now that I consider it, is that it did not change in dimension, in other words, as it got further away, it didn&apos;t necessarily get commensurately smaller as one would expect from normal perspective, yet we both perceived it getting further away.  Very hard to explain.  But, it was as if it finally went out of sight more as a result of not being able to see its luminosity from that distance anymore, as opposed to it getting smaller and smaller.Oddly, I feel as if its shape did not change commensurately either, the further away it got, it did not appear to become more elliptical, as one would expect something of that shape to do in normal circumstances.  Nor did we perceive seeing &ldquo;sides&rdquo; or a &ldquo;top&rdquo; to it as one may expect.  Yet, somehow, we knew it was not paper-thin, we knew we were seeing the bottom of an object of undeterminable overall multiple dimensions.  Very, very difficult to explain adequately.Although my husband kept asking me, &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; and I kept answering, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; we were both calm during the &quot;event&quot; - no feeling of fear or panic, more so a feeling of wondering or awe.  My husband felt it was a feeling of excitement, I felt strangely calm, but in wonderment.  It is only now, after the fact, that we are somewhat agitated, a little fearful I guess, and somewhat bewildered.  Like our logical minds are seeking an explanation.Something else odd &ndash; an estimated 8 to 10 minutes after our experience, a huge jet, definitely not a commercial passenger jet, flew over really low and fast, and was very, very loud.  We NEVER have anything like this in our area &ndash; only small planes, little commuter jets upon occasion, or commercial jets flying really high.  This thing sounded like a rocket or fighter jet, and was flying really low.  We had just come in the house, and upon hearing how loud this jet was, my husband ran back outside to see it.  He said that it went south, and then abruptly circled easterly, and then turned SE, and continued in the very direction we saw the object fly.  We just thought that was weird, especially considering what we had just seen.So &ndash; that&rsquo;s the story!   As fantastic as it sounds, I know what we saw, and have absolutely no idea what it was, and absolutely no doubt it was NOT anything conventional possibilities can explain.  It was like nothing I&rsquo;ve ever seen in my life.", "4 shape shifting lights flies through the sky with planes and helicopters following itSo I was driving down the 405s freeway between beach blvd and Goldenwest Ave in Huntington Beach, CA at around 7pm and i saw an assortment of lights that were 4 distinct lights that formed the shape of an a-symmetric v with one light making one of the legs of the v while the other three light formed the other leg of the v.While at first i thought it was just a plane I kept watching it and saw the lights shift position in which the light kind of circled around each other and each light changed positions until it came around into a straight line. The unusual part was a few things, first, the four lights were not connected but if you focused in the lights you could see a faint light connecting all the lights together as if it were four lights on a string that would shift around as it moved through the sky.The second unusual part was that you could definitely see helicopters/airplanes following it like they were chasing it and as the helicopters/airplanes got closer the object would shift-shape and fly faster, i saw the object go from my left side of the car (north) to the front (east) to the right side (southwest) in less than a minute.Now it was not making any sounds that i could tell just the sounds of planes and helicopters.  The only reason that I would come to conclusion that this could be a ufo is that I had seen these same actions on two different tv shows at two different dates on the history channel in which these exact descriptions were portrayed; four lights appearing to be shape shifting starting as a v then turning into a straight line kind of like Orion&rsquo;s belt, but four lights, moving through the sky.

There were approximately 4-6 planes.I awoke for work at 6 am PST March 1, 2010; I live in San Diego East County near hwy 67. The sky was perfectly clear and blue near my location, except for two jet con trails going from east to west. This is not in the standard flight path for the area for either civilian or military aircraft; there is no commercial flight path at this location.I work a short distance from home approximately 10 miles by road near the hwy 8 and 125. I observed at this location from 7am to 8:30 two aircraft making chemtrails traveling east to west, one was at a higher elevation, and you could see that it was an airplane but it was too high up to get details of the craft. The other plane was at a lower enough elevation to see the size and color of the plane, it had wing tips they were facing up, two jets motors on each wing, drab grey and black in color. You could not hear a jet exhaust noise from the airplanes.I observed 5 passes with this pattern; it would vary in respect to starting from southeast towards northwest and starting northeast towards southwest at the high and low elevations. I could not observe the whole incident, but I saw enough to know these facts to be accurate.  As a few minutes past I  found a vantage point to look at the sky again; I observed 11 chemtrails in the sky at varying heights going east to west and two from a more north to south west direction. I observed during two passes at the lower elevation after the &quot;cloud&quot; spread was starting, these planes had no chemtrails coming out of them.Slowly the chemtrails would spread out and the slight westerly breeze would push them east, you could see these &quot;cloud&quot; were stopping from the atmospheric pressure of the local mountains, so the chemtrails spread out from north to south. It appeared like there were several very, very long thin &quot;clouds&quot; stretching from east to west.By mid afternoon I could no longer feel the warm sun which I had from the morning or see bright blue sky. The sky was filled with a hazy looking &quot;cloud&quot; layer. Not any cloud I have seen, but a hazy white cover in the sky, with slight blue sky color penetrating through.As of this writing at 5:45pm PST there is still a white even haze in the sky, at my homes vantage point I can see normal puffy clouds behind the local Mt.

It was about dusk, when the first craft appeared out of clouds it came, suddenly there were 2, then next thing we knew, there were 5. We started to talk about the crafts and it was like they heard us. The crafts were round, and almost in formation style, when one craft lifts looked like they were signaling to the others, then the others started to signal back. The next thing we knew we were being followed by the crafts, I know it sounds strange, but they stayed with us till we reached our destination. I was so scared I even stopped at some gas station to call my husband, and mom to tell them I was being followed and didn&rsquo;t know what to do, of course they didn&rsquo;t believe me, needless to say, I never pulled over to sleep that night, and drove straight through to California. During the time I was driving ! they would put a light on us, then back away, they would hide behind building then pop out of know where, then they drive along side our car. I had never been so scared, and it really sucked no one believed us. March 2009 My daughter actually seen this one, she states she was in her room, when she heard a noise, she walked to the window to see 2 crafts, one was hovering above the other. The other one was in our backyard, hovering, she states it was round with lights all around it. She states after a few minutes, it finally started moving towards the front of the house, she came running downstairs saying &ldquo;I just seen a UFO it going to the front&rdquo; so we all ran out to the front porch, but we did not see anything.

First he saw &quot;something&quot; and said - &quot;...what&apos;s that thing floating/flying out there?&quot;  I looked out the window - and didn&apos;t see anything - noting that we were close to the Las Vegas airport and just figured it was a helicopter or small plane.  About 5 minutes later I happened to look out the window and noticed a glowing &quot;ball&quot; of light and went closer to the window to get a better view.  As I focused on the glowing ball - I realized it was really a ring, glowing and it floated down past our window then actually floated across the hotel and disappeared.  I am not sure of the size, or even the distance - but if seemed to be around 8&quot; in diameter and floating just a couple feet outside the window.", "I used to want to see a UFO so badly, but now I wish I never saw it.Me and my friend were outside. I was looking at the stars when I see a light in the sky. There were no other stars around it. It looked so weird, I didn&apos;t take my eyes off it. Then I see 4 lights flash off the side, in a straight line. I was amazed. I looked around to tell my friend. He came over and looked up. The look on his face went to confused, to scared. He walked inside saying it&apos;s too much for him. I didn&apos;t move at all. I wanted to see exactly what it would do. 5 minutes passed. The lights continued to flash. Then, it started to spin. I started walking a little closer, but then at the corner of my eye i see another light. I look closely at it. Then a craft came out of nowhere and slowly hovered almost above me. Almost as if they were watching me. Then it got to the end of our fence. This craft was floating above the house, it caused our lights to flicker. As soon as it got above our house, it went blurry and just disapeared above our house. It vanish! ed, it didnt move it just disapeared. My friend comes outside and he sits down on the chair. He was talking to his girlfriend acting as if nothing happened. He didn&apos;t see what I just saw. I turn to him and start walking toward him. All I said was Joey, then passed out on his porch. I woke up in his room in the chair.Every night since that night I hear things above my house. Around one to four. One night i actually saw lights flash through my window. I never sleep anymore. Im terrified of what i saw. Its been 2 months. I continue to hear hovering every night. I thought it was my fridge, but when i unplugged it and went upstairs, it got louder. I didn&apos;t want to see what i saw. And I know how most people want to see one so bad, but believe me, you don&apos;t want to encounter one.

I noticed it to be 5 distinct shooting stars coming from the East going westbound.  Orange/amber in color, spaced apart as if they were &apos;tracer bullets&apos; in the sky moving extremely fast; uniform in direction and trajectory (or lack of trajectory - almost a straight line).I was almost able to make out a chevron in the first, but they were so high up and moving so fast that it wasn&apos;t a vivid chevron per say, but the color did look un-natural to the night sky (dimmer but &apos;steadier glow&apos; than typical stars). The formation crossed the entire night sky and I lost sight of it as it headed further west/northwest coming from the east, almost directly overhead... about 70-80 degrees.The shapes came together or it could have been the angle, but they disappeared as they &apos;converged&apos; still at approx 80 degrees.The night sky was surprisingly clear and I immediately posted a question on yahoo answers dated 03/16/2010.  I do observe meteor showers and comets when in season, but this looked nothing like anything i had observed in the past...  the objects seemed to be flying extremely fast for any man made vehicle, but steadier (did not fade out) than shooting stars i&apos;ve seen in the past.The color was clearly orange amberish.I&apos;m no &apos;third kind encounter&apos; type of individual and I felt that anyone i told would think i&apos;m crazy... i&apos;m very much sane and i am a systems engineer so I&apos;m very empirical and quantitative.

I was driving down the highway to bring a friend home when we both noticed a bright light about a mile or so up ahead, low to the ground.  As we continued to towards it, the light became brighter and still remained low to the ground.  My initial reaction was that it was a spotlight or a low helicopter or something.  As we drove up on the object, which was about 50 yards off to the side of the highway in a field with high power lines, we both stared in awe as we noticed a giant triangular shaped craft hovering above these power lines.  I was driving and my friend was in the passenger&apos;s seat, so he had a better view than I did.  I kept looking over at it every second or so and what I saw was a triangular shaped craft about 60-80 feet long on the longest parts and three bright yellowish/orange lights shining from each corner.  We took a right turn at the next light about 100 yards up the road and pulled right into a parkin! g lot next to this field.  We got out of the vehicle and stared in awe at this giant craft, not making a single sound, just hovering above the power lines.  As we stared at this craft, my friend gets in the car and pulls his camera out.  About this time the craft starts to slowly ascend into the air.  As he takes out his camera to take a picture, the camera reads, &quot;Memory Card Full&quot;.  He had just taken a pictures a few hours earlier of the night and had not filled up his card yet.  I found this to be very unusual.

Told my dad and since he stated &quot;I worked out there before, they are just testing&quot;.  I made the comment, &quot;How can you test something that is still? It&apos;s not moving nor is it being tested&quot;  This happened for about 45 Minutes but driving in that part of Texas is like driving in Colorado.

As I was laying in bed I looked over at the large picture window across the hall.After a few minutes I saw an amazingly bright light beam shoot through the window, lasting 10 seconds. Even though it was of a light quality I had never before seen, I assumed it was one of my other brothers shining a light in my face. I ignored it and was about to go to sleep when my dad walked up the stairs and asked if we had been messing around with a strobe light.He then thought that maybe a police helicopter or swat team was searching for somebody. It was then we all concurred that we saw something extremely odd. We all walked toward the window and then again, this time only about 5 seconds, and it vanished. We could see nothing else in the sky because the whole sky lighted up, but the beam branched out to concentrate in out attic.We have never seen anything like that before or since.

The time was about 11:45Pm.  We were visiting my aunt, in ICU in Port Arthur.I had just activated(the Google Navigator)on my 3G phone.  I was thinking to myself how cool!, we are tracking in virtual time on a satalite map...&quot;this must be the way we appear from an arial view.&quot;  At that same instant my friend who was driving,in a calm collective manner says, &quot;See I told you that there are UFO&apos;s around here!&quot;  I looked up, my eyes immeadiately fixated, to the top left corner of the windshield.And....Sure enough!!!  There IT was!!!!  Traveling east bound, about 200 ft above the hwy.  It appeared to be pulsating a irradescent/flouresent bright rainbow color, however all of the colors displayed at the same time........I find that words are very difficult to express completely what we expireinced!!!  There is just not any vocabulary that I know of that can replicate what we saw!!  However, I will continue at the risk of sounding completely out of my mind...lol There were three Rumboid shaped pulsating objects they seemed to be seperate, but yet as one unit?!?!?  silently/fluidly traveling east bound,paralell to hwy 73...  I have always had a scientific curriosity.... I asked my friend&quot;DID YOU SEE THAT?!?!WHAT THE HELL IS THAT!!!????  four times, I also rolled all of the car windows down and I opened the sun roof.  This was to reassure myself that we were&apos;nt just seeing a reflection off of the car&apos;s glass and the fact that my friend confirmed four times that we were both seeing the same phenomina. As I opened the sun roof, never taking my eyes off of the object, I popped my head up through the sun roof, and said WOW!!!! that&apos;s no reflection!!!  That&apos;s a Bonified UFO!  That very instant, the object made an immeadiate U-turn!!!!!!!!!  And now it was following us down hwy73!!!  I never once left visual contact with the object.  I jumped down into my seat and shouted &quot;THEY ARE COMING!!!! THEY ARE FOLLOWING US!!  keep in mind that this is a dark and d! esolate hwy at this time of the night.I kept my eye on it, while my friend was franticly speeding up to get away!  I could see the same colors pulsating 100FT above the pavement behind us!! ,but it seemed very different than what colors you or I are use to???!!! I was almost hypnotysed by this strange sight&hellip;  That&apos;s when I realized that we were not only being folowed but, also being monitored on a level that no Human/Animal could even begin to comprehend!!!  I could see the triangle shaped pulsating Rumboids getting larger, and closer, leaving and getting smaller, and yet not moving at all?!!?!?!?  well my friend, as strange as it may sound, all of this was taking place simutaneousley,  My eyes and brain were not quiet sure how to process all of this together!  We became panicked and sped up to approx. 120mph.  Again this thing never changed perspective, of course we were speeding, but the object stayed behind us, but not ever moving?!!??!!? My friend says to me&quot;STOP STARING AT IT&quot;!! The object got almost to the back of my car, then I noticed a yellow/amberish colored column of light slowly coming down to the ground from the object... then the column of light became very very bright, nontransparent, and became almost like an orange fire ball. I could see the grass and the dirt flying about ,under this fireball!! I started screaming&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;THEY ARE GOING TO BLOW US UP!!!!!!!&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; that instanst, the object started to wobble? And the air all around it seemed to ripple as if it were H20?!?!?! Then the object became one with the column of orange/yellow light, it reminded me of how Mercury looks on a hard surface. And all in the same split second, the object then became a bright large sphere, with the same pulsating colorfull pattern... I was shell shocked!!!! Did i just see that take place in this demension/this planet/this Whatever!!!!! By this time I could feel a presence in my persona,,,,not anything unusual,,,no strange voices, but almost like my subconcious ! was suddenly in charge?!!?!I never once felt threatened in that sense, but I was subtlely able to become aware of this new/unfamilair feeling in my head?!?! Sounds lunicital ,I know!!!! but like I said, there is no vocabulary that we have as a species that could come close to propperly describing these events,senses,feelings,&quot;phenominas&quot; We continued for for few minutes, then I noticed two cars traveling east bound were coming,after what seemed like an eternity!! I was wide eyed of course waiting to see if those cars would notice what was following us. Sure enough.......they all slammed on thier brakes and pulled to the side of the road!!! at that time the object behind us, backed down and in a split second, the sphere divided into two and disapered!!!!!!

The lights were small, much like backup lights on a car, so we just thought that it was her landlords working on a farm truck.  We sat by the mailbox and waited a minute or so for them to come out of the road.  When after a few minutes, the lights were still there, I pulled my car up closer to the lights.  As we approached them, they backed up into the hayfield.  I had my car window rolled down to listen, as the neighbors entrance, the first on the road  is where the lights were first-on the ground and their dogs were barking and crying and howling!   We didn&rsquo;t hear any motor noises from the &ldquo;farm truck&rdquo; and wondered why it backed all the way to the back of the hayfield!   Then the two lights got bigger and brighter, though there was no beam.  As ! soon as we saw them rise up into the air, we knew it wasn&rsquo;t our friends in any farm truck.  I speed up to catch up and the faster I went, the fast it went.  The , bigger now, lights went up and over the fence of the hayfield, across the farmers road, across the fence to the cow pasture and went along about 15 feet above the ground.  I was speeding at this point, faster than I would have ever driven down the road , maybe 25 mph, but couldn&rsquo;t catch up.

We had both  front windows  of the car open by now and can verify that there was not a single sound  of any motor or of any power plant within the UFO.  And again, there was no beam of light coming in our direction or any other.  The lights were just there!  We found out the next day that our friend, the landlady of the farm had seen the lights when she came home, about 30 minutes before we did.  She saw it in the area, above the river, behind the house in about the same location that we had last seen it.

Twice as bright as the ever is on its brightest night. It was moving from west to east. At first i thought it was a satalite. But i realized it was much to bright. My mind was racing trying to figure out what could be so bright in the sky. Im absolutley sure it was not a plane. It made no noise had no flashing lights and was way to bright. Its was not a meteor, There was no tail and the object moved in a straight line perfect to the horizon. The light began to fade. I thought it was going behind clouds. But the sky was clear and i could see stars all around the area of the object. And not a could anywhere i! n the sky! It faded fairly quickly until it was just gone. I brought my daughter quickly inside. Handed her off to her mother and went right back out to watch for more. In a matter of three minutes i was back outside scanning the north horizon when i saw a jet flying the exact same path. I could see the flashing lights of the jet and hear the roar of the engines. I stayed outside for another 20 minutes and saw one satalite. The satalite was much dimmer and much slower than the object i saw.

It also appeared to have area&rsquo;s of exhaust coming from several spots around the orb.The following night December 26, 2009, I took about 50 or 60 more pics and was again surprised to see many more of these round muti-colored orbs. There appeared to be human-like occupants inside the craft, I could tell because these things are transparent. Today is March 7,2010 , every single night since then I have seen MANY different size and shaped crafts, several of them appear to be VERY large. In the photo&rsquo;s you can see people inside, also what appears to be computer terminals and flat screens, with people sitting or standing around them. Also, you can see what looks to be  ( plasma warp drive&rsquo;s) or something. I have seen these on clear nights, cloudy night s, in the rain, in the snow. One time I was observing a couple of them hovering way up overhead, and it seemed as soon as I took a picture and my flash went off, they took off, it looked like a shooting star, it took off so fast, my brother happened to be standing outside with me during one of these events. I can go outside on any given night and capture these things on camera, sometimes I have to take a couple pics, then its as though the flash attracts them and then there&rsquo;s anywhere from 1 - 20,30 of them. I have many pictures, I haven&rsquo;t really wanted to report them because there is such a stigma attached to this topic. I know what I&rsquo;ve seen, I have proof on film, and they&rsquo;re not blurry images, you can clearly see thses things.If I take several photo&rsquo;s in a row , pointing at the same spot, they are never in the same spot, they are definitely moving. And there is like a roaring sound like multiple jets flying in circles, and then sometimes, no sound at all. They are very beautiful crafts, and super fast. My wife has seen the pictures, but doesn&rsquo;t care, she tells me I&rsquo;m losing it, even though she can clearly see the pictures. She&rsquo;s the type of person that ( just wants to live her life) and doesn&rsquo;t want to be bothered with them. I tell her she needs to pay attention, we don&rsquo;t know what these things are capable of , where they&rsquo;re from, Are they extra-terrestrial, or Secret Machines made by our very own Government. That&rsquo;s another reason I have taken so long to report them, I don&rsquo;t need no trouble from no Government Agency, or Black Op Project  messing with me and my Family. I will share the photos with you.

Starting with my last sighting.On 02/24/2010.At 1330 while driving on Interstate 8 going west, we were about 30 miles out of Gila Bend, I was traveling with my fianc&eacute;,  I had told her on one occasion I had seen a UFO on this same stretch of road, back in 2002, It was a relatively clear sky , as I remarked that we were getting close to the location of my first sighting on this road, I told her that just north  in the foot hill&rsquo;s is where it was, so she looked and  remarked in a hushed voice, &ldquo; Yea I see it&rdquo;, and so I looked harder and there it was, a  bright white ball of light, it looked to be on the far side of the hill&rsquo;s to the north, 15-20 miles away. I was driving around 75 mph. It remained visible  out the side window  &ldquo;as if traveling in pace with us&rdquo; this could just be a trick of distance, but  it remained visible to us while we stopped in Yuma for a snack,  and on till we passed El Centro Ca.  It never changed its Altitude or distance, to any extent visible to us, but did remain out the passenger window till about 1600, and we were going into the foothills.The first time I had this happen on this road was 8 or 9 years ago in November, and I was going East, My first sight of it was around 10:00 the sun was on my right the object was North by North East I was just going into the curves that drop you out of the foothills, my guess at that time was it was 50 miles away, I watched it as I was traveling on my motorcycle, I stopped for gas 2 times and it remained steadily visible till I was almost to Phoenix, that sighting lasted for over 4 hours, it &ldquo;shrunk into the distance N.xNe.&rdquo;", "7 to 9 objects glowing bright red yellow fading towards an an easterly direction away from Metairie la. we were looking south when we noticed a convergence of glowing objects in the eastern night at 9:10 PM 3-13-10. this lasted about 3 min.at the time we believed we were the only ones seeing these objects, but Monday morning we had customers coming in to the shop talking about these same glowing objects((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

At around 4 pm, while lying down on the grass,  I noticed 2 oblong objects floating way up in the sky. They were very very far up in the sky, almost at the middle of the sky.Initially I thought those may be floaters or some other illusion. However when I asked my wife if she can see the objects, she also could see them. and the number of the objects increased soon to 8-10. They appeared like white tadpoles zigzagging their way in the sky. Actually they remained in a small zone of the sky for a few minutes. Their movement seemed somewhat like Brownian motion. At some instances it seemed as if those were aircrafts performing some maneuvers.It was pretty difficult to track all of them as they were very small, and the sun was very bright. Amazingly they disappeared suddenly within 5-6 minutes. We could not follow any particular pathway or trajectory in which they went. They simply vanished.I do not know if they were some military crafts or some other technological stuff. but their appearance and disappearance were very sudden. I have never seen anything like this before.", "Four bright amber coloured lights spotted flying straight upward and into space over the Caribbean Sea in the Virgin Islands.I live on the south shore of St. John in the US Virgin Islands.  I walked onto my balcony at around midnight and noticed, at first, three amber coloured lights.  I ran inside to grab my binoculars (I thought they were helicopters) and when i returned,  I realized they were not flying in a straight line, but, rather, UP.   And then another appeared, as if it came out of the Caribbean Sea.   The first three I saw stayed in formation (I couldn&apos;t tell if they were connected) and continued to fly upwards...into space!  They fourth, which lagged behind, did the same and followed the same course as the others.  I also watched this one as it slowly disappeared into the clear night sky.  There were no sounds.  No flashing lights.  I have lived in the Caribbean for 15 years and I have never seen anything like what I saw earlier tonight.  These were not jet airplanes, nor were they flares.  These were real UFO&apos;s and I am stoked to have FINALLY seen one in my lifetime.", "This is the best I can do. If straight above my head in relation to the surface of the earth is 90 degrees, it was east-northeast at approx. 37-38 degrees in relation to the surface of the earth. It was basically just a small ball of light with no trail and a slight haze surrounding it. It was on a slow arc downward, and at approx. 26-27 degrees, it made a little more than a 90 degree turn at the same rate of speed and was then heading due north. We then lost sight due to trees and houses, but we were able to follow its course for approx. 2-3 seconds. I do wish there was more to add to make this more exciting, but of all the things I&apos;ve ever seen this was without a doubt the most peculiar.", "2 dark color ovals hovering very high in the sky for 20 minutes.One hovered up in the sky for about 15 minutes then another appeared right next to the other.

We just had pass the border patrol check point.  We saw some lights on the horizon to our right.  At first we thought there were stars, but I don&apos;t need to be a rocket scientist to determine if I was looking at a star or not.  I am positive there weren&apos;t stars.  We continue looking at the lights and suddenly they disappear in a fraction of a second.  3 days later, we were driving back on the same highway from out trip to Puerto Penasco, Sonora, Mexico.

This was a clear day with unlimited visibility and the object was maybe the size of about 50 feet round.The object that at that moment I assumed due to the metallic gray color was a weather balloon caught our attention because it did not move for several seconds.  The cluster then started to climb ever so slowly straight up and suddenly flew up at a blinding speed and then disappeared into the daytime sky without ever making any sound.Please note, I and my wife sincerely believe now that we witnessed an object that defies anything man made due to the fact that nothing could have been still like that and then moved at the amazing rate of speed it did without a sonic boom or some sound being emitted.Thanks for letting us share this, regards.((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))", "slow moving light switched off before running away faster on lower levelI was going to supermarket and i noticed a strong small light bigger than stars in the sky.  I thought it is a heading light of an aircraft landing as my area is in the airport landing way.  The direction of the light was from the west to the east and this is not the airport runway direction so i started to dout about the light and also it was a single light and aircrafts are having blinking lights plus the heading.the light was moving very very slow for long time then it started to become very weak slowly till it is totally switched off.  after the light switched off i could trace the moving object as it was a clerly circle shape shaded object in front of the sky stars plus a very weak green colored as if a lamp switched off.  The speed of the object changed and became very fast moving far away.before it dissapears i saw it coming to lower level and i could recognize the common UFO shape very far away before it disappers behind the surrounding buildings.Note: The weather was very very clear that night with no clouds.", "Unknown object flying at unusual patternIt was Saturday, Feb 20, 2010 about 12 noon when my friend and I were out mining in the area of Randsburg, California.  I was driving down the road and I looked to my left and saw what I thought at first was a helicopter.  It was silver and blue and it was traveling along the bottom of the mountain right to left.  My friend and I both thought it was working around a mineshaft.  We pulled over because something didn&rsquo;t look right.  At closer inspection it looked like three blocks one silver on top, and two blue on the bottom and about the size of a car.  I definitely no longer thought it was a helicopter.  The wind was blowing about 30 mph from our left to right.  We got the camera and took some pictures of the object.  The object then made a right turn and went diagonal up the mountain from left to right and when it got to the top of the mountain it went straight up and disappeared . It was hard to believe we saw something do what it did.  We talked about thi! s on our way home and we remembered that we saw a fighter jet the day before flying around, although we don&apos;t know if that is significant or not.", "Several Small lights at Different intervalsAt around 8:15 PM, I went outside to smoke a cigarette.  I usually scan the skies at night out of habit. I turned around to face south as my front door to my house faces north.  I noticed a light traveling north East.  It was a steady glow that at first sight appeared like a star.  I paused to focus better to make sure I was not looking at a plane since LAX is in the same direction, South.  I ran inside to grab my camera. When I returned I lost sight of where it went.About five minutes went by and I spotted it again.  This time it was traveling North West. Same speed but very high up. I ran inside to call my 2 kids and my wife.  Again, I returned to lose it again in the night sky. I asked my kids to stay with me as we scanned the sky.  We then spotted it again but this time it was traveling due east.  In the distance we followed it closely as to not lose it.  It kept its course east and disappeared.  We then looked straight up and saw the same kind of light traveling due north east.  This light disappeared the same way as the one traveling due east.  We spotted what seemed to be 3-4 or these lights at different times. Maybe 20 -30 seconds apart.  When each one disappeared a new light would appear.  This went on for a good ten minutes.  My kids witnessed this strange light that really appeared to be a star.", "Light Seen in Sky in Remote Part of New Zealand.I was outside this morning in a rural area of the North Island of New Zealand, about 45 minutes away from Kaitaia.  It was approximately 6:45 AM just before the sun had come up and I had been looking up at the stars.  I looked away for a second and when I looked back I saw one of the stars moving.It looked like a bright star and it just slowly moved across the sky.  No sound or craft was detectable but I imagine the object was very far away.  It took about 60 minutes  ((sic.  Seconds??))  for it to cross the sky.  Enough time for me to wake my girlfriend and have her come out and see it as well.It is possible this was just a satellite and that it wasn&apos;t actually stationary but rather came into view when I was looking away and just happened to crossed the path of the stars.  There was no blinking or coloration and it was definitely not a plane.  A satellite is a possibility though I have never seen one before.  I just thought I&apos;d report it here in case anyone else saw it or had any information as to whether or not this sounds like a satellite.", "Two bluish-green lights moving NNE over Arroyo Grande, CA at unbelievable speed.On January 18, 2010, over Arroyo Grande, CA at 8:55 PM my assistant and I watched two lights flying eastward, approximately NNE. Both lights were bright and bluish-green.One light was three times as wide as a &ldquo;falling star&rdquo;; the other light was a pinpoint, but completely observable. No sound.The smaller light was below and to the left of the large light and remained in the same position as they moved. The large light left a trail from almost overhead (when first observed) to disappearance. The small light left no real trail.They covered the distance from overhead to horizon (disappearance) in, say, less than 1/10th of a second. The disappearance judged to be two hand widths high.The sky was clear; stars clearly seen. Both witnesses are adults.

My boyfriend had come to pick me up from my house at 21:00 so I could stay the night with him.  We proceeded to watch television for one hour before we proceeded to go to his house which is the neighboring town.  We drove down from the top of my hill until we were in front of our local high school.  In the sky above the high school was gold looking light that we at first had thought was the North Star.   We first ignored the light until we noticed it was slowly moving closer to the Earth.  At this point we were freaking out because we thought it would make a crash collision with our little town.  I personally along with my boyfriend could not take our eyes away from this strange light that kept getting brighter.  My boyfriend and I first looked at it thinking it was in the shape of a body then with closer examination of staring at it longer I noticed i! t had bright rings around it.  The light eventually stopped in mid air and began moving back father into the sky in a right aimed direction and eventually vanished.  My boyfriend and I being skeptics can still not rap our mind around anything but the light had to be a UFO.", "Holden Beach NC - Big Orange Light  Over The Ocean In The Night SkyI was 50 years old at the time we saw this light, and my two sons were 19 and 23.  We were enjoying an evening of surf fishing, but not catching much of anything.  The weather was warm, and the sky was mostly clear with only a few thin, sparse, low lying clouds, and a full moon.  Standing on Holden Beach, NC looking at the ocean you are facing south.  We saw the light to our left a bit, in a south easterly direction.  I estimate it to have been approximately 25 or 30 degrees above the horizon, and most definitely over the ocean.  I did not notice the time when we saw it, but I estimate it to be sometime between 9:30 and 10:30 pm.What we saw that night was a huge, sort of light-orange, maybe even amber light.  It was not a perfect circle, but rather it was a kind of very soft, square shape with long, sweeping, rounded corners.  The first time I saw it, it appeared for only a few seconds, then faded out.  I asked my sons if they saw it, but they did not.  I told them what I saw and where I saw it, and, of course, they got a kick out of picking on the old man for &ldquo;seeing things&rdquo;.  After what seemed to be about 4 or 5 minutes it appeared again, for only a few seconds before fading out again.  We all three saw it this time, and the next two times that followed.  After about 8 or 10 minutes it appeared again, and again for only a few seconds before fading out for about 15 or 20 minutes.  It reappeared once more for a few seconds, faded out one last time, and that was the last time we saw it.The light maintained the same altitude and exact location in the sky during the entire observation.  I used the end of channel marker light from the Lockwood Folly Inlet, and the Oak Island Light House Beacon as my landmarks for pinpointing the light.  At first I questioned whether it was possibly a ships flare, but there is no way it could have been.  It was too high, too big, and did not fluctuate at all in its position or attitude.I did some research before deciding to file this report.  I know we saw it, and I know it was not an airplane, helicopter, blimp, or anything else I have ever seen in my life time.  I am not 100% convinced, however, that it was anything out of the natural realm.  But still, I do not know for sure what it was.((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

Observed a bright white light over the ocean to the West of me, at first I thought it was a shooting star but it had a level coarse headed right towards me heading East bound straight as a arrow, its altitude appeared to be 5,000 to 10,000 ft I took my foot of the gas and rolled my window down to hear its engine or whatever noise it was generating, however as it went across the front of my car there was no noise only the typical sound of air going by my window at about 45mph. As soon as it went by I saw an orange and white sphere on its stern the colors were moving in the sphere like an orange and white marble in motion. The object continued on its course to the East past Camarillo and over the hills as it was going over the hills the sphere flickered out. The whole incident happened within 8-10 seconds. I believe I observed the craft from 75 miles to the West ! and 75 miles to the East in that time frame.I have done some calculations and my deductions conclude the craft to be traveling at 900miles per minute or 50,000 miles an hour, which could of circled the earth twice in an hour.

I was looking out my two rear bedroom windows into the dark when I noticed some very odd lights out in the woods above a house on the other side of our neighborhood pond.  It was very dark but you could still see the dark outlines of the pine trees in the woods and the lights from the neighboring houses.  The flying lights reminded me of a police car&rsquo;s lights and I thought I was catching a reflection in the window glass from the room behind me.  My son&rsquo;s bedroom was directly behind me and a police officer lives up a road right in front of my house.  The mail box the police officer uses is also right across the road from my house.  The lights were almost standing still and then moved very slowly to the left.  I wondered what the police car was up to so I turned around to see out windows in the front of the house.  That&rsquo;s when I was shocked by the fact that my bedroom do! or was closed and that what I was looking at was not a reflection.  I stood up and put my face and hands to the glass to block all reflections from other lights in my room and I saw clearly a large set of lights in a very strange configuration moving very slowly to the left over my neighbors house. There were three colors of lights.   The largest lights were a pair of rectangular almost square lights.  The light on the right was bright blue and the light connected to it on the left was bright white.  Both of these lights were very bright and the shape was very clear.  Two small red lights were above these lights, one on the left and one on the right.  One small red light was in the center on the bottom.  The whole thing looked like a mixed up set of tail lights on the rear end of a car.  I was talking to my father the whole time and he said that I was starting to worry him.  I described what I saw to him and he said go outside to see if I could hear anything.  I went out my! back door onto my porch and stood on my picnic table.  I coul! d still see the objects lights very clearly.  The set of lights moved slowly, there was absolutely no noise.  I continued to talk to my father and I was getting very excited.  I knew that what I was seeing had to be something very odd maybe a UFO.  I was convinced of this by the slow speed, the distinct shape of lights, the brightness of the lights, and the dead silence.  The lights then moved on to the left behind a larger set of pine trees.  When I moved my head back and forth I could still catch glimpses of it.  The lights then started to come back to the right and then the moved back to the left even further until I could not see it at all.  While I was standing on my picnic table talking to my father after the lights vanished, I saw the small white lights of an airplane way up in the sky.  The light was minute compared to what I had just seen in the woods.  I listened and I could hear the airplanes engines.

Eventually, a group of about 20 persons in a large apartment complex gathered to witness these movements.First some background explanations, the witness used the term &ldquo;low&rdquo; to mean that the orange objects were larger than the stars in the sky, so the witness felt like they were at a lower level.  These objects were not close to ground level.  Also, the apartment complex pool is used as a reference point to describe the movement of these far. way objects The witness reported that initially 3-4 objects that looked like the color of fire were coming in &ldquo;low&rdquo;, moving from south to north. Then one orange circular object broke away this initial group.  This single orange object moved further north until it was seen over the apartment complex pool.  Then, after a few seconds that object disappeared. During this time, the witness said &ldquo;little by little&rdquo; other orange objects kept moving from the south to north, and when they got by the pool they disappeared. The approximate viewing time was said to be 15 minutes Then the sky was clear. The witness guessed there were more than 20 orange objects, but not more than 40.Approximately 20 people in the complex saw these orange objects.  Many were out because they were smoking.  They attracted more viewers because they were saying loudly, &ldquo;Look up in the sky!&rdquo;.  The witness went outside because the dog was barking and upon checking outside the apartment the third time the witness saw this group of people looking orange objects in the sky.It was reported from another person in the apartment complex that the emergency phone number 911 was called. The 911 operator was reported as saying that a massive amount of calls were received from all over.  Some of the questions asked by the 911 operator were:  &ldquo;Was anything burning?

Even my friends who are all skeptics about everything, Especially UFO&apos;s, Ghosts, etc., even they admitted that my story sounds crazy, but to have an eye witness who was sitting right next to me who&apos;s story matched exactly, overwhelmed even them. the part that really puts an image that they cant help but to feel something is the part about how it shot into outer space with the white trail following. the best way to describe it is someone hitting homerun with a lightbulb into the air at a million miles per hour , and it never came down nor made a sound.", "It appeared as aircraft, but at least at 100000 feet high.But 30 or 40 of them?  How?  We all stopped our cars and stared at this strange event.  At least 10 cars and 20 people.  I spoke to a few of them.  They all asked the other the same question, &quot;Did you guys see that?  What was it.  I took a few photos.  I only had my Sony 8MP camera with me.  You&apos;ll be amazed at what the pics look like.", "White light over Sens, FranceThat evening on returning home, I saw a strong white light to the east, when I watched it seemed surrounded by a blue halo and moved very quickly to the north and then disappeared without making any sound.I was astounded.I do not know what altitude was the object, the sky was clear and it was night.This was not a satellite or an airplane, they are seen regularly around here (100 km / 60 miles south-east of Paris)  Then a few seconds later an airliner coming from the south flew not far from the area.Sorry for the lack of information.", "Intense red light aura around flying from South to North. Duration 2 minutes before it disappeared. No SoundLooking south, red light approached and flew north in a straight line.  Upon approach glowed intense red aura around it.  No sound.", "Two large blinking orange lights 20 feet high and 50 feet apart moving slowly away as we approached.While driving home on a cloudy, dark evening on February 2, 2010 on a rural county road we saw two bright orange lights approximately 1 1/2 miles away on what we thought were power company vehicles.  The lights blinked in unison and then separately approximately 2 seconds apart.  They looked to be about 15 feet off the ground and about 50 feet apart.  As we approached the dirt road were they had been hovering, we stopped because the lights were suddenly gone.  The road is a dirt road which intersects our main county road and connects to the next parallel county road 5 miles away.  We looked down the road for any sign of vehicles, head lights or anything that would have explained the lights.  The dirt road has a small power substation adjacent to the beginning of the road which would explain our theory of a power company line truck being parked on the road.  The power tends to go off periodically in our area due to normal winter wind and snow storms so seeing! a line truck is not unusual.  We never saw any other vehicles, so we proceeded towards home again driving approximately 25 miles per hour so we could scan the horizon.  This road is on the west side of a very large alpine valley in Northern California and the line of sight available across the valley at any given time is vast.  The only time vision is obscured is when there is a white-out snow storm or too much fog.  Neither were happening at the time, only a light drizzle of sporadic rain.  After traveling one more mile the lights suddenly reappeared in the same fashion, approximately 20 feet off the ground now, still blinking bright orange and 50 feet from each other.  The lights were in an area well known by both my daughter and I since we have lived across from this particular field for 11 years.  There are no roads and no homes on this land, only alfalfa fields which had approximately 2 feet of snow covering the field at the time.  We drove slowly on the road never ta! king our eyes off the lights and as we approached our road the! lights appeared to have slowly moved away from us in a southerly direction, yet they were still blinking in the same fashion and just as bright.  We stopped on the road right before turning onto our dirt road and watched the lights for a few minutes.  They stopped moving away but continued to blink in a random fashion, sometimes in unison, then separately.  The distance apart never changed and was very steady.  The height of each light was exactly the same.  We didn&apos;t feel anything unusual and we didn&apos;t hear anything unusual.  It was very dark outside so we weren&apos;t able to see if there was any sort of aircraft or shape around the lights.  After we drove up our road we looked back down over the valley and the lights were gone.  From our house we have a view of the entire valley as we live roughly 1/4 mile up a hill on the west side of the valley.", "An unusual cloud with round discs and moving fast moving lights, inside of it.Driving at approximately 8:45PM on Friday, March 5th, with my 2 daughters (6 yr-old in the front and 2 yr-old in the back), my 6 yr-old suddenly became eerily quiet in a manner that startled me. After about two minutes silence she slowly muttered a statement such as, &ldquo;Oh wow&rdquo; and expressed she saw the blinking lights of alien spaceships in the sky! I was on a busy highway so I didn&rsquo;t glance her way.Of course my reaction was disbelief and we spoke of stars and such for the remainder of our 5-10 minutes drive home.East of our home lies an extinct volcano with a prominent observatory and to the west, the ocean, while we live in a small urban area. The sky was crystal clear, a typically pristine and cloudless Hawaiian evening, yet, when she and I hopped out of the car (it is a large outdoor parking lot), I spotted in the sky, a lone, transparent cloud hovering about 30 feet above us. As far as I can tell, no one else is around. I see around 30-50 lights moving and blinking and &ldquo;dancing&rdquo; very quickly inside of the cloud. Both of us rub our eyes wondering if our vision is messed up. The cloud is maybe the size of a small, one story home and doesn&rsquo;t move but the lights are bouncy and wild, like we were watching a light show, but nothing I could imagine projected the lights, onto the solo cloud, from below; it was absolutely illogical. I viewed it for maybe 2 or 3 minutes and it &ldquo;felt&rdquo; &ldquo;celebratory&rdquo;.My daughter studied the phenomena in the car for 10 minutes, and described it as 4 round spaceships that initially rotated super fast, clockwise and then, counterclockwise. One of the discs stood apart, however and didn&rsquo;t move like the others. The 3 disc&rsquo;s movement altered from circular to a more randomness, when we were in the parking lot. She also explained the cloud with ships, didn&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;top&rdquo; (lid) to it. I&rsquo;m not certain if she meant the cloud or the ships or both. As I was looking at it, my feeling wasn&rsquo;t of fear at all.My 2 yr-old needed to be retrieved from the car so I decided to attend to her and then watch the strange cloud after I gathered up my baby, but in a manner of about a minute the entire thing had vanished. My six year-old had been looking away, too, so missed its disappearance. I told her it was an &ldquo;angel&rdquo; so she wouldn&rsquo;t be afraid, and every trace of lights and ghost-like cloud substance, dematerialized within under a minute.", "Three dancing &amp; twirling reddish lightsObserved 3 reddish, pulsating lights in a triangular shape. The one took off slowly and disappeared. I went into the house to get my phone and call my neighbor and when I stepped outside with the phone, it wouldn&apos;t work. The other two were dancing and twirling around. Then they slowly began to move away and then they disappeared.", "As you have mentioned in the characteristics an aircraft was around the event &amp; that object had lights emitting around it.Hi Sirs,  This is not a joke or a hoax. I really don&apos;t believe much in these UFO&apos;s or aliens. But today i was very much astonished with this event. Today i was leaving to office (Am working @ night shifts) then suddenly i heard an aircraft flying. Just as normally i watched the sky but i saw a rather amazing sight. A triangle shaped or might be something else was moving across the sky. Then i thought might be the cloud was moving past. But i watched it for next few seconds the one was followed by almost 30-40 similar things &amp; they formed some kind of a Random formation.They moved very fast but they were like a swarm &amp; moved along swiftly. Soon they went past my eye sight. I went to the terrace &amp; some of my friends saw it too.Now i have no choice left to believe in these things &amp; &quot;We are not alone&quot;", "Daylight sighting of metallic sphere over golf course in Calgary, Alberta in Summer of late 1960&apos;s.This event occurred on a clear blue summer day over the Canyon Meadows Golf Club in SW Calgary, Alberta.  It would be the summer of 1966,67 or 68.  Since a number of highly credible sightings, which included photos during the summer of 1967, I am using the 1967 date but I can&apos;t actually remember the date other than I am positive it was summertime.Object was spherical, metallic-grey (gray), scratched or scuffed surface, perfectly stationary and seemed very close (&lt;500 ft). Vague memory of &quot;heat waves&quot; eminating around it but couldn&apos;t be mirage as it was well above the ground.  More like an optical distortion.  Appeared spherical due to sun shaping it as it would a ball. Hovered over golf course and was brought to our golfing party&apos;s attention by other golfers so there were more than 3 percipients.  Sky was very clear blue and the weather was sunny and warm and object was almost due West.  Gave up trying to make sense of it and teed off. Looked back halfway down the fairway and it was still there but slightly more SW direction which is another reason I feel it was very close.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))", "Re Submitted per Mr. Davenport request to detail the light description of objects.01.09.2010  While watering my grass at about 2135 hrs in Kapolei Hawaii, I witnessed two bright orb&rsquo;s swarming acrobatic like around one another over the SW part of the Island.The Blue and Green lights were like someone pointing a bright flashlight at you from a distance.  The color and intensity resembled laser light.  It was neither incandescent nor florescent but very bright light like a high intensity LED.  The lights both gave out two small sharp rays of light from the orb&rsquo;s body at a 45 degree angle towards the ground.  The trail of light  were small but visible. I thought it was someone pointing a laser light into the air but it was very bright and showed no trail from the laser&rsquo;s origin.I stared at the two lights for about 30 seconds in shock trying to make out what it could be, initially I thought it was a hovering helicopter or a UAV but they moved way to fast and in different directions for it to be any aircraft I have ever seen.  At one time the blue orb shot straight upwards into a low cloud and then regrouped with the green orb.I got my video camera but couldn&rsquo;t get a focus on the objects in time before they disappeared into the horizon.Both orbs are assumed to be at a estimated 5 to 10 thousand feet or more off my line of sight above the horizon.  My estimated of its location is off shore of the Chevron Oil processing plant in West Oahu, about 3 miles north of the Barbers Point Light House.I can not tell if it was over land or not but seemed to be just off shore.  It was impossible to get a scale size of the objects but that they seemed close to land.I called my friend who works at the ATC tower in Honolulu Airport but he called back and stated no reports from the tower.  I also contact a friend on the west side of the island but stated that he saw nothing.  The news had no reports as well.I am sure someone else saw it too.  It is possible for someone that was driving West on H1 Freeway towards Makakilo, HI at about 2130 - 2135 hrs.I hesitated to report this but there is no denying what I saw.", "2 round, shiny objects flying close to each other for about 45 seconds, one zooms off into the distance, didn&apos;t see where other wentI was in my backyard laying waiting for my dog to do her business.  Since its only the beginning of Spring the trees haven&apos;t filled with leaves yet so I had a great view of the sky from my small backyard which is normally covered by a massive tree&apos;s leaves.  I looked up and to the south I saw what I thought were 2 of those shiny, metallic looking balloons that have helium in them.  They were very shiny and looked spherical in shape.  The objects seemed to be moving slowly and then they started doing a sort of dance, flying around within 30 ft of each other.  Then I noticed a peculiar detail about the way they were moving.  We just got through a really bad storm on Long Island and it was our first day of Sun, a really beautiful day with few clouds if any but it was windy.  The direction of the wind would have been blowing these things away but they stayed in the same general area for about 30 seconds, staying close to each other.  I turned and went to get my camera b! ut before I opened the door to go inside I took a last glance to get a reference of where they were but they started moving a bit more actively and I returned looking at them.  They started moving apart and I saw one start moving upward and forward and it just took off in an instant, there was no vapor trail or anything,  I couldn&apos;t even see what the other one did as I was fixated on the one that zoomed off.  The whole event was no more than 45 seconds to a minute long.", "I saw a triangle shaped object in the sky above my back yard in Oregon.I was in my back yard playing with my dogs around the beginning of July of 2009, it was roughly 15:30 hours. All of a sudden out of the corner of my view something irregular caught my eye. I turned to look at it, and saw what appeared to be a triangle of white dots. The sky was clear, with few clouds around. I scanned the sky for just a second or two, and by the time I returned my focus to where the object had just been, it was gone. This incident has stuck with me ever since, and even though I saw the object for just a second or two, I can still picture it perfectly in my mind.The object as stated before was in the shape of a triangle. The three white dots were connected by faint white smoky/whispy lines which converged at the center of the object.In the short moment that I saw the object, I didn&apos;t see it fly or move at all. It was stationary when it caught my attention, and seconds later it was just gone. After it had disappeared, I could see no smoke trails indicating where it had gone, nor did I hear any sounds indicative of a fast moving aircraft.I recently saw a television program where I saw a filmed sighting of a remarkably similar object, which was filmed in California. After seeing this, I decided that I should document my sighting.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

At first, it appeared as a bright star, about the brightness of Venus, possibly slightly brighter.  I commented that it might even be the Space Station due to it&apos;s brightness.  But the light never tracked.  Rather, it stayed stationary.  We both commented it was not pulsating or strobing, but was a solid light that was changing from red to white to red again.  We watched this light for about two minutes, at which time I commented to my son that we would go home and look at it through the spotting scope and tell more about it.  At that time the light simply went out.  It never went anywhere, zoomed away, etc.  It simply turned off.  We have not seen the light since.", "Fireball over Dyersburg TNwe was headed home after work at approximately 3:45 on 3/08/2010 we was on 412 headed south from Union city we were just about to Newbern when we saw a fireball in the sky above Dyersburg it only lasted a few seconds and looked like a comet", "Orange flamed fireball spotted from Ajman beach 11.30pm Friday 19 Feb 2010Husband and I were sitting outside a cafe facing Ajman beach when to our left we spotted a low, large, bright orange ball, inside of which were flames and which was moving quite quickly.  It appeared to be coming towards us but then as it seemed to be getting closer it changed direction and veered towards the horizon, climbing into the sky until it faded out of sight.I asked my husband what he thought and he agreed with me, it looked like a fireball, the flames very clearly visible. There were no other lights surrounding it, no noise and as many airports operate in this area, planes are easily distinguishable from this.  This was a definite ball of light and as said, flames inside visible to the naked eye.We are not sure whether it was some jet engined aircraft or an actual fireball.  But the beach this night was very busy with people and this was simply too big to miss, so we are just waiting to see if others report it.", "UFO Crashland in Fort Madison Iowa high school football fieldMy associate and I were out for a late evening walk on March 18th when we witnessed a bright flash of yellow light crash land into the Fort Madison High School football field at what would appear to be a high speed.  Minutes later we noticed a rancid smell and smoke in the air quickly followed by the howl of emergency vehicle sirens.  We tried to get a closer look, but the authorities had arrived and would not allow us any closer to the crashed craft.That night, there were also reports of a flying saucer hovering over a remote park on the outskirts of Fort Madison, approximately 2 miles from the Fort Madison High School.

We arrived there at approx. 2 am.  My husband had already taken some of our baggage up the twenty or so steps to the house and was unlocking the front door.  I was unloading the few remaining items from the truck.  My little dog jumped out of the truck and ran to some nearby garbage cans, I assumed she saw a cat. I just happened to look up to admire the clear, starry night sky.  Almost directly above me was a huge, dark triangular shape.  It had three lights, one in each corner.  I was terrified.  I shouted to my husband &quot; what is that?&quot; he said &quot;a helicopter&quot;.  It was no helicopter, this thing made absolutely no sound whatsoever and the sheer size of it blotted out the star filled sky above me.  I called my dog a few times until she finally came back to me and I grabbed her up.  The object will still hanging above me, motionless and without a sound.  I ran up the steps to the house and as I reached the porch, the triangle darted off toward in a northeasterly direction.  I have no way of knowing just how high it was in the sky but it seemed to me that it must have been quite low due to the enormous span.((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

I walked outside of my gatehouse and was looking west toward the ocean.  Its a very clear night with unlimited visibility. I can see stars and jets at 30k feet strobe lights flashing.Out of the corner of my eye to the north I could see what I thought was a jet landing at fort myers intl airport or Naples even.  The light was small and amber in color like a Boeing jet.  It had a little kind of comet tail that was the same color as the light behind it that I could see as it moved closer and passed over my head going south.  It moved from north to south like it was flying down the Florida coast but at 50-100k feet.  It was moving a lot faster then the other jets and had no flashing lights of any kind.  It took maybe 45 seconds to a minute for the light to disappear over the South horizon.  It looked like a star floating across the sky.  Perfectly round amber light.  I thought it was a jet until it passed over my head going south and it was just as bright as it was coming at me.   Like the headlights of a 737 coming at you but when its going away.?  Jets don&apos;t use landing lights on at cruise altitude?  The object appeared to be very high and was moving quicker then the other jets that I could see and pick out in the sky.  I saw a amber ball of light travel from North to South at a high rate of speed that didn&apos;t look like anything I have ever seen before including the ISS.I also witnessed the 3 red lights over Naples park on new years.  It was a nice size triangle with 3 red lights that hovered and took off north. If looked like it had to be huge.  I couldn&apos;t see a outline but it looked to be one object.

I work one block away from the freeway; they would have been right over the freeway. They looked too spherical to be any other aircraft I know of. The UFOs were also moving with uncanny maneuverability and it was a weird m&eacute;lange of white, and a clear metalic sheen. One was flying more erraticly with sharp quick turns as the ortherone was keeping pace but flying more smoothly. The crafts were too small to be helicopters and far too symetrical.

He opened the blinds and began to yell for me,  &quot;..Come look! Hurry!&quot;  I was too late to see it from the front (west) side of the house, so we went across to the east facing back door and we both observed the object travelling extremely low and quickly towards the southeast.It appeared triangular in shape with several large lights.  It seemed to be comparative huge to normal aircraft.  It was definitely not a helicopter, by the size, shape, and lack of sound.  He said he heard some sound from the object, but I did not.  If it were a helicopter it would have been very loud.  They vibrate the house.  We do not live in a flight path and do not usually see planes.

The ball was the size of a full moon in the sky and appeared to be within miles from our location.  It was jumping around wildly within its trajectory.  Its movement was similar to a lottery ball jumping around in its case during a drawing.

The craft was larger than the strip mall across the street, at least two football fields in square footage, though I could not see the end points of the entire craft on all sides.  It was probably larger than an aircraft carrier.  It appeared rectangular or perhaps a very large triangular shape, but it was so large I could not discern the shape.  It completely covered the view of the sky from my window. I could see it&apos;s underside and it was slowly moving over a neighborhood of townhomes next to mine. I had woken up in the middle of the night and had a strange urge to look outside and that&apos;s when I saw it &quot;floating&quot; very slowly and very low overhead.  It was maybe a few stories above the rooftops of the hig! hest home.  It made absolutely no sound, and was a very dark matte finish (not shiny metallic), not reflective at all, with a very complex underside of infrastructure (i.e., it wasn&apos;t smooth underneath but had what appeared to be rectangular and other geometric shaped objects on it&apos;s underside protruding from underneath).  It had no lights anywhere on the craft, contrary to what a lot of reports seem to detail.  This had no lights whatsoever, and I doubt anyone would have seen it if they didn&apos;t look up because it blended so perfectly against the night sky and was completely devoid of any sound.  It slowly hovered away from my townhouse and then I saw it stop and start to move back to where my home was.  I always thought I&apos;d be the first person to run out to something like this and be proud to witness it, but to my surprise I was literally so afraid that I couldn&apos;t continue to look out my window and went hiding in fear.  I guess when something like this actually happens to y! ou, the perspective becomes one of instinctual survival.  I ha! d a stro ng sense that my observation of this had been detected and I felt very vulnerable and exposed for about 5 minutes and then the feeling of being watched just stopped.  That&apos;s when I looked out again and it was gone.  I wish I had had the courage to go outside and observe it more closely or get some photographs.

I looked up into the night sky because it was a clear star filled night. I then witnessed a Triangular craft that had 3 very dim lights in each corner, or maybe it reflected the City lights from below. The other thing that stood out in my mind is that it was dark, as if flying covertly. The object was traveling fast and only about 600 to 900&apos; altitude. It was difficult for me to gage the size of it. The object made no noise at all that I could hear.", "This morning at 11am I again heard the now familiar jet-like sound of an approaching craft.  I went outside to see a low flying jet of either the F-14 or F-16 shape.  Oddly, however, as it banked by raising one wing I saw absolutely no markings of any kind on the totally gun-metal grey plane.  Oddly, too, there was a smaller Cessna-like one engine plane flying very close to the &apos;jet.&apos;   At this time another witness, an TV/internet installer at my house came outside and I pointed up at the craft.  He looked at it and thought it was a F-14 as he was familiar with some jet craft.  He, too, thought it odd that the &apos;jet&apos; had no markings on it and that he thought the smaller plane was flying with the jet somehow.  The &apos;jet&apos; flew in the exact same pattern as the night observations I made, coming from the east, flying around my house in a low flight pattern, then heading back east again over the  town of Narragansett and out to sea.  I called the South Kingstown police again.  I reported what I had seen and the dispatcher said, &apos;one minute please&apos; as he went away for 3 or 4 minuted before coming back to talk to me to report that all he knew was that he was told by someone that the &apos;jets&apos; came from an air base on Cape Cod somewhere and he said that was the official explanation.  I thanked him for taking my call.  I then called the Air National Guard at Quonset Pt. in North Kingstown to see what they knew.  I could not  get to talk to anyone as I had on the morning of the 22nd, Friday, where a Sergeant with the Air National Guard told me there were no jets reported to him and none were at the Quonset location (only C-130s and helicopters).  He said that Air Defense in Providence would have picked them up on radar anyway.  He also said that he was at home in Narragansett the night before and had in fact heard but not seen the &apos;jets.&apos;  I also this morning called Senator Reed of Rhode Island&apos;s office to see if they knew anything about these flights.  A woman who answered the phone knew nothing but took my name and phone number and said she or someone would call me back but I have not heard from the Senator&apos;s office the rest of today.  By the way, I saw no lights on the F-14/16 like craft in this daytime observation as well as no markings on the craft.", "star turned into a bright flare gradually changed and suddenly lost the lightI was driving alone from my mothers house in Half Moon Bay to my house in Santa Cruz.  About 45 mins in between the two cities with nothing in between, and the sky was clear and crisp.  About halfway in my drive, I noticed one of the stars started to gradually and became incredibly white bright flare-ish light.  It did not move at all.  I thought someone shot a flare, or a firework, but it didn&apos;t move, and the light dispersed after a full minute of bright flare lights to a normal glimmering &quot;star&quot;. I pulled over to take a picture of it from my blackberry phone but it went away before I can take the shot, and my phone suddenly went out of power.  I&apos;ve seen a lot of things in the sky that COULD be explained, but this one I couldn&apos;t find a logical explaination.

I was sitting on a bench visiting with my mother when I noticed what I thought were 5 geese flying in a v formation from east to west.  After looking at them for a couple of seconds I was shocked realizing that they were not geese since the sun was reflecting upon them showing that they were actually metallic sphere like objects.  The sky was clear and the temp.was about 65 degrees.  With excitement I yelled UFO&apos;s and the 3 boys (22, 17, &amp;16 years old) came running to see.  I pointed them out and then I ran into the house to get the binoculars.  When I got back outside I tried to focus on the objects but I was to shaky so I handed them to my son&rsquo;s friend.  We were all screaming and laughing that we couldn&apos;t believe what we were seeing.  As they started to go behind the tree line we ran to the corale area in front of the house to continue watching them.  One of the spheres shot off back towards the east disapearing as the other four continued steady and equal distance apart on to the north/west- towards Austin&rsquo;s Bergstrom Airport.  They slowly just disappeared.  Right before they vanished a white prop plane (about the size of a cigarette butt) was traveling near and behind them to their south.  The plane must have seen them.  We heard the plane but no noise from the objects. The plane seemed to have been traveling faster than the spheres.  The spheres were low and slow flying well beneath the cloud cover. The funny thing is one of my son&apos;s friends was a skeptic until this afternoon.  He even said that he wished he a gotten a picture for the news.  It is 2 hours later and we are still excited and talking about the event,especially since it was a daytime sighting!", "Two White Star-like ShapesI woke up this morning and went down stairs for a cup of coffee and a cigarette.  When I went outside, I heard an airplane flying over head, and looked up to see it.  I then noticed a white balloon behind it.  This balloon did not keep up with the airplane, and moved SW very slowly.I then noticed it was heading for another white balloon in its path.  I went into my house to get my dad&apos;s pair of binoculars and went back outside.  I located them again, and when I looked through the binoculars I noticed a red/orange round shape between them.  I then realized that the two white balloons were actually reflecting the sunlight, and thought they looked more like stars.My mom came out on the porch and I pointed them out to her.  She had to go to work and that was at 10:05 am.  I had been watching them for fifteen minutes now, but after I said goodbye I looked back up and the one that was heading towards the other was now moving in the oppisite direction.  I followed it for a minute and then looked up at it without the binoculars and could not see it.  When I looked through the binoculars it was gone.I kept watching the sky, but the clouds rolled in and there was no chance of seeing it again.  I now there was a shuttle launch early this morning and that it was delivering a piece of the space station.  I was not going to think twice about it until I saw them move away from each other, and thought that was very strange.  I went to the NASA website to see the launch, and found that the red/orange object couldn&apos;t be the tank, because that falls off ten minutes in to the flight.  This took place six hours later..", "Light pulsating in the sky.I was standing on my doorstep, waiting for my cousin to arrive. (We were having a sleep-over.)

It did not look like an airplane as it did not move, and there were no strobes. It was very bright (almost had a haze like apperance around it), and stayed stationary and then vanished after about five minutes. While it was visible, I asked my Fiance to come out and look. She saw it and wondered what it was. I can not be sure what it was, but I do know it was bright, did not move, and then vanished. There was no sound from where I was viewing it from. I have looked in this direction numerous times before, and have never noticed anything. The appeared to have some slight color variations in it, but not a whole lot. It would fade every once in a while (but not go completely out) and come back very bright. All in all it lasted about 5-8 minutes total, the whole time not moving at all (had lined i! t up with a branch on neighbors tree).

It was partially hazy but almost completely clear around Mt. Lemon of the Santa Catalina Range north of the city. As soon as we stepped out of the house I heard a high pitched screech coming from the south (from Tucson). It was fairly high pitched but sounded like a commercial airliner. The aircraft(s) were in the haze traveling north. Since it was loud (so most likely low) and traveling in a heading not a major population center I will assume that they were A-10 Warthogs hailing from Davis Monthon Airforce base in Tucson (they have exposed turbofan jet engines and sound similar to commercial aircraft). I only saw on faint pair of lights and they were flying west by northwest and probably at low altitude. As the noise subsided, I looked towards Mt. Lemon and noticed ONE bright pulsating light coming from the northeast. It was brightly pulsating and at high altitude, pulsating at random intervals (sometimes many times in a second and sometimes one every two or three seconds). When it pulsated it appeared that their were green and red lights (one of each) in addition to many very small white lights on the sides of the objects. I am sure  that this was not an airplane as the red and green lights (like those on the sides of airplanes to indicate their port and starboard sides) as they were not constant and the white lights were not a planes landing lights as they were not constant or pulsating in constant time. Although it was hazy in most of the sky, the sky around Mt. Lemon and the rest of the Santa Catalina mountains was clear as the moon and numerous stars were visible  while only the brightest stars were visible in the rest of the sky. The craft appeared to spawn, as it sudd! enly appeared next to a star that I was viewing to the northeast. The craft travelled very quickly as it was able to transverse the entire mountain range in the course of about two minutes. As it progressed its strobing light gained in intensity. Although I can not say for sure, I would speculate that it flew at high altitude and was far to the north, most likely directly over Globe AZ. After about 30 seconds or so, a second identical object appeared behind and closer to the horizon, in relation to the first object. They were in constant formation and had a tethered appearance to it. The objects were definitely not satellites (as I&apos;ve heard of old tethered satellites) as they were very bright (brighter than the surrounding stars). Right before I went in the house to get the whole family to see (as only three other people were witnessing it) a third light appeared. The object was identical to the others but was far in front of the other two and was at an altitude (or locatio! n as I can&apos;t really speculate on its hight) in between that of! the oth er objects. The objects combined form a V shape or that of an isosceles triangle with a very small angle made between the first two objects and the third one in front. When I came back out with the rest of the family about one minute later the objects and any traces of them were gone.", "ufos looks like star but moves from one end of sky to other( south&amp; north) very fast.It was a clear night no moon, I was looking out towards southeast sky.

BNAS (Brunswick Naval Air Base)  Is near by so I know these planes, also Portland Jet port commercial planes are easily identified.One night while working for a engineering outfit in Poland springs I thought I was seeing a satellite  passing overhead. I used my field glasses to look at it and it appeared star like. It moved very slowly. But to my amazement it made a U turn and started back toward the direction it came  from. I have no idea what it could have been.  It traveled what to me seemed miles before turning back.On another occasions, and this really frightened me, I was going to work at the shipyard where I work. It was about 9:30 at night. I looked to my left and sitting up in the sky was an object with orange light in the outline of a commercial jet. But this was way to large to be a jet and it was not moving.  It just sat there what I believed to be right over the river. I drove on a block before looking back up. The orange lights were replaced by 3 large white lights in the shape of a triangle. Very huge. I set my eyes back on the road and suddenly there was this bright light that seemed to me like someone setting off a flash on a camera. It lit up the trees and the rooftops, and when I looked back the object was gone.

It  had yellowish windows that seemed to change  color to an orange-red.   It had tons of little windows the whole thing looked like a cartoon.  It came right at us and became 20 feet away.   We were so scared and ran off- we started to scream and cry.  We had left our phone so we went back for it, but we found it in our pocket.  By that time it had left, but we ran home.

I didnt see the top of it, cause it was right over my head, but I did see that it was circular from the bottm, so I assume it was a disk.  On the bottom of this craft, was 4 large domes.  The domes were glowing a milky white color.  The craft was about 25 ft. in diameter and the only saound this thing made, was a humming noise, like bass on a stereo.

We noticed a bright object in the early morning sky. We focused my video camera on it, we then centered the object on the video cameras screen, then paid no attention to it. We then talked about what we had seen earlier that night over the lake, then turned back to the camera, and noticed that the object had moved. We continued to observe the object until it suddenly disappeared.We thought that the object could have been a star, or planet at first but quickly realized that the earth simply doesn&apos;t rotate fast enough to account for how far the object progressed across the sky, and even if it were a star or planet the path it would have followed across the sky would have been entirely different.We then thought about the idea of the object being a aircraft, however I did not see any anti-collision, landing lights, navigation lights, or wing lights that were blinking at a timed interval on this object. The object appeared to be pulsating with no predetermined order, and flashing an array of colors.I further concluded that the object could not have been a aircraft because the object was on a eastern heading towards the rising sun so with that being said after the objects lights went off, the sunlight would have reflected off of the aircrafts fuselage still allowing it to be visible.I am former Air Force, and I have been around a lot of different airframes. I&apos;ve seen many different aircraft in the sky, and I can identify all of the airframes the USAF currently has in service, along with a good portion of those in the civilian sector on sight. However this object doesn&apos;t appear to be any airframe I am familiar with. Let alone the object was traveling at a extremely low airspeed, which in most cases the majority of aircraft would have a very hard time trying to stay airborne at such a speed. Not to mention the object was either in or extremely close to the NO FLY ZONE located around the Perry Nuclear Power Plant near Madison, Ohio.I eventually lost sight of the object when it suddenly disappeared from sight. I saw it disappear with my own eyes, an my friend saw it disappear on camera. We managed to capture the object disappearing on tape and we analyzed it frame by frame the best we could.

I watched it for about 5 minutes, it was still there when I proceeded to go on to my mothers.She lived about a mile away.She came out and got in the car, we proceeded to go to the store.I backed out and went to the stop sign by her house and there was the object up close now flying very slow over the buildings and trees.The object was very large about the size of a football field, it was mettallic in color, it made no sound, it had no windows or lights, it was between being oval shaped and mushroom shaped.This craft flew so slow it was almost hovering. Now the strangest thing about this! object is coming from the bottom center it had a black tube looking object coming from it about half the size of the craft.Now while I watched this craft I had the strange feeling that it was hunting for something. I watched it until it went out of sight, or as if it blended into the enviroment.I will always remember that day, it will always be very clear in my mind.And then the very next night I went over again to take my mother to the store, we go to the stop sign again, it is around 10;00 pm and there flying at an average speed was many bright white lights flying scattered all over the sky making no sound. When we got home we were watching the news and the castors were talking about the strange lights flying over Andrews Airforce base, and making jokes about them being ufos flying over the base. Now when I saw this craft it was around 11;00 am in the daytime on a gray cloudless day, there were no leaves on the trees,and I saw this craft up close, and I watched it for at! least 10;00minutes. I just want this on record somewhere what! I saw t hat day. I sure will never forget it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

At the back of the field there are woods to the left that go behind apartments but also go down a steep hill that connects to someone&rsquo;s field for their horses.As we were walking closer and closer to the woods I suddenly saw the entire woods light up as if there was a giant flashlight beam over everything.  I stopped walking and asked my boyfriend, who is that?  I thought it had to be a person and when he looked at the woods he saw the light right before it disappeared.We were frozen to the spot, it was the scariest thing id ever seen and then my boyfriend noticed a light on our feet, it looked like a bluish light from one of those high powered flashlights and we thought it was the cops, we were in the park after hours, but when I looked all around me and no one was there, no cop was shouting at us and the light was a perfect circle around us like someone was above us so we looked up and of course saw nothing but that was even worse than seeing something so we ran full speed down the field.We didn&rsquo;t stop till we were all the way at the other end but my boyfriend looked back while we were running and he said he saw an orb of orange light gliding down the field, when I looked it was gone but we started running again anyways because we were afraid of being chased.We didn&rsquo;t go back to the park for awhile but a couple weeks later when I wasn&rsquo;t afraid anymore we went back.  That night my boyfriend and I had an argument so we sat under the pavilion to talk about it.   I had my back to the field but he was facing it and he pointed towards the woods and told me to look because he saw a bright orange light in the sky.  I looked but the light was gone.  I stared at the spot for a minute and then looked away when he said it came back and this time it was there.  The light was small,  from our view point it looked like the size of a beach ball.After about fifteen or twenty seconds the light started to expand.  It just got bigger and brighter, and then the most amazing unexplainable thing happened.  It seemed to unfold and it went from a big ball of light into exactly what you would picture a UFO to look like, a saucer shaped hover craft, except the light was so bright that it didn&rsquo;t have a defined shape.  It was like the sun on earth, it blurred the vision around the UFO and after five or ten seconds it started to descend behind the woods and I assume it landed in the field behind it.  My boyfriend and I wanted to get closer, to go find it but I refused to go in the woods at night.  Since then I haven&rsquo;t ever seen anything like that but I honestly now believe aliens or someone not like us is out there, watching, or maybe waiting for something.What I saw has inspired me to look up a lot of information on aliens and I think when these UFO&rsquo;s are seen it is by choice to determine when or if ever it will be acceptable for aliens to walk among us.", "Slow/upward moving dark, circular object observed approximately above Mt. Charleston in NW Las Vegas that disappears suddenlyI had just finished dinner with my husband and son, then sat outside, in the rear patio area of our he.  It was somewhat unseasonably warm out and I was enjoying the upcoming sunset.  I looked in a Northwestern direction- towards Mt. Charleston- when I saw a dark circular object in the sky.  This object appeared to stay still in the sky for several minutes, when I called out for my family to come look.  There appeared to be no illumination coming from the object, so that ruled out aircraft or even a meteor, as there was no trail of smoke behind it.  My son saw the object and ran back inside to grab binoculars.  At this point the object began to very slowly move upwards and farther away in the sky.  Looking through the binoculars, my son and I saw a well lit aircraft that we presumed was an airplane (it was to the leftside of the object )and as soon as both objects were visible in the scope of the binoculars, the dark object suddenly disappeared.

We were unable to come up with any explanations as to what it could be.  Though it just disappeared so fast, we looked for anything that would provide information or an explanation all the way in route to our home.  When passing the Wachusette Reservoir area we were even looking for signs of what we witnessed, but saw nothing.  However, there was an increase of air traffic, including a helicopter as we approached the town of Clinton, MA. on route 110 heading west.

As I looked up, basically straight up but facing west, I noticed a line of dim objects, about 30-40 (I will use rough numbers in my description because of how quick event happened) and my first thought was that it was birds reflecting the city lights, but then the objects split into 3 separate groups, one with about 10 objects, the middle one around 20 and the third (farthest group from me) was maybe about 15, again just rough numbers, I didn&rsquo;t have time to count!  The group was traveling in a southern direction, from where I was in Sunnyvale, I&rsquo;d say they were directly over Mountain View, about 2 miles west of me.  That path would take them over Cupertino, Saratoga, then the northern edge Santa Cruz Mountain range (around here we call them the Cupertino and Saratoga hills).  The group was moving at a good rate of speed, it was hard for me to focus on them because they were so spread out, and I was trying to see if I could discern any shape, which vaguely they were each a slight V-shape, but I&rsquo;m not 100% on that.  The whole sighting lasted maybe 10-15 seconds, and at the end of it they all seemed to group together and fade out, which is why I think they were only reflecting city light and they dimmed out going over the mountains.   A group of birds could not travel that distance that fast across this valley.  I tried to stay focus on the direction they faded out but saw nothing more.  About 30 seconds later I heard a plane and saw its ! flashing navigation lights, in the same west direction I was facing but far lower, I believe small planes over this area have to be around 1500-2000 ft, so using that these objects were higher, but I could not estimate for sure what height.

Smith Arkansas during these sightings and I can clearly remember being brought outside so view the unidentified aircraft.  Although I was very young  (4 or 5 years old), I can clearly remember a few items:  - The unidentified aircraft were clearly flying in formation.My father (recently discharged from the Army) viewed the behavior and maneuvering of the aircraft as unusual.Multiple people in our neighborhood were out in the evening viewing the aircraft with a collective uneasiness bordering on panic.Real-time media reports (radio &amp; TV) followed the incident.The local paper had front page coverage, with photographs, the next day.Less clear memories include recollection of the unidentified aircraft hovering and/or landing at the airport and of military aircraft in pursuit (roar of jet engines and visible identification of military aircraft separate from unidentified aircraft).The timeframe for the sighting is only approximate, but -must- have occurred prior to the fall of 1966.  My family moved to St. Louis in the fall of 1966 (where I entered kindergarten)  Media coverage of this incident was extensive, so I am perplexed why there is no existing and/or available records of this.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

The best description of how bright the light was relates to the science experiments done in school when burning magnesium.  This light was not a flare, was consistently bright, did not have a chemical trail and left no sound/wake.As soon as we noticed the single, very large, bright light, it took approximately 1.5 seconds and it moved due south at a high velocity.  Within that 1.5 seconds it had moved from our position we noted to a point in the horizon we could no longer see &ndash; it had in essence disappeared.

I continued to look at this &lsquo;star&rsquo; which as high as it was I figured it was over Empire Lakes which is behind my apartment building complex.  As I continued to watch the star it started to glow bright and get larger.  Then it shot off north leaving again a yellowish trail behind it shooting south.  I was shocked but not surprised.  This also took about 30 to 45 secs.  Again I went in and told the kids that I just saw another one.  Again they believed me.The only thing that really makes all of this weird is that two days later I woke up at 10:00 am.  Everyone in the apartment, including the cats were still asleep.  I found this odd as my 9 year old granddaughter who slept with me at the time is usually up at the crack of dawn.  My cat Yuki cries at the door at 9:00 am every morning like clockwork to be fed.  I was the only person awake.  Gradually, everyone was up and about and seemed sluggish.  I discovered that I didn&rsquo;t feel well, had a headache and my throat and windpipe were extremely dry, like bone dry.  My lymph nodes in my throat were swelled up to bursting and I had three horizontal cuts on the bottom right side of my mouth.  I felt like this for about five days.  I didn&rsquo;t get checked out by a doctor as I didn&rsquo;t have any health insurance at the time.  I do have an appointment in March and I will ask the doctor to check out the marks in my mouth. Previously in 2003 to 2004 I had lived off Seven Devils Road in a secluded spot on the ocean on Tokyo Lane.  I didn&rsquo;t write down exact times of the things that happen to me while the kids and I lived there.  I was constantly plagued by the Coast Guard helicopter flying directly and very close to my house at 2 or 3:00 in the morning several times a month.  When I say close I mean just over my roof top!  I thought that they may  be rescuing someone but there were never any reports of vessels needing assistance and they weren&lsquo;t near the water.  One time I woke up to what I thought was a spot light over the house and thinking the Coast Guard was at it again.  I got up out of bed to flip them off.  Just as my feet hit the floor I heard the Coast Guard coming?  The light went out and I got back into bed to hear the Coast Guard once again fly as fast as they can from the station, south toward Bandon.I woke up one time with every joint  in my body on fire.  When I say joint I  mean every place that a bone connects to another bone.  This lasted  for about 20 min. and then the pain faded away.  It was an uncomfortable feeling living there and night time was always stressful.  I was fatigued all the time, the children said they felt like they were being watched.  We left in 02-2004 and the children and I were grateful to leave and move back into town.Apparently, it doesn&rsquo;t matter where you live.  I have shared this with very few people.  My friend in California believes my stories and is greatly concerned.  Hopefully, this will help and in some way be another piece of the puzzle.", "2 Lights In The Night SkyIt was around 10:15pm last night on the date of 03/24/10 when the three of us friends were outside talking about going to a lake tomorrow, then one of us noticed that a light was moving across the sky very fast with a trail of light behind it.  At first we just thought of it as an airplane or a shooting star but when we saw another one go in the opposite direction we payed close attention to them and then we saw the two lights appear out of no where and they just were sitting there and not moving but they were glowing and we all just were stuck thinking in our heads of what these lights could be. Then we looked at each other in &quot;aw&quot; and we were just flabbergasted.  After about 3 minutes the light just flew across the sky again in the same direction but it seemed like as the both melted together and disappeared into the dark night sky.  All three of us after that just started talking about what it could be and everyday we try to figure out what it was.", "At approximately 4:45 PM on Tuesday March 16th 2010, I was in my work parking lot in Tempe Arizona, when I noticed two very white objects very high in the sky.  They were nearly directly above the flight path for jets landing at Sky Harbor Airport, and appeared to be at an elevation that aircraft would need to be pressurized or at least would leave a vapor trail.  Although they seemed directly above the flight pattern for landing, I expect they were slightly north/northeast.My sense were that these objects could have been parachutes as they may seemed rectangular in shape, and since they didn&apos;t appear to be moving laterally, that&apos;s all I could think of.  While watching them for about 15 seconds, a third object appeared to the east of them but was a bright blue and of the same shape.  This third object reinforced my reasoning for thinking they were parachutes, because I could imagine that being a parachute color.  The only thing that baffled me about the parachute theory was who would attempt, or get permission to parachute in this area with such heavy airline traffic.About 10 seconds after I first noticed the blue object, it disappeared.  I didn&rsquo;t see it move or actually disappear, as I was talking to a passerby about it, but when I looked back up it was gone.The remaining two objects maintained their altitude, and moved to the west at what seemed to be a relatively slow speed.  I observed them for about 50 seconds, and there were no sounds, vapor trails, etc. That&apos;s it.", "Three transluscent, reddish-colored, orbs in a perfect triangular pattern fly overhead at a constant speed.This day, January 30, 2010 at approximately 19:00 hours, I as well as two others were witness to a UFO flying overhead. At the base of the Oakland Hills, myself as well as three other friends, were on the outdoor deck of a penthouse on the fourth floor of an apartment building. Our focus was on the horizon just over the hills due to the reason that a friend mentioned that the moon rises so quickly at night over the hill. While we were waiting as we observed the glow of the moon thru the fog rolling over the hill, two of the three friends went into the house (the residents of the apartment.) I remained outside because at 25 years of age I had never witnessed the moonrise before. While the other and myself were anxiously waiting for the moon to peak over the hill he shouted, &ldquo; A UFO, a UFO!!!&rdquo; I immediately looked to where he was pointing and I saw a triangle shaped object. It was three translucent reddish-colored orbs in a symmetrical &ldquo;pyramid&rdquo; shape. The top! of the triangle, the point, was at the head of the direction it was moving. It was moving at a higher rate of speed at an altitude higher than that of planes that regularly fly over the same area. Its rate of speed during the sighting never wavered. It remained at a constant speed throughout the sighting. At the time it was in our field of view, there was not one other plane or object in the sky. The only things in the sky in view were the stars. When he shouted, the male resident of the apartment raced out to the deck (back patio) and immediately saw the UFO. He was the only one who said he &ldquo;heard&rdquo; it. Myself as well as the other fellow who first observed the object did not hear anything. It was just &ldquo;gliding&rdquo; thru the sky. I have never seen anything like it.It was funny or odd to me that several minutes after the sighting, as we were all in amazement of what we had just observed, I noticed the sky began to fill up with airplanes flying overhead. This was odd to me due to the fact that when the UFO was in the sky there were no other objects present except the sky and stars. Several seconds soon after the UFO traveled out of our field of view, is when planes began to fly in their respective patterns overhead.", "sightings of moving crafts over salinas california in the early a.m hours of april 8th 2010on the morning of 04-08-2010 at 3:15 a.m i was standing outside in a well lighted parking area.I had observed a shooting star earlier in the night and was now casually watching the few bright stars that were visiible even with the street lamps washing out of the darkness.I was looking southeast when i observed two orange lights streak across the sky directly over my position,from the southeast heading northwest starting at about ten o&apos;clock high to about 3 o&apos;clock where buildings blocked further veiw of it&apos;s path.The object appeared to have a orange light at it&apos;s front that shone out a short distance as it progressed and another orange light at it&apos;s back or tail.The object appeared to be long in shape and thin.The object seemed to be about a 1/4 mile in the air above me and seemed to be about 200-400 ft long.The objects body ,or area in between the leading and tail light was blacked out against the night sky,but i could percieve somthing solid connecting the two lights ,due to the way they moved togehter as one and stayed the same distance when shooting by above me.I was very startled and reported it to a supervisor who happend by minutes later.The supervisor had been indoors and had not seen anything although he related that a  sighting had been reported the week before in monterey bay area and was upportive ,if not a little suspicious of why i chose to get so excited/agitated.The supervisor left me at my assignment outdoors and i continued to watch the sky,except now i was very excited and afraid.At about 3:50 a.m ,or 20-25 minutes after seeing the first object,i observed a second object 2 miles away, due south and about a 1/2 mile high in the sky or 20-30 degrees above the horizon.The second object appeared as white very bright light that was not blinking or pulsing.The object appeared in a dark section of sky that i was already looking at and appeared to just turn on in place and right away moved morth west in the same same direction as the earlier sighting.The white steady bright light was a few miles away from me and moved much faster than an airplane or satalite but slower and more steady than a shooting star.The second object also moved out of my veiw as i watched it untill buildings blocked my veiw.I was very startled to see a second unbelievable object and neglected to check my cell phone this time to record the time mentaly.At 4:06 a.m in the same section of sky but a bit farther south and farther away from my vantage point than the second sighting,i obsrved a third object.The third object was a exact match to the second object,a bright steady white light that appeared in the middle of a dark section of the sky.The thirs sighting was the same as the second sighting in it&apos;s path and behavior.I am very good at seeing satalites and airplanes and shooting stars and have spnet years ppointing out these things to friends,as well as having spent the past four months on my present graveyard shift ,where i get to be outside and observe shooting stars,satalites,and airplanes all night long.I never expected really see somthing so unusual in real life.The first object reminded me of the ciger shaped objects from airline pilot sightings re-enactments on t.v.The above statement is true and not any type of conventional aircraft or missle test,as i have witnessed many military tests and most aircraft flying today.The objects made no noise,had no trails left bvehind ,and were below the level of all but cropdusting aircraft.I am telling my event in the hope that others who may have seen somthing like this in my area will come forward and i can maybe learn more and not feel so alone on my experience.Thank you for taking the time to read this event as it happened to me.", "Silent, pulsating  lights flying parallel to HWY73, turn and start chasing us down the HWY!!My friend and I were in route from Port Arthur to Houston, traveling west bound on Highway 73, we had just passed the landfill(between Winnie Tx.)The time was about 11:45Pm. We were visiting my aunt, in ICU in Port Arthur.I had just activated(the Google Navigator)on my 3G phone. I was thinking to myself how cool!, we are tracking in virtual time on a satalite map...&quot;this must be the way we appear from an arial view.&quot; At that same instant my friend who was driving,in a calm collective manner says&quot; See I told you that there are UFO&apos;s around here!&quot; I looked up, my eyes immeadiately fixated, to the top left corner of the windshield.And....Sure enough!!! There IT was!!!! traveling east bound, about 200 ft above the hwy. It appeared to be pulsating a irradescent/flouresent bright rainbow color, however all of the colors displayed at the same time........I find that words are very difficult to express completely what we expireinced!!! There were three Rumboid shaped pulsating objects they seemed to be seperate, but yet move as one unit?!, silently/fluidly traveling east bound,paralell to hwy 73. I have always had a scientific curriosity....I asked my friend&quot;DID YOU SEE THAT?!?!WHAT THE HELL IS THAT! I also rolled all of the car windows down and I opened the sun roof. This was to reassure myself that we were&apos;nt just seeing a reflection off of the car&apos;s glass.The fact that my friend confirmed seeing the same object, I knew that we were both looking at the same phenomina. As I opened the sun roof,never taking my eyes off of the object, I popped my head up through the sun roof,and said WOW!!!! that&apos;s no reflection!!! That&apos;s a Bonified UFO! That very instant, the object made an immeadiate U-turn!! And now it was following us down hwy73!!! I never once left visual contact with the object. I jumped down into my seat and shouted&quot;THEY ARE COMING!!!!THEY ARE FOLLOWING US!! keep in mind that this is a dark and desol! ate hwy at this time of the night.I kept my eye on it, while my friend was franticly speeding up to get away! I could see the same colors pulsating 100FT above the pavement behind us!!,but it seemed very different than what colors you or I are use to!!!I was almost hypnotysed by this strange sight...That&apos;s when I realized that we were not only being folowed but, also being monitored on a level that no Human/Animal could even begin to comprehend!!! I could see the triangle shaped pulsating Rumboids getting larger, and closer, leaving and getting smaller, and yet not moving at all?!! All of this was taking place simutaneousley, My eyes and brain were not quiet sure how to process all of this together! We became panicked and sped up. Again this thing never changed perspective, of course we were speeding, but the object stayed behind us, but not ever moving?!! My friend says to me&quot;STOP STARING AT IT&quot;!! The object got almost to the back of my car, then I noticed a yellow/amberish colored column of light slowly coming down to the ground from the object... then the column of light became very very bright, nontransparent, and became almost like an orange fire ball. I could see the grass and the dirt flying about ,under this fireball!! I started shouting&quot;THEY ARE GOING TO BLOW US UP!!&quot; that instanst, the object started to wobble. And the air all around it seemed to ripple as if it were H20?!? Then the object became one with the column of orange/yellow light, it wobbled and streched,it reminded me of how Mercury looks on a hard surface. And all in the same split second, the object then became a bright large sphere, with the same pulsating colorfull pattern... I was shell shocked!!!! Did I just see that take place in this demension/this planet/this Whatever!!!!! By this time I could feel a presence in my Phycie,not anything unusual,no strange voices, but almost like my subconciou! s was suddenly in charge!? I never once felt threatened in that sense, but I was subtlely able to become aware of this new/unfamilair feeling in my head?!?! Sounds lunicital ,I know!!, but like I said, there is no vocabulary that we have as a species that could come close to propperly describing these events,senses,feelings,&quot;phenominas&quot; We continued for for few minutes, then I noticed two cars traveling east bound were coming,after what seemed like an eternity!! I was wide eyed of course waiting to see if those cars would notice what was following us. Sure enough.......they all slammed on thier brakes and pulled to the side of the road!!! at that time the object behind us, backed down and in a split second, the sphere divided into two and disapered!!!!!! I feel like someone else out there had to have seen something. if so please share. I feel a sense of isolation from people who have never expireinced these phenominas, Almost like I can not communicate to them the events that took place that cold clear stary night! I cant help but look to the sky every moment I am outdoors!!!! I am still a bit &quot;rattled&quot; not threatened per say...but I have a sense that who/what ever that was, is still out there, and knows where I am and what I think before I think it!!", "Very solid dark object in the sky. I was photgraphing another object at the time. I think it was chasing the dark one.Tonight I was just transferring pictures from my old camera to my laptop.  After transferring the photoes I opened the file with microsoft picture viewer.  Two of the pictures I took were of the night sky. as my fiance and I were On vacation.  In Brookings Oregon at Harris beach look out Parking lot on top overlooking the entire ocean  The sky was clear as a bell. I took a picture of what I thought was a bright star or rogue satellite.  It was pretty so I took a total of 6 pictures, 4 that I deleted at the time because I thought they were just bad pictures.  Tonight I noticed in the two remaining pictures. a Long, square, cigar shaped &quot;thing&quot;. its not really cigar its kinda boxed but in irregular not so perfectly even on all sides.  The thing covered the bright object I was aiming at to take a picture of in the first place. Anyway I dont know what to think of the pictures I am not an expert photographer, nor a ufo buff. maybe its something, maybe its not.  The odd t! hing that I noticed their were no lights, flashes, glowing etc.  The norm by ufo sighting of all sorts shapes and sizes. But the creepy thing that disturbs me. just What if &quot;aliens&quot; are smarter than to use lights but absolute darkness.", "Flame flying across skyIn an extremely busy business area, I made a left off of Business Rt. 1 to get to A1 Steakhouse.  I noticed a bright orange light in the sky moving from my left across the road I was on.  It was very low and at first I thought it was a helicopter circling towards the hospital.  But there was no blinking lights. Just a bright orange glow.  There was absolutely no sound from the object. Instead of making a left to where I wanted to go, I continued straight towards the light.  As I got closer I couldn&apos;t believe that it was like a flame with a glow around it, floating across the sky.  Flickering and moving straight across the sky at a steady speed. I quickly made a right into a parking lot so I could stop and watch it.  There was another car there with a guy standing with one leg still in his car, also watching it.  It was extremely windy that night, but the flame continued at a steady pace. It seemed to stop at one point and hover.  Then it began to move at a steep angl! e and disappeared into the clouds.  I sat there for several minutes stunned, trying to figure out what I had just seen.", "Black triangle/lights formation in triangle shape sighting with soundWhile I was watching the stars through a broken cloud cover, I saw a black triangle craft for a split second. I had watched it for 3-4 sec to realize it was a black (air)/ship/craft/thing (not stars) flying over a broken sky.To my amazement, it was a typical V shape, more like a Christmas tree V shape, rather than a B2 stealth bomber.  It was more like two converging rows of lights in a V formation, moving swiftly over the entire sky in mere seconds.  A few second later, a subtle low hum, much like a jet at high altitude,  the way you would ear it on a quiet farm.After thoughts: I saw it right above me, between two low clouds.  Altitude was IMO, for a craft the size of a Airbus 320, around 6 thousands feet, and with speed over mach 1, (really quietly), north bound.  The sound could not have been another high altitude jet, cause we can hear many every -quiet- day. I remember my surprise to ear such a low and distorted sound. Much like one of a quiet multi engine jet...End report.I think it is ours.  And I would hope, the US navy&apos;s skunk works.Because if it&apos;s not ours, it makes noise and doesn&apos;t look so exotic, like a silent disk.  But then, is a noisy triangle more human or terrestrial?", "Bright light, too low to be a satellite, hovers 10 mins. then abruptly disappears. watched with binocs.June first, 2010. Groton Long Point, CT.  I was sitting on the porch of my parent&rsquo;s home directly on the shore  of Fisher&rsquo;s Island Sound, unable to sleep (for personal reasons).  It was a perfectly peaceful, clear, quiet night (a.m.) I noticed a bright light hovering over the waters of what looked to be just outside of Stonington harbor (could have been more like Watch Hill, hard to tell).   At first, I thought it must be a heli, but there was no sound, and it did not move for ten minutes.  I have seen the satellites way up in space, this was at heli level.  Obviously, it was not a plane, because it wasn&rsquo;t moving.I was curious enough after 5 minutes of hovering to get the binocs out.  I watched through them for the next 5 minutes, then it seemed to spin (I saw a second light) and then quickly disappear towards Rhode Island,  I watched it through the binocs till I couldn&rsquo;t see it anymore (probably took about 30 secs.  For it to disappear.)   I was so blown away, and bummed that I was the only one in the household that actually saw it.  Surprised there aren&rsquo;t any other reports of that sighting, though it was rather late (or early).   Please let me know if anyone else saw this!  I know what I saw.", "My report of Sunday night April 24 9:50 pm 17:50 hrs  I was out in the open Night sky lying on my hammock with my face toward the northwest.  There was a spotty overcast but many stars were visible. I had just finished reading Edward J Ruppelt book  On &ldquo;A Report on Unidentified flying objects&rdquo; and was thinking that the reason I was not seeing anything myself was because I was not spending munch time.  Looking at the night sky. That is why I was here on my hammock armed with mosquito repellent and I phone with astronomy Apes.  I had just identified the brightest star in the sky Sirius and was moving my eyes right to the north and west.Suddenly high in the sky almost directly over my head I saw a meteor streaming down.It was no small meteor it was bright and was leaving along lighted trail. I was thinking this is a good meteor one of the best I have seen. I have watched for meteors for decades And have seen some good ones some much better but this had to be in my top ten.Then just as it was terminating in a bright red fireball a red light came on and begin to flash red and white and then at times I thought there might be some green but it was a fleeting green that lasted only milliseconds.   The meteor seemed to have terminated rather oddly it was larger and seemed to have stopped for a short period before becoming a red and white flashing light. It was motionless for a brief period of time and then began to move in a northwesterly direction in the general direction of Dallas, TX about 35 air miles away.  It seemed to be moving at about the speed of a jet airplane.I watched it for about five min as it disappeared into the northwestern horizon", "Ball of light, smaller lights flying, flying saucerOn the night os April 28th, A friend and I were outside smoking a cigarette, we noticed a giant light in the sky flying in a slow motion, the light never blinked and was abnormally slow.  The light in the sky was floated by and we were shocked so we ran to my backyard to check it out, by that time I grabbed my camera and took some shots, I only got 1 picture of the big light, I zoomed in and it is a perfect rectangle.   After that we were watching the sky and we noticed some small lights that resembled stars and I began snapping photos.   We followed the light not losing focus and as the small light passed what seem to be a star the star began moving in opposite direction!  The supposed star flew over us, and after that we noticed another one flying,  It seemed far away and it flew over my house.  I have photo proof of what I seen!

To the northwest, I observed a fairly large, black object in the sky above the trees but below the cloud ceiling (3600 feet, according to my local FAA Fight Service Station&rsquo;s data).  At first, I thought it was a hawk, as they do sometimes circle above.  But as it slowly moved across the sky, it became clear to me that it was, in fact, a solid boomerang or backwards-L-shaped object.  It had no lights and was silent (at least to my ears), and it didn&rsquo;t move like one would expect a gliding bird to.  As I reported above, this was during a thunderstorm, so with the cloud cover, there was no sun or anything else I could use to give it scale, but it appeared to me to be at least as large as a helicopter or a single-engine plane.  It was a solid, hard object, moving slowly and deliberately.It moved in a wide, horizontal arc towards me, traveling from left to right in my field of vision, and began moving to the north/northwest, away from my location, and disappeared, possibly into cloud cover.  One unusual aspect of this object was that the &quot;boomerang&quot; did not have a horizontal attitude like a plane, but rather a vertical one, hence the backwards &quot;L&quot; description.In the interest of accuracy and full disclosure, I should note here that I am mildly nearsighted and wear glasses for driving.  I was not wearing my glasses at the time of this sighting, and felt that there wasn&rsquo;t time to go and get them.  However, my vision isn&rsquo;t that bad, and I stand by what I&rsquo;ve described.So, I immediately wrote down the details of my observation, and went to my computer to look up what to do in the event of a sighting of this type, and then called the local police who, in turn, sent two officers to speak to me right away.  They listened to me but did not take a police report, and instructed me to keep a camera handy should the object reappear.  I then called the Center for UFO Studies to make a report.I should also put on record with this report that I&rsquo;ve had a mild interest in the subject of UFO&rsquo;s and have read about them and kept an open mind.  However, I never expected to have my own sighting, and can draw no conclusions as to what it really was that I saw, except that it didn&rsquo;t appear to me to be a plane, helicopter, or other known aerial vehicle.

It was late afternoon before sunset.  The objects were two large craft and a group of smaller craft that were flying to the north east.  The smaller craft were randomly dispersed around the two larger craft, and as the group of craft kept moving to the north east the smaller craft disappeared.  The smaller craft did not crash, nor was there any light emitted from them.  The two craft stayed at altitude as they moved through the sky and my co worker and I lost sight of them due to distance.  The craft did not leave an exhaust trail  I estimate that the craft were traveling near the speed of sound, and below the flight ceiling of commercial aircraft.  This is due to the fact that a commercial flight flew overhead at 20:18 MDT and did leave an exhaust trail.From my position the craft were approximately 5 to 7 degrees above the horizon and within 5 miles of my position. The craft stayed in sight for 5 minutes and disappeared due to distance.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sober minded.

As we turned west on rt. 78/24 we could see clearly that it was outlined in very large white circles of light around an irregular triangle. The body was pale green light and above and below the triangle was a shimmering red light.  It made no sound and hung in the air about 10-12 minutes that we saw it.   It was low--maybe 600 feet high  and very large.  On the roadside 4 motorcycles were parked and the drivers were standing watching it.

This is what caught my attention. I continued to watch at each stoplight as I drove home down Nimitz drive towards Waikiki. I did noticed two contrails following each other in rocket like arc. Then they would cross each other. I got home and looked at object with a pair of binoculars. There were three at this time. Only one came close enough for me to get a good look (about 8 seconds) I could clearly see that the closest object was a very bright silver triangle (could be from the bright sun reflection) the objects left short contrails that were shaped like a snakes tongue. These objects would perform criss cross maneuvers and sudden upward and downward arcs. I watched as a third object began to sort of dogfight with the two others. This was very high in the sky. Way above normal air traffic. After about another 5 minutes they disappeared out of site heading towards Molokai. I took about 10 photos. None are ve! ry good I only can see the contrails. The maneuvers did not seem out of this world. I was watching because they looked to be possibly, my first thought, cloud seeding because of the patterns. I don&rsquo;t think that was the case because the contrails were so short. I will attach some pictures. Did anyone else notice these strange aircraft?", "I saw a glowing, red object fly through the sky, slowly headed in a SE, then E direction.I went outside to smoke a cigarette.  After I finished smoking my cigarette, I decided that it was nice enough out to merit staying out there.  I decided to lie on top of my car and look up at the sky to watch the clouds pass by.  I sat there for about a minute before a saw a red light out of the corner of my eye. It grabbed my attention so i sat up to get a better look. At first, I dismissed it to just being a plane; I see a couple pass pay each day.  Then, as I continued to watch it I realized it couldn&apos;t have been a plane because the entire object was red, almost glowing like a light.  Then, I tried to say it was a a meteor, or some type of fireball, or a flare; but there was no trail of smoke left behind, nor was there a tail on the object.  It was just an glowing, oblong figure. It flew at a relatively constant speed; a little too slow for a plane, though.  It was high enough so that it was above some clouds, but below others. When I initally saw it, it was fl! ying from the north-west and headed towards the south-east.  However, I lost this figure behind the clouds for a moment and when I regained sight of it, it appeared to be headed east; at least a 30 degree change in flight path. I lost it beyond the horizon shortly after.I&apos;m reluctant to call it a UFO just because I like facts and tangible proof.  I wasn&apos;t able to clearly see this object, nor was I up close to it.  The I&apos;m posting this report now is because it seems as though there is no other explanation. When there are planes flying overhead, I hear noise.   There was no noise. It was too bright for there to be stars out.  Plus, it was much to large and oddly shaped for it to be a star.  It was moving too slowly to be a meteor or a fireball.  And, there was no trail of smoke as there would be with a flare. As much as my logical, fact-based mind hates to admit it, I think this could have been a UFO.The thing that really made me post this report, though, is perhaps the most unsettling thing. I came inside to research what it might have been and all that kept appearing in my search results were links to people talking about UFOs. I ended up on this website and decided to look at what other sightings have happened in my state. I came across a report in which the poster said they were on States Bridge Rd. near a subdivision named Double Gate.

They were going at super fast speed, and I judged them to be quite low (About the same height as the local air ambulance helicopter flies over)  I can only compare the speed of them to war zone footage I have seen on TV of tracer bullets fired at night. they were that fast.It looked like one was tailing the other, and both seemed to be darting slightly from side to side as they travelled forwards. They got to a point just over the school behind our house and without slowing just shot up vertically and then vanished in the cloud. They were completely silent.

I had no time to get my a camera and film them, and even if I did I think I would have been to preoccupied to think about grabbing it.(I would just like to add, even though I am quite interested in reported UFO sightings, I don&apos;t particularly go looking for them, and wasn&apos;t even sure if I believed in odd things flying around in our skies.  I have never witnessed anything like this before, and even though I am quite rational and like to find possible explanations for stuff like this, after seeing something for myself I have no idea at all what it was.)", "small object floating moving up and down blinking.I&apos;m looking at an object right now.

It was October 21, 1973 at 2:30 in the afternoon.  I was 14 than and working on by bike behind the house when I heard a whinning high pitch sound that caught my attention.  Leaving on a few miles from the local grocery store and the fan fan on top of their roof occasaionally make this sound also.  Realizing that it wasn&apos;t coming from the direction of the grocery store I walked out from behind the house and looked skyward.  There it was hoovering in the sky in a Northwest direction.  It was about 3 miles away. After spotting this object I ran in the house going through the kitchen yelling flying saucer.  I noticed the time on the clock that was hanging on hte wall above the kitchen sink.  I ran arounf the dinning room table to my mother&apos;s china closet and I grabed my mother&apos;s bincoluar&apos;s and ran back outside to get a better view.  With the bincoular&apos;s up to my eyes I could see that it was saucer shape with a dome on top and a dome underneath  slightly smaller than what was on top.  I could also see port holes going around the saucer just below the top dome.  It was silver metalliac in color and hoovering in the sky.   At that moment I could feel the air stand up on my body.

It was late, dark, and we were driving north east on Highway 7, when I noticed a white circular light in the distance.  At first I didn&apos;t think any of it. We were in the country, it was white and rather small, so I just thought  a light on the side of a barn, off in the distance.As we continued driving, the light never fell behind our car, which seemed really odd to me.  If it was a light, we would have eventually passed it and it would have went out of sight, but instead, it continued to keep pace with us.  It was then that I asked my mom if she saw the light and she said yes and had been watching it too.The drive was about 20 minutes and the road was fairly windy, and the entire time, the light continued to travel the same path as we did.  It also seemed to bigger, which I assumed meant it was getting closer to our car.  When we got close to our house, we turned left into our neighborhood.  It was then that the light came even closer to our car, then moved ahead of us about a block down the street and hovered. It was very low in the sky, almost to the top of the tree line.  By now, we are both scared.  We drove down towards it, and made another left onto my street. Our house was two houses on the left.  We pulled into our driveway and my mom ran inside the house to get my dad.  It was at that point, the light suddenly went from white to several bright flashing colors, yellow, white, red, blue...

Then It got a little lower but what i really noticed is it started to become more parallel to me at my 9 o&apos;clock so I knew I was right beside it. Past the hills on Woodford I started to notice it become even lower and go even past my 9. So I pulled over on this dirt road (lee witt rd), and I couldn&apos;t see it all. I had lost it in the trees before i turned of 321, then through the trees I noticed a outside light prob from a house and another brighter light, possibly the light itself, much lower now. So I did a 3 point turn and turned back to 321. Then I drove about 30 feet, killed the lights and got out, looking directly NE behind the truck. I saw it again!! Much lower prob 100 feet above the tree line in the distance. So I got! the flashlight,  and went into the field about 6-7 feet and could see it perfectly. Due NE, have no idea if it was 1-2-4 miles away b/c all it was white light. I swear for a sec i thought it had a searchlight on but it was like 1/2 sec only.

We were driving west on Colburn Road heading toward Highway 291 in Lee&rsquo;s Summit, MO. The sky was clear to partly cloudy and there was little or no wind. There is a small airport near Colburn Road on Douglas Road in Lee&rsquo;s Summit and I often watch the planes come and go while driving that strip of road. Tonight I was watching what I thought was a plane. The object had one red light and two white lights, pretty typical of the small planes which fly out of the tiny airport, except none of the lights on this plane were flashing like they usually do. I did not think anything of this because many times when a plane is coming at me head on, I cannot see the flashing tail light. As I got closer to the object I realized it was not a plane. The object was in the west heading east. I was driving west on Colburn Road. We had just passed Lake Jacomo and were i! n the outskirts of Lee&rsquo;s Summit. As I got closer and finally under the object I looked up and realized the object was a black triangle and not a plane. It was completely black except for the three lights. I am an educated person who has a B.A. in Psychology and I am currently pursuing a Master&rsquo;s in Counseling. I am aware of the Gestalt Theories and this was not my brain &ldquo;filling in&rdquo; lines. The sky blackened and there was no background filter light between the three lights on the object as it flew past me. The object was flying low and the night sky was not yet completely dark so I was able to get a very good look at it. I said something to my daughter who then looked at it and got very excited exclaiming, &ldquo;I see it mom it is a triangle! I see it! I see it!&rdquo; My next thought was it was a B2 bomber because Whiteman Air Force Base is only about 45 minutes away. However, as low as the object was flying it definitely was not a B2 because it was way too small. I have seen those fl! y around our area quite often and they are huge, especially wh! en flyin g low. I asked my daughter if she could track it, and she said she could. I made a u-turn to try and follow the object so I could get ahead of it and stop the car to get a really good look at it while standing still and hopefully take a picture on my cell phone. Unfortunately I lost the object in the street lights when I started heading east. While I was driving west the lights had been on the north side as I looked west. I was basically looking away from the lights and they were on my right side, which was the passenger side of the car. Now that I was driving east, the lights were shining in my eyes on the driver&rsquo;s side of the car and I could not see the object anymore. However, my daughter still had the object in her sight and I followed it as she guided me. Then as I approached the intersection of 7 Highway and Colburn Road, my daughter stated the object had suddenly shot straight up into the sky and disappeared into some clouds. We lost the object and I was unable to get! a really good look at it while standing still. I don&rsquo;t know if anyone else witnessed this object in Lee&rsquo;s Summit tonight and I don&rsquo;t know exactly what it was. I can only say what it was not. It was not a B2 Bomber because it was too small; and it was not one of the small planes that fly out of the municipal airport in Lee&rsquo;s Summit because I have never seen any of those planes make that triangle shape. I drive that area daily and nightly to and from work and school and I have lived here for 10 years. I have seen planes come and go from that tiny municipal airport day and night and none of the planes have ever made the triangle shape I saw tonight. Though I am a believer in UFO&rsquo;s, whenever I observe anything in the sky I do so with a very skeptical mindset. I always think of all possibilities before saying what I saw was &ldquo;unexplained.&rdquo; Tonight I honestly cannot think of anything that is as small as the object I saw and makes the shape of the black triangle which I saw in the! sky earlier this evening.", "Large twinkling/flashing light with smaller one across from it, spinning like a batonEvery night my mother and I stand in the back patio and smoke a cigarette before bed.  We live near the Riverside Airport, so we always see helicopters, commercial airplanes and jets fly over us.  At about 11:34-36ish at night, I&apos;m looking up at the night sky taking a drag when I notice a twinkling, moving light.  Thinking it&apos;s probably a plane or chopper, I just kept watching the sky. But then I noticed that the twinkling/flashing light was moving pretty fast, and was hovering above a smaller light.  As it flew before me, it spinned like a baton at least three times before I noticed it was somewhat cigar/rod shaped.Meanwhile, I was also trying to get my mother&apos;s attention without keeping my eyes off the UFO.  I tried to speak, but all I could say was &quot;Oh my G-d!&quot; and &quot;Look!&quot;.  My mother didn&apos;t see anything except the larger twinkling light.  From what I can recall she was either staring at me to try and understand what I was saying or behind me putting something away in the backyard.  I wouldn&apos;t call her a witness because 1) she wasn&apos;t looking at the sky and 2) she wears triple-lense reading glasses and we were outside in the dark with no lights on.I would call myself an observer.  Every-night I look into the night sky.  Every time we&apos;re on a road trip to Vegas, I see at least five shooting stars on the way there and back.  When I was three months pregnant with my boy, I saw what I believe today to have been a comet.  But what I saw about an hour and a half ago was nothing like this.  It was just so surreal, I almost had an anxiety attack.  Funny thing is, now there&apos;s a bunch of loud choppers flying over my house, there&apos;s been at least three already.  Whoever is reading this may choose to swallow it with a grain of salt, but only those who saw it too can vouch for me.", "Unknow light in sky headed toward TiptonLast night around 7:15pm my wife came inside from the car and took me outside there had been several people driving in the street that stoped and the neighbors next door were also outside looking up at what appeared to be some type of a fireball that was moving at a good rate of speed.

While driving down Latta Rd. we both noticed two bright amber lights in the night sky.  The lights appeared to be around 4-5 blocks in distance from each other.  The lights moved in unision as if they were attached beneath an object.  My husband stopped the car and we both stepped out to get a better look.  The object and the lights continued to glide northward in the sky.  The object seemed to be less than a mile from the ground and floated noiselessly.

I realized this because the o&apos;hare and midway flight traffic continued as normal and these crafts were moving in a totally different pattern.  my vantage point was looking southwest.  these objects were ascending southwest to northeast.  Two objects out front, followed by one single object in the center of the formation, followed by two objects at the tail end of the formation.  they ascended into the stars much like the last nighttime launch of the space shuttle of which i saw first hand.

I was on hwy 21 going south and I watched it cross over I-77, clearing the tree line and one of the foothills that we have in our area. The Fireball was about the size of those blue plastic kiddy pools. The fire trail behind it looked to be about 8ft long. It appeared so fast but it took a bit longer to disappear because the viewing area was not blocked by objects. I do not scare very easily, I am a retired Nurse and I am trained to be observant, however this thing had me so upset that I sat in the middle of the road for several minutes before I could calm down enough to drive. I honestly thought that it was going to hit us when I first got a glimpse of the fire from my peripheral vision! .

We pulled into a parking area near one of the formation.  The night was clear, the sky wonderful.  We stood and admired the shadows of the formations and quickly noticed a significant numbers of meteors.  My daughter saw one with a tail squiggle.  There were about 8 sighted in about 15 minutes.  We live in Glendale, so its been since the Leonids of 2001 that we saw so many.  My son sighted a mid-brightness star between a stand of trees.  I would guess the object was at least 20 miles ahead.

We were listening to my transistor radio; it was after midnight and the guys were inside the cottage.  We had consumed no alcohol or drugs and were just enjoying the cool, rather misty night, and each other&apos;s company.  We worked together at an advertising agency during the week, at Yonge Street &amp; Eglinton Avenue East in Toronto.All of a sudden, we heard a very faint whirring sound behind us overhead, and both looked up above the cottage roof where it originated from, at the same time.  What we saw there was this...a large, silver object which appeared perfectly round, beaming some kind of light on us.  Our jaws dropped, and we simply sat there frozen, stunned and terrified for a few seconds, which was how long it took me to receive a silent communication which was,&quot;you&apos;re afraid&quot;.  Then, the object took off upward, resembling what I could very loosely compare to the Roadrunner in the old cartoons when he was under chase, said &quot;beep beep&quot;, and ended up way beyond the mountains on the horizon in a matter of seconds.  Only now it was who-knows-how-many-miles directly above our heads (this was probably what is known as a &quot;hyperspace&quot; move); it then did a slow rectangular trajectory, then disappeared behind a cloud.  Perhaps it joined with something else, because what we witnessed next, through the clouds w! as a huge mass of light moving up, up and away into the northeastern sky.I lay awake that night, half-expecting &quot;little green men&quot; to come knocking at the door.  Our husbands were kind of in disbelief at our shared experience, I guess you can&apos;t blame them, but we saw what we saw, and looking back, I now consider myself extremely lucky and perhaps even chosen to have had them come and observe my friend and I that night ... it was definitely the highlight of my life.I would love to hear from others who have had sightings!

I saw that it was a black flying wing/chevron shaped craft made of just 2 wings joined together at an angle of approximately 160 degrees. Each wing was a long narrow black rectangle; the &quot;wingtip&quot; edges did not taper at all and were squared off at 90 degrees, but with rounded corners. Arrayed along these wings were 7 round, white, non-blinking lights equidistant from each other and the front and rear edges, from tip to tip; the fourth central light was right on the central axis where the 2 wings would join (if they were separate pieces). The diameter of each of these 7 lights was approximately 50% of the width of the wing from the front edge to the back edge.It is very difficult to judge never having been close to the craft to get a sense of scale, but its size may have been as much as 180 - 200 feet from left to right, and it may have been traveling at an altitude of 1200 feet. It is also possible that it was a larger craft traveling faster and higher, or a smaller craft traveling lower and slower; at any rate the speed I observed it moving at was almost leisurely. Its direction of movement was due west, or with a very slight northwest component, and it was silent. It was in my line of sight for 3-4 seconds before it moved out of sight behind the roofline of the entrance to the Aria.", "two sets of five/six bright yellow lights too high to be an animal, too low/big to be aircraft /star appear out of nowhere in rural ILDriving home, I turned into my drive way (150 ft) to my rural home.  Half way down the drive way, I noticed a bright yellow light in the sky which quickly turned into two lights. Then to the right of the lights another one appeared, then two or three more on the right side.  The lights were almost in a hooking pattern like they were around a disc-shaped aircraft.  Quickly, almost the exact same thing happened to the right of the first set of lights.  One light turned into two then quickly into five or six. It was way too big to be a plane.  The lights were not as high up in the sky as a plane would be. The lights were also too far apart to be anything like a plane.  It was like they were lights on a disc-shaped aircraft.

I was terrified.  I was so scared that I couldn&apos;t speak for two or three minutes. I ran back outside to look back up into the sky and they were gone.  I was shaking bad for about thirty minutes. I continued to shake the rest of the night and had goose bumps for hours afterward.  I have never believed in this sort of thing and it really shook me up.  I have never been anything even close to as scared as I was for that night.  I was shaking the rest of the night and ended up sleeping with my lights on, afraid to go back outside.I know there is no way this could have been any sort of star (they was too close and were bright yellow), aircraft (they were too close and appeared out of nowhere), or any thing else that I&apos;ve ever seen in the sky.

It traveled east and blinked out before it reached the tree line. The light was bright white, and blinking, but there&rsquo;s no way an airplane was moving that fast-it literally took only a couple of seconds to cross the sky. There was no engine noise, no sonic boom, just the light.Weather was partly cloudy, and there was a storm to our south, with lightening that we could see on the horizon. There were fireflies out-however, this was definitely not a firefly, because the color of the light was too white to be a lightening bug (our local fireflies are usually green), and the blinking was too fast.

My boyfriend and I were walking into the mall on night and I noticed an unusual light in the sky and we decided when we left the mall if it was still there we would go look for it.  When we came out it was still there but had moved slightly.  So we drove up to Hyde Park where the lookout spot is and could see a disk like object hovering above Santa Fe.The sightings I am reporting now are above Taneytown, MD.  I have not lived here long but since I have moved here I have been noticing different things.  Last winter I saw a falling object over a local park, it was too large to be a falling star.  I have noticed an object that travels parallel with a main road- the lighted object moves so slow it is almost not noticeable it is moving unless you are actually watching it.I have also noticed that around 9pm there is a light in the sky behind where we live.  To give an idea of the diameter; stars vs. &quot;the light&quot;   it is like the stars are pin-heads and &ldquo;the light&rdquo; is a pencil eraser.  The light is not directly above me when I see it; it is off in the distance a bit. To show attempt to express the distance it travels within an amount of time; if you were to go on my back porch with a ruler and hold it up, the bottom of the ruler lined up with the roof top of the house-- the light starts out about 12 inches above the house diagonally behind us, then by 10pm the light is level with the chimney top of the same house.  Not sure how else to explain it.  The light is not directly above the house it is off in a distance.  Just using perspective to explain how it moves.  Also it does not move in a straight line &ndash; it slowly zigzags as it moves forward.  My friend and I went looking for it the other night but it was slightly cloudy out and lost it.  We a! re going to attempt it again on another night.  This light is out there every night &ndash; but I have not noticed it on rainy nights because I don&rsquo;t go out there when it is raining.Earlier tonight I saw something in my peripheral vision above me out front.  It was a very large green glow shooting across the sky.  It was round in the front and it definitely was not a shooting star, if I would have held my fist in the air it would have been bigger than my fist.

I followed the light from west to east and noticed there were no blinking lights.  I thought I saw the light moving a bit chaotic, but the lack of stars to reference it against made it difficult.  It wasn&apos;t zigzagging, but sort of slowing down and speeding up, slowing down and speeding up.  I thought, since my reference wasn&apos;t great that it could be an airplane or helicopter, and i just couldn&apos;t see the beacons, and as I thought this, it slowly faded away to nothing.  The object was simply a light.  Again, I thought this could be an aircraft, but the lack of blinking lights made me think.  If it continued without fading, I&apos;d assume it were a satellite or the shuttle, but the fact that it disappeared made me question its make up.", "We saw a strange light in the sky and on the same night, saw two strange looking men in a grocery store, one of which, I spoke with.Not sure of the exact date but sometime in september of 2008 many residents of Virginia Beach saw an unidentified object in the sky.

He spoke in a strange accent(even though his english was perfect), the way it came out sounded very monotone and far away.  He didn&apos;t turn away from his magazine and wouldn&apos;t look me in the eyes, which I also found strange.

There was no moon in the sky  and the area is a farming valley so except for my headlights there was no other sources of light in the area.  I happened to look to the Eastern horizon and slightly north when I noticed four red lights in the sky in a diamond shaped pattern hanging what  appeared to be approximately 200-300 feet above the Northern mountain range.   Although these lights were in the distance I wasn&rsquo;t sure at the time what they truly were.  These lights were stationary and were constant at all times.As I continued to drive East I was beginning to notice that I was becoming aware that I was getting closer to these lights in the sky.  Growing up around an airport most of my life I knew an airplane or helicopter when I seen one, such as a strobe light on such craft.  These lights always kept the same distance telling me that they were on a craft and were apparently on one side of this craft, but because of the extreme darkness in the area I couldn&rsquo;t tell you what this craft look like.  For the next 20 minutes I continues to see this light pattern in the sky.As I approached an area of this freeway, where the freeway would now turn to go around portions of the Northern mountain side that came towards the valley floor I could not see the lights due to my view being block. As I came around the curve in the road, out of thin area four large orbs of light appeared over a little mountain right in front my view.  These lights were large, as large as a house, and were of white light with speckles of grey within the orb.  Each orb had a halo surrounding it in what was the same color as lighting yellow and lit up the top of this mountain, which had a power line tower on top of it,.  These orbs were also in a diamond shape configuration.  Although I had my radio on in the car I could hear an electrical discharge as they appeared.  Within a second or two from appearing they quickly disappeared back into thin air. I&rsquo;ll tell you that I was keeping my eyes on the road and trying to make sense of way I had just appeared and disappeared in front of m! e.

Now I was approaching two sets of four red lights in the sky in a diamond shaped pattern side by side.  I opened my window and notice no sound from the air as I drove past these lights in the sky.I couldn&rsquo;t talk to anyone about this incident for two days because I was trying to process what I had witnessed that night.  I finally came to the conclusion that I had witness teleportation of an alien spacecraft.  I had witness alien technology in action.  After a while I began to tell people who I have known for at least several years about this event, including an older woman who was a widow.  As I told her this story, she told me her husband was a fighter pilot in WWII in the pacific theater.  He had spoke to her several times that while flying in daylight he saw a black disc object in the air with him which had four red lights on the back end of this craft in a diamond shaped pattern.  When he tried to fly towards this craft, the ship would race away from his plane.", "A light that, at first, appeared to be a star, suddenly flashed several colors and  flew away from the Earth until it disappeared.In the West Southwest sky, southwest of Spica in the Virgo constellation, between Virgo and Hydra, I saw a light in the sky that appeared to be a star.  Moments later, the star began changing colors from yellowish-white to red to blue and flashing excitedly, briefly got brighter, then it appeared to began moving away from the Earth at what I can only assume was a surprising fast rate of speed.  The light grew smaller and smaller until finally is disappeared.  There appeared to be a faint haze around where the lights had been.

Three small white lights formed each corner of the triangle, with the tip clearly pointed in the direction of movement.  One large blue light, softly blinking on and off, was in the center of the triangle.The object came up over the tree-line at approximately a 45-degree angle, continued in this direction for several seconds, then suddenly reversed its course in a strange motion, like a rotation, and came back down in another 45-degree angle, until it disappeared behind the trees and could no longer be seen.

They made no sound and appeared to be powered.I was sitting in my back yard facing straight south on Saturday 6-5-10.  I had been outside about 15-20 minutes and then at approximately 1:00 AM, still facing south, I spotted, at an altitude of about 45 degrees up, and just slightly to the west, two separate lights, side by side, traveling directly from north to south.  I ended up following one of the lights with a pair of 10x 50 binoculars, south, to an altitude of about 5 deg, just above the trees down the block.  By this time it was far off and very dim. The sighting, from beginning to end, lasted around 35-45 seconds.The objects made no sound,  jet, prop etc., completely silent.  No blinking, or flashing  lights. Magnitude was 2.0 to 1.0, approximately.  Looking through binoculars, the colors were a dim orange glow with no distinct lines and the shapes of the glows were rectangular with rounded over corners.  Through binoculars they were approx 0.25&quot; inch wide, maybe slightly larger and the position of the &quot;rectangles&quot; were symmetric to one another.  My first impression when viewing through binoculars was that they looked like sky lanterns as they start to burn low, when all that&apos;s visible is the glow from the lower part of the paper sack.  It was hard to tell, but the shapes looked like they were the bottoms of something as opposed to being the entire object.  I could see (with binoculars), a very faint reflection or distortion out in front of the orange glows.  This was dark in color and not a reflection of the orange light but more of a reflection or distortion of the night sky.  These &quot;refl! ections or distortions&quot; were extremely faint to the point of fading in an out of view.  Height of the lights could have been satellite altitude or as low as passenger jet altitude, but I couldn&apos;t be sure.  I do believe the lights were much higher than local low flying air traffic.  Speed appeared slightly faster than satellite speed.  Distance between the two objects, when I first spotted them, (extending my arm up, in front of me at a 45 degree angle and spreading two fingers apart) was about 3&quot;.I like watching satellite/Iridium pass over, so initially I thought I was seeing two satellites.  Movement of the objects appeared powered and were very fluid and constant.  They stayed perfectly fixed, side by side, traveling in a straight line like two fighter jets in formation.   They were definitely not something being carried on the wind.  There were stars between them so I know they weren&apos;t attached. I watched them like this, with naked eye, for a few seconds, but the lights looked different than satellites, not pin point reflections, but more of a dull glow, so I switched to my binoculars.  After a few seconds I began watching just one of the lights (the other light was outside the field of view of my binoculars) until it dimmed out of sight, so I don&apos;t know if the other object stayed beside it the entire time.  As far down on the horizon as it traveled, about 5 deg, I would think the other object would&apos;ve come into the FOV but I didn&apos;t see it.  The &quot;dull glow&quot; of these objects was dim enough that had they been the smaller size of the pin-point of reflected light given off from a satellite passover, I probably wouldn&apos;t have spotted them.  Because of their larger size, though, they were very evident to the naked eye.Night was clear, moonless, little or no breeze.I would be curious to know what these lights are, and someone else may be able to easily explain them, but in all my years of looking up, I&apos;m at a loss.  I thought possibly a couple of Stealth fighters, but then they wouldn&apos;t be very stealthy with the orange glow part.  Forbes Field, (Previously Forbes Airbase) is a few miles to the south, so maybe it had something to do with that.

They were flying directly North to South. They were going dead straight at a steady speed, slower than helicopters that give city night flights, after 10 seconds they passed behind a all building and out of our sight. They were on a course that we have never seen flown by any other aircraft, heading out in the direction of the sea.The lights were remarkable, because they were absolutely silent. Even the jets at high altitude can be heard on our balcony.A few minutes later the Tokyo sky was filled with the usual 3 or four helicopters, and we could see 4 jets at varying altitudes passing over the city on the regular flight paths.

Last year I reported a sighting that three of my friends and I saw to Mufon.   However we were not taken seriously. I am aware that the Morristown Hoax has done a great deal to diminish credibility for all future UFO sightings in NJ, but I am not talking about seeing flares here.  I am a writer/researcher and one thing I discovered is that when our government wants to discredit a ufologist, they often create a hoax designed to lure UFO investigators into proclaiming the event is a genuinely unexplainable occurrence; only to have the rug pulled out from under them when the sighting is revealed as fake.  Morristown ruined the UFO hunters (on the History Channel) because the UFO hunter team went on national TV claiming that the sighting is undoubtedly real.  As soon as they did this, the sighting was proved to be hoaxed and the UFO hunters got canceled.  I feel I have to include this in my report because I think it is a big part of why no one seems to take me seriously.  Ok, on to what I saw last night. I am constantly sky-watching because I see so many unusual things up there.  I walked out my front door and looked up in the sky-facing east.  The first thing that caught my attention was a very quiet object with red strobe-lights.  I followed that for a second or two until a very dimly lit object flying west to east appeared in my line of sight.  This objec was shaped like a disc with two small wing-like appendages similar to the alien craft in the movie Independence Day.  The object was moving at an astronomical speed; faster than anything I&rsquo;ve ever seen.  It flew straight over my head, kept on its course for about 2 or 3 seconds and then pulled a hard 70 degree left turn, and began heading North at that point. There is a house to the east of my house only 20 feet away, so t! o follow the object I had to rush toward the end of the drivew! ay to tr y and get a better look.  Unfortunately by then the object was gone. The night before last, I saw a very similar craft, also dimly lit and flying at break-neck speed in the same general direction.  I have witnessed tons of other amazing airborne activity, which if you are interested and willing to take me seriously, I will describe in detail.  Some of the most outrageous sightings happened when I was with friends or my co-worker in one case.  So I know that I am not crazy, even though I have been forced to question my sanity based on some of the things I&rsquo;ve witnessed.  Also, I woke up a few weeks ago with a circular crater-like scar on my upper left thigh.  I don&rsquo;t know how it got there, but I can see that there is something hard under the skin, and extending from the center I can see what looks like spokes on a bicycle wheel. I did some research to see if others have reported the same thing, and I must say I am a little bit frightened by what I found.  I have no memory of how I go! t this scar, but I do know that one night it wasn&rsquo;t there and the next morning it was.  I really hope I&rsquo;m not wasting my time filing this report.  I just want some answers.  I am aware that most people go their entire lives and never see a single thing that could be classified as a UFO, and yet in the last year alone, I&rsquo;ve witnessed dozens.

There were two small circles. Both were red. They looked a lot like what a ring lite on a camera would look like except with the middle part filled in so that there is only a small ring of black. I thought it could be a helicopter, but I&apos;m right near a lot of hospitals so i know what the helicopters look like, and it had no flashing lights on it that would signify it was such.

There was also a helicopter in the vicinity passing nearby so I knew it couldn&apos;t be one. I have never seen any flight vehicle fly in that path either so it felt out of place. It flew at a steady pace. Id say the speed was equivalent ! to seeing a low flying Cessna it was fast, but not supersonic.

PD))", "Sudden appearance &amp; equally abrupt disappearance of illuminated &amp; extremely fast UFO flying in the night sky above I-75 South.WHEN: May 31, 2010, at approximately 12:50 a.m.WHERE: Driving South on I-75, about 2 miles before reaching the Williamsburg, KY, exit SIGHTING:  An unidentified object flew across the night sky just above the road in front of us;  it appeared and illuminated suddenly and seemingly from nowhere, moved extremely fast in a straight line  (although it seemed to move slightly forward across the sky), and just as suddenly, completely disappeared seconds later SUMMARY: While driving home to western NC from Berea, KY, a friend and I observed what neither of us can logically explain as anything other than a UFO. [OBSERVER 1/INCIDENT REPORTER BACKGROUND INFO.] Being both an avid astronomy enthusiast and the daughter of a retired USAF fighter pilot, I believe that I am a very good judge of determining the &ldquo;identity&rdquo; or cause of an illuminated and/or moving object in the sky.  Not only do I have a strong knowledge of what things in the night sky such as meteors/&rdquo;shooting stars,&rdquo; satellite/ iridium flares, planes, helicopters, etc., look like, but I also have a healthy dose of analytical skepticism from my father which I always apply when something out of the ordinary presents itself.When the topic of a UFO is brought up, I always think of the story of the &ldquo;Tucson Lights&rdquo; ((NUFORC Note:  ((sic))  Phoenix Lights))  that is shown on UFO shows on TV often and hoe my father finds it slightly comical how much that incident is still hyped despite the lights so clearly (at least to him) being from A-10 flares (he was an A-10 pilot for 20 years, with over 4,000 hours in the cockpit).  However, my father has always been deeply fascinated by UFO stories/sightings, and he is a firm believer that much more happened at Roswell in 1947 than what the government ever told the public.  My father has instilled in me a profound love and curiosity for all things flight and/or outer space related, as well as a strong sense of the importance of thoroughly reviewing/examining something before drawing any conclusions.ADDITIONAL NOTES ON SIGHTING]   The object did not enter from one end of our line of sight and exit at the other, but rather, it suddenly appeared in the middle region of the night sky visible in front of us, and seconds later, disappeared directly in plain sight.  It did not have the movement, luminosity, or any of the distinguishing characteristics of a meteor.  Although it appeared to be an illuminated aircraft of sorts (not just a streak of light), it moved far too fast to be a plane as well as in a somewhat hard to explain irregular path unlike that of any airplane.  Additionally, its light was not constant like that of a plane in the night sky. It simply appeared in the middle of plain sight, moved across the sky in a way and at a speed that I have never before witnessed demonstrated by anything else, and then abruptly vanished while still in a clear area in the middle region of the night sky visible to us.Having observed a comet, several meteor showers, a satellite flare, and of course, more planes and helicopters than I could ever hope to count, move through the night sky, what I saw in the sky this past night was almost bewildering, due to it being absolutely unidentifiable in any right.", "Dim light moving south to northit was a dim light round in shape moving from south to north i live near an airport so i see planes all the time and this was no plane they come in east and west i called a freind that lives in palm beach to see if he can see it but he did not this is the first time ive ever seen anything like this i will always keep my eyes to the sky now i have video on my phone but cant pull it off", "On Friday, the sky was really dark as if it was going to storm.  Around 12:00 midnight, I heard winds blowing hard against my bedroom window, so I went to the back door to look out.As I looked in the sky, I seen a multitude of blurry lights shooting from behind the clouds as if they were released from something &amp; flying really fast above my home &amp; disappearing.I couldn&apos;t tell exactly were they were coming from because there was a huge tree blocking my view, but it was definitely from behind the clouds.The lights continued to fly from behind the clouds for about an hour. It is really hard to describe, but I have never been so frightened in my entire life.I never believed in flying objects or ufo&apos;s, so this is very scary to me.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))", "As my friend and I were driving home late one night, I was staring out at the window gazing at the stars when I noticed one particular one that was much brighter than the others.  I remember saying to myself &quot;Wow, thats a bright star&quot;.  Then we both noticed how much bigger and brighter was becoming and within seconds it was right over our head and hovering above a corn field we were driving by.  It was a black triangle. It was rather small and moved so quickly.  I remember it head green to red lights glowing around it...and as we turned onto the street it was lowering itself onto, we pulled up close enough to listen to it...but there was no noise whatsoever.  Right when I began to open my door to get a closer look it flew straight up and away as fast as it came. I was scared.  I screamed.((NUFORC Note:  Date in 2005 is approximate.

The object was slowly moving over upper Riverview, it appeared to be a large, diamond shaped craft with at least 6 lights around it; two where closer to the middle and were flashing.  It stopped in mid-air and changed directions several times; moving smoothly and fluently. We made sure it was not a helicopter as it was far too large and did not make any noise as it hovered not far ahead of us.  We turned around to chase the craft which was heading towards the river.  It began moving faster and faster and eventually disappeared.  The sky was barely cloudy so we would have been able to spot it, but we did not.", "Looks like a star but much too low , stationarry for a while now , appears to have flashing red lights and blue lights , apparantly theres 3 but i can only see one at my current address", "Sighting of orbs after report of large boomerang shaped craft.On Thursday, April 22 my fiancee called me and asked me to come home as soon as possible around 10:55 pm. He said that he had witnessed a boomerang shaped craft flying low over our apartment. (around 3500-5000ft.) This has not been the first time we have witnessed an event like this, we had a similar one last year. When I came home he explained to me that he had seen a large craft flying overhead. We are used to seeing planes fly over us all of the time and he knew that this was not a plane. Also from our previous experience last year I assumed that if I waited outside long enough I might see something else, which I did. Flying north towards the mountains, off to my right, there were two slightly glowing orange orbs circling each other in formation. This is when I called to report the event. Then about ten minutes later a single orb flew in the same direction off to my left. Then again about 5 minutes later another one flew over but seemed to vanish as I was! looking at it and I could no longer trace its flight path. They were much like the orange orbs I had seen last year however not as bright and this time they were flying much closer to the ground. I would say lower than planes yet higher than birds if that makes sense.", "Pine Ridge, South Dakota - Bright Orange Light, June, 26th, 2010Bright orange light flying over town low, slow, north to south, and disappering into a low cloud cover in the distance towards Nebraska, then repeated pattern half an hour later, just slightly westward of its original position.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

At first we thought they were helicopters, but we quickly noticed that they were too high up to be helicopters.  The lights were a bright orange/red and were moving in irregular patterns from a south to north direction.  One of them stopped.  Another one sped up past it, and then slightly changed direction. The last one continued its speed and eventually all the lights &ldquo;went out&rdquo; starting with the one that stopped.  After the lights went out we were all trying to figure out what we just witnessed.  We live 5 minutes away from Hopkins airport, these were not planes.  Not helicopters.  There was no starboard or starlight, the lights were not blinking it was solid.  This was nothing any of us have ever seen. The thought of it being an asteroid was brought up, but there was no trail left behind in the sky, and they were changing directions and speeds.  An older couple pulled over to the side of the street and confirmed that they have &ldquo;never seen anything remotely close to these lights in over 60 years of living in Cleveland, OH.&rdquo;  The actual amount of time we witnessed the lights was not longer then 3 minutes.  About 10 minutes later we saw another light, a single one moving slower then the previous.  It started to change direction and head east.  Within a minute of watching, the light &ldquo;went out.&rdquo; I could still see the shape of it through the clouds.  It appeared to be large, dark, and round.

Hovering just over the hill was a orange/yellow light.  I woke boyfriend and we looked at it for sometime.  The object didnt move or change in anyway. after looking at it for about 5 mins, we came to the conclusion that it must be a star, even if the colour was different slightly.  We continued talking then 5 mins later, my boyfriend realised it had disapeared.  None of the other stars around it had moved, we hadnt moved in the car, we were still parked up in the exact same spot.We didnt hear any sounds that a helicopeter/plane would make.

We were standing in his kitchen looking out the sliding glass door to the upper balcony.  His deck looks east over the Willamette, and his house sits very high up, near John&apos;s Landing and Macadam.  Because his house sits at the top of the viewpoint it offers a full view of Ross Island and directly parallel from the deck is the north end of Oaks Bottom Natural Reservation.  This is where the whole incident took place it did not happen in the sky. The objects appeared about a half mile away from us, from the opposite bank, the east side, of the river.Before we noticed the lights, we were having a good conversation talking about the state of the world, spirituality, and sharing personal experiences.  I had gotten to the subject of recent UFO sighting I&apos;ve had, and I was explaining to him that I really feel that we can be making efforts to reach out and contact off world visitors, as individuals, and as communities or small groups.  I was telling him about a sighting I had near Lake Cushman in Washington, where I was staying at a friends cabin.  This particular sighting happened one night a few months prior, when I went out to the deck of the cabin overlooking the lake.  Strangely enough, when I went out there the sky was clear but nothing unusual was visible.  I closed my eyes and began to envision a light rising up out of the lake, and I put out my thoughts that I wish to have a contact and I want to see something, then when I opened my eyes out in the distance on one of the hills was a white light which had appeared while my! eyes were closed! It pulsed irregularly with no apparent pattern, and the brightness of the pulses also were changing.  This is a sighting in Washington months ago so I won&apos;t go into detail here.  But it&apos;s important to describe this because it is interconnected with all of my sightings I&apos;ve had recently, which all seem to be the same &apos;type of craft&apos;.SO, while I was describing this to my friend, I had been looking out his window at lights which were flashing and changing colors, but I hadn&apos;t noticed consciously.  My friend interrupted me from my descriptions and said, &quot;What are those lights out there?&quot;  I then noticed we were looking at something unusual.  I started to list things off and I thought at first we were looking at a traffic intersection, was there an accident?  Were we looking at ambulance lights or was there construction going on out there?  But my friend pointed out the lights were not coming from our side of the river, they weren&apos;t that close.  These lights were coming from across the river!  We went out to the balcony and our eyes adjusted to the darkness, it was just before sun rise so it was pretty dark out.  We could clearly see the outline of the river and Ross Island, and the tree line and bank of the east side where Oaks Bottom sits.The lights were all very close together, I would say there was an area of 100-200 feet which these lights stuck together and hovered around very close to ground level.  The lights didn&apos;t rise up above the tree line so they stayed about 50-100 feet above the ground and the river.  They moved slightly at first from side to side, and then towards the end of the sighting they did move north about a quarter mile before disappearing right before our eyes.To describe the lights without seeing them for yourself does not give justice to the intensity of what we saw! I could not stop saying, &quot;This is so beautiful! Have you ever seen something so amazing and beautiful before!&quot;  I was touched by the sheer sight of it all.  But also I was going through phases of many emotions and physical feelings during this sighting.  At first I was skeptical, uncertain of the area we were viewing, that it could be something unexplainable.  But as it got brighter out I could see my friend was right, it was an area where there are no buildings, no roads, and no public access.  The lights we saw are unlike anything I&apos;ve really seen before.  Even in science fiction movies, these lights just were so unique I can&apos;t really describe it perfectly.There were lots of colors, and the lights seemed to change rapidly in shape, size, color, and brightness. The lights would stay &apos;lit&apos; for a split-second to a full few seconds.  And the lights were not lights on an object - this is very important to understand - the UFO was a group of lights with no other objects associated.  I could clearly see, for the entire duration, the larger lights would pulsate, glow, and vibrate for a few seconds.  Then, upon shrinking and disappearing, it would be followed by dozens of colorful sparkles and twinkles and yet more bright white-blue or golden pulses.  The number of individual pulses and appearances would number in the hundreds.  Because for the whole duration these twinkling pulsating orbs of light would be constantly changing and it was hard to say whether we were observing a collective of dozens of individual objects, or if this was some kind of vortex which many objects were popping in and out of, or if maybe it was all one big transparent object which dozens of changing lights appearing all over it.We were out there for a while and continued to watch these lights with much excitement and wonder, for the next 20-30 minutes I assume.  The sun came up not long after we stepped outside, and the lights continued pulsing even though it was then light out and we could clearly see no vehicles, people, objects, or anything at all! The lights were appearing from out of nowhere, they were literally phasing into our visual perception either from another dimension, or from a band of light or vibration which we cannot visually see - or both.I recall my friend describing that he felt very warm through the entire experience, I too did feel like I was having hot-flashes, but I at the peak of the experience, I felt as if electricity was surging through my body, and I felt like I was having a transmission of thought with these objects. So many feelings went through me. But not one tiny amount of fear was felt - I felt completely secure and in fact I felt very blissful and loving energy. I recall that there were tears streaming down my cheeks and I couldn&apos;t help but cry because the love and joy I was feeling was SO intense!  I felt that these lights were supporting us, all of humanity, and they care dearly for our well-being and our planet too. We are not alone and we live in a vast universe. But we do not have anything to fear, if we feel fear and are in a negative place within, then we are going to attract such experiences perhaps unconsciously. We must remain grounded, centered, and composed.We didn&apos;t get any pictures or footage at all unfortunately, but this sighting was more than a usual UFO sighting, to me it was a CE5 - a close encounter of the fifth kind characterized by close bilateral communication, and experiencing physical effects from the encounter. I can send a picture of where the sighting took place using an aerial of the area from google maps - if this is something that would be useful then let me know.I can be contacted via phone or e-mail for further questions and details.  I am an artist so I have been drawing what I saw but truly the whole incident was so dynamic a simple picture doesn&apos;t really show the incredible animation of these objects.I am personally making efforts to pursue more contacts and I feel very confident now that things are just beginning and I am very excited for the near future events to come.  I know I have my own personal perception of what happened and because i&apos;ve experienced &apos;supernatural&apos; or unusual events all my life, I am very confident in trusting my intuition on these matters.  Contact with these higher dimensional beings requires an open heart, and pure intent.  We must be raising our vibration as individuals, communities, and a planet - there is much hope for us here in our quest to heal and clean our home, these beings are here for multiple reasons, some may be a part of our earth too, some may be here to assist us or our planets or the sun. We will find out more as we open up and begin to shift into the new paradigm.There is much more I could attribute to this sighting, as in the last 2 weeks I&apos;ve had yet another sighting but of a smaller implication. I&apos;ve seen ufos in the sky but my sightings are happening on ground level as well simultaneously in some cases. I am pursuing more contacts with an open heart and mind. Thought and meditation techniques are very helpful and I believe the way to go for pursuing a communication with dimensional beings.

No cloud cover.Full Description &amp; Details:  On April 14, 2010 at approximately 22:10, I was standing on the North end of our house facing south when we witnessed what appeared to be at first to be a shooting star.  My second thought was an aircraft coming down on fire, but the speed was too fast for an aircraft.  Then I noticed that it was quite large. Much larger than any star I had ever seen.  Not as large as the moon, but absolutely not a plane or helicopter.  It had a greenish color to it with a dark area in the middle.  It arced in the sky heading to the south east, and then appeared to be falling to the earth when it suddenly disappeared. The entire encounter only lasted approximately 10-15 seconds.Can sighting be explained as any conventional man-made or natural object?

I could see what would looked like &quot;star dust&quot; seemingly emitting from Venus in two trails in a 45 degree downward trajectory, headed by a very small  blinking white light. This &quot;object,&quot; from my point of observation, was moving at a very slow pace. The light and trail so faint, barely visible to plain eye.From the North, a white/blue light was shooting across the sky in a jagged flying pattern.

I just made the switch onto the 85 North.What looked like a flare being &quot;shot out of&quot; Venus, and also at a 45 degree angle, started gaining acceleration towards the ground. As the &quot;flare&quot; flew closer to the earth, it appeared to change in color.. ranging from bright white.. to pinks and finally a white-blue.

Within 1/2 mile of the American River.It was silent.  It was moving slow and seemed to be only 50-100ft off the ground.  It was disc for the most part much like if you were to take two plates and stack one upside down onto the other.  It wasn&apos;t just a disc shape though.  Imagine you have the two plates again now take 3-4 small plates, saucers, stacked properly or and set the original two on top of them.  That would be pretty much to scale.  A large disc section with this lower section roughly 2/3 the diameter of the main section protruding.  This lower section is round and flat on the bottom, it has a taper to it.  Smaller at the bottom tapering to somewhat larger where it was joined with the large disc section.  All around the edge smaller bottom section were panels, each a rectangle, but only about 30 around the entire ship.  These panels ran the entire height of the lower section, the bottom had no features that I recall.  Each panel lit with each color imaginable, changing colors every second, not in some un! iform pattern, it seemed each was doing its own thing.I was on the lawn of my grandfathers house.  I believe some family members had been over that evening and they were about to leave.  There were roughly 5 of us out there.  I saw the craft, low and slow, going right down my street towards the river.  I reached out for it and started running after it as fast a small boy can.  I recall one of my sisters screaming at me to stop.  It was all so fast.  I reach out and start running, simultaneously she starts screaming, &quot;No Matthew Stop!&quot; I didn&apos;t.  I ran about 25 yards and I was keeping up with its slow pace but suddenly it sped up and I mean like snap your fingers, boom, it&apos;s gone.I&apos;ve asked all my sisters about this incident none of them recall this ever happening, but I know at least one of them was there.

I went outside and set up a blanket and a pillow out back and turned all the lights out.

As I turned myself to face more towards the clear patch of sky which eventually expanded to a completely clear sky.Five minutes after the clouds cleared out I saw it.

It moved from about middle of my view towards the north in erratic patterns.  It traveled north east quickly turned 90 degrees on a dime for about 4 seconds then turned back on its original course.  It finally disappeared over my treeline.

Directly ahead of us, (guessing over Cumberland Heights area was where it was) my husband and I both watched as this oddly shaped tangerine/peach colored rectangle passed in front of our field of vision going in a northerly direction.I say oddly shaped because the leading edge had well defined 90 degree edges on it and the length was consistent with a rectangle, but the back end was less well defined almost as if it was fading or in a mist at the back end.  The colors were very pretty and bright, and kind of rippled with different shades of orange, tangerine, peach, and even a little pinkish or salmon color.We were far enough away to see it in its entirety, and we saw no other aircraft around (at first I thought it might be a banner pulled behind a plane, but the sky was otherwise empty).  My husband suggested it was a blimp, but the shape was wrong, as was the area, for the area is very rural.We watched it as we continued our drive into town for about 4 minutes and my husband even sped up to get closer to it so that we could see it in more detail.  The closer we got, the more vivid the colors were.  We were also able to say without doubt that it was not being powered by or pulled behind any other craft in the sky.  We were trying to get close enough to see if it had any marking or writing on it, but as soon as we got close enough, the road went between two tree covered hills and we lost sight.  I would say that when we lost sight of the craft we were approximately 200 yards away and the craft was flying about 150 feet high, just over the tops of the trees on the hills that surround the road.  It didn&apos;t leave any con-trail, unless the &apos;mistiness&apos; of the back end would qualify, and it didn&apos;t seem to make any noise, but our distance from the craft and the fact we were in a moving vehicle could have been the reason we heard nothing.As we came out of the hills, my children (age 11 and 14) and I scoured the sky behind us and to the north for the rest of the drive in, but didn&apos;t see it again.  We figured it had to have landed somewhere in the woods, because it was just gone. We talked about it and we were all left scratching our heads.  To my total consternation, we had left the camera at home, and our cell doesn&apos;t have a camera, so we were unable to get a picture of it.We do live near an army base, and there are army aircraft of all sorts in the sky over us on a regular basis.  This sighting also took place not far from a TVA power plant off the Cumberland River.  I am unsure if this has anything to do with the sighting, but not far from the sighting is a small back country looking road that has been closed and gated with a sign saying something to the effect - closed by order of the U.S Government.  Could they all be related??  I am reporting this in the hopes that someone else saw what we saw and can verify or disprove to us what it was we saw.  My true hope is that someone else was able to get a picture or video of this UFO so that I don&apos;t wonder for the rest of my days what it was that we saw.Thank you for providing this forum so that can happen.", "Black cigar shaped object hovering after storm over Red Bank in Lexington South CarolinaIn Red Bank, after the storms had passed through, my husband, daughter, and I were sitting on our porch enjoying the cooler temperature from the storms.  I glanced up into the haze of out-flowing clouds and inside of them I saw this dark, cigar shape just sitting in the thick haze.  I couldn&apos;t tell you how high up it was, but originally I thought maybe it was a goose about to land in the pond, but the object didn&apos;t get any closer.  It simply hovered and would vanish into the clouds and then back out again.  I told my husband to look because there isn&apos;t any towers or high trees like that around, I had to see if he saw it too.  Every time I would point the object would slowly fade into the hazy clouds, then back out.. it never once went higher or lower.

After it traveled from left to right it hesitated, and then traveled sharply back to the left for a short time, and then changed direction again to proceed to travel to the right out of the scope of the skylight. I ran outside to follow it further but it was no longer there.  I feel that it could not have been a space station or a satellite sighting because it moved too fast and because of the way it changed direction. When I first saw it through my skylight I thought it was a shooting star or a comet.   If I was to try to debunk this account I would take into consideration that we live within 120 miles + or - of the Norfolk air force navy base.  I would first consider this either a shooting star based on it&rsquo;s appearance or a test rocket from said base, however it rapidly changed direction and speed.  This was no rocket in low altitude and it was no space station.  I understand that rockets and earthly crafts travel fast, however this damn thing was booking.   I first thought it to be a shooting star.To be perfectly frank I was offended by the rudeness of the hotline phone proctor who asked me to summarize this in ten seconds and after five would interrupt because he needed to go to a social engagement.  If this organization&rsquo;s goal is to obtain all ufo sightings, it would be nice to show patience for every caller who takes the time to call this hotline to hear their description of the sighting and to assist them in reporting it.  I was very excited to share this sighting and was disappointed that the staff was not interested in what I had to share.  I hope in the future you will have time to answer the call when it is first made so I will not have to call again nor have someone else speak to the hotline on my behalf in order to seriously be heard by an organization that represents itself as one that wants to hear about strange sightings encountered whenever and wherever they occur.

But, it WAS there.  i know what I saw.  my yard is dark, so ! at night, I have a beautiful view of the sky, and it was amazingly clear out, and a bit crisp.  I live close to an airfield (farmingdale), and at that time to my knowledge, there are no small craft flying, or weather ballons.  There is also a major air port (MacArthur) about 20 minutes east of me, but this was not a commercial airline, nor a small craft.   And at the angle at which it changed, its distance, and its speed, related to that distance.  there were no blinking lights, unless you would ascertain the &quot;twinkling&quot;  as such. did not leave a trail, and no sound.

I was on my way to bed around 11:30pm when I went for one last cigarette, and when I looked up into the sky I saw a strange flashing object way up in the sky above my trailer park. This would be in the North East. The object stayed there for a while and bounced around in the sky from NNE to the North. I had just purchased a camcorder about a month before hand primarily for use in recording precious moments of my baby girl, so I went in grabbed the camcorder came out and started filming the thing, this time it was down lower in the sky. I then went in grabbed a flashlight, and the object flashed brighter at me when I flashed the flashlight at it, before it slowly made its way due North through the tree line. I immediately filed a police report and the officers looked at me as if I were a kook even though I had showed them the video. Later that morning my husband told me it may have been an in ! flight jet refueling procedure, but over our town? So I phoned the Cold Lake Alberta Air force base and reported my sighting there. Needless to say although I&rsquo;m a new mother with a sound mind and had many respected positions in my careers, I have been receiving flak about my experience. Upon researching websites, over the weeks following this incident, I was shocked to see how many reports of UFO&rsquo;s there actually are, and that this object has been seen in this part of northern Alberta for over the past ten years.Here is the first video of the object: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5R8i8XHt2g  I find I couldn&rsquo;t sleep and I went out ever night watching and waiting for this object to return. On May 24th around 3 am, I saw the thing again over the Catholic school, so I jumped in my car told my husband to watch the baby and went to the field near the school to try to get a better image of it. I made sure I purchased a tripod for the camcorder and this time brought along a 3 million candle powered flashlight.I discovered upon flashing the spotlight at the object the thing seemed to get scared? It went dark took off and stopped over the sawmill that my husband later estimated is about five kilometers from the school straight to the east. After about five minutes, the thing disappeared. I turned to go back to my car in the parking lot, when suddenly the thing reappeared over the trailer park again. It made a white semi circle glare, went dark and then sped off towards the radio towers north of town. I jumped in my car and followed the thing that stayed stationary over the field north of the towers. I couldn&rsquo;t get it on video because the thing had turned its lights off? But now I wonder if I was just following a satellite that disappeared, and I was just seeing things above the field? Needless to say I got really spooked standing out in the middle of a dark back road trying to get a (?) on video. I decided to get out of there, and head for home.So now I think I&rsquo;ve gone crazy, my husband doesn&rsquo;t believe me, and is questioning if I&rsquo;m fit to raise our daughter. I keep watching the video trying to stop the frames to get a clear view of whatever it could be which I&rsquo;m sure my husband was thrilled about. When on May 28th around 11:30 or a bit later before midnight, the weather had turned cloudy, so I decided to actually stop waiting for this thing to come back, and actually get to bed at a decent time. I was going for my last cigarette when low and behold there it was again this time up in the clouds to the NNW, shining away. The weather had turned overcast, and I checked the cloud ceiling on the weather network later to discover the ceiling was at 3900ft. So I&rsquo;m estimating that the object was another 500feet into the clouds. I keep my camera on a tripod now by the door, so grabbed it and started filming the object, and finally got a clear image of the thing. Its maneuverability is unbelievable, yet I still question coul! d this be a night kite an old man supposedly flies in a field a kilometer north from my doorstep? I got my husband out of bed, and he now believes me Thank-GOD! He says this definitely is not an old mans kite with LED lights on it. I looked everywhere online for any new technology a person could buy and place on a kite that would make it glow and pulsate like that, but so far haven&rsquo;t turned up anything remotely close to this thing.Here&rsquo;s the new clearer video I shot of it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SOu7NTHY-w  If anybody knows what this might be, please contact me through this report, Thank-you.", "A young man in Colorado witnesses three objects interacting in sky, performing impossible maneuvers.Tuesday, April 27th, 2010 should be noted as a particularly fair-weathered, cloud-free day.  At the time of this incident there were no clouds visible, the sun was at my back, and no known aircraft could be seen or heard at this specific time.  Living relatively close to an airport, I&rsquo;m very familiar with the daily sights and sounds of small aircraft and helicopters.  I was sunbathing this afternoon while on the telephone with my sister when a flash of light caught my attention from the corner of my eye.  The flash of light was relative to sunlight reflected by a mirror from a distance.  When I focused my attention toward the eastern sky I had a difficult time identifying exactly what I was witnessing at that moment.  I saw three spherical/disk-like objects flying in what appeared to be a perfect equilateral triangle formation.  These three, separate objects appeared to be metallic and continued to reflect light, but appeared darker on the bottom.  Perhaps the darke! r appearance on the bottom was an effect of shade.  However, the shade theory is merely speculation.  Although the objects were indeed reflecting sunlight, they did not emit any other light whatsoever.The three, separate objects held their perfect equilateral triangle formation for approximately 30 seconds. They appeared to be fading in and out of my plain of sight flying rapidly, sharply in a direct east to west motion while maintaining the triangular formation. Each separate object appeared to be twice the size of how the planet Venus appears in the night sky. One of the objects was flying at a slightly higher elevation than the two objects below. The appearance of these three objects was specifically puzzling as they appeared as if they were out of focus, exhibiting an almost hazy appearance. I live at approximately 5,500 feet above sea level. Using the western mountain peaks as a reference I estimate that these objects were flying at altitudes between 8,000 and 12,000 feet above sea level. Their low-altitude flight level could be compared to the altitude of a south-bound, ascending plane from the nearby airport, which is within a five mile radius of my home. Despite t! heir low altitude, no sounds could be heard. If I would have held a ruler to the sky to measure their distance apart, they appeared about &frac34; of an inch from each other. They were not spread throughout the sky, they were tightly grouped in the equilateral triangle formation for the first 30 seconds of this occurrence.After the first 30 seconds had passed I moved toward the eastern side of my deck for a prolonged view as the objects were slowly creeping north. Suddenly these three objects began flying in circles around each other. The circular patterns they flew around each other were perfect circles which could be compared to the circular motions demonstrated by braiding three sections of hair. Weaving in a very calculated manner from left to right, up and down. They repeated this pattern 2-3 times in a matter of 10 seconds. The three objects then altered their path, all three of them were flying in completely random circles around each other similar to how flies would buzz around each other. During both patterns of circular, weaving motions the three objects became so close to each other it was difficult to discern one from the other at times. This confirmed that what I was witnessing was indeed not a small aircraft or a helicopter. I am aware of the kinds of maneuvers our known aircraf! ts are capable of and these three separate objects were not demonstrating ordinary or technical maneuvers, these maneuvers were absolutely mind-boggling.The objects maintained their relative position in the eastern sky, slowly making their way toward the north while holding their altitude. Believing the objects would hold their position I bolted inside the sliding glass door of my bedroom and swiftly grabbed my digital camera. With the objects still within sight it was obvious they had returned to their original equilateral formation in those few seconds, exactly as it was earlier; fading in and out of my plain of sight. While fumbling with my camera to set it to video mode, the objects had moved far enough to the north and east that they were no longer visible. Minutes later the sounds of small aircraft could be heard once again, and were beginning to come within sight. I later contacted the Federal Aviation Administration who referred me to the National UFO reporting center per section 6 of FAA regulations regarding Safety, Accident, and Hazard Reports, 7-6-4. Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) Reports.What were these three objects? Why three patters? Why a triangle? How did these objects manage these impossible maneuvers? Why the middle of the day? Why Colorado?  My sighting today has left me with many understandable, unanswered questions. The most poignant of all these questions is: When will I experience a second sighting?? Until then I will keep my eyes on the skies whenever possible.", "clear photo of saucer in background of hawk pictureSaucer appeared in background of photograph being taken of red tail hawk.  Very clear.  Not in previous photo or following photo.  Taken along Refugio Road at noon.", "Two brilliant blue and green lights that were observed for about 15 mins. that moved in an erratic fashion independent of each other.At 11:12 PM on the 28th of June I received a phone call on my cell from my brother who lives about 4 miles from my location.  He wanted me to go outside and see if I could observe the lights he was looking at north of his location and close to the horizon.  I immediately went outside and looked in the direction he had indicated and was able to see a faint green light just above the horizon northeast of me which appeared to be somewhere near the direction of Ft Ord.  I told him to grab his digital video camera and film what we were seeing.  I immediately went inside and grabbed some binoculars and was able to distinguish a brilliant green light moving erratically near the horizon.  The light would move in an approximately east to west direction at a slow pace, randomly stop and hover then move again in spurts and change direction very rapidly.  It took about 5 minutes for me to locate the other light, which was blue in color, and I was able to observe both lights moving independent of each other.  The blue light would periodically disappear and then come back into view.  Generally it would appear as if the blue light would take off vertically and disappear behind the cloud cover.  At other times my view of the blue light was obscured by intervening trees. The blue light eventually disappeared from my view even though my brother did indicate that he could still see it.  At no time did I observe any navigational lights that would indicate that either of these objects were some kind of aircraft.  The movement also was unlike any aircraft that I have observed in the past.  After about 15 minuets the lights disappeared altogether.", "Pair of lights seen hovering, or slowly cruising, over Route 80 West.My wife and I were traveling West on Route 80 and drove underneath 2 hovering lights; blue/green-ish. The light placement was similar to an airplane. However, the object did not move but remained stationary, or cruised at such a slow crawl that it appeared to be hovering.We considered it might be radio-tower lights (of which there are many on the mountains in that stretch of road) but the lights were above us and the road. Our next thought was that it could be a helicopter, but there was no detectable blade noise and the distance between the lights was closer to an airplane wingspan; it would have had to have been a bigger helicopter than I&apos;m aware of in existence. I can&apos;t think of anything else that can hover or travel at such slow speeds besides a blimp...but how often are blimps even flown?...especially after dark and over a highway, rather than a sporting event?  It remained in our line of sight as we drove for approximately 30 seconds to under a minute before the road curvature obscured our view behind the treeline.I&apos;ve waited this long to report it because I&apos;ve periodically been checking this site, and similar reporting sites, to see if anyone else collaborated this sighting, to no avail. So, I guess I&apos;ll be the first to report it.", "A yellow triangle that made a big bang.I was walking outside because it was a nice day, then i saw a shine from the sky.

To my left, I saw what looked like a huge plane flying way too low.  I thought it was going to crash with it being so low, so I started to slow down.  The closer I got to it, I saw that it was a military cargo plane.  Then, it seemed like it was not moving...so I stopped almost completely when I got right beside it. t was not moving.  I turned down my radio and there was no noise from the plane.  It looked like a big military cargo plane, it couldn&apos;t have been any higher in the air than the top of a telephone pole.  I could read the stickers on it it was so low.  All I remember of the stickers is that there was an American flag and numbers and letters, no words.  The plane was not tipping in any direction.  It was completely still.  Just sitting in the air.  After about a minute of being right beside it, traffic started coming from the other direction so I had to move.  Once the t! raffic moved, I could not see it anywhere behind me.  There was no plane and no smoke from a crash.  It was just gone. I had the worst feeling of a panic attack I have ever felt.  It started just as soon as I looked over at the plane when it was beside me.  My entire chest hurt and I felt like I was going to vomit.  I was so afraid.  And, I do not know why!", "At aproximately 9:19 P.M. Eastern Standard time I witnessed a bright orange sphere that I mistook first for a star, moving in a Northeast direction.  There were no flashing lights attached as would have been on an airplane and no sound to accompany it.  It moved steadily and was very bright.  I was sitting in a dark room looking out the window when the object came in to view from a Southwest direction and I watched the object until it passed from my view.  I watch the skies at night, as I enjoy stargazing and have seen satelites and meteors (shooting stars) pass by in the sky and this looked like nothing I have ever seen before.  The object looked to be the color of an orange flame and stayed steady but strongly resembled a star.", "Sonic boom event over Northwestern Pacific.  No craft seen.", "2 Teardrop shaped crafts sighted, one followed us down the mountainMy girlfriend and I left my mother&rsquo;s house around 10:20pm on Monday night. She lives on a mountain with lots of pasture and trees. We started driving down the mountain when we passed a car on a very big curve. There was a large break in the trees, and that is when we saw the UFO. It was approximately 400ft above the tree line and approximately 100ft in front of us. I was trying to make sure it was infact a UFO and not a plane, so I unconsciously started slowing down and stopped while we were staring and discussing its shape. It appeared to be rather stationary at that time. It had three bright lights we could clearly see, which seemed to give it a circular or teardrop shape. As we were talking it started moving more in our direction. It moved at an angle, getting closer to both the ground and our position simultaneously. At which point my girlfriend tells me I need to start driving again since she doesn&apos;t want to get abducted. It was like I was in a trance a! nd unable to move at first. After a short period of time I just snapped out of it and drove as fast as I thought I could without wrecking the car. I felt the only chance we had at it leaving us alone was making it to the nearby highway. She continued watching the craft from the window of the car while I drove. She noted it changing direction and following us. It was practically on top of us when we made it to the highway.We both lost sight of it for a short period as we continued driving down the highway.  Then we started seeing it sporadically through the trees to our left.  It seemed to be continuing in the same direction we were driving.  We decided to pull over and observe the UFO. This time it we did not feel threatened as it was much farther away from us. When we caught sight of it again it was extremely high in the sky. Now we were able to see a blinking red light on another side of the craft. At first I thought perhaps it was a plane and we had really lost sight of the UFO. At this point it started descending. It was coming down in kind of steps. It would drop straight down and hover then drop again. This is when my girlfriend noticed the problem. That wasn&apos;t our UFO at all. It was a second one. We saw the craft that had been following us moving extremely low to the tree line, almost in the trees. We could see both the bright white lights and the flashing red one on the UFO now. It was obvious the two UFO&rsquo;s were the same type of craft. They were moving towards each other. The lower one was practically underneath the higher one. Then it seemed as though the lower one turned. All we could see of it was the flashing red light. I started wondering what made it turn and if it was coming in our direction. I was keeping an eye on them and the fact there wasn&apos;t nearly as much traffic on this highway as I&apos;d like. Infact, at that moment there was no one to be seen. Then she uttered the worst words I&apos;ve ever heard, &quot;Did you see that, over in the trees?&quot;  I glanced over to see what she was talking about. To the left, directly across the 4-lane, in the trees we saw two tiny light blue blinking &quot;lights&quot; next to each other in a straight line. The way they were positioned so close to each other made me think of eyes, though I do not know if that is what they were. They were too high to be the eyes of any animal I know of in the area. There were no buildings and no people in the area either. They also were not responding like an animals eyes. They were actually blinking, like twinkle lights on a fade switch. There was no light pointed in that direction for anything to be reflecting. There was nothing but darkness and our car lights pointing directly in front of us. My girlfriend told me she&apos;d seen it blink at least five times before saying mentioning it. The mere thought of what it might be scared me enough to immediately pull out onto the highway and drive quickly away. We kept searching for the UFO&rsquo;s as we drove toward Huntsvill! e. We were unable to clearly identify the crafts again.", "Two gold &quot;star like&quot; objects moving silently in formation.Sitting on my patio with clear unobstructed views to the west and northwest.

I always take time to scan the skies while outside after dark. Sometimes I take my night vision scope out because there are so many more stars and other objects that are seen with the night vision monocular than with the naked eye. Last night I took the scope outside with me again. I was able to see, what I believe were, two separate satellites traversing the night sky. These are usually always seen at least once a night through the scope.However, after looking at the sky for a good 10 minutes I was able to see an object that I could not identify. This object was traveling from west to east very high up. Because it was only visible through the night vision I could not discern if this object was within the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere or if it was out in space.This object moved much slower than the satellites I see every night, much slower. It also brightened and dimmed in a rhythmic pattern. While the object moved through the sky it would slowly brighten, stay bright for about a second and then slowly dim again to nearly invisible, staying dim for approximately 4-5 seconds. This pattern repeated itself during the length of time I watched the object. It didn&rsquo;t flash quickly or erratically, nor did it move briskly or erratically. This object stayed on the same course repeating it&rsquo;s brightening and dimming as it went.When the object was at its dimmest, it blended in with the smaller, less visible stars in the sky. The size and shape of it was very much like the rest of the stars. I was not at all able to see this object without the use of the scope, even when it brightened to its maximum luminosity. Eventually, this object flew out of sight. Given the slow movement, size and the fact the object was not visible without the scope, I believe this object to have been in space. If it was, it had to have been extremely large!  There were other aircraft in the sky during this sighting. I could hear and see an airliner coming from TIA in Tampa heading north and see smaller aircraft to the west heading south. These planes were much lower and faster than the craft I was watching.I am a paranormal investigator and have some experience in investigating and reporting unexplained events. I have seen satellites, the ISS, shooting stars and all kinds of aircraft as I have served in the USAF and currently reside in an airplane community; this object did not fit the description of any of these things.

It was approximately 11:45pm.  I glanced up at the sky and I noticed what at first I thought to be a plane, flying in the southern sky, heading north.  The first thing that caught my eye was three, bright blue lights, almost the color of the lights on a black light.  I pointed this out to my friend, and he noticed how unusual the object looked also.  It was flying low enough that if it were an airplane, you would definitely be able to hear it; however this craft was completely silent. It was then that we realized this was no airplane.We immediately called my cousin and his two friends outside to look at the UFO.

When they were off, we could clearly make out the shape of the UFO.  It was a dark, circular shape. As the lights came back on, they were rotated, as if the UFO was slowly spinning.  We tried to get pictures of the object on our cell phones, but apparently it was too dark out and the UFO was too far away to get the shot, which was really frustrating.  We watched the UFO flying south for approximately 5 minutes.When the UFO was almost out of our view, about to go behind some clouds, all five of us noticed that it appeared to quickly move upward in a diagonal direction, and then move back down, as if it were making an upside-down &ldquo;v&rdquo;.

I watched the craft for a while, and then I saw several red lights dropping from it, two at a time.  The red lights would then swirl up, loop and zig zag around in the sky, turning white after a period of five minutes.  I called the police station and asked if any odd lights had been seen over East Wenatchee (My view was in Wenatchee, WA looking East), and nothing had been called in.I saw the same thing happen about a half hour later, but farther to the north, and higher in the sky.I also noticed, as I had the morning before, what looked like a binary (I think that&apos;s how it&apos;s spelled) star which was also doing something odd.  It was slowly moving higher in the sky from the north and moving west to east.  When the sun began rising, it was difficult to see the smaller white lights dancing around, however I did notice that they moved closer to this &quot;binary star&quot; and began swarming around it like fireflies, winking in and out.

I recently bought a pair of Nikon Sportstar 10 x 25 binoculars and so I thought I would pass some time looking at birds, clouds and aircraft. There were scattered light cumulus clouds in the vicinity, but most of the sky overhead was clear and brilliantly blue. There was also a lot of air traffic. I watched three Boeing 737s pass directly overhead, a few minutes apart, and a four-engine jet somewhat south of my location. The larger jet was too far and too high to identify, but the engines left pronounced contrails.  The 737s showed up very clearly in my binoculars, although there was a slight atmospheric haze, but I had them sharply in focus.At about 16:20 (4:20 p.m.), just after watching the last of the 737s pass over, I began lowering the binoculars toward the horizon, when another object appeared in the field of view. I thought I had happened upon a small aircraft, so I steadied the binoculars to follow the craft through the sky. At that point, I realized that it didn&rsquo;t look like an aircraft. It was filling a greater portion of my field of view than any of the jets had earlier. If it was a small aircraft, it should have been close enough to hear the engines, yet there were no aircraft sounds to be heard. If it was an aircraft, my view would have been about 45 degrees off its right front, with the aircraft banking in a right-hand turn, such that the wings would have been &ldquo;level&rdquo; with my point of view, but it was traveling perpendicular to my position, not turning toward me. For a second, I thought it was an aircraft similar to a de Havilland Tracker, with brightly painted engine nacelles. Then I thought it mig! ht be some kind of bird, first thinking that it must be soaring, because there was no motion of beating wings. But it didn&rsquo;t really look like a bird. The object consisted of two large red-orange spheres, separated by a distance that was somewhat less than the diameter of either sphere, with a white body or fuselage between them and also a white body or fuselage attached slightly below them. The white shape(s) could have been spherical, about the same size as the red-orange spheres. It was hard to make out the shape of the white part(s), i.e., whether it was one body or separate pieces. the red-orange spheres were very bright in the direct sunlight, almost as if they were lights, but I don&apos;t think they were illuminated.I followed the object with my binoculars as it continued a wide, steady, unwavering arc in a clockwise direction, until I lost it from sight as it passed behind my house. At that point, I got up from my chair to try to follow the object further, but I could not find it in the sky.Whatever the object was, it had to have been some distance away, as it was as sharply focused in my binoculars as the 737s had been. For that reason, I ruled out the possibility that it could have been an insect and most smaller species of birds. If it was a bird, it would have been very large. The largest birds we have around here are pelicans, and this certainly was no pelican. I thought it could be a cluster of party balloons, but it was moving contrary to the wind and on a very steady path. Also, it was apparent that it was some distance away, both because it was sharply focused in the binoculars and because of the atmospheric haze between the object and me. Party balloons would not have filled so much of the field of view at that kind of distance.Because I saw it for only a short time and was not able to see it by the naked eye, I really can&rsquo;t say for sure what I may or may not have seen. I&rsquo;m reporting this mainly in case someone else saw it and either can explain it or would like confirmation that they were not alone in seeing it.", "Black, gumdrop/bell shaped object sighted over downtown San Antonio, TXI was 21, working as a valet driver at a downtown hotel in San Antonio, TX.  It was a slower day and I was parking a vehicle behind the hotel in the parking lot.  As I was walking I was looking up across the top of the hotel for a hawk that usually picks off pigeons and stuff.  I then noticed an object, not directly above the hotel, but from my line of sight I can surmount that it was just a little bit further out over the city.  The first thing that popped in my mind was that it looked as if someone had placed a black gumdrop in the sky.  I am a college student and I know what things are, this was no helicopter or anything that could have been produced with our current technology.  It was clear as day right before my eyes, almost as if I could reach out and grab it.  I attempted to take a picture with my phone but could not get a distinguishable shot.  From what I could see there were no openings, lights, windows, or protrusions of any kind; just a solid be! ll/gumdrop shaped object.  There were cirrus clouds that day so I was able to gauge if it was moving, it wasn&apos;t.  I watched it for about 3-5 minutes then I ran inside, down to the maintenance room to see if the engineering guys had any binoculars.  There weren&apos;t any so I ran back up to the front to see if any guests had arrived, everything was clear so I immediately ran to the back again because the sun and trees obscured my vision in the front.  When I got back, I searched for it and was able to find it again, still there not moving.  Total time elapsed so far would of been about 8 minutes.  I watched it for another 2 or so minutes until I was interrupted by my radio that a guest needed assistance in the front.  When I was done with that I ran back again only to find nothing there that time.  I waited for a few minutes watching the sky around me but could not find it.  When this was over I went back to the front and about ten minutes later I noticed a very high altitude je! t going over, heading roughly north to south.  Then after that! one had passed, about 5 minutes later, another high altitude jet flew south to north.  I hadn&apos;t seen anything like that fly over all day, so if it was a coincidence then it was perfect timing.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

Flame because it flickered in that sense. It was large enough to recognize the flickering.  Thought of a hot air ballon but it was traveling too fast and flame was too visable to be of any highth to catch major winds for speed. Surface winds were 5 mph.  No sound. It was traveling South to North and kept a steady direction until it dissapeared.  Weird because of flame versus glowing lights like most sightings.

I had been outside about 15-20 minutes and then at approximately 1:AM, still facing south, I spotted, at an altitude of about 45 degrees up, and just slightly to the west, two separate lights, side by side, traveling directly from north to south. I ended up following one of the lights with a pair of 10x 50 binoculars, south, to an altitude of about 5 deg, just above the trees down the block. By this time it was far off and very dim. The sighting, from beginning to end, lasted around 35-45 seconds.The objects made no sounds,  jet, prop etc., completely silent. No blinking, or flashing  lights. Magnitude was 2.0, to 1.0 approximately. Looking through binoculars, the colors were a dim orange glow with no distinct lines and the shapes of the glows were rectangular with rounded over corners. Through binoculars they were approx 0.25&quot; inches wide and the position of the &ldquo;rectangles&rdquo; were symmetric to one another. My first impression when viewing  when viewing through binoculars was that they looked like sky lanterns when they start to burn low, and all you see is the glow from the lower part of the paper sack, without the flicker of the flame. It was hard to tell, but the shapes looked like they were the bottoms of something as opposed to being the entire object. I could see (with binoculars), a very faint reflection or distortion out in front of the orange glows. This was dark in color and not really a reflection of the orange light but seemed more of a reflection or dist! ortion of the night sky. These &quot;reflections or distortions&quot; were extremely faint to the point of fading in and out of view. Height of the lights could have been satellite altitude or as low as passenger jet altitude, but I couldn&apos;t be sure. I do believe the lights were much higher than local air traffic height. Speed appeared slightly faster than satellite speed. Distance between the two objects, when I first spotted them, ( extending my arm up, in front of me at a 45 deg angle and spreading two fingers apart ) was about 3&quot;. I like watching satellite / Iridium pass overs so initially I thought I was seeing two satellites. Movement of the objects appeared powered and was very fluid and constant. They stayed perfectly fixed, traveling in a straight line, side by side like two fighter jets in formation.  They were definitely not something being blown by the wind. There were stars between them so I know they weren&apos;t attached. I watched them like this, with naked eye, for a few seconds, but the lights looked different than satellites, not pin point reflections, but more of a dull glow, so I switched to my binoculars.  After a few seconds I began watching just one of the lights (the other light was outside the field of view of my binoculars ) until It dimmed out of sight, so I don&apos;t know if the other object stayed beside it the entire time.  As far down on the horizon as it traveled, about 5 deg, I would think the other object would&apos;ve come into the FOV but I didn&apos;t see it.  The &quot;dull glow&quot; of these o! bjects was dim enough that had they been the smaller size of the pin-point of reflected light given off from a satellite passover, I probably wouldn&apos;t have spotted them. Night was clear, moonless, little or no breeze. I would be curious to know what these lights are, and someone else may be able to easily explain them, but in all my years of looking up, I&apos;m at a loss.  I thought possibly a couple of Stealth fighters, but then they wouldn&apos;t be very stealthy with the orange glow part.  Forbes Field, (Previously Forbes Airbase) is a few miles to the south, so maybe it had something to do with that.

Every so often we could make out a white jolt of light that seemed to project out from the object in random directions (quickly like lightning).  The object was brighter than anything else in the sky and mostly hovered in one spot but also moved from side to side. &nbsp;At first, the light / object was large and did not seem to be very far away and I was almost sure that it was a strange type of lit up helicopter searching for something on the ground.  I opened the window expecting to hear the engine! and was very surprised to find that it was dead silent outside. &nbsp;  I worked as a professional photographer for a few years and have all pro level equipment.  I asked my wife to grab my camera (a Canon 5D digital SLR with 70-200 L 2.8 IS lens), tripod, and shutter release cable while I kept my eye on the light.  I wanted to try to get a long exposure that showed the path of the light over time.  Just as I got everything setup and settings dialed in, my newly charged batteries went completely dead. &nbsp;I asked my wife to try to find some other batteries while I kept my eye on the light.  As time went on, the light seemed to be dissipating and was getting smaller as if it was traveling away from us. I was also scanning the sky for anything else out of the ordinary and saw a high flying jet moving overhead.  The jet turned slightly and headed DIRECTLY toward the light. &nbsp;We were watching as the jet approached.  My wife returned with new batteries and I took a 30 second exposure with my shutter release cable (no camera movement) with the jet approaching the light in the same frame.  At this point the light was very distant and just looked like a bright star. As soon as the path of the jet overlapped and intersected the light, I expected to see the jet continue on it&rsquo;s trajectory, bypassing the light in the sky.  I was absolutely startled when the jet disappeared completely from sight at the exact same time that it intersected the light.  It was as if the pilot shut off the strobe lights at the exact same time. &nbsp;There were no clouds in the sky so I&apos;m certain it did not go behind a cloud. After analyzing the image, one would tend to discredit the image since the light appears to follow the exact same trajectory as the stars as the jet is approaching.    However, before the image was taken, the light was much closer, much brighter, and clearly traveled in multiple directions in the sky.", "A star like object moving up and down rapidly and disappeared in the skyI was sitting outside my house with three of my friend.

As we were making the final merge onto the interstate I noticed a bright glow on the underside of one of the few white clouds that were in the sky.  As I looked harder I noticed a dark line pointing up towards it at about a 45 degree angle.I kept my eye on it until it disappeared behind trees, due to the bends in the I-10.  About 7-10 minutes later we were approaching Intersection 196, Capital Circle NE, when we finally got a good look at what we&rsquo;d seen from a distance.There were two objects.  The first was a small, highly reflective, bullet shaped object with no wings or tail.  The second was rather more startling.  Keeping pace behind the bullet shaped object was &lsquo;V&rsquo; shaped object that was quite simply the biggest think  I&apos;ve ever seen in the sky.  Although a good distance away it was easily the size of a football stadium, possibly larger.  The object was dark gray/brown in color.My wife was quite shaken up by this.  I was excited!  She slammed on the breaks pretty hard on the off ramp when she saw this thing and noticed other people around her doing the same thing, looking up at the sky.Anyone passing Intersection 196, heading west, MUST have got an even better view of it.

I was eight years old and my parents and I were visiting their friends, somewhere rural outside of Toronto.  Not exactly sure of where but it would have been in the GTA, summer, late in the afternoon. As the only kid there, I was told to go play outside. The backyard was a large grass area, with large trees( pines and such) and wooded areas around the perimeter of the property.Anyway, I saw a movement in the sky and looked up. Gliding through the air was a ring shaped object. Not a disk, more like a substantial wedding band, with tall sides but a hollow narrow body. There was no noise, no smoke, no vapor. It was moving quite slow and low, maybe twice the height of the tree line.  The outer side of the &quot;band&quot; was black and had little white dot lights on it, similar to an electronic score board.  The ring itself did not appear to be spinning, but the white dots seemed to be scrolling around  and changing their configuration, but nothing that I could read.  The little dot symbols seemed very simple, just randomly changing and moving around.  There was no discernible front or back. It just quietly glided past with nothing changing other than the dots.  I watched it quite calmly for about 30 seconds and then it went past the treeline and I couldn&apos;t see it anymore.I then went in to get everyone to come out to the front yard to see if we could still see it.  The adults weren&apos;t that interested in my rambling about a spaceship and when I went back outside, of course it had not reappeared.Being 8 at the time, I don&apos;t seem to have a good grasp of the size. I seem to recall it being small, maybe 15 to 15 feet across. I remember thinking that it had to have very small spacemen or that it was being controlled remotely, being that the shape didn&apos;t seem like anyone could be inside. But who knows, maybe it was bigger than I remember or maybe they were really really small, lol.Over the years I have wondered if it was some sort of remote controlled aircraft or weird balloon, etc. but it just doesn&apos;t seem plausible. It was definitely flying, with no noise, no vapor, no strings and looked like a simple band horizontally gliding above the trees.

One of the object, glowing red, moved quickly toward my house, above where I was standing. It hovered no more than 300 feet above me, and moved down the road.Later that night, at 3:00 sharp, my roommate came outside as I was coming in.  I told him what had happened, and we both began searching the night sky.  Seconds later, the shape appeared again, moving as it had before (very rapidly).  Within ten minutes, a series of flashes erupted from the east, without cloud cover (no lightning).  Immediately afterward, a dozen circular &quot;crafts&quot; emerged, traveling in perfect oblong triangles (groups of three), moving west at a decent speed, as though heading toward some planned destination.  It didn&apos;t take long before more and more of these groups emerged.  Soon enough, the sky was littered with these triangular groups.It was like looking at a sky filled with moving stars, but the stars were larger and far brighter, able to pierce through cloud cover.  After each wave finished, there would be more flashes of light, followed by hundreds of &quot;crafts.&quot;  Coincidentally, the flashing red craft I had seen earlier came bounding down towards us, but stayed at a decent height.  Tiny specks of light (or what looked like smaller crafts) broke off of the entity periodically.  This whole process lasted two hours, or until 5:00 am.  All in all, I would say that we saw approximately 1500 anomalies.I realize how outlandish this sounds, but I am being quite honest, and only wish to help people understand the gravity of the situation. I can only share my subject feelings on the matter, but from the looks of it, each anomaly was being piloted, taking non linear paths, some turning around completely.  At one point, when all of the cloud cover vanished, the crafts froze simultaneously and took on the patterns of constellations, i.e., Orion&apos;s Belt, the Big Dipper, etc., as though to camouflage. The flashing red anomaly also emitted a strange pulsating noise, very quietly; however, only further examination of the envirnment will tell if this is somehow connected.I hope this happens again tonight, as I will be patiently awaiting.  I am serious in admitting that something very big was (or is) going on.

Today&apos;s incident:  I was outside in the backyard getting some sunshine, and as I was looking up towards the south-west, at about 1 or 2 o&apos;clock, I saw a shiny matalic object, moving rapidly (I say 200-500 mph) in the sky towards the south-east at about 2,000 to 5,000 ft. It had a bright golden/matalic glow to it.I saw it for only 2 or 3 seconds and then....it disappeared.There were clouds in the sky, but where I saw the UFO flying, it was perfectly clear and deep blue...It didn&apos;t go inside/behind a cloud,like alot of reports suggest...it just vanished..into thin air!!!

There was no sound or anything, I was moving at a high rate of speed and was gone with in a min leaving a greenish gray trail behind it.

I had not noticed what he was looking at until he started yelling that he saw a ufo.  Naturally I didn&apos;t believe him.  Too far fetched for me.  He told me that he saw a strange green light stay still in the sky fore a few brief moments, then zig zag back in for rapidly a few times, then take off again not to be seen.Later in the night I had to go to the town over to get to my girlfriends house, around the time I got on the freeway I noticed a green light.  I watched in amazement for a bit eating my own words.  I immediately called him and told him I witnessed the exact same same thing.

Object may appear up to three nights a week and has no movement other than when you stare at it a optical illusion makes it seem to move.  However when viewed through a telescope it appears to have shape and remains solid in position.  Object does change colors but I can&rsquo;t determine if it&rsquo;s actual color change or just atmospheric light distortion.  The only reason the object caught my attention is the abrupt entry and exit speeds of the object.  I have clearly seen aircraft around the object by the indicator lights on the aircraft, but the aircraft&rsquo;s were not pursuing the object.  Unfortunately I&rsquo;ve tried both camera and video camera to capture the object but all I capture is a big blurry ball.  I&rsquo;ve tried to take a picture through the telescope but this also was a failure.  I cannot determine the entry and exit speeds however it does leave a trail of light through the sky which only lasts briefly.  It&rsquo;s entry and exit patterns very day by day.  Too dark to get a genuine shape however occasionally I will get a glimpse of a reflective surface on moonlit nights.

Was ridiculed for it by my family for what I am about to write.I am of the age of 35 yrs and almost 20 yrs ago, a friend and I were honestly getting ready to head to the lakes about a mile from my home at the time to have a few beers.  Mind you we hadn&apos;t had any to drink at this point.We pulled up to about the end of the lake, &ldquo;they were man made lakes for reservoirs,&rdquo; and parked the car got out and cracked our first beer.  This was around 9:30 pm..  The year was I believe 1990 and it was around march , &ldquo;what day I could not be sure,&rdquo;.  Anyhow we just cracked our first beer and looked over to the north east toward cape Canaveral fl.We noticed a luminescent orange light emerging from the ground. Our first reaction was what is that?  I said it&apos;s the shuttle. My friend says , &ldquo;no couldn&apos;t be I didn&apos;t hear anything on the news about a launch&rdquo;. I said, &ldquo; Me either but there it is.The strange thing is that it looked to be traveling straight up and  at a very slow accent. My friend also noticed this and said that&apos;s weird. I agree. And sure as he said that it looked to have shot straight up what looked to be at least  2 miles up within the blink of an eye.We then noticed it coming in our direction. After seeing it move toward us we guessed it to be at least 3to4 miles away. It was over the lake not more than 50 yards in front of us within less than three seconds. Our initial reaction was holy sh** what the f**k is that.My friend and I got in the care shaking trying to put the keys in the ignition. I told him how many time in your life will you see this again? So we stayed. I remember it being shaped like a slender oval. It reflected the moonlight and the moon as would a mirror and had two lights on top swaying back and forth touching each other. No noticeable windows or anything.I don&apos;t think they knew we were there. I believe it was purely accidental we saw them that close because when I opened the car door to get a better look, &ldquo; this thing at an angle straightened up shot side to side across the lakes at what appeared to now be a white light. It shot back and forth within 2 seconds stopped  at the end of the lakes and just shot off towards west palm bch fl you didn&apos;t have time to even close your eye and it was gone.We both agreed that we had just seen what we had seen. I told him we should tell someone. He said sh** I&apos;m not telling anyone there going to think your f***ing crazy. I went home told my mom and brother who both till this day call me a liar and just don&apos;t believe.Look I wasn&apos;t a believer in this. Never told stories like this in my whole life about seeing things. Yet how can you help what you see. I am now and always will be a believer.The story gets better. For about a week after I noticed what appeared to be a white light resembling a star would always be on the right of the cars I would be in and would also change direction with the car as we would turn there it would be on the right side of the car. Weird I thought at first until I thought that no other stars do that so what the f am I going crazy?  I kept telling my girlfriend at the time and she about thought I was going crazy too. Until about 6 days after the initial sighting I noticed from my house back by the lakes a light. Looked like a spot light from a helicopter.I told my girl do you see that? She said it&apos;s just a plane or something like that. So out of all last hope I grabbed my lighter , &ldquo;I know sounds stupid,&rdquo; and began flickering in click click click pause click pattern. My girl looked at me like I was crazy. Can you blame her. Everyone else thought I was crazy. Until I noticed the light got real bright and flickered the same pattern. My girl said that was co-incidence so I did it again in a different pattern.And once again it did also. At this point my girl even said that&apos;s weird. I noticed the light starting to come our direction and as it got closer we heard the sound of a prop plane. My girlfriend then said see I told you it was a plane and I said no crap your right. At this moment the prop plane sound changed to what sounded like a helicopter . I started to trip at this point and I asked my girl if she just heard that thing change sound. She said yes. And at that moment it sounded like it changed to the sound of a single jet propulsion engine.The light began to get closer and as it came by the street in front of the house the light dimmed out to almost nothing and the sound just stopped. And there it was again and my girl saw it with her own eyes and starting crying and saying I want to go inside. I told her to look and tell me I am not crazy and she said I see it I see it I want to go in the house.I told her to go inside and get my mom and her husband , &ldquo;at the time,&rdquo; and tell them to come out the back door and look up over the house in the back yard . This thing was 30 ft high and probably 30 ft in front of us. By the time my mom and her husband came out I watched this thing start flickering and moving up down left right and random patterns as fast as the eye could see and disappeared . My mother said that I talked about it so much to my girl that I convinced her to see this in living color and she saw it only because I convinced her to see this, my girl I mean. She even told my mother and they did not believe us. If I was that convincing to make someone see that then put me on ripleys or I am in the wrong line of work. Oh well I know what I saw and have not seen it in almost 20yrs.Moved to wis. And recently strange things have occurred over the last two weeks that I can not explain. White star like object sitting in the sky around dusk very similar to the one I thought was around for a week prior to the second sighting when I was sixteen. Noticed every night for last two weeks at least ten times this has occurred. Will watch the star slowly descend and turn to amber orb no visual shape other than amber or every once in a while it changes colors but mostly amber. Sits there and moves slow almost as if to get my attention. Will watch it fade out to nothing and light will reappear bright white and turn amber and move slightly . Call this strange but it is really weir-ding me out .   After 19 yrs what the hell is it and why does it keep coming back . Have looked around environment and questioning it you know , &ldquo; maybe it&apos;s a street light , but come up with the same answer. It&apos;s not! Reason: It has not been here every night.  I&apos;ve seen this thing at least! 10 times and on a couple of clear nights its not there and 30min later there it is . So if anyone can help me solve this riddle pls do.Note: I have never been abducted nor have I ever seen an alien being, just what I saw when I  was sixteen and now again almost 20 yrs later. Have never been inside of this thing or anything like this.Just a color changing orb appears at close range.Is it possible after one has a close encounter for these things to show up and let you know at a distance that they are back or am I just fortunate enough to see this again ? And if so why ? Haven&apos;t seen or looked up in almost 20 yrs . Tried to forget what I saw. This all started 4/14/2010 right before the meteor event. Saw these lights before the meteor and have 9 other occasions over the last 2 weeks.I know I am not nuts considering I haven&apos;t seen this in 19 yrs and not the same. This has been appearing around9:30 10: almost every night for the last two weeks.

On the night of May 12, 2010 I was taking a series of Images (over 80 images in total) of stars for a composite star trails picture.The image I captured that is of concern, shows a green streak traveling from northwest to southeast. Each exposure was for 5 minutes at a 400 ISO at f3.5 and was taken at 11:25.I&rsquo;m used to seeing meteors and satellites in my images, but never like this. A friend of mine who is a professional astronomer and the Curator of an observatory in Washington state examined the image and can&rsquo;t explain it either.When the image is zoomed in on, there are no others lights are visible (like red or white for an aircraft). The astronomer and I both thought that perhaps it was just a meteor that was heavy in nickel, that would show as green as it heated up. But on second thought, he felt that in his experience (which spans decades) he&rsquo;s never seen a green meteor that would take up a whole trail like this and be this brilliant.The laser idea also came up, but I&rsquo;ve been doing this for a long time, and had green lasers in my field of view for star trails images; in my experience they&rsquo;ve never shown this brilliant, if at all.Also, if it were a laser, they would have had to hold it steady for 5 whole minutes, an almost impossible task. The streak also shows that it was very quick, because it doesn&rsquo;t move in motion with the stars in the background.I&rsquo;m open to any ideas&hellip;thanks!

I&apos;m 26 year&apos;s old with two little girls....I don&apos;t really know who to tell my story to.I&apos;ve had these strange sorts of events happening to me throughout my life.  They were coupled with different feelings... confusion, fear, disbelief.None of it really made sense until I saw in detail what I&apos;m about to tell you.  I knew that everything I had questioned before was no longer questionable.  It was undisputed in my mind.  It has been going on my entire life and now there is finally an event that proves (to me) that this is real.I&apos;ll start by telling you that my cousin ((name deleted)) was with me when this happened...  He has been in the navy now for about 8 years.  He is a trustworthy person and his word means a lot to everyone that knows him.  Not only is it me telling the story, but he can verify that what I&apos;m telling you is true.My cousin and myself were sitting on the back porch of my house (which was also my bedroom).  It was my bedroom at the time because it was a room enclosed with glass walls.  Some of the sections of the glass had been removed and either had screens remaining or nothing left in them at all.  Since it was summer, this wasn&apos;t really a problem.  I actually loved being in a room that allowed me to look outside at nature and even the stars.We had a couch-bed in the room that was unfolded at the time.  It was unfolded for most of the summer so that my cousin could sleep over and &quot;hang out&quot; with me.  The backside of the couch-bed was placed against the glass, so the unfolded bed occupied the space in the room facing the house.We were laying in bed trying to sleep but we spent most of our time talking instead.  Then, out of the corner of my eye, I spotted a red glowing orb that came into view from behind the house and was slowly moving across the sky.  *See Attached Photo*  I got ((name deleted)) attention and we both watched the orb move across the treeline that was north of the trailer park.  It seemed to not be as far away as a plane should be.  It look to be about the size of a basketball approximately 50 yards away.  I then realized that it was getting closer and that it clearly was not a plane.As it moved across the sky, we watched as this incredible UFO was slowly moving toward a treeline where we assumed it would disappear out of our lives forever.But instead of disappearing into the sky... I could still see it through the trees moving towards the ground. I could clearly see it flickering through the trees and I would estimate it to be approximately 10 feet off of the ground as it entered the field on the left.  It had clearly made a 90 degree turn. At this point in time I realized that it was probably in the field that was on the other side of the treeline.  (Treeline: small patch of woods separating the trailer park and a field.)  It traveled the length of the field before I could not see it through the trees anymore.  I would estimate the length of the field to be about 200 yards.My cousin and myself sat in awe even after we could not see the UFO anymore.  He turned to me and said &quot;let&apos;s go check it out!&quot;  I sternly answered with, &quot;hell no! are you f**king crazy??&quot;  I was not sure what I had just seen but I had a gut feeling that I did not want to find out. So, we waited...waited... two young boys waiting to see something else as amazing as what they had just witnessed.Then it happened...A flash, as if someone had taken a picture from a camera, appeared at my friend ((name deleted)) trailer.  It was on the other side of her trailer, preventing me from seeing the source of the flash.Approximately two minutes later, another flash... this time, from the side of her trailer. I still couldn&apos;t clearly see the source of the flash.At this point, my cousin and I were starting to think something strange was happening.A few moments later, another flash. This time, I could clearly see the source of the flash... nothing.  It appeared as if the flash was angled towards ((name deleted)) house, although there was no source of the flash.  There was absolutely nothing visible to the naked eye that created this OBVIOUS flash.  Bud and myself both KNEW that flashes that are that distinct do NOT come from NOTHING.We waited about five more minutes still staring out into the trailer court through my glass room.  We were now more worried about what was in the court than what we had seen earlier.  Without speaking to each other for what seemed like five or ten minutes, another flash happened.This time it was at my friend ((name deleted)) house - directly in front of my house.  The flash was on the other side of the trailer and appeared to be aimed at his mothers bedroom.  Again we waited... wondering what the flashes were.Another couple minutes had gone by.  Another flash.This time, it was clearly pointed at Tommy&apos;s window and there was NOTHING at the source of the flash.  In my mind I could pinpoint, to the INCH, where the flash had started, yet there was nothing there. ((name deleted)) looked to me and said,  &quot;what the hell are those flashes?&quot;  I had no reply.  I wanted to remain silent and hidden from whatever had been making the flashes.Again we waited.About another five minutes passed when there was a flash on the other side of Mr. Wilson&apos;s house.  (That wasn&apos;t his real name, but we knew him as Mr. Wilson in the trailer park.)  So, we waited what seemed like forever.  In reality, it was probably 15 to 20 minutes with no sign of flashes or anything similar to them.Quite suddenly, Bud looked at me and said &quot;well, I&apos;m getting tired. wake me if anything happens.&quot;  He then put his head right down on his hands where he was sitting (propped up on his knees on the backside of the couch bed).I said, &quot;okay&quot; but wondered how anybody in their right mind could just fall asleep that fast after witnessing what we had witnessed. In my mind,  I would not go to sleep until the sun was up and people were awake.I started to get the strange feeling that the happening wasn&apos;t over.  Then... I started piecing things together that were quite simple and obvious.1. ((name deleted)) lives with her mother and father.  There were 3 flashes at her trailer. (aimed at their bedrooms&hellip; )  2. ((name deleted)) lives with his mother. There were 2 flashes at his trailer. (aimed at their bedrooms, also...)  3. Mr. ((name deleted)) lives alone. There was one flash.I figured that if they had gone through flashing every individual, as they went around from left to right in the court, since Wilson was last they had to turn around and come up the other line of trailers...starting with mine.I almost panicked as I came to the realization of what I believed was true.I turned my head in the direction of where I believed the thing causing the flash to be.  As I turned my head I could clearly see out my window (one that did not have glass or screen in it - open - nothing obstructing my view) an alien.  I had turned quick enough to spot him before I saw a flash come from, what seemed like, his forehead..........When the flash hit me, he disappeared and I realized I was completely paralyzed.  As I tried to move my limbs, I looked around to realize that I was no longer on the same part of my bed that I had been during the flash.  I was, in fact, at the foot of my bed on my knees staring at the open window as if nothing had happened. Instantly, the numbness was gone.I grabbed the back of Bud&apos;s leg (because he was in the same position that he had been in when he laid his head down...)  It appeared that he had not moved at all.  But somehow I was at least 4 feet away from where I was when I had seen the flash...?  When I grabbed his leg I screamed extremely loud &quot;BUD! wake up!&quot;  His head came off of his hands with his eyes wide as if he knew something wasn&apos;t right.We didn&apos;t have to say anything to each other as we both jumped up and ran into the kitchen.  We each armed ourselves with butcher knives, not knowing how much time had gone by or if the threat was still around. He asked me what had happened.  The only way I could really describe it to him was &quot;I was flashed..&quot;  Bud KNEW what I meant by that, which told me that I wasn&apos;t just seeing things and that I wasn&apos;t alone.After about two minutes of silence.. waiting for something else to happen.. we finally laughed at the fact that we were standing armed in the kitchen with knives... waiting for aliens to come.It seemed ridiculous to us.  Although it had clearly just happened, we couldn&apos;t really wrap our minds around it.  So, we laughed it off and this time we went to bed INSIDE of the house, instead of the room surrounded with glass windows.(This event has made me realize that more than one time in my life - for a split second - I have seen aliens and &quot;the flash&quot;. I have seen them in my bedroom window... I have seen them outside of my tent while sleeping in the woods* the same woods that are between the trailer park and the field I described*... I have had many occasions where, just for a second, I believed that I had been part of an alien abduction. Seeing what I have seen and the fact that I have witnessed a UFO, I have seen that UFO land in my field, I have seen something flash friends and neighbors, and I have been flashed by something that came from the sky... this is not your ordinary alien story because to this day I cannot say that I fully remember ever communicating with an alien or being aboard their &quot;crafts&quot;. But that doesn&apos;t mean that I haven&apos;t seen, felt, or experienced something extremely out of the ordinary. My cousin was there as a witness to the UFO and to all six flashes... (the seventh, of co! urse, being my own) I have no explanation as to WHAT exactly the flashes are or WHAT they do to people, but I do think that they were meant for individual people... and to somehow make a person &quot;unaware&quot; that something is going on... whether by putting them to sleep... paralyzing them... or wiping out their memory... I don&apos;t know for certain. What I do know for certain is that I have had many encounters with them and I believe that I truly know how they arrive. To put it bluntly, I&apos;ve caught them in the act of flashing people. I believe that they were completely unaware that I had spotted them, until it was too late. I feel as though they knew that they had made a mistake. I had witnessed their mistake and I almost FELT the reaction of the alien as.. panic. For the instant that I saw him, I knew in my gut that he was as scared of me as I was of him. I knew that their &quot;routine&quot; was not supposed to have been witnessed by anyone. We are supposed to be dazed and unaware by the ! flash when they come.)((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The lights were approx 500-1,000 feet above the ground.  This guess is based on my own personal experiences with flight lessons in which I was a pilot who flew under VFR only.What made me watch the lights was the fact that there were no navigational blinking lights as well as literally NO SOUND.  The craft flew over my house and it was at this time that I noticed it was not two but three white lights in a triangular shape.I wanted to run in and get my wife but did not want to miss out on what I was seeing.  This craft was very low and while directly overhead emitted a sort of haze around the lights.  I really believe that this object was not a conventional aircraft despite it heading in the direction of the Moline, IL airport.There has to be other people in the vicinity to have seen this.  I am shocked at what I saw at such a close distance.

I know it was not durring the hour of 9:00 in the evening, as I was inside for the whole hour watching tv.  I stepped outback to check on the cat.  I was facing west when I noticed a bright flashing orange light to the south east of me.  We live near a smaller airport and I like to watch the air traffic.  I have never before noticed a plane with such bright a light.  The light was alternating bright orange and white.  The lights appeared to be side by side.  The object was low in the sky, much like the planes who are turning to go in for a landing about a mile north of us.  It seemed to be lower than most small crafts in the area.  This flashing object was headed east.  It is not a usual flight direction for our area.  I noticed a second light that came from the south and turned to go east following the first set of lights.  I know the second object was a plane or hellicopter because it flashed the normal color lights and it made noise.  The first craft with orange and white lights was not making noise. I found that part strange.  The light from the first object looked much brighter and larger than any other in the sky.

Therefore  I am always trying to debunk what my mind wants me to think.I live4-5 miles from the Redondo Beach coastline.  There is an airport &frac12; mile from my home, There have been a few times that a plane coming from over the ocean toward the airport seems to glow but I quickly figure out that it must be the sun reflecting off of the water and giving the appearance of a plane glowing.  The two times this has happened after a few minutes the plane looses reflection from the water and shows itself.Today however I was stumped. I wondered, not sure why, outside of the overhang of my carport and looked directly up beyond the airport airspace. I saw what I quickly thought was a plane that had caught  the sun that was behind me. My first thought was that this plane must be some aluminum shell picking up every possible reflection  it could to give the appearance that this plane was flickering with fire. The reflection was flickering like Morse code or something in that type of pattern.  The light moved at normal plane speed from west over the coast line to east about 5 miles past my location, slightly higher than 75% of the planes that come through this area.  Once it traveled far from me I expected the reflection to dim but it maintained it&rsquo;s glow well.  I was somewhat perplexed but I still felt it was a plane. At the 5 mile point past my location it turn upward and traveled to a greater altitude, before turning back at what appeared to be around the same speed as many of the! WW11 planes and sesna&rsquo;s  that decentin to the airport landing strip.  The glowing golden object came back past the airport heading west and then stopped it&rsquo;s westwardly movement. It help position for the most part in one area for the next five minutes.  There was some minor attitude changes but it maintained a very still and silent hold of it&rsquo;s position.  The moment it stopped movement I was not thinking plane anymore. I was able to go in my house twice to get my phone camera and my digital camera, both times when I came outside it had not moved and continued it Glowing flashes.I made one final dash inside my home begging my girlfriend to come outside, when I came out the last time the object was gone.Could it have been some type of metallic object like an aluminum balloon that appeared to be farther than it was, therefore it looked like it was traveling at plane speed and it just happened to catch the sun reflection and wind patterns that created its movement? I thought about that at certain point when I did not think it was a plane anymore but when I came out of my home for the third time after a 10-15 second absence the object was gone.  Before I went inside it was not moving at all and in 15 seconds it disappeared.I am not saying it was a UFO, but it was not something I could deduce, and going outside for noreason in the first place is a bit weird.Not one of the photos I took had anything on them except for blue sky", "two star light object seen minutes apart moving slowly across the sky originating and ending at the same locaitonFrom a balcony looking ENE I was looking at a star in the sky when a second &quot;star&quot; appeared above it of about the same light intensity.  The intensity remained the same as it moved in a straight line at a slow rate of speed for about 5 seconds before disappearing.  It was not blinking and did not appear to be an airplane or a meteor.  My guess was that it was a satellite, except within a matter of minutes a second light appeared in precisely the same spot as where the first appeared, was of slightly greater intensity, and moved across the same path as the first before disappearing.  The possibility of two satellites on the same trajectory only minutes apart seemed odd.", "flashing star type, green blue red and white and hovered left to right just a littlein the south east sky there are 5 of these the brightest looks like a star but changes color green red blue white and hovers left to right just a little the one right above that blinking one looks like it has a tail of little tiny lights, kind of looks like a crooked unbrella.

At about 20:30 on January 4, 2000, (est.), my son was in the vicinity of Jomax Rd. and 62nd St. looking toward the south at the lights of Phoenix in the distance.  The day had been overcast with some rain, which had stopped in the evening.  A light at the extreme right side of his field of view caused him to look in that direction, west.  He witnessed a vivid green circular object descending at about a 30 degree angle, the object was the size of a dime at arms length.  At a height of about 200 feet above the ground the object stopped and a second identical object then appeared as if out of the first and proceeded on the same path and speed until it was about 12 diameters from the first, then it too stopped.  A third identical object immediately appeared, traveled the same distance, stopped, and a fourth identical object repeated the process until it reached the 12 diameter distance.  The moment the fourth object stopped the entire string of four objects then pivoted on the central axis of their array with the last object appearing closest to my son with the original object the most distant.  The array swung in such a fashion that it became parallel to the ground, forming an east-west line.  At this point my son was able to see that there were still four objects even though they overlapped each other from his vantage point.  Within a second or two all the objects simply vanished, followed a few seconds later by two loud &quot;sonic booms&quot;.   At this point my son, then 16, made a hasty retreat to our home.He described the objects as having even illumination across the entire surface with distinct edges.  He described the green as similar to the green in a traffic signal.  The movement of the objects was very smooth as each emerged from the previous one.  His estimate was that the objects were about 1/4 mile from his location.  A set of electrical transmission towers runs on a southeast to northwest line, about 1/2 mile west of this location.  When I questioned him about the possibility of some sort of ball lightning or electrical plasma, he dismissed this possibility stating that the objects were never in the vicinity of the transmission lines.  He stated that the objects somewhat reminded him of the warning balls attached to power lines in the vicinity of airports.  Since the objects retained their circular shape as they pivoted, he made the assumption that they were spheres.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I was able to watch it for about 10 seconds give or take as it fell, and noticed the apparent size of the object from my distance meant it could not have been terribly far away---my best guess being it fell somewhere beyond campus in the fields beyond.  I should note that this was at night of course, and my sense of distance could have been skewed, but that object was pretty bright and appeared large from my viewpoint.My first impression was it could have been a lone stray firework, but as I studied it, my impression was that of a fireball.

In the Northwestern sky I stared at a light that was flashing looked to be a constant white and red.  I then pointed it out to my husband, at which point we noticed there was a triangle shape of two additional bright, flashing lights.I went inside to get some binnoculars to get a better look of the image.  When I returned the brighter light of the three I initially saw now was a constant white with a red flash on the left of the light, green flash to the right and the occasional yellow/ orange flash.  There was at times a set pattern and at other times no noticeable pattern.  About 15 minutes into the phenomenom there was a sudden brilliant blue almost indigo light that emitted and the object moved slightly up vertically.  The object then went back to the original light flashing of alternating the multi-color flashing.It was at this point I called my sisters that live roughly 3 miles away to see if the could see these lights.  I called neighbors to see if they too, were still awake and could see.  All that I was able to get a hold of, confirmed that they too saw what we were seeing.  My sisters stated that they could see 2 additional triangular shaped flashing lights of 3 in two different groups.

All of these planes didn&apos;t appear to react in anyway to the flashing lights.  It also helped give us an estimate to the altitude, the planes were much higher.  The flashing lights were just above the tree line from our patio.Tried on multiple occasions to use a camera to photograph but all we had was an iPhone camera which isn&apos;t of good quality and couldn&apos;t pick up anything on the image.  We drove closer to where we thought the light was directly overhead to get a picture but could never get a decent quality shot.  When we came back home the original flashing light was much dimmer and had moved quite some distance away.

Pocono area.At around the NJ/PA border, I spotted a star as I faced west and a light approximately a hand&rsquo;s distance below that star.  The light appeared to be red and green from afar, so I assumed it was an aircraft of some sort.  As I drove approximately for thirty minutes or so, I noticed that the light just above the horizon was getting brighter and larger.  As I came upon the intersection between W-80 and 380-N, I noticed that the craft was to my left (south of the W-80 road).  It appeared twice the size of a full moon, approximately 9-10 building stories above the ground, hovering.  It was very large in appearance.  At the time, the sun was setting so I had a little light to make out the bulk of the object.The craft seemed metallic in appearance, and seemed to have vertical metallic grooves going down the sides.  The object was dreidel or cross-shaped and had white lights on the upper, lower, right and left extremities.  It also had a red light in the middle of the craft.

They were a yellow-orange color.  They initially hovered in the sky in no distinct formation.  Slowly they started to float(?) downward and one by one faded out.  It was so dramatic that a car stopped and 4 people jumped out to look at it.Now I realize that this could have been a firework but it would have to have been an industrial/military type thing because these lights were really high in the sky.

It was a bright white glow which appeared to be multiple lights with no colored lights.The speed and abrupt movement was nothing like I&rsquo;d ever seen.  We were used to seeing and hearing jets in and around Phoenix but never at night.  Jets frequently broke the sound barrier over Phoenix during that time so we were used to seeing them and this was not one of them.There were 9 of us in the car.  My two parents and I were in the front seat and my 3 brothers and 3 sisters in the back seat.  My two parents and I saw it clearly for the duration of the event which lasted less than one minute or half a minute.  Four siblings saw the event and the other 3 were sleeping. It had to have been a weekend day because my parents would not have had us out that late on a week night.There was much commotion in the car and my parents, who were normally calm and serious, sounded alarmed and scared, which scared me.  The term UFO was not used; we all used the term &quot;flying saucer&quot; to describe it.  My father abruptly told all of us that we were never to speak of this again because the child welfare people would think they were crazy and unfit parents and take us away.  We never reported the incident to anyone.I mentioned it to my parents several years later in the 1980s and they both remembered the incident vividly.  In February 2009 all of my siblings were together and I asked if any of them remembered the incident and all four of them that witnessed it remembered the event.My parents are now deceased but all siblings are living.    Phoenix was a really small town back then.  South Mountain was a nice area, not a slum like today.  There were radio towers on top of the mountain.  From the top of South Mountain you can see all of Phoenix as well as Luke Air Force Base and Sky Harbor Airport (which was very small back then).I&rsquo;m reporting it now because I thought there should be some record of the incident for posterity.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date in 1959.

I can not estimate its speed, but it moved from my left to my right in about 2 seconds.  I continued to see it for about another 10 seconds as it continued south over Rt 22 and 78, and it seemed to slow only because my view of it was looking at it from the back.

But they had a form.  They were definitely not balloons.I also could tell they were quite large, because if a buzzard, the bigget bird around here was that high it would have been about a sixth to an eighth of the size of these things, and it would have been soaring and flying.They were stationary and were in a line side by side but separate individual objects, not moving any parts, just floating with the clouds.I looked at them for a short while but could not figure out what they were.

While turning it pitched about 70 degrees and I saw three lights. These three lights made me report this as a triangle shape from their position in respect to each other. The light that I did not see until it turned was slightly red in color. I could not see the body for it must have been transparent. I only saw the dark blue sky behind it. After turning, I could not see it because it went behind a tree. From that point, I did not see it again. I went around the area and noticed aircraft, probably United States air force, moving around.

I just feel like I need to tell somebody now because what I saw was incredible.  I have told a few friends but I am most definitely sure that they think I saw something(I don&rsquo;t care if nobody believes me, I know what I saw).   I love to watch the UFO television shows but I am the type that has to see something in order for me to believe so if my friends came up to me saying they saw something I would also may tell them I believe them but in the back of my mind I would probably think they saw something.  Well let me get started.  It was my friends&rsquo; birthday and we decided to go to the club 2009 in Dallas, Texas.  We planned on getting wasted and have a good time like we always do.  Well we got to the club and it was a normal night until I deci! ded to go out to the car and smoke a cig with my girl.  We got to the car around 1:45AM.  We were in the car facing north in the parking lot, I was in the passenger seat and she was in the driver seat.  We were having a conversation over something very old as we watched people walk by.  I remember looking at the security guard on top of the building patrolling, looking down, I guess to make sure nothing crazy happened,  it was around 2:15AM when out of the corner of my eye I saw  UFO floating from east to west as if to be a balloon.  As soon as I saw IT, I said &ldquo;Look&rdquo; to my girl and we both rushed out the car to look at the thing, we both are sure it wasn&rsquo;t a plane or a balloon especially because of its lights.  When we stepped out it seemed to have stopped and it just started getting smaller as it went up and before I could process what the hell was going on, it was gone!  The overall time it was there was around 10 seconds.  Well I must say I was a little drunk but it was! n&rsquo;t my first time drinking and in all my life of getting drunk! I have never seen things that weren&rsquo;t there especially disk like flying objects.  I also want to say that WE only saw if for a small amount of time so I don&rsquo;t want to give a description of it since it may be inaccurate but I do remember that it was circular and it had circular blue lights under it!  I also remember that it was kind of fat in the middle so it wasn&rsquo;t a perfect circle or sphere, maybe egg shaped but like I said I don&rsquo;t want to go into too much detail since I may be inaccurate.  All I know is that I saw something that I had never seen before and I really didn&rsquo;t believe in that stuff but I now know that there is &ldquo;something&rdquo; out there.  The object made no noise and when it started to elevate did not leave a trail/aurora, nothing, it didn&apos;t shoot off into space either like on television, it simply elevated very fast.  I am also almost certain that the guy patrolling on the roof saw it but I&rsquo;m not sure.  I also know it was around 2:15AM because my cousin called at 2:22AM a! nd by then I just kept talking about it and it had just happened. I also want to add that about 2 minutes after we saw the UFO we were standing outside(because I made my girlfriend stand by me just in case we saw something else) I was looking East of in the distance when I saw 2 star like lights moving up and down as if to be playing but when I told her to &quot;look&quot; they were gone!  That only lasted for about 3 seconds. If anybody has seen something similar I would love to hear about it and compare, I am really interested and excited because I now know we are not alone.  If you think I was too drunk or I am mistaken, NO! I know what I saw.  I wish I could have captured it on camera but I don&apos;t know why I didn&apos;t even think about it.  I will go there again and try to capture some proof.", "This was a bright, fast moving object that was in view for about 15 seconds before disappearing.At about 2225 hours on 05/08/10, my wife and I were walking with our dogs in Isanti, MN.

As the dogs were sniffing around, the Western sky light up inexplicably catching the attention of both women who turned to look at each other in total shock.  The light was so big and so bright and so powerful it could not have been a spot light, search light or or anything of the sort.  There was no sound and it flashed and disappeared with no trace in about a second.  The flash of bright white light seemed to project from the Sierra de San Pedro Martir toward the Sea of Cortez meaning it appeared to projecting from West to East.  The landscape of this sighting is remote, barely developed, rugged desert flatland where there are no street lights or light pollution.  It was absolutely bizarre.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Cowichan more precisely, during sunny weather with only a few clouds and maybe a high haze, while I was driving down Kingsview Rd from &apos;The Properties&apos; on the W slope of Mt Tzuhalem, as I approached the bottom where it comes to a T with Maple Bay Rd, I spotted something small in the air somewhere over Quamichan Lake, maybe 1km away I estimate.It was reflecting the sun (to the upper left) and had some sort of dark attachment, either above or below it - I&apos;m sorry I can&apos;t remember clearly as I only saw it for a few secs.. but it was rising quickly.  As you would expect, my mind was racing thru the various possibilities as to ID - small helicopter/plane or model of such.. mylar balloon, etc - none seemed to fit. (If it were a plane, model or real, I think I would have seen wings.) I could not pull over to watch it as there was traffic behind me and no room to pull over, not to mention going down steep hill, so as I descended toward the main Rd I lost sight of it behind the trees along that road.  But just seconds later, after turning onto that rd in the short merge lane I found I had a clear view out over the lake, and there were no longer any vehicles behind me, so I could pull over and try to relocate it. The only trees were now to my far left, but pretty open view otherwise. There was nothing to be seen in the sky.  It had to have hightailed it out of there pretty fast to disappear like that. When I saw it I could see it against Mt Prevost in the background (beyond the lake and on the other side of Hwy 1), which provided good contrast to see the obj. Some of its rapid upward motion could have been caused by my decent, but I&apos;m sure that effect only added to its real motion.I could not figure out why I could no longer see it anywhere around, after only a few seconds. I wondered if the power line crossing the main rd over to Kingsview had been reflecting the sun as I came down, viewing it almost end-on.  So I got back in my car and spun around to go back up the hill and down again to recreate the effect, but the power line was too low to have caused it. There goes that theory..  I&apos;m quite certain it was out over the lake, maybe 1km from me, almost level with my line of sight and the Mtn in the background, but quickly rising.  It had to be very shiny to reflect the sun like that, but couldn&apos;t have been very large - no bigger than a small helicopter. So it still could have been something mundane like that but even with choppers you can usually see them flying away in 1 direction or other, they can&apos;t move that fast! Hope this is detailed enough considering the banality of the sighting as compared with others, but it was actually my first sighting in 34yrs of life and felt I should report it. Wish it could be less vague.", "Random flashing multicolored lights, with one spotlight, shining down onto my house.Standing outside in my garden, I noticed a light on the horizon.  It was red at the beginning, but after a few minutes, it got brighter as it approached and resolved into a multicolored profusion of lights.  The event lasted about 5 minutes, and during the last 30 or so seconds, the collection of multicolored, randomly flashing lights stopped directly over my house, which was about a hundred feet from the garden.  It was dark, so I couldn&apos;t discern the shape of whatever it was, just a bunch of randomly flashing multicolored lights.  It appeared to be about 100 feet above the house, and if I had to guess based on the cluster of lights as an indicator of size, I would say that it was about 20 feet wide.  Anyway, as it stopped over my house, a spotlight shone down from it onto the house.  I must emphasize that it made no noise at all during the entire time, even when it was almost directly overhead.  When the spotlight appeared, I panicked and ran into the house.  The person who I was standing with outside watching it followed me after about 15 more seconds.  After I had calmed down some, we both went back outside and it was gone.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

I noticed the light and advised my entire family to come out and observe as I noticed it was moving South slowly and was a color light I have never seen on an aircraft before.  As we watched, it started moving faster to the South, only to be amazed that a helicopter was following the blue light.  This struck fear as we continued to watch, when suddenly, the light shot back in the direction it was going, and immediately dropped below the house line. I ran into the house and grabbed my video camera.  The light returned and in a similar, but not exactly the same pattern, flew the same path running at very wild speeds. I was able to capture the light but due to how dark it was, kept having to zoom in and out to get a clear example of the brightness of the blue. It finally dropped again and was never seen again.  The sky was dark and very clear so this was by no means a spotligh! t as most of us were thinking.  I have the video but am not sure who to share it with for fear or rejection, but 5 of the most honest people I know watched this light move back and forth with no idea what it was we were watching.", "I witnessed a bright orange glowing object in the sky on a starless night, and disappear as a plane flew near.On May 13, 2010, around 11:30P.M., I was laying in bed next to my sleeping girlfriend and staring out her window. It was dark due to overcast, so there were no stars in sight.I was tracing the outline of a pine tree in her yard against the dark sky, and noticed at first what I thought to be a star, behind a branch of this tree.  I noticed it as the wind caused it&apos;s branches to sway, revealing this object.Then this &quot;star&quot; began to slowly move out from behind this tree.  It was an orange-gold in color and spherical, much like a star would be, but it shone much, much brighter.  Also, it&apos;s movements were rather peculiar - it&apos;s rate of motion wasn&apos;t necessarily fast, but it definitely did NOT move at a constant rate.  It would move across the sky slowly, then speed up slightly, then slow again, almost like it was floating or dancing.  Also, it did not move in straight lines, it would wobble almost, and sway slightly as it moved.I watched this object move around the sky in this strange fashion for about a minute, when I realized I should wake my sleeping girlfriend to show her too.  I woke her, and then we watched for about another minute.  Then, it slipped back behind the tree, and I struggled to follow it through the branches.  A jet or a plane then came into sight as it flew across the sky, and I knew it was a jet or plane due to the strobe lights on it, and its steady rate of movement across the sky.  It also flew out of sight behind this large tree, into the same vicinity as the object.I watched this tree closely, the jet passed out on the other side of it, but the object in question never re-emerged from behind it and vanished.", "low flying bright light above home star shaped light fast horizontal movement in night skyI was driving home around 9pm with my two sons when i was about to pull into the driveway i saw a bright bright light over my house about 50ft up. I immediately began to drive away toward my parents house 15miles away.  As I was pulling away the lights were i would say about the size of two big trucks at 50ft up.  They began to dim and move higher in the sky.  A few miles away it was higher in the sky and smaller but it had moved rapidly in a zipping horizontal movement across the bridge i was heading over.  At this point it was the size of maybe a cluster of 3 or 4 bright stars.  As I drove the final 2 or 3 miles the light shrunk to the size of 1 bright star size or planet.  The light remained stationary for the next 2 or 3 hrs then disappeared beyond the horizon,  As if it was a fixed star.  The light would at times elongate itself to a vertical point.  The light was extremely bright when above my home but emmited no light on any surface or surroundings. at some poin! t while driving it caused my car radio to shut off.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

This lighted object had none.  We watched as it &quot;glided&quot; through the sky in a northern direction.

It was large, more than the width of the 50 foot wide street, but a number of lights on the bottom focused on the troops prevented me from seeing the exact shape of the craft.

It is my belief that what was seen was a helicopter.  My reasoning for this is based on the fact that many RI National Guard Blackhawk helicopters were in the air at that time because it was a disaster area and FIMA was involved as well as other state and federal agencies. The choppers were probably doing security flights as there was some looting going on in the disaster areas.  I am not a debunker.

I decided to take a break and sit outside on the picnic bench in our front yard. The moon was out and what caught my attention was the huge gap/line in the cloulds. This was not ordinary because because of it&apos;s size. It would have had to be a jet liner flying at about 1200 feet to leave mark of this size.

Any and all planes I&apos;ve ever saw have strobes or red light or both. I live in the country outside of town so planes never fly over my house at all unless they are rerouted due to a storm is the only time I&apos;ve ever seen them fly over. Anytime a plane flys over me I will hear it after it passes. Delay in sound. I have also spotted sattellites before.  They look like a star way out above the atmosphere moving slowly across the sky.  Ok what I witnessed was neither a plane nor satellite looking whatsoever.  I was in my backyard facing south towards Dallas tx when to the southwest of me maybe gainsville tx area a bright light moving towards me caught my attention.  My first thought was a that&apos;s deffinatly not a plane.I immediatly thought a satellite.  Well it was moving very fast and as it became closer I notice it was not very high in the sky and it was to bright to be a satellite.  It actually passes right over my house.Well when I first see it it&apos;s to my southwest ,passes over my house I run around the side of my house And it&apos;s now heading away from me now because it had flew over my house but was heading northeast the whole time. It&apos;s was flying lower than a commercial airline.  As it went over my house the light was very bright.  It was a clear night with the moon shining.  I don&apos;t wanna say for sure but when it was directly above me it seemed to be a circle or triangular shaped craft but the light on bottom made me unsure exactly what shape it was.  The only reason I saw a bit of a shape for a second was because of the moonlight and position Of the craft at that moment.  There was absolutly no sound whatsoever from it.  From the time I spotted it to the time it went over my house and flew totaly out of site took only a minute to a minute and a half.  It happened about 4 hrs before I wrote this. I hope someone else saw it or it can be explained.  It pretty well traveled across the whole sky in 1 min 30 sec. I&apos;ve sat and watched aiplanes fly for sometimes 5 to 10 minutes before I can&apos;t see them a! nymore and we are talking about planes in the distance with blinking lights.  I am 99% sure it was not a plane we k ow of or a satellite flying across the sky in our atmosphere.  I&apos;d say it was approximatly 10,000 to 15,000 feet from the ground. I jus hope more comes of it becuz it was only 4 hrs ago. I know that there had to be others around here that saw it I jus don&apos;t know yet. I am buying a video camera now jus because this incedent hoping to get film of an event like this if I ever see this again but I doubt it. As soon as I saw it I hollered in the house to two of my friends and they came outside and witnessed it but they were not very interested.  They just said it looked strange because they thought planes had blinking lights and not jus one big bright light facing the ground.  The way it was moving was also strange it seemed to speed up then slow down then speed up again.  It didn&apos;t move slowly across the sky like a plane nice and steady it was more jagged like it could! jus take off and be gone in the blink of an eye if it wanted  to.  VERY STRANGE.  Anyways I probly sound crazy and I&apos;m tired of talkin about it because I can&apos;t do anything about it and I have no proof other than 2 witnesses and myself. Hopefully someone else witnessed it and maybe they have it on radar.  Well that&apos;s about all I can say for now thank you", "11-12 bright lights observed over Reykjavik, Iceland. One at a time in a space of 2 hours or so.I am a student of history attending the University of Iceland.  I&rsquo;d like to note that I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like this before.  I do believe it is possible that aliens may have visited us and that UFOs might be alien spacecraft.  The things I witnessed yesterday night left a lasting impression on me and I&rsquo;m actually filing this report because I just need to get this sighting of my chest.Last night me and my girlfriend had just finished watching a movie. The time was roughly 2:45 am.  I walk out onto my deck and light cigarette. As I am smoking the cigarette I notice a light descending across the sky.  My first thought is; &ldquo;Oh cool, a shooting star&rdquo;. But the object moved far too slow for any shooting stars that I&rsquo;ve ever seen and it&rsquo;s descent was taking much longer then any shooting star I&rsquo;ve observed.  As I&rsquo;ve been looking at it for maybe 5 seconds it suddenly starts to ascend in a curve and then suddenly it makes a U-turn in the sky and bolts at high velocity in the opposite direction it was originally travelling.  By the time this happens I&rsquo;ve called my girlfriend to come look.  Then the object vanishes but reappears a short distance away from it&rsquo;s vanishing position about 2 seconds later, takes off at high speed again and then vanishes again. By this time my girlfriend is outside with me but missed seeing the object.About 30-40 minutes later I went back outside both to see if I could see some more of these things and to have a cigarette. After gazing at the sky for 2 minutes or so I noticed another light. This light moved in a straight line but seemed to be changing speeds as it did. I observed 5 lights like these in a 15-20 minute timeframe and they all moved in the same line but I never saw more then one at a time. I lost sight of the lights as they moved over my apartment building. They must have been very high up. I called my girlfriend to see these and she saw two of them and agreed with me that there was something strange about those lights. As it was really cold outside I went back inside.As I was about to go to sleep at about 4:40 am or so I went outside again to have a cigarette before bed. It was beginning to light up a bit outside but still semi-dark. I then observed about 5-6 lights appear one at a time far away on the horizon. They seemed to appear out of nowhere and then they would bolt away at high speed and vanish. One of the lights actually took a whirl in the air before bolting away. Then I went to sleep.I would like to note that the sky that night was mostly cloud free and it was very starbright. Also I would like to note that due to a volcano that is erupting about 200-300 kilometers away from here there was very little airtraffic due to the ash, although none of the ash has reached Reykjavik yet a lot of European flights to Iceland have been cancelled in the last few days. Maybe that UFO was observing the volcano and used the chance as there were no other aircraft around, but that&rsquo;s just speculations.", "Firey orange orb seen in sky over Elgin, IllinoisWe were driving home, in Elgin, Il. on Larkin Ave.  Looked up and saw this orange flaming sphere shaped object in the sky, it looked like a plane on fire.  We pulled over onto Aldine Ave, 10:10 p.m. Got out of the car and watched it fly across the sky it didn&apos;t seem to have a flight pattern, it slowed down, it&apos;s movement was kind of jiggly and then hovered.  It seemed to have an arc shaped sail or wing on it, like if you were looking up into a hot air balloon and saw the glowing shape of the balloon thru the fire.  After hovering for a bit it started moving again and increased speed upward into the sky.  We knew it moved up, it got smaller as it went and finally disappeared.  It move across the sky towards the horizon, it went up.  We did not hear any sounds or a sonic boom when it disappeared.   After that we watched a plane fly across the sky for comparison, and it was not a plane of any sort, or a helicopter or balloon.", "In the past we have seen many strange lights.  We always thought they were just flares from the air force base uptown.  But that night was different, we heard jet engines like usual, then we saw 5-7 fighter jets flying around.  They were heading in the same direction, but not in any formation, heading West I believe.  But then we saw this single white dot a little to the east of the fighters, just sitting there.  At first we thought it was a star, but then the fighters came around, and the object just dissapeared.  The fighters started circling the area were the object was, then started heading north to the air force base.", "Discolored grass after thought to be Alien encounter.To whom it may concern,On the night of June 4th , I think, for an unknown reason I looked up and said Good-Lord I&rsquo;d like to offer a Male Alien a glass of water if there are any.

We started walking through the park and decided to play around.  We got started getting rough and wrestling around.   He was holding me down when I happened to look up.  He was facing the opposite direction I was, when I saw an object in the air pretty low.  It was too low to be a plan or such. I knew it wasn&apos;t a satellite either.  After a couple seconds of looking and focusing it became clearer. It was a round saucer that looked silver at first until it started giving off a glow of white light.  I immediately tried to get my friends attention. I yelled his name, he proceeded in trying to hold me down, I yelled it again and got his attention. I told him to look where I was pointing. He had something in his eye, he took a second to clear it up while I was yelling look!  look!  He finally looked up. But couldn&apos;t see it at first for a moment. I was looking at it the whole time.  It was going a little slow at first as it was when I first seen it.  It was heading over our direction over us.  It kept the same level the whole time in the air.  My friend finally caught it and was watching to as it just started to go faster.  At that point it was only visible as it was going faster until it took a tremendous increase in speed and just warped into disappearing into the distance.

The object was first noticed toward the right hand portion of the sky, and at the time, didn&apos;t seem much higher than around a few hundred feet up (judging by the speed it was traveling, and the movements it made).  The object was round in shape, and moved across the sky towards the left, all while it&apos;s color changed from a vibrant blue, to green, purple, red, orange, and so on.  It wasn&apos;t making any sort of sound, and didn&apos;t seem to be moving like it had a distinct front/rear and left/right.The object then changed direction with seemingly no effort, and did something similar to a figure 8 (still only moving at a medium pace). Just after the erratic movement, the object then proceeded to change it&apos;s shape from being round, to a more cigar shape with what looked like a bend in the center (it almost looked like a DNA strand in shape).   At this point, the object&apos;s two &quot;halves&quot; both started to change their own colors, all while the object started to move south and in a straight line.  The shape slowly morphed back into being round (as well as it&apos;s color back to a white), as the object increased speed and continued straight.It appeared that my first guess of it was being a few hundred up was wrong, because after a minute or two of this, the object then started to flash 3 times consecutively, every few seconds, as if it were exiting the atmosphere.  The object eventually disappeared after another minute or so, and no further lights/objects were seen again.I myself am an avid lover of UFOs and their mystery, but had yet to see anything abnormal in my life until this happened.", "Two red, glowing spheres were traveling in a manner that defied the laws of gravity and left the atmosphere with unexplainable speed.My brother and I were standing on my balcony when two red, glowing spheres floated from behind the trees.

Sometimes appearing to drift and at other times they looked to be propelling themselves. It&rsquo;s important to note neither object drifted the same way as the wind or clouds.

Then directly after the plane swooped through Matt began hollering to look directly up in the sky. Over head and very high we saw a number of lights blinking on and off and dancing around.

The perceived distance and speed of the object told me that in order for it to streak across the sky like it did, it had to have been traveling at a VERY fast rate of speed.

Im reporting this event becouse i think its time. Me and my mom were witnesses of a alien in tucson az.  My mom and I were sitting outside looking at the stars in our porch, i was wishing from inside my heart to see a creature and spacecraft.  When my mom spotted and alien and pointed at it.  The creature was floting in the air above some tree&apos;s, between two star&apos;s. The alien seemed like it knew we were looking at it and started floating in small circles in the air.  I felt like the alien had mad eye contact with me from this distance.  As soon i blicked the creature disipered out of the sky.  During this encounter there seemed to be no space shuttle.

It appeared to be just west of the rest area and just above the highway.I expected to see a fireball on the south side of the roadway a second or two after I saw the object, but this did not happen.  I looked at the occupants of several eastbound vehicles knowing they had to have seen the plane pass in front of them, but nobody seemed at all bothered.I scanned the sky with my eyes in the direction of travel, thinking I would spot the aircraft, but saw nothing.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

I was gazing out the window when a white object caught my eye.  It was traveling in the opposite direction and about three times as fast.  I lost sight of it under the wing and then spotted the object again as it came back out from behind the view of the wing.  Just then it made a large, graceful, consistent right hand arc and sped away.  I watched it for e few seconds until it disappeared into the horizon.I would describe it as a perfectly round, bright white, featureless &quot;ball&quot; about the size of a large washing machine.  It zipped by under the left wing about 400 ft. down and was traveling very fast (several hundred or maybe a thousand mph?)   As it arced a turn to the right it didn&apos;t deviate in altitude or in speed whatsoever, it just changed direction.  I was struck by how fast and how smoothly it moved through the air.  It looked like it was riding through the air on invisible rails or something.... Just REALLY fast and REALLY smooth...

It was about 9:45pm.  I was driving and we were all admiring the full moon.I noticed a red light in the sky at a 5 o&rsquo;clock position from the moon.  I thought it might be a planet and asked them that.  It was about the size of the North Star when it first appears in the night sky.  My daughter said if it was a planet it would be Mars because of the color.  We were all looking at it and noticed that it was not steady in the sky and was pulsing slightly.  It was not moving in big movements but steady, like when a helicopter is trying to stay stationary.As we were watching it trying to figure out what it was its glow changed in size and its color was a vibrant red glow.  It increased over 20% of its original size and continued pulsing.  I asked my sister to get her camera out of her purse so we could get some video of it.  As she was getting it out of her purse it decreased in size and went to how it was before.I turned off the road I was on and traveled down a residential road with my hand out the driver&rsquo;s side window taking video of the object.  I had to stop when a car came up behind me.  I turned towards home and that is when my daughter said that it is gone.   When we pulled into our driveway I went to search the sky to see if there were any planes or anything, but nothing was there.  Just the full moon.I don&rsquo;t know what we saw, but I know it is nothing I have ever viewed in the night sky before.From the time I first noticed it to the time it vanished was close to 5 minutes.I will get the video from my sister as soon as she returns from vacation and send it in.", "Stationary gray cylinder slowly accelerates, turns white, then opaque, and disappears.At the above time, I stepped outside to look up at a passenger jet (red bottomed, so I assumed it was a S.W.

As the passenger jet, flew over at about a thousand feet, I looked to the left a bit to see a small gray cylinder perfectly stationary, at a higher altitude than the jet...I said to myself, &quot;What the heck is that?&quot;   The sky was very clear and blue with excellent visibility.  As I looked at the cylinder for a few seconds it started to move Northerly at increasing speed, while at the same time going from gray to white and then to opaque and then to invisible.  I had the feeling that it knew I was watching it.  I kept watching that area of the sky when I saw a dark bird-like gliding craft come from the S.W., at about the same altitude as the cylinder...it had wings, was blackish, and glided like a bird, but was not a bird.  I went inside! to get my binoculars but when I came out it was gone.  The only noise heard was from the passenger jet.  Back on January 20 and 21st of this year our area of southern Rhode Island was subjected to low flying odd jet-like craft (see my report for those dates).

I stepped out in the back patio and reached down to pick-up the water hose when I came back up I saw what at the moment I thought was a kite.  I immediately concluded that the object was not a kite because it stopped moving but continued to rotate clock-wise.  I stood and stared at the object to study its form, color, &amp; shape.  This was the (MOST Obscure Object) I have ever seen&hellip; I also noticed that this object made absolutely no noise, and the most interesting aspect about it is its shape.  The object looked like a vertebrae or back bone and has it rotated it seemed to be flexing in a cumbersome motion. The color was a faded florescent blue, and the light that it emitted was even throughout the entire shape and form of the object. The size could have been 7-10 ft long and 2-3ft in diameter. The distance was about 40-50ft above me and facing north towards the Hollywood Hills. I ! wanted to go get my camera that was sitting on my desk so I backed away from the object to my back door keeping my eyes on it so I don&rsquo;t lose track of its position. I ran to my desk grabbed my camera and ran back out to my patio. The object was no-longer in its previous position, It had climbed vertically straight up at what I estimated to be 1-2 thousand ft. I turned off the LCD display on my camera to see if I can acquire it through the view finder. I could not see the object, but I snapped 4 succession pictures in the general direction of the object. I could still observe the object with the naked eye but could not see it through the camera. I continued to watch the object for about another minute &frac12; then it passed out of view completely. I then placed a call to the (LAPD) to file a report. The Officer who handled the call listened intently and asked me 1 or 2 questions, and then offered to send out a chopper that was in the area to see if they could intercept the object.! I said go ahead but that I could not see the object anymore s! o it wou ld be impossible for me to give any position of where it might be at that moment. The Officer thanked me for calling and said that it was an interesting conversation and that if the object returns to call again immediately. I then called (MUFON) but got no answer.  After that night I had tried to make sense of what I had seen that night and the only explanation I can come up with is that it could (NOT) have been anything explained in conventional terms and it seemed to be under intelligent control because it stopped in mid-air almost at the exact moment I took notice of the object. It was like the object was watching me has I was watching the object.  And when I returned outside this thing had traveled straight up vertically 1-2 thousand ft, from the point and position from where I left it to grab my camera. This was truly the most strangest sighting I have ever experienced&hellip; I have had an Abduction experience when I was 6 years old, and throughout my life I have had UFO sighti! ng of all different types, but nothing like the 1 I had this night. I did a little research into this object and there was some video on YouTube pertaining to a sighting that Story Musgrave the Astronaut had videotaped from the Space Shuttle. Here the YouTube video Link that will give some idea to what I witnessed: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jotdaXX1w2A The object I saw moved in the exact same way has the video clip of the Story Musgrave Sightings. Its form or shape hard to determine whether it&rsquo;s the same Object. But its movement is identical to my sighting. This sends chills up my spine when I think about it.

The other end appeared to have 3 panels attached to the bottom of it.  The center panel had 2 white lights illuminated; the outer 2 panels had 3 green lights illuminated.

The aircraft was approximately 20-30 minutes south of Sacramento. i was sitting in the window seat on the left side (facing forward) of the aircraft looking out the window trying to pass the time. i often have my nose glued to the window looking out during flights so it&apos;s not unusual  or random that i was gazing out the window at that particular moment. i observed the first sphere traveling above the ground heading south westish (based on the assumption that we were indeed traveling North). it was very difficult to determine speed and size of each sphere because I was tra! veling in the airplane. the airplane i was in was traveling about 10-12K feet, or however high those airplanes fly during travel(horizon airlines). we were at cruising altitude, that is, we never appeared to go any higher than that for hours at a time, and only descended for landing.The first sphere was like a ball of light, likely emitting light rather than reflecting (although if this ball was chrome or mirrored as was the second, it COULD also have been simply reflecting sunlight). since it never lost its brilliance, i assume it was emitting light rather than reflecting. i got the brief impression that it was lite-green in color.  this sphere was farthur from my eyes and closer towards the earths surface so i could observe it for about 6 seconds before it flew out of line of sight from my little window. i was taken by slight surprise by this because it was the first one and moderately gained my attention. it seemed to be traveling quickly, faster than the cars traveling nearby. i would approximate the size of this one to be slightly larger than a minivan. if one were to crush a short school bus into a sphere that would be about the size, approximately. again very hard to determine considering that i was in a moving airplane at about 10K feet.Continuing to stare out the window, i was eager to see it again. between this sighting and the next i could see a small small recreation/agriculture airplane and make out the fusalage from the wings. so i&apos;m very confident that this first object (along with the subsequent 2) was a perfect sphere, not birds or planes. and i&apos;m very confident that the first object was in motion. so after a brief minute or two another one flew by, this time it was headed directly in the direction we had come from. this second sphere was what really got me intruiged, this one appeared to be less than 300 ft away from the aircraft. Way close! it traveled at the same altitude, didn&apos;t go up or down, it was traveling in a straight line directly south.  this sphere was definately chrome in color, about the size of a minivan. it was very hard to determine if it was just floating there or traveling rather slowly. if it was floating in place and the airplane passed over it (not directly because i could st! ill see it from the windows on the side of the plane) it would appear to the observer to be moving. so it&apos;s difficult for me to determine if it was moving in a straight line south or whether it was simply floating. i asked several people in front and behind my seat (same seating oreintation) if they &quot;saw that?&quot;. i was frustrated that they hadn&apos;t and I had caused a minor disturbance on the plane because i was frustrated that nobody was looking out the window because they would have also seen it. i was mad that they missed this event because they had their face in a book. i was essentially trying to find another witness but nobody else claimed they saw it. accepting that this was likely to be a personal experience i let it go and continued to press my nose against the window. several minutes later i spotted the final and most distant sphere. this was bright in color, no hints of green, only white, bright white. this one was traveling West, of the three seperate objects, this one appeared to be closest to the ground. upon landing, i found a pilot sitting in the small Sacramento Airport that we were awaiting our flight transfer at. i asked him if he knew what a chrome colored sphere shaped object would be doing in the air? he immediately suggested a balloon and i was disappointed at the thought that a balloon makes sense. weather balloon or party balloon. so i then asked him how many balloons he has seen in the air during his career (excluding hot air balloon), he responded with zero balloons. i described our flight path and he said, &quot;aah, yes i just flew on that flight&quot;. unspecific to whether he was pilot or co-pilot, i will never forget his face, broad jaw like Elvis, i could spot him anywhere. he also admitted to having not seen the objects (or at least the up close chrome ball) for himself. i was the sole witness. 3 spheres, one at a time, first one was lite-greenish headed opposite direction of plane, the second was way close and i got a very good look at it for the breif 2 seconds it was in sight. my eyes were able to lock on and focus on it before it dissappeared out of my line of sight, it was traveling in roughly the same direction as the first. and the third was faint, bright white and headed westward towards Pacific ocean. i have seen footage of an identical chrome sphere in a ufo clip filmed in Ventura California. i had always been intruiged by ufo&apos;s but after this sighting of mine i became very interested for approx 7 months before i was satisfied and no longer interested in persueing clips online or reading such books.i was 20 yrs old. I have a difficult time believing that it (second Chrome sphere) was a balloon, a little girl would have to run into a random farm field and release it. im not sure if balloons remain inflated at that altitude. NOAA uses whether balloons that look very very similar to it, but i doubt that NOAA would release such a balloon in a flight path especially considering that they are aware of wind direction and speed, if this was a whether balloon, it definately posed a danger to the propellers. too close for comfort.", "2 different UFO&apos;s visible at the same time.When driving down a country road toward my house at about 8 pm, I looked across an empty field  to see a large stationary orange light high in the sky.  I slowed down quite a bit to observe the light across the field.  As I watched it, it quickly flashed yellow, white, red, a pinkish tint of red, then back to orange.  I thought this was very odd so I hurried home and turned down the unpaved road which I live on.  When I turned down the road, the light was still high in the sky but a little lower then before (the color of the light was still orange). I decided to flash my high beams at it.  I flashed my lights three times. I then noticed the object flashed at me once or twice but still remained the same color orange.  This really startled me.  I got home and the light was behind my house and extremely low in the sky (about the height a helicopter would be at to view a police pursuit). I told my dad about it and he came out to see it.  We were looking at it through th! e trees and he also thought it was strange.  So he went back inside to put his shoes on.  As he went in, the light flashed yellow for about 3 seconds, then back to a really bright orange.  He came back outside and we observed it for about 20 minutes.  Then it slowly turned red and then the light went off for about 5 seconds.  Then at that time it was noticed the craft was a metallic looking sphere.  Then the red light returned on the craft.  It still remained stationary, then as we looked right over our heads a different white light (which looked like a normal airplane from a distance) passed slowly over our heads making no noise what so ever.  It only had one white light on the bottom of the craft  (There was no red or green lights on the craft like you would see on a normal airplane)  Compared to the craft with the red light, it moved perpendicular across the sky. As the white light craft flew off from west to east.  We focused our attention back to the red light craft. Now the red ! light craft was moving in our direction. Then it stopped once again.  It then flew in random patterns very slowly.  Then it seemed to stop moving.

As we approached the object, this time in a different darker colored car, the object immediately took off away from us and again appeared over the vicinity of my daughter&rsquo;s house.  When we got down the road, it was gone.  It had gone from point A to point B in the flash of an eye and we think it knew that since it was a bright, moonlight night, that we just might be able to see the craft, thus its speedy demise this time.

While co-piloting a 1959 B-95 Beechcraft &quot;Travel Air&quot; between Mesa falcon field (KFFZ) and St. George Utah (KSGU) I witnessed along with two others a spherical craft within approximately one statute mile of our position.  While making a course correction turn over the &quot;drake&quot; VOR at 150 knots 8500ft climbing to 10,500 approx heading 330 degrees(Prescott, AZ, according to GPS right after the event our exact posistion was 17 miles due east from the Prescott airport.)  I was visually scanning the sky for other air traffic prior and during a left turn. Looking upward (off the starboard wing as it banked upward) the object in question came into veiw. It was a silver lenticular disk, I was the first witness to spot the object.  The passenger seated directly behind me was the second.  I asked the passenger to look up while still in the turn and to simply tell me what they saw.  The witness stated &quot;Oh my god... It&apos;s a flying saucer!&quot; (or somthing to that ! effect) By this time I had turned passed my intended heading.  I made a corrective turn passed the course in the opposite direction so I could see it again in another left hand turn.  We reaquired the target and attempted to photograph the object with a cell phone camera, without success.  It is difficult to judge it&apos;s exact size, however if it was anything close to a convetional aircraft in size it was within 1 to 2 miles almost directly above our aircraft.  As we continued our zig zag turns (in order to maintain a visual contact) on or about or third turn cycle the object began to climb in a spiralling arc through a broken cloud layer that was at about 12,500 plus feet at a very high rate (I estimated 500 to 700 knots possibly supersonic, I based this on my experience as a pilot and witnessing many supersonic fighter aircraft)  No condensation trail, and no visable exhaust trail and was out of visual range in under 8 seconds or so.

At about 20:30 on January 4, 2000, (est.), my son was in the vicinity of Jomax Rd. and 62nd St. looking toward the south at the lights of Phoenix in the distance.  The day had been overcast with some rain, which had stopped in the evening.  A light at the extreme right side of his field of view caused him to look in that direction, west.  He witnessed a vivid green circular object descending at about a 30 degree angle, the object was the size of a dime at arms length.  At a height of about 200 feet above the ground the object stopped and a second identical object then appeared as if out of the first and proceeded on the same path and speed until it was about 12 diameters from the first, then it too stopped.  A third identical object immediately appeared, traveled the same distance, stopped, and a fourth identical object repeated the process until it reached the 12 diameter distance.  The moment t! he fourth object stopped the entire string of four objects then pivoted on the central axis of their array with the last object appearing closest to my son with the original object the most distant.  The array swung in such a fashion that it became parallel to the ground, forming an east-west line. At this point my son was able to see that there were still four objects even though they overlapped each other from his vantage point.  Within a second or two all the objects simply vanished, followed a few seconds later by two loud &quot;sonic booms&quot;.  At this point my son, then 16, made a hasty retreat to our home.He described the objects as having even illumination across the entire surface with distinct edges. He described the green as similar to the green in a traffic signal.  The movement of the objects was very smooth as each emerged from the previous one.  His estimate was that the objects were about 1/4 mile from his location.  A set of electrical transmission towers runs on a southeast to northwest line, about 1/2 mile west of this location.  When I questioned him about the possibility of some sort of ball lightning or electrical plasma, he dismissed this possibility stating that the objects were never in the vicinity of the transmission lines.  He stated that the objects somewhat reminded him of the warning balls attached to power lines in the vicinity of airports.  Since the objects retained their circular shape as they pivoted, he made the assumption that they were spheres.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

He described them as red and blue lights moving back and forth like a kite (they saw it from 10-10:13pm prior to calling me @ 10:13). At approximately 10:13pm on May 19, 2010 I looked out the back window of my house and saw four red lights lined up horizontally, they were stationary at this point.  They had an LED look to them, very bright and focused points of light, not beams.  I immediately told the two friends I had at my house with me to come outside and see it.  When we came out it was gone, but there were many helicopters in the air circling (at least three).  Then the four red lights came back into view as they quickly moved straight upwards from behind the buildings directly to my West until they were approximately 20 degrees above the horizon, at this moment the object transformed instantly from four red lights into one slightly larger blue light and headed in the exact oppos! ite direction straight down.  The change in color, direction and number of objects seen happened simultaneously and it appeared to move sharply with no acceleration or deceleration and did not seems to make any noise.  The four red lights from end to end were approximately two to three times as wide as the moon was from my vantage point and the blue light was about a third as wide as the moon.  I was located at Nutmeg Avenue and Lexington Street in Sarasota, FL facing between W and WNW.  My friends who called me were standing at Superior Avenue and Gulf Gate Drive in Sarasota facing directly North, it was about 15 degrees above the horizon from their point of view.  The helicopters that were in the sky circled this area for about twenty to thirty minutes after we last saw the lights.  Afterwards, I called every news station in town and they all confirmed that they either did not own a helicopter or it was grounded at the time.  I also contacted the County Sheriff&rsquo;s Departme! nt and they confirmed that they did not have their helicopter ! in the a ir.  I called everyone again the next day (5/20/10) and asked if they would confirm that they had no helicopters in the air at that time.  They all confirmed.  Next I called Air Traffic Control at the Sarasota International Airport, they said that they knew of nothing, but gave me the FAA Flight Standards contact information.  After asking about the helicopters, I explained my story to them.  About an hour later I received a call back from the FAA, the gentleman I spoke with was very friendly and helpful but could not give me any answers.  He suggested I contact NUFORC at that point.  That leaves me with two lingering questions: 1) What did we see? 2) Whose helicopters were in the air, why were they there and what do they know about the events we witnessed?", "Saw ship outside bedroom window, had mole on solarplexis, pulled out 2 yrs later, long string, flushed in toilet  I woke up at 04:00 with my dog keisha barking.  And the odd feeling that something was touching me. I immediately ran to the window to see what could be making such a bright white light.  It was shaped like an airplane, except it had no wings.  It was hovering just a few feet away.  I was so excited I just stared at it.  The light blinked, as though something walked in front of the light.  It seemed like two shadows.  Then the light flashed brighter and I was blinded and all I could see was this light and nothing else.  My dog was growling and whining at the window.  The only time she acts like that is when there was a deer in our back yard.  Then I saw the ship raise a little bit, point the nose to the sky, and disappeared in the blink of an eye.  I went to bed, when I woke up I had a strange mark on my arm, and a weird mole sticking out of my stomach.  It felt weird, so I was uncomfortable and started pulling at it.  I worked on it for a couple of years and I was constantly pulling at it.  Then finally I gave it a good pull and a long string noodle thing came out of my arm, like a vein and it was a foot long.  I thought I&apos;d pulled my vein out but it wouldn&apos;t come all the way out.  I thought it was connected to me because I felt pulling on my stomach, on the inside.

I looked around and saw the orange real moon rising over my neighbor house in the east.  I stared at the object the size of the full moon above me for several minutes while it hovered above me.  It started a rapid ascent in the sky looking like a small moon then a brilliant bright star and then dim star until it disappeared from view.  Later analysis suggest that the object was at twenty thousand feet and was about ten acres in size.  I call the object the &quot;Moon of Memphis&quot; since I witness this object over the community of Frayser in Memphis, Tennessee.  The backyard that I witness this event was ((deleted)) St. I was a ((deleted--aviator)) in the USAF and an intellegence officer in the ((deleted--military)).  This object had religious implication since it appeared in 1964 because A through Z connected with 1 through 26 is a code! which decodes the word Israel to sixty four.

When we first got in I asked her if she thought a very bright light over the horizon on the West side of the lake (we were staying on the north end of the lake directly across the water from the state park) was a planet or a plane... after watching it for about 10 minutes I realized it wasn&apos;t moving.  It was much bigger and brighter then a start.  About an hour later I realized the light had dropped to right above the horizon.  I asked my friend to quickly look.  She suggested it had dropped because the earth was moving.  I had to correct her and tell her that it dropped too fast for it to be the earth rotating. Then 30 seconds later the light dropped completely behind the horizon and was gone.  It was like watching a really fast sunset.  I never saw the initial drop from the original position, I just noticed that it had moved and then quickly after that w! as gone.

I was a passenger on the left side of the cabin, with a view to the north out my window.  Lights in the cabin were dimmed aside from a few reading lights and television screens for the inflight entertainment. It was probably sometime between 11:20 and 11:50 pm.  The weather was mostly clear, with the stars and moon easily visible and a very small amount of light left from sunset at the northwestern horizon.  Our flight was beginning to make its initial descent to the Albany airport, but still very high- as the cruising altitude of the flight was announced to be 39,000 feet.   As a former resident of Upstate NY, I could determine when we flew over Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse.  When we began approaching what I believe to be Utica, and possibly Rome to the North, I noticed a bright point of warm white light which at a quick glance would apprear to be a bright star or planet (no blinking ! to indicate it was a commercial aircraft,) to the north.  It was moving significantly faster than our aircraft to the ENE direction.   As it was to my eyes, simply a small, steady light, there was no way to determine how large or far away it was from our jet.  It is entirely possible that it was a high-altitude aircraft, or satellite, but it seemed to be moving much more quickly than satellites I&apos;ve observed from a stationary position on the ground. I was only able to observe it for a minute or so, as it flew somewhat parrallel and higher than aircraft, then quickly away.  There was no change of speed during the sighting.  The light appeared to be flying in a straight line, although I may have seen it swerve slightly a couple of times- possibly due to air movement between myself and the object, or the movement of our aircraft.  No other passengers that I was near seemed to notice anything, and as I was traveling alone, I did not alert anyone around me to what I saw.I consider myself a skeptic, and I am making this report simply because it was something that I could not easily identify.  It did not look the same as other commercial or military aircraft I&apos;ve seen from an airplane, and it was thousands of feet higher than necessary for a plane to use landing lights.", "Unidentified object in picture.I took a picture with my cell phone of what I thought were some unusual clouds. when I checked the picture I noticed the dark object.

Out of the corner of my eye i noticed something moving across the sky and assumed it was a shooting star.  Once I looked at it directly i realized it was an extremely bright blue circle, and much much bigger than a shooting star would have been.  It was so bright that I would almost consider it neon blue.  It didn&apos;t flash or blink any other lights, just the same solid electric blue color.  It moved straight across the sky at a steady pace moving faster than an airplane at the same altitude would&apos;ve been.  It&apos;s hard describe the size since it was up so high, but from that distance it was about the size of a soccer ball. Up close it would obviously be much bigger.  Right when i saw it I knew it was something unusual and started shouting for the other two to look.  By the time they turned around it was gone because the opening in the trees that i saw it through isn&apos;t very big.  It was behind the trees and gone by the time they looked.", "I saw a red and white flashing object that moved in any way other than a straight line, and I think it noticed me.Before I tell you what I saw, or what, at least, that I can remember of what I saw on May 27th, 2010, a short while after 10:00 p.m, latest being 10:20 p.m., I want to let you know that until recently I was a total skeptic.  Before all this chit-chat about ancient aliens and ufos started on t.v. and what not, I thought, &quot;Okay, well, I agree that it&apos;s a possibility that there are other life forms out there, but I disagree that they have visited us.&quot;  Then came all the ufo hunters and t.v. series that have sparked an intriguement inside me.So, now let me describe my sighting to you.Okay, I&apos;m walking my boyfriend to the top of my street from where he will skateboard home, we say our goodbyes and depart.  About this time everything is seemingly normal.  As I&apos;m walking, being a nature lover that I am, I&apos;m looking towards the sky.  And I thought, &quot;Wouldn&apos;t it be crazy if I saw a ufo tonight? Walking home and I see one, yea right hahah&quot; sort of joking about in my head. Well, a few minutes later I notice something that first I thought was a star.  However, it had a white and red flashing light system.  The object would glow a dim red, and then a bright white, and then back to the dim red and then back to the bright white, like a strobe light, then I thought that&apos;s strange, so I stopped walking.  And that&apos;s when I noticed that this object was moving in abrupt directions, such as zig zagging, but this object was very far away so I could only see it move just a little bit everytime it did so.It was only a little light in the sky flashing a dim red and then a brighter white and moving in every other way I can think of asides a straight line.  Okay, here&apos;s where things get even a little more funky, so I&apos;ve stopped and I&apos;m looking at this light in the sky and I think &quot;Oh well, there must be some logical explanation for it.&quot;  So I keep walking, not a block away from my apartment, I turn my head to face in front of me and I noticed that far away up in the sky, is ANOTHER one of these flashing lights, still red and white, so I look back at the spot that my eyes had just previously left and sure enough the same one is still there.  I felt a bit frightened at this point and hurried into my home through the back door because I felt that it hid the view from those points of mysterious light, from what might&apos;ve been aliens.  Now there is one critical detail that I have left out, and that is that while I was walking, the light that I was watching, moved from in front of me ! to behind me.  It was originally ahead of me and off to my right, then it moved to behind me and off to my right, had I turned around and faced it, it would have been on my left.  I cannot explain it any better than that.In one or two sentences, I was walking home the other night and noticed two objects that were distant from each other in the sky yet had the same flight patterns and dual red/whtie light systems that were definitively not airplanes and not helicopters.  There was no sound, it was as simple as this, when I laid my eyes on it I knew it was something I had never seen before, and it frightened me.  I&apos;ve seen video recordings of such orbs of changing light and the best way I can tell you what it was, is a red and white ufo like all the other ufos glowing a bright white light and some other color.  I&apos;m saying that it is a possible UFO abduction case because soon after I went to bed, they might&apos;ve beamed me up late at night.  Also my boyfriend had a dream about me being abducted by aliens.  And when I think back to that night, things always get a little blurry, and everything that I said to you I remember with specific detail.  When it comes down to it, I think I might propose that! aliens are trying to make me forget, but I&apos;m holding onto it, almost like when you try to remember what you dreamed last night, and you can remember those bits and pieces of imagery but not the whole scenario.", "I was 11 Years old.me my best guy friend and our siblings were playing hide and go seek tag in the dark.

They were in a perfect formation of approximately a 25-30% angle triangle with the center point above the other 2 outer low points. The points of light were way to far apart to be any plane or aircraft I have EVER seen!  I didn&apos;t see any distinct blinking lights like those from an airplane or any other common aircraft.  The individual lights would somewhat pulsate in intensity but not a true blink. One light would get brighter though the light didn&apos;t radiate outward to appear any larger, just brighter, as another would dim in unison. They seemed to &quot;take turns&quot; dimming/brightening.  I don&apos;t recall seeing any odd colors just white/yellowy lights.As I turned onto the freeway ramp I lost sight of it for a moment then regained sight of it to my right as I was heading north.  At this point it seemed as if the formation had slightly shifted but gone up a bit higher in altitude, though still too low to the ground for this to be a military type plane formation maneuver.  Now the northernmost light was slightly lower than the southern pointing light and it appeared closer to the center light, like how the perspective would warp if you had a solid triangular object and pivoted it slightly clockwise.At this point a fourth light appeared just barely above the tree line and even further back in the south direction than the back corner of the triangle and much lower.  This light seemed brighter and larger than the other three and seemed almost to be a tail???   Upon a quick glance at this point it would almost appear as if the little dipper had lost part of it&apos;s tail, it&apos;s bottom star, gotten very close to the earth and hovered there above Oregon City.Unfortunately I was not in a position to stop and shoot footage as I was running late for work.  I called home quick to see if my husband could see it but he could not even though we are on a slight hill.  The object was just hovering too low for it to be seen from many locations.  I say object, yet strange thing is I didn&apos;t see any solid object holding these lights in this formation.  It was BY FAR the oddest thing I have EVER seen! I have looked all over the internet, called news channels and even the local dispatch and NO ONE else seems to have reported this.  This is why I&apos;m posting this here. I am not crazy or anything but some verification that ANYONE else saw this would ease my mind! Thank you for reading.", "Orange lights seen over the Houston area traveling east to west in pairs.I was traveling east on McGregor St going from the Houston Medical Center to highway 288. At about 11:05pm I saw lights over a line of trees to my left from inside of my car. I kept driving down the road until the trees to my left ended and I came to an intersection where the traffic light was red. I stopped at the intersection and rolled down my driver side window and I could see the lights traveling horizontally from west to east across the horizon. There were about 20 - 30 lights in the sky traveling in pairs one on top of the other. As they moved across the sky, the pairs would switch spots within the formation (the one on the bottom would move to the top).  When the light turned green, I pulled into a parking lot of a restaurant, which was closed for the night, and continued to watch them move across the sky. I was in the parking lot for about 3 minutes and I decided to keep traveling east on McGregor. As I pulled out of the parking lot, I kept followin! g the lights with my eyes. I came to another intersection and took a left to turn around (to go west on McGregor). While I was waiting for the light to turn green I noticed 7 lights identical to the ones that were traveling across the horizon and saw that they were stationary and in a tight formation. The formation was 3 lines. One line was at a 90 degree angle, and the other 2 at a 45 degree angle, with one on the right and left and they all met in the middle with the other light in the formation.At this point, I called my wife and told her about what I saw. She told me to go pick her up from home because she wanted to see the lights. I picked her up, but once we got there the lights were gone. Traveling home and back took about 20 minutes.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We hadn&rsquo;t been paying attention until it started moving.  It was in the north north-eastern sky and was slowly moving towards the south east.  As it moved it got somewhat faster, but also significantly brighter.  It got bright enough that it rivaled some of the other stars, but I wouldn&rsquo;t say it :lit up the sky,&quot; or anything that significantly.  As it continued to travel, it started getting dimmer and dimmer until it couldn&rsquo;t be seen.  I wouldn&rsquo;t say it traveled very fast, and it never got far enough to be parallel with us/over us (though its path wouldn&rsquo;t have allowed it go over us).

I soon noticed however that these spheres I was seeing were too big to be balloons and were travelling quite quickly across the sky even though there was barely any wind.The spheres were perfectly sperical but bobbed up and down a little as they crossed over the river which made it hard for me to distinguish whether there were four or five of them.  They also appeared to be metallic and reflected lots of light.  It took them perhaps 10 seconds to cover a quarter of a mile.

At first one was behind the other, and then they moved to side by side.I initially thought it was one of those spotlight things like at a car dealership, but this is in the country, and there are no clouds.  It wasn&apos;t moving particularly fast, and I perceived them to be rather low.

There was hardly any traffic on the road because of the hour.  This neon blue light moved downward toward as if coming down a staircase.  The object stopped in front of a business park just to the left of us, approximately 25 yards away, and changed from a blue light orb to three neon blue squares linked together in a vertical rectangle tilted forward from the top.  The neon blue light pulsed at a very high rate and radiated from the the blue squares but the object itself made no sound.  The object itself appeared to be slightly smaller than the light on the light post next to it, approximately 10&quot; in length.  It hovered from side to side and up and down, turning sideways and back again; remaining in an a! rea of about 2-3 cubit feet.   As it turned sideways to reveal it&apos;s profile there didn&apos;t appear to be anything behind the blue light bar that we could see.   At first we thought it must be a toy.  There was not a single person around the object or in the parking lot of the business park.  Our driver said it could not be a toy because no transmitter could reach that far, given the fact that it descended from a visual point out of the night sky high above us.  A car coming from behind us also stopped to watch this intriging object as well as a man in a truck coming from the other direction.  The object then returned to the blue light orb and began traveling NE just above the roof tops.  It seemed to be traveling very slow at first so I told my friend driving to follow it.  Before we could get the car turned around the object acceleratled in a straight line NE and disappeared.I believe whatever it was came with an objective and that it traveled so low to the roof tops so that it could travel without much detection.  I also believe that it&apos;s destination were somewhere reasonably close or else it would have made it&apos;s descention elsewhere.  Northeast from where we were located is a military reserve base, Northeast Mesa and Fort McDowell Mtns.  I live right next to the military reserve base where there is a jet and pilot ready 24/7 for take off in case of an intrusion.  In the three months that I&apos;ve lived here I&apos;ve heard the jet take off just after midnight twice within the last week.Thank you for allowing me to share our experience.", "Light blue object, suddely turns brilliant white, leaves trail and wakeOn 06/17/2010 at 2133 hours I was on my back porch, looking at the sky before going to bed.  There were no clouds, but there was some haze near the ground.  I noticed a light blue object approaching from the South which I at first took to be a satellite.  As I watched, I noticed it was moving much faster than any satellite I have ever seen.  The object continued going North, passing overhead slightly to the East of my location.  Suddenly the object went from medium intensity light blue to brilliant white, and its size seemed to increase substantially.  It was not a gradual transition as with an iridium satellite, but instantaneous, as it something had switched on.  About a second after it turned white, it began making a conical shaped wake which spread out from the object and dissipated.  The object itself began leaving a thin, white trail behind it as well. After several seconds, the brilliant white light, wake and trail went off, and the object returned to its lig! ht blue form.  After a few more seconds, it briefly switched to brilliant white again, but this time no wake or trail were visible.  The object returned to light blue and remained that way until I lost sight of it as it went behind the roof line of my house to the North.  The object was on a straight flight path the entire time, going from South to North.  It seemed to wobble a bit after it started making the wake and trail.  At the time of this sighting, there were satellites and various types of aircraft visible in the sky.  I did not hear any noise that seemed to be related to the object. I did hear jet aircraft but I am sure the source was from airliners passing overhead.  I watched the sky during the same time period for the next two days to see if it could have been some type of satellite, but I did not see anything similar.", "Standing on the corner of Kolnar and Belmont looking east.  A Pitch black sphere slowly hovered, moving in a south-eastern direction.  There was a distortion effect around it.  Like a haze or something blocking the human eye from seeing more of it.  I didn&apos;t have a camera on me but it looked like the footage i have seen of the phoenix lights during the day when they appear to be black spheres...this sighting was in full daylight.  I tracked it while on the phone with my brother until it was out of sight.  The Sphere was close enough to me that I could easily see that it was NOT any sort of aircraft at ALL. NO sound, NO lights, NO markings.  Just a black floating sphere.  There was no way to truly know its size but my educated guess would be between the size of a minivan and possibly even larger.  Maybe the size of a house.", "stead single white dot heading southeast then rose straight up and vanishedOutside I was walking my guests to their truck while on the stairs we saw a little round white light heading southeast at a steady pace.

It was a clear night sky so we decided to pull out a couple of chairs in the back lawn and chat while the dog did what dogs do outside.  Within five minutes of looking at the night sky I noticed what appeared to be a satellite or a plane at a very high altitude moving steadily across the sky.  The object appeared almost indistinguishable from a star except for the fact that it was moving.  I turned to my girlfriend to ask her which one she thought it was and when we both stared back at the moving light it was sitting in the night sky stationary.  I was immediately a little spooked because I was unaware of any plane, satellite, or other flying object that was capable of moving and then coming to a complete stop.  My girlfriend thought I was just seeing things but I convinced her to keep an eye on for a few minutes.  It is important to note that the light that was moving! was now sitting still at about an arms length distance, from my vantage point, of a small bright star.  We watched the object for what seemed to be five to seven minutes, and just when I convinced myself that I was just seeing things the object clearly moved another arms length distance north of its current position.  My girlfriend confirmed this movement and as we were talking about what it could be the object quickly moved east of its position.  The object started at a six o&rsquo;clock position, in relation to the small star near it, and when it became stationary again it was hovering at about a ten o&rsquo;clock position from the star.  We were so intrigued by what this could be that we watched the object for a total of two hours.  Within this two hour time period, the object made several more movements, displayed a red tint at times, and changed the level of brightness it was emitting several times.", "many red little blue on bottom light 4x star saw move at a speed slower than a shooting star faster than a satalite no trail moved from the north to south then shot up and disiperad like it was using the full moon as cover whatever it was it was highly advanticed((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Frozen in fear, I looked up at the sky, seconds after the illumination began, and witnessed only what appeared to be a white burning horizontal column moving across the sky, appearing to be very high in altitude, and casting off white embers.  There was no sound, nor detectable smells, and the white column appeared to &quot;burn out,&quot; in any event going away with the illumination receding.

I&apos;ve had this event in my memory for many years, and I am wondering if any one can substantiate or add detail to what I&apos;m calling an event.I believe it happened between about &apos;68 and the early 70&apos;s.  My father worked as the attendant at one of the few all night gas stations along the old Rt 66 as it passed through Joplin, MO -- locally known as East 7th Street.  The station sat near the crest of a very long up-slope and so at night one could see back across the city quite well.  He was the introverted, serious type person.  Many of the local cops patrolling the city made this station a regular night-shift break stop and they shared all the &quot;cop gossip&quot; with him.  He stated to me the following when I visited on a weekend.One night he saw an illuminated metallic craft moving slowly just above rooftop level across the city.  The motion was steady and it exhibited a controlled motion.  It apparently did not come directly over the gas station.  This activity continued long enough for several police cars to engage in trailing the craft around the city, as he saw the roof lights on their cars in the distance and heard sirens.  He said that the craft eventually gained altitude and simply faded into the night sky -- there was no sudden vanishing, it just flew off very calmly.Later that same night, many of the cops converged at the gas station and began relating to each other what they had witnessed.  My father, of course, heard much of the chatter between officers and on the radios.  All agreed that they had seen a very large metal craft that simply glowed with no apparent source of light.  Some reported what appeared to be windows and various details about the skin, much as you might attempt to describe the surface of any vehicle after having been up close.After a few nights, the various cops on duty the night of the sighting resumed their regular break stops at the gas station.  All told my father a similar thing: They had all been instructed to forget that they had seen any thing and to speak no more of it.Dad said that the Joplin Globe Newspaper ran an article on the UFO as soon as they gathered the early police reports, but then the story was never given any additional press by the newspaper.I repeat that this was told to me by my father years ago.  I buried this for so long that I lost track of when it happened.

I have noticed that much of Idaho&rsquo;s UFO history from before 1970 is totally missing now unless you happen to own a copy of Frank Edwards&rsquo; book, &quot;Stranger than Science.&quot;   I cannot find my issue, if I even still have it, but I know one of the entries from personal experience.During the summer of 1957 my Dad and my Uncle Paul worked together in a post and pole business located one mile west of Donnelly.  In mid-August of that summer they had an order to fill one hundred miles south near Nampa.  The flatbed truck was loaded and they left early one august morning.  When they returned late that night both were filled with an incredible story.When returning from the Nampa-Boise area they took the only route available which was Idaho State Route 15.  Years later the road would be widened and made a bit straighter and renamed SR 55. Uncle Paul was driving and my Dad was the passenger. Traveling north the trip was uneventful until the moment they turned onto Rainbow Bridge just north of Smiths&rsquo; Ferry. By the time they reached this area it was twilight or past 9pm. Also, there was no other traffic on the highway at the time. This area is also known as the Cougar Mountain area. At least once a decade, when traveling through the same area, I would ask my Dad to tell the story and point to what he saw. Most recently was in 2003, not too long before he passed away. The story never changed.In mid-August, 1957 at about 9-9:30pm, northbound Hiway 15 (55) passes Cougar Mountain Lodge and the road continues following the Payette River.  Both the road and the river become narrower with some zigzagging prior to reaching Rainbow Bridge.  The road makes a sharp right onto the bridge.  At that point my Dad yelled &ldquo;STOP!&rdquo; and the old flatbed truck was nearly in the middle of the bridge before coming to a complete stop.  What my Dad had seen was something large and glowing coming right up the river at about the same level above the water as the bridge. As they came to a stop the large object rose slightly to avoid the bridge and missed the cab of the truck by mere feet. Once over the bridge it dipped about 30 feet down to the river then pulled up in a high arc reaching about 500 feet higher than they were, then dove straight down onto the top of a hill. They watched a bit of an explosion, but did not notice any burning of the dense forest. The land had not been logged and th! erefore no roads existed leading to the crash site at that time.My Dad described the object as circular and shiny on top with a nearly flat bottom. The entire disk glowed with a bright purplish color and was traveling up the river and through its arc at about 60 mph. It was half the width of the bridge making it about 100 feet in diameter.  My Dad would seem to be a good person for observation. He was retired from the Air Force with the rank of Master Gunnery Sgt. He had been in the Flying Tigers and when evacuated from China he was sent to school for the Norden Bomb site and spent the rest of the war in the Flying Fortress. He told stories of &ldquo;Foo Fighters&rdquo; and the first momentary glimpse of this disk coming up the river immediately triggered his old reaction to those earlier foo fighters. Unable to do anything about the crash, the two men continued north for a half hour reaching Cascade, the county seat for Valley County. There they stopped at the police station and filed a report.During the evening of the next day an Air Force Officer dropped by the house and explained to my Dad and Uncle that what they saw was no more than a missile that had been accidentally launched from a jet out of Mountain Home Air Force Base, southwest of Boise. The officer added that &ldquo;You have no reason to be concerned and should just forget about the incident.&rdquo; I remember looking at the smiling officer and then at my Dad just staring at him for a moment. My reaction was to try to melt in to the background and be out of site for a while. Very calmly my Dad explained to the young smiling officer that he was retired Air Force, added a few details, and knew a missile when he saw one.  He then invited the officer to change his story or leave. That was the last we heard from the Air Force about that incident.The crash at Smiths&rsquo; Ferry was at 44&ordm; 20&rsquo; 11.57 N and 116&ordm; 03&rsquo; 27.54 W and by the following day, the Air Force had the entire area stripped clean.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I noticed a plane flying behind it but at a much lower altitude and way slower. It was a solid light not blinking like a plane and it was moving sporadically side to side up and down not drastically but similar to what a plane would look like in turbulent sky&apos;s.

Shortly after that we caught glimpse of another formation exactly like the first sighting flying south to north overhead, silently approximately 80 degrees off the horizon.

I think it was going up because we saw it for so long.All three of us got a little excited and I told my friend that he should report this.", "disk flew up very fasti was out side in pol i lok up i see a disk with flashing lights and it zooms off stright up in a matter of secends((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I, my brother and a close friend were driving to my cousins in Erin, Ontario.  We were coming close to the edge of the town, when my brother noticed something moving in a strange way in the sky.  It turned out to be a star and the moving clouds created the illusion of it moving.  As I looked at the star I noticed something else.  It looked like a tear from the side but from below it was a triangular shape.  It had a red light on what looked like the aft of the vessel. It was so close I thought it was a plane making an emergency landing.  We opened the windows to see what it sounded like, and heard nothing at all.  If it was any known craft in this area it would have been deafening at the distance it was.  We decide to follow the craft as far as we could we got to the edge of the town and watched the craft fly east at a steady pace, stop, hover, then fly west, stop, hover, then continue north west.  The three of us are still unsure what this was! and there was no reported military training in that area.  A week prior to this my brother and I were outside my house when we noticed what looked like a star moving very fast across the sky.  I said that it was probably a satellite just I  I said that the star stopped moved the opposite direction, so east, and then continued its original path, until it was out of sight.  My brother and I have had a number of experiences with these phenomenons.  We used to live close to military base Borden in Proton Township, and we would see these same types of craft all the time.  Being located so close to the military base they let the community know when they are training, and none of the sighting to which I speak of corresponded to these training exercises.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

As I was crossing the I-44 overpass at Exit 100, I noticed a bright gold colored light to my left.  It appeared to be no more than 100 feet off the ground and less than a mile west of me.Hundreds of people reported sightings of mysterious lights in the nighttime sky in the vicinity of Northview, MO (I-44 exit 96) in 1992, and I personally saw lights from a distance many times myself, and spoke to others who saw things up close, but this was by far the closest I had ever been to it.As I traveled west on Missouri Highway 38 toward Elkland, I kept watching this object.  The farther I traveled, the closer it got to me and no matter which direction I was traveling, it was always at my 10 o&rsquo;clock position.  This was very unusual given the fact there were several 90 degree curves on this highway.  I could sense that I was being watched by whoever or whatever was in control of this object.  When it got to within a quarter mile of me, I decided to stop and look at it with my binoculars.I made a left turn onto Conklin Road, stopped and turned off my headlights and engine.  The object also stopped directly over Conklin Road about 1,000 feet west of me.  It was about 50 feet above the ground, totally motionless and soundless.  It was oval shaped and about 25 feet in diameter and approximately 12 feet from top to bottom.With my binoculars, I viewed the object for about 2 to 3 minutes.  It was the same color as yellow gold jewelry and had several black dots scattered randomly on it.  It also had a tiny bit of red on the very top I could only see with the binoculars.  It definitely was not a red light and it did not blink or strobe.The temperature that night was around 15 degrees.  I don&rsquo;t know if this had anything to do with it, but I could see a distortion around the object similar to what you would see rising from and asphalt highway on a hot summer day.The car I was driving was equipped with a spotlight.  While standing there looking at the object, I decided to aim the spotlight at it and turn it on and off a couple times to see what, if anything might happen.  After carefully aiming the spotlight toward the object, I turned the switch on and off twice in rapid succession.  As I was turning the light off the second time, without a sound, the object went straight west and was completely out of sight in less than a second.  This was the last time I saw the object.What was really strange about this was the fact the object did not start at zero miles per hour and gradually increase its speed, but instantly went from zero directly to something like 2 or 3 thousand miles per hour without creating a sonic boom.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

June 2, 2010 at apx, 9:10pm.I live near Rural Road and University, in proximity to ASU&rsquo;s Tempe campus.  As two friends of mine were leaving, one got in his car and drove off, the other called for me to quickly come over and look up.  As we can only see the &quot;aircraft&quot; from one angle, below us, the object was a circle shape, so likely some kind of saucer/disk.  It&rsquo;s altitude was near what typical, large commercial passenger planes reach as they are approaching landing, near Mill Avenue bridge.  The aircraft proceeded to head mostly south, in a slightly west direction.  When I witnessed the aircraft, it appeared to be 1-2 miles from me, over head.  It silently floated in the sky, as it traveled down over the rest of Tempe (until it was out of my sight).As my friend and I were watching it slowly drift away, another neighbor came outside to go to their car as well.  We called to her immediately, notifying her if she wanted to see a UFO to come quick.  She came over and watched with us, as she called her roommate to come outside.  By the time the roommate (4th witness) came outside to meet us, all he could see was the red light in the far distance (unable to tell the difference between this and another local Sky-Harbor related aircraft).To describe the object:  It had no color, maybe black, and had a red light at the tail of it that occasionally turned quickly on and off (slight flash). The front lights were a series of lights, between 6-8 white, circular lights that were all on, but one. This is hard to describe, but one light would turn off, in the row of lights, and turn back on as the next one turned off.  It repeated this pattern, across the entire row, and back again.  Resembles the kind of lighting effects that are used on games we see at the fair, or Peter Piper Pizza, for example.As I have lived in direct sight of Sky Harbor&rsquo;s flight path for landing/taking off over the last 4 years, I have watched aircraft during the day and at night time.  I know what helicopters look like, and how aircraft are supposed to have one red and one green light (to indicate which direction they are flying to other aircraft) and this did not have these lights.  Like I said, the only red light was at the tail. The object moved slowly, similar to that of a police helicopter, using their search light to find a criminal.  The bright white lights making a pattern, as the object flew, was very usual, let alone unsettling.  The object made little sound, very slight puttering sound, but almost nothing at all.I am a 21 year old female, just graduated from ASU.  The other observers are one male, 22 year old, current ASU student.  The other witness, another resident at this apartment complex off 8th street and Dorsey, is about 19-20 years old.  Her roommate is male, between 21-24 years old.", "Several bright orange lights in the sky.On the night of Saturday May 9, 2010 in the city of Graham, Washington.  I was at home with my family watching TV. My sister who lives down the street called us and told us to go outside and look at the sky. When we went outside we saw six or seven bright orange light moving in the sky. They seemed to be in two groups and the lights were moving steadily in different directions.My sister, who had watched the lights for about ten minutes before she called us, said that when she first saw them they were above the horizon facing east forming a &ldquo;T&rdquo; shape.By the time we got outside they were above the horizon facing south. Then one by one they disappeared. This happened at about 10:15 PM.I tried calling the Air Force which is several miles away. They didn&rsquo;t see anything or seem too interested. Which I can understand, I would probably say the same thing if I didn&rsquo;t see them with my own eyes. I also tried calling the local news stations they probably thought I was joking.

We were having a party at a restaurant on Lake Norman and everyone walked out onto the dock and saw many slowly moving red objects coming overhead, from the North West.  They were too slow to be planes or shooting stars and too fast to be hot air balloons.  They were red lights that looked relatively large and were all traveling in a group. There was a cloud directly overhead of us and as all of the U.F.O.s passed it, they all disappeared at the same spot!  It looked like they were burning out or turning off a light.  We did not see any U.F.O.s after they passed the cloud over head of us because all of their lights went out.  The duration of the event lasted from about 9:50 to 10:00 PM and after they all traveled past in that 10 minute time span, there were no more.", "Looked like a star but it rotated and signaled other white beams of light and just hanged thereI was walking south on the street and up to the east i saw a light that shown on the surrounding sky.  I thought stop its a star i said so i sat down and observed that it seemed to be signaling another white round light source and the first object then did a spin, i thought to use my lighter and do a kind of signaling thing and it flashed three purple lights around like a top would do if lights were fastened to it.

This trail wasn&rsquo;t straight, it formed a strange shape and wasn&rsquo;t a constant line, it was thick as well towards the end and curved upwards at the end. Also, the trail was close, it wasn&apos;t way above the sky.I told my husband I saw a ufo, he didn&rsquo;t believe me  he did admit he saw a strange trail of smoke riding across the sky that was at a strange close range.

We live on the 3rd floor of our Apartment. &quot; He said look at this object in the sky&quot;, There was a bright far away fuzzy looking object in the sky above the tree tops from where we were standing in the north west sky.  At first I thought it was a star, but  it moved in closer and it appeared to have a hazy glow so I went inside to get my binoculars.  While I was inside the object moved somewhat closer. The object  looked like a top that young children use to play with.The tips of object both top and bottom extended to a point the middle was of course round but the strange thing was the object was encircled in fluorescent reddish orange light that lined the whole object. It  had squares throughout the top that were set apart from each other in equal size. The squares looked like windows and/ or small rooms with white flat pads on the bottom of the squares or rooms. I saw nothing but light in the squares and the round pod or pad on the botton of each square or room - I saw nothing move inside the windows the squares were empty with bright light shining throughout each square.

At first I assumed it to be an approaching aircraft but it did&apos;t move at all which drew my attention.It was completely stationary, which is impossible even for a helicopter.  It was absolutely stationary for about 10 minutes, then another orb appeared as if it were a light being turned on. The second orb was identical to the first and appeared to the right and slightly higher than the first.  They both remained completely stationary in relation to the surface of ocean and to each other.No way these were stars.  It was still light out and slightly hazy and the objects were slightly above the ocean.There were literally thousands of people in and around the beach so others must have seen it.

It was a brilliant star field and the Milky Way weaved a misty pattern in the night sky. A lightly illuminated orb seemed to suddenly float across the sky.  No sound and about the size of an asprin tablet in the sky.  It floated acrosss the sky from one horizon and disappeared on the other.  It took only a dozen to 15 seconds and was gone.  You could see it diappear briefly behind a few puffs of clouds and quickly reappear.  It had a floating action, but moved at considerable speed at a 60 degree angle from the horizon, seemingly faster than a plane would.

When I got in my car and pulled out of the drive way, I saw this  bright star-like object hovering high above the clouds. I was so blown away by its beauty, that I kept staring at it in amazement. I just knew that it wasn&apos;t Venus or a any kind of planet or star.  As I kept driving the road, the object disappeared and I could not find it. By the time I reached the end of the road to make a right turn at the corner, I saw it again, but this time it was lower and much farther away in distance. It also appeared brighter than before. I just held the brakes and stared at it for a brief moment before making a right turn. As I drove in the other direction, I came to a stoplight. When I stopped, I looked at my left and I saw the object moving in my direction, as if it were following me.  I don&apos;t know why I did what I did after this, but I guess it was a test to see if i! t was really following me or if it was truly in the Earth&apos;s atmosphere. The creepiest, yet most amazing thing happened after this.  I drove down the road and made a left turn. I wanted to get closer and get a better look. I did not see it in the sky when I checked. Instead, the bright light came down and suddenly appeared above some trees on the right of the road and slowly moved across the street. It started getting really close to me. It was so close to my car in both length and height that I could see its spherical shape. I put my car in park and watched it hover right above me. I didn&apos;t hear any sounds coming from it. Then, suddenly, the white sphere of light vanished. As I drove away, it appeared once again high in the sky, but in a different position.  Once I reached my destination and got what I needed, I walked up to my car and saw that the object was still in the sky, but just not as bright.  On my way back to the house, I was ready to make the turn on my street, whic! h was the corner that I first mentioned. I took one last look ! and checked if it was in the same spot I had originally seen it, but it wasn&apos;t there. I highly suggest that an investigator come and videotape the night skies in the reported area since I don&apos;t have a video camera. I can compare the star-like object I saw to the fleet of UFOs seen in Chile back in 2009.

Nor do we want to be thought of as, &quot;out of our minds&quot; for saying anything at all.  We simply saw what we saw, and just want to report it.To add a little validity to our report our backgrounds are:  My son - 12 going on 13 real soon, an &quot;A-&quot; student,  7th grade, athletic, only child at home.Myself - Retired Air Force, aviation was my career for 22+ years, aircraft mechanic 6 years, aircrew member, flight engineer, cargo and air refueling aircraft the last 16 years.  I worked in the airline/aviation industry for seven years after retirement from the Air Force.  I did finish college a few years after I retired.  Aviation Management with a minor in Aviation Safety; took a few courses in accident investigation which taught a person how to question and evaluate an &quot;eye witness&quot; to an event.The sighting took place on the night of May 10th, 2010 at approximately 21:40, (9:40 pm) PST.  We were outside enjoying a wood fire in a small mobile home park in Trinidad, CA.  A clear night, the rains had just gone through earlier in the day.  There is a small airport just south of our location about 11 miles away.My son and I were engaged in a conversation when I noticed a brighter than normal light coming up over the tree line just to the north of us.  I wouldn&apos;t have paid much attention to it had it not been so bright.  Initially, I thought it was a late night commuter flight arriving out of the north, but then I noticed it wasn&apos;t the normal color patterns of an aircraft, the green and red lights from the wing tips and the flashing anti-collision lights the FAA requires. The light pattern we saw was a reddish orange color, maybe a little yellow mixed in.  And they weren&apos;t flashing.  The colors were &quot;glowing&quot; or slowly pulsating.  I questioned then whether it was an aircraft or one that I knew of anyhow.  Granted, I&apos;ve been out of the aviation field going on seven years now.  I then noticed its movement.It was moving a little quicker than the normal &quot;prop&quot; or small jet type aircraft that come into our local airport.  And, it didn&apos;t appear to be one of the Coast Guards&apos; rescue helicopters out on a night flight.  All aircraft have a distinctive sound to them; there wasn&apos;t any sound at all coming from the sky.  Just the occasional car or truck going down Hwy 101 and the rustling of the redwood trees from a slight wind.  But then I figured it was too far away to hear.  However, that would mean it was a large craft with the size they were and not being able to hear them.  A couple of weeks ago, someone said that was Venus in the night sky that was so bright.  I just noticed it was a very bright star or planet on a clear night.  Compared to that, this light was at least twice the size.We watched it for about 30 seconds or so, maybe a minute.  It was traveling from our right to left which would be north to west or northwest direction.  It was then we both noticed two more similar lights appearing from the same location over the tree line.  Then a fourth one appeared following the two in front.  All seemed to be going in the same direction.  A tall redwood tree obstructed our view as we watched and I had my son move to his left to try and pick them up as they appeared from behind the tree.  They never reappeared.  He said,&quot; Papa, they disappeared!&quot;  About that time and I would say again it was around 30 seconds or so, a fifth light appeared, trailing all the others and moving in the same direction.  We then moved our position to be able to watch the craft without obstructions from tall trees.  We kept an eye on it and to our amazement, it all of a sudden got smaller and disappeared.  Wow! is all we could say.The direction of the flight pattern for the five reddish orange lights were west or northwest at about a 20 to 30 degree angle in the sky as referenced from the top of the tree line to the point where the last one disappeared.  It all took place within a three to four minute time period I would guess, but I wasn&apos;t keeping track of the time while watching.  I did happen to remember to ask my son what time it was when the last &quot;light&quot; disappeared.I could only hope that others saw this and are reporting it.  As a military flight crew member I could only describe a few of the &quot;odd&quot; things I saw throughout my flying career as, well, &quot;odd.&quot;  Now, at least in my mind, I have some creditable proof to maybe I wasn&apos;t seeing things.....", "It was a light orange round ball of light with no sound and physical form flying nrth to south 9:45p Pomona,CaMy friend and co-business partner were outside my garage.

At closer look it was very high in the sky, no sounds were audible, and no blinking lights, or shape were visible.  The light appeared to be very high and seemed to change directions from approching to reversing and it ascended upward very fast and then the bright light just disappeared without a trace(as if someone just turned off the flood light).

I was with a friend. The sky had bouts of moving clouds.  Sometimes the clouds were more dense, and sometimes the sky would be pretty opened up.  I soon noticed a very bright star, there weren&apos;t any others noticable in the sky.  It was abnormally bright, and it was moving north in the sky.  It felt much too distant to be a plane, and there was no sound.  I asked my friend what he thought of it. He said he wasn&apos;t sure, he thought it was probably a satellite and fell asleep.   I&apos;ve never seen a satellite before, but this &apos;star&apos; looking object then stopped and stayed in one place, making small seeming motions back and for or up and down.  This object would fade in and out sometimes, other times it would get covered by clouds and it made it difficult for me to understand what it really was.

The experience lasted about ten seconds and then it disappeared. My friend soon woke up, and we left.

The recording is spectacular although the conditions of brightness and sharpness common to this type of devices.The video can be put under all kind of tests to ensure its authenticity. It is absolutely real.I do not want to avoid comments identify humorous or otherwise by known or not as well known. I hope you do not mind this detail.I&apos;ve got a Private Pilot License, and thank to my experience and knowledge about flying, and the knowing on attitude and maneuvers of aircraft on airspace, that&apos;s why I&apos;m absolutely sure that this are not &quot;conventional&quot; fixed wing aircraft. The only possible explanation would be that they were helicopters, but given the characteristics of air space location, time of sighting, weather and number of traffics sighted, it&apos;s hard to believe we&apos;re talking about this type of aircraft (and also due to other reasons explained below).Let&apos;s  describe the facts:  Location: San Sebastian, Spain Date: 06/22/2008 Time: 2:50 AM (local time)  The facts are set in a rainy late night, after a sultry day, classic Basque coast, in the afternoon that triggers a &quot;gale&quot; that completely changes the weather, thus passing a hot sunny day in excess , a late-night and early morning rain, the sky completely covered (the ceiling would be around 600 or 800 feet). Weather conditions certainly were not ideal, either for VFR (visual) or IFR (instrumental) flights.I leave a disco located near the mouth of Urumea river, 300 ft from the sea, and the first thing I see (outside the disco could at that time be about twenty people watching the scene) is something like flares or fireworks (is the first thing that went through my head just seen the objects).I never leave my amazement when I see that they are objects that have a bright orange light, fixed and weak (although the video appears in a flashing mode), which seem to be quite large, and maintaining a steady ascent flight (improper of a flare or firework).This is a sighting made up of at least nine traffic. I say at least it is the number of traffic which document the recording, but I am sure that before I started recording I could see more objects. I think there were around 13 or 15 spotted objects. I think this is a considerable number of traffics, which were moving in groups of 3 or 4, some in pairs and solo, with variable speeds from one another, although all were heading in an east-west direction, looking that its point of departure was off or the sea. I could not hear any sound coming from the objects (sound of rotors, ...). The truth is that my proximity to the disco would probably prevent me hear any sounds associated with them, but it is also true that in the case of many objects, it is logical that it had heard a noise, more so considering that the wind, even weak or very weak intensity, was at that time, and after the passage of the gale, north-northwest direction, so it was not a factor which prevented listening t! o sounds from that area, or that slowed them.The recording, in mp4 format and weighing 63.4 MB, has a duration of 4 min. and 25 sec., and has audio (with a &quot;taco&quot; or improper word included).I have to say it was something I could not believe. I was watching something that escaped my mind all logic by the circumstances of the moment, and physics of flight if we think of objects such as flares and fireworks. I had never seen anything like that. I have never spotted suspicious objects to be classified as UFOs but from my experience as a pilot and my knowledge of aviation, and from an objective perspective, I cannot give a logical explanation and some of what happened on that late night/early-morning of Sunday June 22nd on the sky of San Sebastian.Trying  to clear any doubts, I first put in touch with local newspaper &quot;El Diario Vasco&quot; once I got home (around 03:30 AM). From the paper, and to my question about whether they had received any calls or had known what had happened, they said no, and the person writing that I attended dealt with the subject telling me that I would have the exclusive on the matter. I did not provide any information in this medium, because my focus was solely on finding out what had happened, beyond creating a notice or cause any unnecessary minimum alarm.A few minutes later I put in touch with San Sebastian Airport with the intention of resolving any doubt in the case of several traffics had taken off from this airfield, which is unlikely since these facilities are operational only from 06:00 h. to 21:00 pm GMT. Indeed, a member of airport security personnel, along with several Civil Guard troops, at that time the only staff at the facility, tells me that since the closing time of the aerodrome there has not been any takeoff or landing operation. Thus, in the narration of the facts and seeking a possible explanation between the event, he tells me that there must have been a chopper concentration close to the field ... If so, that is, if it were private helicopters, where did they take off? at that time? in those weather conditions? how many? what was their fate? There are many questions, in addition to the already questionable as &quot;normal&quot; physical characteristics of the flight, since no one respects Training, traffic looking! each flight develops its sole discretion, even at times to provoke some kind of collision between aircraft. Also, the navigation lights are anything but navigation lights. They are more comparable to &quot;landing lights&quot;, although these are only used at final approach maneuvers, landing and take-off on, but that&apos;s not all, as the brightness, hue, intensity and very important direction of the light beam, not easily explained. Landing light beams are projected in a sense, the flight path, and not through a kind of focus light at an angle of 360 &deg; as in this case. In the recording can be viewed at all times the same intensity of each traffic light, regardless of their position, and throughout the flight path east-west.Thinking on the possibility that, being helicopters, were those well known and dilapidated soviet made MIL-MI that usually come from Eastern Europe to Spain for the summer fire season, I contacted next day with the tower of Labacolla Airport (Santiago de Compostela, Spain) for the purpose of ascertaining whether there was a landing operation of such choppers over last morning. The only reason for contacting with Santiago de Compostela Airport was that is the only one airport in the northern half of the Spanish peninsula, with the exception of the Foronda Airport (Vitoria), which operates 24 hours a day (H24 operational). The answer given by the driver in command at that time was negative, indicating that there was only air military exercises of NATO airspace early in the vertical drawn from Le&oacute;n to the west, there are therefore any flight plan or known traffic area in the hours watching the events. We are talking about a longitudinal distance between two points (San Sebastia! n - Le&oacute;n) approximately 160 nautical miles (300 km). We must take into account the rigor that military and civilian authorities established to determine airspace to such maneuvers, for the danger they entail implicit in the civil air operations.Given these responses, only have the option of consulting military authorities and the Radar Control Center in Madrid, Spain. Not being easy the access to these establishments, I leave it to anyone interested in the phenomenon of inquiring beyond the initial investigations carried out.All these details about the physics and flight characteristics of the objects spotted have been discussed with different Airline Transport Pilots of recognized national carriers, they can likewise view the recording made, and very surprised at what is seen in the same, have not been able either to give a priori any explanation of the phenomenon. Like me, they could give as valid only the explanation that they were helicopters, yes, with all the questions raised above.You can watch the recording at  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPUZuTwUmPE  Best Regards and thanks a lot!", "Weird light in the sky near Dearborn Heights, Mi.My brother and I were outside to have a cigarette tonight.

We then proceeded out to the rear of our house where I saw the circular shape with rings travel over our house, we followed it to the front of house, it then traveled past &amp; behind the neighbors house&apos;s.  The rings then changed to what could be described as triangular shapes protruding from the sides of the circle.  The circular shape then &quot;flew&quot; upwards where we lost sight of it.  Please note that the rings/triangles where surrounded by a fog.Approximately 1 - 2 minutes later we then observed an aeroplane flying from a different direction.  This was obvious from the shape and the wing lights, we therefore dispute any person/s or organizations trying to state that it was an airplane.  We do not believe it was the so called rocket as stated in the news later that day.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

They seemed to move independently, and moved in different directions and different speeds. They were also different sizes which I guess was to do with distance, some must have started to come closer as they were getting bigger, some getting smaller and dimmer. Over time they seemed to go out of visable range, getting smaller/dimmer before dispearing into the horizon, or shooting up into the sky. A few minutes later there seemed to be 3 more launch off from the ground into the sky, these were in formation.Eventually they all disappeared, but over the course of the next 20mins, more were seen, to be moving around the sky. My guess is they would be over the Clipstone or Ollerton region of Nottinghamshire, England.I have a few blurry photos, and a movie, but as there from my mobile phone there not great.... but they do show 2/3 orange firey balls launching off into the sky...We walked home about 20 minutes later, and the sky seemed to have 3 or 4 low flying jet type aircraft, possibly military in nature. This is unusual as we are not in any normal aeroplane flight path. Also as we walked home my sister called me saying she saw another going across the horizon.This is not the 1st time I have seen weird firey orange lights in the sky moving at high speeds with sudden direction changes... I saw one quite close back in Nov 2007... This time though, the fiery balls were witnessed by 5 different people including adults and a child.10 other sightings of the same objects all over England were also witnessed, accounts of these are onhttp://www.uk-ufo.co.uk/", "25/5/10 OVER NEVADA WHITE IN COLOUR TURNED VERY QUICK BRIGHT SUNNY AFTERNOONI PHOTOGHRAPHED THIS OBJECT FROM THE TOP OF THE STRATOSPHERE IN LAS VEGAS, I SNAPED THREE PHOTOS THE OBJECT FACED A DIFFERENT DIRECTION ON ALL THREE PHOTOS,THE OBJECT WAS AT HIGH ALTITUDE,I NEED TO CONTACT SOMEONE WHO CAN ENLARGE THE PHOTOS WITHOUT LOSING TO MUCH OF THE QUALITY", "UFO over Sandia MountainsI saw a circle that I thought was a star.  It shined brightly, and pulsated, however, only white light that I could see.  I realized that the star was too low, compared to others in the night sky.  The sky was clear, with a few clouds.  The circle was over a house (at least it appeared to be) and was low in the sky.  I took out my binoculars and looked at the object, which glowed, then slightly dimmed.  I saw no aircraft lights, and it did not move from side to side, but appeared to hover over the home.  I called my daughter and my son to look at it.  They came out, and we were watching it, when it disappeared.  It was there and then was gone.  I have never seen anything like it.  Can someone tell me if there was any experimental aircraft in the area?  I know the base is nearby.  It was just crazy, because I keept looking for it after it disappeared, but didn&apos;t see it again.", "Triangular craft watching Bristol Mountain Ski ResortThis sighting is going back some years now, but I can remember the precise weekend in which this UFO was seen by 5 people at the same time, just like it was yesterday.  I have created a drawing of what I remember the craft looking like which I  included with this report made on Microsoft paint.It was 1977 at Bristol Mountain Ski Resort in Bristol Valley , Canandaigua, New York, the weekend that followed  Thanksgiving  Day which was November 24th, 1977.  Bristol Mountain ski resort was teaming with activity for the holiday weekend, that&rsquo;s when we really used to get snow.I worked in the snack bar on the bottom floor of the Ski Lodge, along with 4 other people present that day.  We cooked Hamburg&rsquo;s,  hotdogs, fries and such for customers visiting the ski resort.The only window&rsquo;s in the snack bar area were a row of windows located higher up on the wall just below the ceiling, facing the Mountain across the street from Bristol Mountain ski resort.  These are the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, in the finger lakes region.It had been a busy day this Saturday November 26th, 1977.  Lunch hour was packed.  Finally the business dropped of for the snack bar and we were all just goofing around and talking, when one of the guys I worked with yelled out,  &quot;Hey , look at this thing across street above the Mountain!&quot;  So we all looked out the window&rsquo;s to see what he was making the big deal about.There was a perfect view of this object above the tree line of the Mountain across the street.  At first you had a hard time seeing it because it was a beautiful sun filled winter day with a dazzling blue sky.  It was like a bright orange yellow glowing severe triangular craft, with like a boomerang back to the triangle, but the craft had a severe point to the front of the triangle like to a sharp point and the back although it had a boomerang shape was not a wide type.  It looked like the shape of a paper air plain you made in school.It was just  sitting still over the Mountain top and was pointed right at Bristol Mt. Resort.  Like it was observing all the activity going on there.  We watched it for sometime until we started getting busy again, and after that point I don&rsquo;t remember if it just left or what?   Over the years I have told this account to different people at parties and such and always can remember it with clarity.  I was completely blown away while surfing the internet, when I discovered that these triangular crafts have been seen by many people.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "At about 12:27am on the 21st of May, while getting ready for bed and all was quiet, I heard the same sound I heard in mid-March when I saw a sphere in the sky.  I immediately looked out my window and saw a sphere. I ran for my digital camera/video recorder and started filming.  I recorded a white, round light/sphere moving away from my location in a northwest trajectory for several minutes and could still see the object between the trees until I finally had to give up due to trees blocking my view at about 12:39am.  The object did not move vertically or horizontally or change color, but did seem to &apos;flicker&apos; in light intensity a little.  This time of year the night sky is still quite light and no stars or satelite lights are visible.   Also, in this area we get an abundance of air traffic of many types including helicopters, small planes, military, and commercial at high altitudes, and this &quot;UFO&quot; did not fit any of these.  No tail was seen immediately behind the object as I have seen on meteors or meteorites.I have the object on video and am willing to release it to your organization, but seem to be unable with dial-up internet.", "clear sky, 2 &quot;light&quot; objects high above, joining each other, then shooting off towards the west. third sighting. first time for 2 to getok, i have seen this&quot;light&quot; for the third time now.  it looks like a star, rapidly moving, kind of a &quot;twinkling&quot;/dimming, followed by a brightness, then it disappears.the first time I reported this.  the second time I did not.  now the third time i am again, only because there seemed to have been two of them.  one travelling from east to west, very high in the sky, the ohter travelling north to north west, and meeting with the other &quot;light&quot;  it seemed to become &quot;one&quot; but then looked as if they were both very close together. this lasted for about 45 seconds, until at which one point, it just &quot;flashed&quot;, and shot out of sight, almost like a shooting star.( which it definately was not).  there is definately something going on in the skies above long island.  I have seen this on several occasions over the past number of years, but never reported anything.  but with the frequency of these &quot;sightings&quot;.  I am convinced there is something up there.((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of satellites??  PD))", "We saw a bright &quot;star&quot; next to the sun as we were out for a drive.My fianc&eacute; and I were out for a drive around Table Rock Lake, when we both looked out the windshield and saw what looked like a VERY bright star.  This was strange, because it was only about 6:00 in the evening and the sun was still high in the sky.As we watched it, it seemed to be reflecting the sunlight like something big and metal.  When we went around a curve, the &quot;star&quot; started to dim as if the angle had changed and it was reflecting less light.  It was high in the sky like an airplane, but it was perfectly stationary.  Eventually, it dimmed to the point that it seemed to disappear.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))", "Fast moving metallic oval object over Brookston, INWhile sitting on my mother-in-law&apos;s deck, I saw an oval-shaped object traveling SouthWest The sun was gleaming off of the craft. It was very metallic like silver.There were no vapor trails at all so it must have been traveling at a lower altitude.I did not see any kind of wings or a tail at all. It eventually disappeared into the horizon.I am an USAF veteran.  Since having being in the military I know to observe all the details.  This may have been a classified aircraft that I am not familiar with.I sure didn&apos;t look terrestrial.", "2 lights (1 red, 1 yellow), Too big to be a plane. Silent and keeping perfect line and formation.One red/orange light and one yellow.  Went across the whole sky over about 1-2 min period.  Kept perfect line and formation.... One ahead of the other.

Last Wednesday they hiked to the top of a mountain in Ischia, an Island off Naples to visit a statue of the Holy Mother.  They took a sequence of pictures.  Never noticing anything in the sky.  Although it was a perfectly clear day. It wasn&apos;t until they got back to the house later when reviewing the pictures that they noticed a UFO that was above them.  This object was not in the sequence of pictures before or after this one.  Interestingly, and within 48 hours of this photograph they heard there was a report on the mainland in Naples that made the local news of someone claiming an actual UFO landed on their property.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

My husband had died 4 months before.It was the 4th of July, 1973.  The young boys wanted to sleep so I slept out with them on the front lawn of our country home.  We had fun looking at the stars and we were tired.  The boys fell asleep but I couldn&rsquo;t, because I was thinking of their Dad and wishing he was here with us.  I did things like this with them hoping it would help them to not be so sad.As I lay there I looked up and saw a large &quot;fireball&quot; floating over the trees and continued over the house, coming from south to north.  After it passed over another one came from the same direction but slightly off the same path but also going in the same direction.  And as soon as it passed was over my shoulder I saw a 3rd one came over.  Their color was orangy-red and looked on fire and they were complete silent.  No noise at all..  It took about 10 seconds for each one of them to pass overhead until the next one came.  I was so shocked that I didn&rsquo;t turn around to see how long it took them to go out of sight.Also, I tried to compare their size with the moon.  Comparing the almost full moon in the sky to the fireballs they were three-fourths as big as the moon.  It&rsquo;s really hard to tell how high or low they were.  I&rsquo;d say they were as big as a saucer held at arm&rsquo;s length.  This probably doesn&rsquo;t make much sense but it&rsquo;s the best I can do.When I went to work the next day I told co-workers about it and they said it was being announced over the radio if anyone saw something strange in the sky last night to report it to the Sheriff&rsquo;s office.  I did report it and sent the diagram I had made right after it had happened.My only purpose in reporting this now is just to let someone, somewhere know that UFO&rsquo;s are REAL because I saw it &quot;with my own eyes.&quot;  I&rsquo;m a Christian woman and would not lie about what I&rsquo;ve seen.  I&rsquo;ve recorded it in my personal history of my life and I&rsquo;ll never forget it.  Thanks for giving me the opportunity to report this incredible sighting.", "As I was working on patrol I looked up at the clear night sky and notice a V-shape formation above me.I am a law enforcement official and on april 18th, 2010 as I was working on patrol at approximately 0120 hrs.I was parked facing a south direction approximately 300 feet from Gst on Community Dr. (This is in the area of Merced College the College parking area lights were all off)I then got off my vehicle and looked up at the clear sky, as I looked up in a north/east direction above me I notice a white  V-shape formation approximately 100 yards width moving slow in a north/east direction. The V-shape formation had no sound to it. Then the V-shape formation broke up and got in to three smaller formations, with three objects in each formation.  Each formation was now shape in a triangle formation.  Two of the formation got closer together still heading in the same direction and the formation closer to me separated and headed north.  The size of each object in the formation was the size of a small compact vehicle the object&apos;s were white in color with a haze&apos;s around them. As I staired at the formations for approximately 30 sec. They took off at a high rate of speed in their direction of travel. I then got back into my vehicle and left the area heading north on Gst. to see if i could see the formation again.  I got to the intersection of Gst and bellevue and headed east on bellevue and parked off the side of the road approximately 200 yards from Gst. This area is in the county of Merced, CA, and is surrounded by fields and their is really no lights out in this area where I stopped. The formation never came back over me.", "Charleston Area UFO June 27 2010I went out to smoke a cigarette before going to bed and saw a bright light through the trees to the west. I stepped out into the yard to see what it was.  The light was very bright.  What made it interesting is that the light was solid and not blinking.  It was probably about 2,000 to 3,000 feet off the ground.  It was moving in a straight line.  No noise was heard from the triangle shaped object.  As I watched this craft moving to the east and it started to fade from my line of sight, I heard jets taking off from the nearby Charleston AFB.  Were they trying to chase this craft?   As the craft got further away to the east it started changing colors rapidly from red to blue to white and green.", "Orange Craft Seen Over Galveston BayOn Saturday May 22, 2010 at approximately 11:45pm-12:00am timeframe, my husband and I were fishing on the West End of Galveston, TX on a private pier located in the Jamaica Beach area.  If you looked across the bay, you could see the Texas City Refinery Plant on the other side.As I was walking to use the ladies room in the parking lot, I looked over the bay and saw what I thought was a fire trailing up towards his side.  I called out to him to look above his head and tell me if he saw the fire.I thought at first it was a bag blowing upwards with a fire inside (like the kind used at a Thai wedding or something).  It was so windy that night; I knew that had to be ridiculous, so I called out to see if he saw it too.My husband and two others, fishing at the end of the pier saw the orange glowing object as well.It looked like a dark object with a series of bright orange lights on the side.  I do not want to make an observation on the shape of it because all I could tell was that it seemed to be an object and I could only see what I thought looked like a half moon set of lights.It floated left to right (from my vantage point), hovered for a few moments and then faded from bright orange to nothing.  Total duration seemed to be approximately 60-90 seconds total before fading out.", "orange color,  appeared about the sizeof a tennis ball, moved vertically until barely visible, then moved at a high speed westwardThere was no sound. I noticed a bright orange ball to the north of my location on the beach.  It seemed to hover for a few seconds after I noticed it.  Then it started to move vertically.

The best I could explain it&apos;s location is that it was hovering a few dozen feet over my neighbor&apos;s house, but since I wasn&apos;t able to determine exactly how close or how far away it was, it may not have been over his house at all and only appeared that way. I immediately reached for my camera phone, fumbling with it as I tried to power it on. By the time it was turned on though and I had it aimed out the window the light was gone. The entire experience lasted anywhere from ten to thirty seconds.", "I was just driving home on North bound I5 near exit 71.  There were a few people ahead of me and a few behind me, i wish i could know if they saw this too.  It was a very clear night out. So when i went to admire the beautiful night sky i thought i saw a shooting star.  I took a double glance and couldnt believe what i was seeing.  It was lower to the ground is what first caught my attention, then i noticed that the craft had slowed down; to wear it was so slow it almost just disapeared; and then took off really fast leaving an unblievable, luminous green trail behind it.  I have always been the type of person that did not believe in aliens or ufo&apos;s or whatever lable you would like to call them.. but after seeing what i saw, i now believe that there are others out there.", "Sighted 5 circular lightsWhile walking with my brother, we noticed a circular light high up in the sky.  At first we thought it was just the top of a light tower, but then 4 more of the circular light shaped objects appeared.  They didn&apos;t seem to be in any order as they were not in a straight line, but they were all spaced apart and different heights.  They did not move at all, but just stayed in the positions that they first appeared in.  They remained for a few minutes, then all but the original one disappeared.  That one remained for another minute or so, and then it disappeared as well.

Like a hook shape.  The color was white it was so far. the more we got closer (my girlfriend and I were running) the more I could focus on it and I began to see it tilt in the air exactly looking like an oval shape but slanted like 40 degree angle.  So we just stared at it(just in aww trying to decipher the thing) because it was quite signifcant to the plane that was flying near it.  The plane turned around for some reason, I dont know if that had anything to do with the ufo thing.  But it was obvious that it was some type of ufo compared to the plane.  For about one minute and a half it was the same slanted oval shape but it began to disapear, fade away, diminish.  Two seconds later, to the left, about thousands of feet away it reappeared but in a regular horizontal oval shape.  Same color, white with just a touch of shine. It was just there doing nothing just! being white and shiny for about 5 minutes.  It started to fade away,  As it was fading away it turned into a small light blue colored dot just diminishing.  We looked all around us for another shape but nothing.  I&apos;ve never seen anything in the sky like that and I look in the sky quite often seeing falling stars quite often, the stars and astrology type things are amazing.
