["A spotting of bright and unusual flashes from the sky.I didn&apos;t really know who to report this to, but a close friend and I witnessed an event that we both believe to be very unusual.  At around 1:00AM on the 10th or 11th of June 2001, while we were in his back yard we both witnessed a blinding reflection of bright white light.  Neither of us heard anything, nor did we see anything after that. And just now at 1:28AM on the 14th of June 2001, I witnessed a bright white reflection of light off of everything in my back yard as if a helicopter flew directly over my house with it&apos;s spotlight shining, but I heard no noise.  I immediately went outside to see what it might have been and stood out there for about a minute before I saw two consecutive flashes of an orangish light that reflected off of all of the clouds in the sky facing north of my home which was the direction I was facing at the time of the incident.  Again, no noise or any discernible origination of the light was to be recognized.  I don&apos;t know what to make of it, but I will be watching for any more unnusual activity.", "My wife and I were driving east on Missouri Rt 14 about 1 mile west of Billings MO  when we both witnessed a green object which resembled a meteor, except that it was much larger than any we have seen before.  Its color was the same made by copper when exposed to a flame.  It was just north of northeast and was about the size of my little finger nail when held at arm&apos;s length. It was about 30 degrees above the horizon and travelled downward in a straight line at about a 45 degree angle.  It travelled rapikly and disappeared below the visible horizon.

The jet seemed to be on an aproach to Will Rogers Airport. It was heading due south directly over our location. The jet was flying low, perhaps 2000 to 2500 feet above the ground. I was the first to notice an other object just off the plane&apos;s left side. The object was about 75 to 100 feet from the left side and keeping pace with the plane. At first I thought I was seeing a reflection in my glasses. I asked the other person with me if they saw it too. They did. We watched for about 45 seconds, untill the jet and object disappeared behind some trees to our south. The object had no lights of it&apos;s own and was only lighted by the street lights below. The object looked to be cigar shaped, 25 feet long and 10 feet wide. The object was gray in color and made no sound that we could hear over that of the jet. The object made to change in direction other  than to pace the plane. The weather was clear with a few stars showing, wind was from the south at 5 MPH.

It was traveling upward from North to South similar in speed to a shooting star as it heads downwards.Suddenly it was out of view because it ascended higher than I could see,being inside the car.At first I thought it may have been a reflection of the green traffic signal in my windsheild that I had just passed a few hundred feet behind me, but as i slowed down to look at it, it continued traveling at the same steady speed.((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.

My daughter says, &quot;Look at that hot air balloon without the balloon.&quot;    I looked and saw a translucent egg-shaped bubble with a smaller dark ball above it up in the sky about a mile or so to the northeast of us - about as high up as we usually see hot air balloons.    I pulled off the road to get a better look.     It was very strange.   I couldn&apos;t tell how it was staying up in the air - there were not propellors or any other apparent source keeping it up.    It looked like a silvery white balloon and it almost looked like two human shapes were moving around inside of it.    The shape was just about the size for the 2 shapes to be in.    It appeared to hang in one place and drifted side to side from the top just very slightly.     I did not have any binoculars unfortunately.    When we turned onto Wagner Road headed north, we couldn&apos;t see it anymore.   It was almost like the sun had been shining through it to make it visible to us.

We were in the middle of nowhere and decided we had to sleep in the van.  We were parked along the road beside the Black Mesa trailhead.  The almost full moon was very bright and was lighting up the unfamiliar landscape.  My husband and I got out and thought about putting up our tents but I heard a buzzing and decided to just sleep in the car,as the kids were already asleep and I didn&apos;t want to wake them and have them cry out in the night. My husband got a sleeping bag and put it down on the passenger side of the van.  Before I took my glasses off, I looked around and noticed there was no lights to be seen in any direction. I slept for a couple of hours and something woke me up at 1:43.  I raised my seat and put on my glasses and looked to my right to see black cows mooing and sniffing around my husband.  While I worried about him being trampled by cows, I looked around at  the desert landscape.  I looked out my driver&apos;s side window and saw a large blue disk shaped light.  It was below the horizon, so I got the feeling it was on the ground. It&apos;s color was pretty much the color of a blue street light, but it was much too big to be a street light. It was shimmering.  I thought that maybe there was a lake in that direction and the moon was reflecting off of it.  I went back to sleep, but would wake up every now and then to see if it was still there.  I am sure it was there for at least two hours, maybe more. As soon as it was light enough, I looked in that direction expecting to see a lake or a barn or house, but there was nothing there.  It couldn&apos;t have been more than a mile or so away due to the fact there were hills in the way. I estimate the object was about mini van size.

The light was stopped very close to the ground and we thought that it was a law enforcement helicopter searching for something. We walked up to the back porch thinking that there might be a criminal in the area, and stood by the door. As we watched, the light then moved towards our house and was out of my view (we were standing on the bottom deck). Once it reached the house, it came back into view. It sounded like a helicopter and my mom said that she heard it from inside her bed room. I never saw the actual shape due to the intensity of the spotlight, but when it came up to the house, we could clearly see the bottom of the object. It was round and with a few white lights on the bottom. It appeared to be a white, or light grey color. It flew over the house very slowly so that we had a good thirty seconds to see the bottom of it. It was a very strange looking helicopter, if that&apos;s what it was. The spotlight was very intense. It lit the pool area as it flew by. I&apos;m normally very skeptic of U.F.O. sightings, and am not confinced that it was one, but would like to find something to explain this object.

We were standing outside of our patrol vehicles.  My supervisor called my attention to a &quot;bright star&quot; low in sky to the north east.  Upon seeing this very bright, red twinkling object I first thought that it was a planet,  then the object faded out and disappeared.  We thought that maybe a cloud had passed in front of this object that we were still assuming was a planet or star, although the night was relatively clear as one could plainly see the cresent moon.  Approximately five minutes later, this object reappeared at what appeared to be a higher altitude and began to slowly become very dim and then very bright, as if someone were playing with a dimmer switch on a light bulb.  I retrieved a pair of 10 by 25 binoculars that I keep with my duty gear and again looked at the object.  Through the binoculars, three seperate objects could be seen in a tight triangle formation.  By this time, around 0500hrs, vehicles were passing by our location, but noone elese seemed to notice the object, as it looked like a &quot;normal&quot; star unless one watched it for a few minutes and noticed it&apos;s strange behavior.  At dawn, around 0530hrs, the object seemed to stabilize at a constant brightness and ended the pulsing effect.  At 0545hrs, with sufficient sunlight,  when looking at the object through my binoculars,  the three lights were still distinct, although now they were a bright white color, with what appeared to be some sort of solid object behind them, visible only through the binoculars.  At this time, the moon and this object were the only visible objects in the sky, but by this time, if one did not know where to look, one would probably not notice it.  By 0600,  with the glare of the rising sun, the object was no longer visible.  I have six years of law enforcement/security experience, with many nights being spent on the overnight shift.  I, nor my supervisor,  who has over ten! years e xperience, have never seen anything like this object.  I have seen satellites and had an astronomy course in college and do not remember studying any know heavenly objects visible from earth that act in this manner.

A friend and I were star gazing. We noticed flashing lights off in the distance, 1 foot above the western horizon; red, blue and white lights flashing. It appeared to be a satelite at first. As it approached us, we began to think it was an emergency plane or helicopter. It was travelling very quickly. It flew/drifted almost directly above us, and as it did, 2 more lights became visible for 10 to 20 seconds. It had a pyramid shaped bottom. Then as it passed by, the 2 front lights faded, and 4 lights were visible again, but in a reverse pattern. The wind picked up at about the same time as it was above us, so we don&apos;t know if it made any sound. We watched as it dissapeared 1 foot above the eastern horizon. Whatever it was, it came toward us from a point above the horizon, and went away above the horizon; it did not follow the curvature of the earth. It was very, very high in the sky while above us. It was visible for a total of about 5 minutes. It never stopped or slowed down. We don&apos;t know if it&apos;s related, but we also saw a bright flash in the sky, shortly after this craft went by. The flash was bright enough to dimly light the sky and ground. Neither of us has ever seen anything like this before, and we tried to think of what it could be. I&apos;ve personally seen many aircrafts flying above me at night, and can tell the difference between a star and a satelite. This we can&apos;t figure out what it is.

People reported having to stop in the middle of highways because this thing hovered 30 to 50 feet above the ground.  Police departments verified also seeing this, and also recieving the numerous phone calls reporting a so-called downed plane.

Does ball lightening hover over Dodge Durangos? The object was reported as being extremely huge, and VERY bright green.

It was said to have a sort of red tail that could be seen as it was moving. Those who saw it hover closer to the ground said it was so bright, that it didn&apos;t appear to have any shape, except that looking into it, the center appeared black, surrounded by a blinding green glow, with evident lights at the bottom perimeter of it.

Its trajectory showed it had come between the houses and it was only 1 or 2 feet away from the corner of the house as it passed over the fence. The trajectory was a slow curve as it seemed to have risen up to avoid the fence and then continued downward after clearing the fence.  (the downward curve took the object from about 8 feet in the air to 6 feet and the object was travelling between 5-10mph).  As I first seen the object it was rising though, so i am sure that it had risen over the fence and dropped again into the garden. At this time it was travelling away from me but coming across my vision.  I was only around 10 feet away from the object at this time.  It then curved sharply upwards and at this point I grabbed my mother who was hoovering behind me. &quot;whats that&quot; I said and pointed.  She looked at it for a good few seconds and we both watched it dissapear out of view.  It floated almost like a balloon but rose at such a pace that it was soon out of site.  It also clearly moved in several directions before its steep climb, which shows it was not being blown by the wind. The object was of a grey black colour, of a cylinder shape and very small.  (One of my first thoughts was that it was a balloon but it was the wrong shape,too small and made at least three clear changes in direction.  The object cannot have been more than 5-10 cm from top to bottom and 2-3 cm diameter.  I could not make out any detail on the object so you could say that it was smooth. I heard no noise. Although I was a little intrigued, the fact that this was such an unremarkable and small object made me put it out of my mind.  The only thing that really intrigued me is the way that it moved.  It was totally unexplainable how an object this small could be capable of self powered flight.  One further thing to mention is that the cylinder remianed upright throughout flight and did not spin or wobble, as would be excepted from an object floating in the wind. I realise how easy it is to discredit stories like these and I admit that moments after I had seen the object I began to look for a &apos;rational&apos; explanation.  I could not think of one.  Perhaps other people have seen similar things or could shed some light on a possible rational explantion.", "I observed 2 red flying objects moving across the sky, from right to left, then becoming one, for 20+min.I was parked near the Conejo Valley Art Center in Newberry park, CA on a deadend road. I sat there to relax &amp; enjoy the peace and serenity. I saw 2 red objects move from right to left. At first I thought they were airplanes, but the one object merged into the other &amp; became one! Also, I felt very anxious &amp; afraid. I don&apos;t feel that way when I see planes in the sky late at night. The object stopped in mid-air &amp; hovered! The moon was out &amp; it was very clear so it was easy to see. I didn&apos;t hear an engine. The object would change in shape- get smaller, then bigger. It jst hovered. It stayed red, &amp; did not flash on &amp; off.  I watched it for about 20 min! Then I began feeling extremely anxious &amp; afraid. I wanted to stay &amp; watch it, being curious; yet, I felt afraid.  I turned up the hill to the right of the object, &amp; the object got closer &amp; closer to me! I left &amp; went up the hill. However, this was the wrong way! I&apos;m not familiar with Newberry Park. I don&apos;t live there. So I turned around &amp; went down to where I was before. The object was still there. I wanted to leave, feeling very afraid, so I did. I watched the object in my rearview mirror, until it was out of sight. I have never had a UFO encounter before. I am actually very skeptical. However, after this experience, I am a believer. I have never had such intense feelings of fear before from seeing an object in the sky. I have seen many airplanes in the sky before at this time of night &amp; never felt fear. This was different.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness and found her to be quite eloquent in her description of the event, and quite credible in her description of the objects she witnessed.

I live in Waterloo, about 1 hour west of Toronto, and on  Wednesday, Aug. 8th, shortly before 11PM I was outside waiting for the dog to &quot;do her business.&quot;  While waiting, I just so happened to look up northwest (at an angle of 45-50 degrees), and saw what appeared to be a slightly &quot;out-of-focus&quot; ball of white light flying across the sky at a tremendous speed.  It was about the size of my baby finger-nail held at arm&apos;s length. It&apos;s altitude must have been quite high, since there was absolutely no noise whatsoever, but it went from nearly the western horizon to the eastern horizon in a matter of 5 or 7 seconds.  I would have passed it off as a &quot;shooting star&quot; or small meteor, but the strange thing is that there was no tail, and it did not fly in a perfectly straightward path. It seemed to meander slightly as it shot from west to east, like an bee flying from one flower to another.  Have you heard of anything else like this?  Thank you.  Sincerely,  ((name deleted))", "I saw 3 separate red lights flying together-went in a semicircle then went up at the same speed and disappeared.I was out feeding my horse and it was dark outside. I looked up and to the right and saw 3 red lights flying overhead. The size was about 2-3 times the size of the stars. They flew to the left in a semi circle but not in any sort of formation. They drifted randomly amongst themselves/not too far from one another. As they circled left, I heard the hum of what seemed to be an engine or motor. I kept watching them and as the circle was about halfway complete they went up at the same speed. I kept watching, I was thinking to myself &quot;if these things dissappear, I&apos;m going to ((be very surprised))..&quot; and that&apos;s exactly what they did. My sister then came outside wondering why I was taking so long. To be honest, I never asked how long I was out there to know if it was longer than I recall.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I assumed it was a balloon, but when I realized it was sitting stationary while the clouds were moving past it, I reached over for my binoculars.  Through the binoculars, the object appeared as a shiny silver metallic sphere that seemed to &quot;pulsate&quot;.  It began to move against the wind current, pulsated for a few moments while it hovered in the same spot, and then suddenly disappeared.  I&apos;ve never seen a balloon pulsate and hover, so I figured I&apos;d report this event.", "Jet chasing object over Los Alamos National LabsI have been camping outside of Los Alamos.  Last night I couldn&apos;t sleep and was laying in my sleeping bag looking up.  I had just seen a shooting star a few minutes earlier and so was watching the sky carefully.  The event started by my seeing what I first thought was a satelite.  Very shortly after though, I heard the roar of a jet plane.  I have been camping here for several months, so I&apos;m familiar with the jets that normally pass over the area.  This jet was excessively lowd and I was confused for a second.  Then the jet came out from behind a tree and I could see that it was following the &quot;satelite&quot; which I could now see clearly was at a low altitude.  The light and the jet had both come from the west and had apparently just cleared the mountains west of Los Alamos.  The object and jet maintained the exact same distance for the entire time of the incidence.  They both flew directly over the lab and much lower than any aircraft I had previously witnessed. It looked as if they were tied together, since the distance between them never varied.  The light in front continued to look like a satelite the entire time, while the jet had it lights on and was clearly blinking and showing its normal lights.  I looked at the object as it went by and couldn&apos;t see any shape and couldn&apos;t tell how big it was.  The jet was obviously &quot;after&quot; it.  There was no sonic boomb, so the two objects were going less than the speed of sound, however they were moving much faster than the commercial jets which fly over often.", "Slow moving gold coloured boomerang shaped craftI was driving when I noticed a shape, something like a boomerang, just below the level of the moon. It was quite a distance away, as it was only moving on the horizon as much as the moon. The object was a gold-yellow colour, and &apos;pointing&apos; upwards. As I drove along, checking it&apos;s progress, it moved slowly upwards, until it was about three &apos;moon lengths&apos; above the moon.At this point I looked away, to see where I was driving, and when I looked back, it had disappeared. The whole incident took perhaps a quarter of an hour.", "Triangles seen flying in thin layer of clouds.Hello.   I want to come forward with a complete report of my sightings which occurred on 3/1/01 at 04:50. I am a construction contractor, 43 years old and have lived at ((town deleted)), Oregon all of my life. I spend much time out doors, camping out hiking and star gazing. My home elevation is 1100 feet and I see passenger jets fly over all the time. (and military) I see them fly over in various cloud formations and at night I have studyied them with their fog lights on, rays pointing downwards at the forward angle. The luminance is yellow in the cloud ceiling and one inch long at arms length. During the day, passenger jets average 1/4&quot; to 1/8&quot; inch at arms length. The speed of the passenger jets is quite slow. The object I saw that early morning was 2&quot; inches at arms lenght and was moving fast in the ceiling at about eleven thousand feet. I saw the clouds passing under it and the brightness was like a white sixty watt flourescence with a hue of blue. And a faint red was glowing at the center through the mist. I heard no sound, it was traveling North with one light in the forward position. The three lights were about 3/8&quot; inch in diameter at arms length. After seeing this thing I immediately went out side with a flash light and saw to my West other lights at an angle of about 30 degrees. They were an odd arrangement of lights, 2&quot; inches at arms length. Small bright green lights one red, and I saw a white light not flash but pulse only once at the trailing end as it moved behind the tree tops. As it moved North, I heard a faint low rumble. I continued studying the sky and could see the brightest stars shining through the ceiling and there were small breaks in the clouds. I saw a triangle of lights directly over my head, 1 1/4&quot; inch at arms length, brighter than the other stars and I was suspicious of this and watched them for about 15 seconds when suddenly a bright flash occurred at the center of the triangle. all three lights just blinked out. I studyied the sky for about a half hour after that, but saw no oth! er movin g objects. At day break I noticed the clouds to be at about eleven thousand to thirteen thousand feet above the surrounding mountains.

It was a warm evening, and the lake was very calm.  I began my patrol starting in at the east gate, where we - security was ordered, and then continued on thorough the patrol in the company van.  The sky was clear and starry, and I could see where the sun had set beyond the horizon line, northwest of where I was driving along the shoreline road provided.  After I made it past the horseshoe pond on the east end of the plant&apos;s outside area, I began heading toward the west end of the plant, checking designated spots along the way.  Once I made it to the west end of the plant near the fence and public park next door, I checked around a bit and saw that nothing was wrong.  At that point, the ufo had not yet appeared.  So after I turned the van around and began to backtrack my route, I came around the west end of the roadway at the sharp turn on the west end of the plant and headed eastward, when a bright light over the lake caught the corner of my eye.  I stopped to see what it was, and there was this weird craft hovering over the water at approximately two hundred yards off shore, and about one hundred and fifty feet or so above the water.  It was super bright white and very quiet, having seven straight pertrusions coming off of the rectangle center of the craft.  Each pertrusion was exactly the same length and thickness, and each one pointed in a different direction.  For a moment, I thought it was someone playing a trick on me, so I got scared and rolled up my window.  Finally, after three minutes of watching this thing do nothing, I began to continue on with my patrol.  So I started moving the van with my foot still on the break.  I moved it about fifteen or twenty feet before I decided to stop and take one last look at the object.  When I did, it was gone!  Then I really got suspicious and began looking around the water and the pier below the cliff that I was driving! along, when I noticed something moving around by the rocks almost near the shoreline.  I saw a long black semi-cylinderical shaped object moving around down there, that turned around showing a bright white football shaped light directly toward me, as if it were looking at me.  Then suddenly, the thing turned around again, pointed upward, and darted off into the northeast sky, vanising into the stars within three seconds after it took off.  It never once made any sound or expelled any streams of fuel gasses.  After that, for about two weeks my mind was in total confusion.  I couldn&apos;t sleep, I couldn&apos;t take my mind off of the thing at all.  Even to this day, I think about it and watch the night skies.  The following year, some friends and I went back to that approximate spot to see if any other alien crafts would come down; but we had no luck.", "Bright yellowish disk objectI am still having continous observations of some type of craft.

I turned around just to see if any of our freinds might have been walking behind us. There weren&apos;t any. When I turned around I couldn&apos;t help noticing a huge triangular object in the sky kind of comming up behind us. I yelled at mt freind in awe and said something like &quot;LOOK&quot;! He said, what is it? I said something in the terms of, It&apos;s gotta be a UFO!! The object was &quot;huge&quot;, atleast one hundred feet or more tip to tip. It made no sound what so ever and was fairly evenly lit by a bright light on each corner. It hoovered above us as we watch it for quite a while and we decided to leave. It went in the same direction as we did so we ran to get home. I lived near the spot where we saw it. My freind went home the long way to avoid the object. When I got home, my mother asked why I was home so late and I said I didn&apos;t know. About 10 minutes later, my brother came in the door. He was at his girlfreinds house up the street. He said look, we saw this earlier. He and his girlfreind were laying in her yard just watching the stars and whatever else and he said a huge triangular object went right over them. High in the sky, of course. He described the exact same thing that I saw and he had a picture that he drew and it was, the exact same thing I saw. It was in the news papers the very next day. A lot of other people saw it too. My freind never remembered the incident when I saw him a couple of weeks later. I had night mares for years of being in a totaly white room with no corners, and a dark object would come closer and closer to me towards my face and then I would wake up. I was stressed for a long time for some reason and for years I was convinced it was from seeing the craft. I had a small round scar on my left legg that I could never explain. It looks like a vaccination mark now. I had my throat checked once for a problem I was having. The doctor went through my nose with a scope to go down to see my throat. He asked me through the course of the check up what did I get opporated on for in my nose. I said I never got an opperation in my nose. He said you had to and I replied, I would know if I did. I had my nose courtorized when I was a child but never an opporation. That was the end of the conversation. I&apos;m not saying I was abducted, but with all the things that happened to me, I sure thought about it. If I had the money, I&apos;d get a whole body scan just to check it out. I would like to say that I and other people I know and talk to, beleive in u.f.o.&apos;s. This is the reason I do. Also, about two years ago, I ran into! an old employer of mine at a store. We were looking for a good ufo movie and my old boss replied, I shouldn&apos;t tell you this, but I saw a u.f.o. years ago. Around 1970. He described the &quot;EXACT&quot; same thing we saw. And best of all, the same time frame. He lived behind the mountain where the school was located. He and his father saw the same one we did. Everything I mentioned here is 100% true. I&apos;m 47 now and was 16 then, I recall everything I mentioned as if it happened last night. There is no forgetting.

At about 10:35 pm, I spotted a large orange sphere on the south end of the lake heading north-northwest. The orange sphere had a hazy glow around it. There were also two bright greenish spheres moving wildy around the orange sphere. Note, I could see this clearly without optical aid. When I used my husband&apos;s binoculars, each bright greenish spheres looked like tiny v- shaped objects when they appeared in front of the orange sphere. When the bright greenish objects moved wildly on the sides and top of the orange sphere, they appeared to be spherical. I continued to watch with and without binoculars. There was a bright flash and the orange sphere split into 2. The bottom half appeared to have dropped to the ground and the top half disappeared. One green sphere headed to the north at a fast rate of speed and the other green sphere stayed in the general vicinity of where the orange sphere had been and seemed to move wildly around that area. I continued to watch the green sphere until 11:15 pm. The mosquitos were getting too bad for me so I went to the car.

Focusing on the object which was moving at a moderate clip at about 40K feet in a  N-NW  direction, I noticed it was a configuration of three bright spots, maybe lights, two in front and one in back. There seemed to be a blurry darker area surrounding this config. The sky was powder blue with only a minimum of high altitude vapor making very faint almost transparent clouds. I continued to follow it in its path and noticed that it was now looking like a sharply defined very bright, white in appearnce, angular bomerang shape with an equally bright spot in the rear.

I have a M.A. degree in history. I am currently employed as a manager of a hedge fund. I am also a writer of short stories and novels. My wife is a former filmmaker and an animal rights advocate. It was a clear evening at approximately 7:00. I was sitting on my back porch with my wife. We were talking, and I looked to the west. I noticed what appeared to be three or four seagulls flying in close formation towards us. The ocean is very close, and it is not unusual to observe sesagulls flying in the area. I have seen them many times in the past. However, this time I instinctively stood up to see better because they were flying at a very rapid speed. I remember remarking to my wife that they were flying much faster than seagulls were capable of flying. The objects flew within approximately a fifty feet of my house. I remember thinking that there must have been a very powerful sea breeze above us because the objects were so fast. I noticed that the objects were oblong with short wings (I am not sure about the wings) that did not move. As the objects whizzed past me, I was amazed by how rigid and metallic they looked. My wife still believes the objects were seagulls. She, however, did not notice them as soon as I did, and she did not stand up to really look until they had almost passed by. The entire time frame of the sighting from first seeing what I thought were birds to their flight past our house was maybe five-to-ten seconds. That&apos;s what I found so amazing because I first saw them a couple of blocks away coming from the direction of the ocean. Birds just do not move that fast, and they were so low in the sky, i.e., maybe fifty-to-hundred feet over roof tops, that I could clearly see them. The three or four objects, which were flying in a perfect, tight formation, were small but bigger than seagulls. I will never forget thinking how unusual it was for those birds to be moving so rapidly in such a tight formation without flapping their wings, and how awe! struck I was when they passed in front of me. They were metallic and looked like some kind of gliders that were on a mission. I remember thinking (my first thought when I noticed their metallic nature) that they were probably extraterrestrial reconnaissance flights surveying the city. I have always been a believer in the existence of alien life, and I have always wanted to see some evidence of it. Since it happened, I have had second thoughts about what it really was. However, it is something that I cannot dismiss because the experience stays with me, and the objects were metallic. I did run to the front of the house to see more after they passed by, but they had disappeared. I thought this unusual too because of the speed by which they disappeared. My eleven-year-old son, who was inside the house, heard me remark about them, and he ran to the front of the house before I did. He saw them for an instant, and he agrees that the objects were not birds, but rather some kind of solid objects that disappeared in a flash. Also, they made absolutely no noise, and I found that to be unusual considering the rate of speed at which the objects traveled. They passed within several feet of the front of my house. I certainly would have heard a noise if they made one. I must say that UFO experiences are very mystifying simply because they catch one offguard and happen so quickly. You do not have time to collect your thoughts.  Then, you experience self-doubt because what you&apos;ve seen violates the known laws of physics, traveling a distance of a half mile to one mile in seconds without any noise or observable means of propulsion. They looked to be gliding in a smooth pattern but at a very rapid speed. I cannot imagine how the objects I saw were man-made. They moved too fast, without any noise, without any engine glow, and without any exhaust. The three or four objects looked like highly polished silver/copper-colored oblong objects. They flew in perfect unison and moved very rapidly. I will never forget how amazed I was with the ! rich-loo king metallic appearance of the objects. It was a beautiful metallic color that I had not seen before. The objects looked very well-designed with an appearance of substance and strength. I am just now reporting this incident because it is something that I cannot forget. I often times think about how strange the metallic objects were, and I believe it is worthwhile reporting something that I consider to be other-worldly, especially after thinking about it for so long.

The light was tiny and it looked &amp; moved like a satellite in polar orbit, but the time of sighting would seem to preclude that possibility, as the sun has been down for some six hours. It &quot;came on&quot; slowly while moving directly south, increased in brilliance over about 1 second, stayed lit at around magnitude -2 to -3 for about another second, then dimmed &amp; vanished over the next second, never to reappear.  I tracked its projected course until my view was obstructed by the exterior wall of my own building, and did not see it light up again.  The color did not change, and no trails or tails were left behind. Once it dimmed out, it could no longer be followed. The apparent size was smaller than the head of a common pin held at arm&apos;s length.

One left a blue luminescent trail for a brief time.  This object was nothing like them.  The speed was all wrong, the direction of travel was wrong, and the color of the light wasn&apos;t a typical &quot;meteor&quot; color compared to any meteor I&apos;ve ever seen.

It hovered motionlessly in the air for most of the sighting, but occasionally drifted back and forth, and appeared to waver or change shape at one point. It may have been a black trashbag lifted by a thermal, but the shape seemed too symmetrical (except for the few seconds when it &apos;wavered&apos;, as if behind a heat wave).

The area of observation is near O&apos;Hare and Midway airports, and several jet aircraft were in the area flying in normal traffic patterns, for this time of day.  We noticed the object was flying nearly at the same altitude of the jet aircraft, but much faster.  The object all at once slowed down as a B-757 aircraft departed Midway airport, westbound and flew past our position.  We were amazed at this behavior, as if the object was observing the jet. The object then accellerated to the northeast and disappeared in a wink as a B-727 came into view from the east. The 727 entered the O&apos;Hare inbound traffic pattern, flying downrange and turning 180 degrees to begin a final approach. We stood  in disbelief to what we just witnessed.  It seemed that object was right on top of the 727 and then just vanished.

I am quite certain the object  was not a military or commercial aircraft. Based upon the following observations: 1) Aircraft operating in the area were distinguished by familiar physical characteristics, dark in appearance with wings, landing lights and anti-collision lights easily seen and flying in a pattern. 2) The object was a glowing, gold/orange cylinder with NO wings and NO tail section, it  changed speeds, and immediately vanished.

I had a clear, panoramic view of the sky.  Bright light (intensity of Haligen lights) moving from West to East.  DFW Airport is located approximately 20 miles from my point of view, so I thought it was an airplane since planes fly in the area all the time.  However, this light moved at the speed of a military jet. Suddenly the light came to a complete stop at about the two o&apos;clock position in the NW part of the sky. It was still much larger than a star with a brightness consistent with Haligen lights.  In a matter of minutes, it began to wane in size comparative with the stars around it.  As it got smaller, the white light appeared to pulsate with color.  I had binoculars with me and promptly used them for a better view.  This object, or whatever, twinkled and pulsated with red, green and white colors. At times it appeared to have a strobe effect.  I never took my eyes off of it and waited for it to make a move.

Move to New Hampshire!I am a bartender, (and a amateur ufoligist who has had at least 4-5 unexplainable sightings) and I was taking out the garbage from my shift on a patio bar for the night. It was bike week at Laconia N.H, so, there were alot of people around. Usually the main bar is buisier, but we had a band out in the back of the restaraunt so there was not one soul on the front deck. Anyways, while takeing the garbage out, I looked up in the sky, as I often do, and noticed a star that was unusually bright sitting next to venus, which sits in the same spot every night at that same time in the southern sky, or pretty close to it. The star seemed very bright and as I said to my self, &quot;boy, that&apos;s a weird star?!?&quot; the brightness came down to the normal stars surrounding it, ( which in New Hampshire in a dark part of town can be pretty spectacular for a boy growing up in the subburbs of chicago for most of his life!). At that moment the star, or what it at fist appeard to be, gradually sped strait up into the atmosphere. In other words, It ascended rapidly, but not to fast, into the sky as if saying, &quot; time to go!&quot; This is the second sighting I have wittnesed in this area. The first being a blue star sitting amongst the rest, and the speeding up into the atmosphere at an unimaginable rate of speed.

For 15-30 seconds or so, it sped across the clear sky in a straight line, leaving a substantial tail which dissipated fairly quickly as it crossed. At first I thought it was a Navy type flare that some yahoo had set off for a lark. It was the same size as such a flare and had the same velocity as those I have seen set off around here on New Year&apos;s Eve. However, the light was a very bright white, not orange or purple. After its rapid, soundless progress almost directly overhead, it disappeared from my view plane behind trees and a bright streetlight, having maintained its constant speed, trajectory, and brightness throughout. I have no idea what it could have been, though I suspect that it was a large meteor or a piece of space junk re-entering the atmosphere.

It was brilliant white, flickered somewhat and with the naked eye colors could be seen either rotating around the top or alternating flash sequences....green and red. I of course then watched it with the 200 mm zoom lens and called for my fiance ( an ardent skeptic) and watched through the zoom lens. It had a red and green revoloving light on top or near the top it emitted a bluish beam at various times and even released another smaller diamond shaped light from the side which travelled away from it. Neighbours were also out watching because i could hear them talking aand wondering what it was and of course my flash going off at 1:30 a.m as i took photos attracted attention. it just sat there really high almost like a star for over 30 minutes. A commercial aircraft i think flew by at one point in the general vicinity, it didn&apos;t seem to veer off or even notice the object, i think it may have been too high. My fiance agrees with the following....it was not an aircraft helicopter or any other aircraft it was not a star it definately rotated colors red and green it emitted a blue beam and hovered in spot for an extende period of time.

About 75 cars stopped on the highway to view the lights and 15 people in different locations who have noticed it independently of each other and called the Cartret police department. According to reports police officers themselves saw the lights as well. Whatever this was, it must have been very close to the ground, as only people at Pert Amboy, Raritan Bay, and Carteret NJ, but not in any other neighboring towns, saw it. The descriptions all point to orange redish radial self contained lights in a V and then Diamond shaped formation. This does not convincingly corespond to any possibility of projected light from the ground or Aurora Borialis as some suggested. It would be very interesting to know whether the coast guard or the Newark airport radars have picked up anything unusual at that time. It is also interesting to find out if any of the people heard anything at all while making this observation (such as a chopper or plane sound) especially considering the concluded low altitude of these lights. could we have a more articulated description of the sighting from anybody who saw it? What was the angle of the opening in the V shape? How far do people asses the lights along the sides where in relation to the end points of the V from each other?

I had identified several planets and constellations to my friend when I noticed a very fient triangular object in the southern sky.It really looked like dim stars on each point of a triangle and it was moving upward,very slowly.It stopped,then moved left,then up and out into space until I could no longer see it. It disappeared at my 1 o&apos;clock position as I faced south.I pointed it out to my friend as soon as I saw it and he confirmed that I was not crazy or seeing things. It was very fient and very large. I hope that we were not the only witness to this object.", "A grouing of 3 lights forming a triangle, one very large light at the top with 2 small ones at the base. Lights remained stationary.At 5:00 AM I took my dogs outside to do their business, the sky was totally clear and full of stars.  I live quite a ways from the city and there is very little light polution so I often look at the stars.  I was gazing at the stars and was drawn to the ENE sky by an extremely large light.  My first reaction was that it was the headlight of an airplane especially since it was in the direction of Cleveland Hopkins airport.  The main light was so large it  amazed me, It was the size of a cars headlight when viewed in oncoming traffic.  Along with the main light were two other lights more star sized, with the main light they formed a triangle with the two smaller lights at the bottom.  I watched this grouping of lights for at least 15 minutes trying to figure out what they were.  I concluded they were not airplanes as they did not move or change size.  The lights did not twinkle like stars so I thought possibly  they were planets, but the odd arrangement and the extremely large light did not make sense.  I often look at the stars and am familuar with most of the constellations so to see this in the sky continues to puzzle me.", "Every one must read this!!!!Three what I thought were just bright stars, were settled at water level probabaly 50-100 miles out in the lake. I was on the beach when I witnessed it. They were all spaced evenly apart from eachother. The center one shot strait upward probably 50 miles, at a great speed. I could tell it was moving faster than any plain possibly could. It stood still for a few seconds till the other one to the left moved upward to. The center craft did a zig zag pattern while moving down the shorline and covered what must of been a few hundred miles making very destinctive zig zag patter in less than a second or to. The third stood very still and then shot strait up very fast and than just simply dissapeared. I could see the first moving object turn sideways and is appeared to be spinning in place. The lights on then at the time were just white. They all went under the horizon. And did&apos;nt come back for probably two minnutes. But the one appeared again. Making very sharp, sudden , and fast manuvers up and down. I truely don&apos;t believe plain&apos;s can move like these objects were. I returned to the beach the next night. Thinking I would&apos;nt see anything. Much to my supprise i saw a very bright light in the exact same spot i had seen them the night before. And the light satarted doing the same sharp, fast up and down movements as the others. In these same spot! With in a few minnutes 5 plains started moving tword the very low flying object. At this point the object started to have very un- even flashes of light and moved north and dissapeared into the land. Still flying very, very low. The night before a half hour after they were seen a helicopter with a very bright spotlight was flying in the area where i had seen them, shining all over as if they were looking for something- yet there was nothing on the cb radio-at all! I&apos;m not lie or exagerating the least bit. I mean come on why would i sit down for the past hour and write till my hands hurt if i did&apos;nt see anything. Everyone who witnessed these objects were sober as could be. I never really believed, but now there is&apos;nt a doubt in my mind. If any one else saw these objects Aug.13th and 14th please feel free to e-mail me.

It was moving so quickly that I wasn&apos;t sure I had seen anything at all (maybe my imagination ?) until another one flew in front of my truck. This one I saw as kind of a still picture for an instant: they were about the size of a softball and had an orange glow. They were flying parallel to the ground at about three feet because I remember thinking how glad I was that they didn&apos;t hit the little Isuzu truck because they were going so fast that they would have went clean through both doors and me. I always thought they were meteors and maybe they were, but wouldn&apos;t they be falling towards the ground instead of moving parallel ? Of course, I only saw them for a split second so maybe they were.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I caught a glimps of something moving from the corner of my eye.When I turned to look at it, I saw a triangular shape moving slowly at about a 45 degree angle. It seemed to be rather close, as I could make out the dark edges against the starry background. If I recall correctly, the object had three lights , one on each point of the triangle. The object made no sound. I immediatly called to my friend to ask if he was seeing what I was. He had not seen it, but just then we both saw something. This one was different. It looked only like a point of light, no noticeable shape. We saw several objects of this kind. They were more over head of us, and moved to the west&#x5C;southwest. Some moved at incredible speeds, zigging and zagging across the sky. While others moved in what appeared to be a formation. First came four in a row, then six then eight. Some even looked as though they split in two. After about 20 min. of this we both spotted a triangle- shaped object, this one right over us, we could see lights on the bottom side. The lights seemed to change  color, from red to orange and white. It was very peculiar. We watched this go on for hours, or necks grew tired from cocking them back to see, so we layed down. I remember the clock was at 4:20 when I went in to bed. This was the third sighting I&apos;ve experienced. In April of the same year,I watched a trianlgle-shaped craft silently fly across the sky in front of me. It had three lights. I was with a different friend, on the same deck. And once before a couple of years earlier, I would have been 18, so that was 1994. It was in spring, this one was like the triangular ones, but much higher. It moved horizontaly for a moment, before shooting upwards at a fantastic speed until I could no longer see it. Again I heard nothing. Neither I, nor my friend know just what we&apos;ve seen. Could have been military. Who knows what they were, but they were not like anything I! have ev er seen before or since.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The lights were in a triangle with two on the left and one forming the triangle shape on the right.  As it moved across the sky it blotted out the stars so it was easy to determine the shape of the craft.  There was a constant droning noise, not very loud as it moved. The craft probably stayed with that shape for about 3-4 minutes as it moved into the south, at which time the light on the right hand side started to move away to the right from the craft.  The two lefthand lights stayed together and followed their original path.  The light on the right disappeared, the other two lights stayed together until they were lost to sight.", "Glowing red object flying across sky ten times faster then jet!!!!!!appeared like a star only reddish-orange, thought it might be an airplane at first only it moved very fast across the eastern sky, from north to south and then met up with two other &quot;stars&quot; and traveled back from south to north. I am writing this for my husband and I saw it myself, it moves very quickly across the sky, it looks like an air plane at first but it moves at least ten times faster and it switched from N. to S.

I was driving down a road in the county coming home from a late night at work, when I thought I saw some lights over the trees in the distance.  I did not think too much about it, because I knew I was near the airport.  So I drove on for about 2 more miles, listening to my scanner.  Suddenly the channels started changing rapidly and the damn thing went nuts. Static, squeals, etc...  I was about to reach down and turn the thing off when the engine on my van quit.  The lights went out, and I rolled to a stop on the side of the road.  I tried and tried but the van would not start.

Every hair left on my head stood straight up. Like when a baloon is rubbed on your head.  I heard a really loud noise, then nothing.  The van started, the scanner started too.  I had no idea what had happened, but I was tired and decided to go on home. When I got home, all the lights were out.  I went in and asked my wife why she went to bed so early. She said &apos;Early? It&apos;s 12:30!&apos;.  Well I nearly fell over. I checked my watch and it said 10:45! I got really concerned that I had blacked out or something, but I have no history of this.

I then saw another very small bright light amongst the stars and it moved across the sky in an arc, not a straight line.  That was followed by another, then another almost as if they were chasing each other.  The next few that I observed zig zagged across the sky changing speed and direction.  Then I observed a formation of four to five, lined up across from one another with one slightly ahead as if it was the leader.  These lights are all very small, bright and appeared and dissappeared very quickly.  The formation appeared, flew in an arc-shaped pattern then vanished.  This is when I became very concerned as I knew the possibility that what I saw was natural was about zero now.  I made my girlfriend come outside, after a minute she poointed up and said &quot;is that one?&quot;  I looked up and a light was very quickly moving across the sky in a very tight arc shape.  She became frightened and went inside.  I stayed and saw more of these lights.  The last one I observed before it clouded up was travelling toward me (due west) then suddenly sped off in the opposite direction, very quickly.

From my back yard, looking north-west, I was taking a look at Mars which in recent months has been very bright.(I&apos;m in the southern hemisphere remember). There was about one half of the moon showing and the night sky was virtually clear of cloud cover. As I stood watching, a light appeared out of nowhere at about the one-o&apos;clock position, travelling east-west, and probably 80 degrees up from the horizon. It travelled to about the ten-o&apos;clock  position and changed direction, without changing speed, and headed north. After a few seconds heading north it faded out, just the way it had faded in; like someone using a light dimmer switch. Now just a few more details: The colour of the UFO was a uniform yellow-orange glow. There were NO flashing lights as per conventional aircraft. An &quot;arrow-head&quot; form was discernible behind the glow. In size it appeared about 4-5 times larger than Mars appeared that night (it actually crossed close to my view of Mars so this was easy to judge). When it changed direction it did not change speed or bank into the turn, (it was like it bounced off a wall at right-angles!!!). It did not appear to change altitude during the time I observed it. Its altitude was difficult to judge but I would say at least 12-15,000 feet. Its speed was much faster than I have seen any aircraft travel yet slower than a meteor,(&quot;falling star&quot;). It had no &quot;tail&quot; like a meteor. There was no sound associated with the event that I could hear. It was moving as it faded in and out; that is I could see it moving before it reached its maximum brightness and I could still see it moving as it dimmed to invisible. I have seen numerous UFOs over the years but this is the first one that impressed me so much that I felt I had to make the effort to report it to someone.(Someone who wouldn&apos;t laugh anyway). I have scientific training (analytical chemist) and I&apos;m well read in areas of physics and astronomy. I can with confidence rule out that I saw any of the following on this occasion: a conventional aircraft, space debris, meteor, satelite, space shuttle, space station (esp MIR), balloon,(weather, hot air or other), searchlight, flare, fireworks.

The object appeared to me to be squarish and a yellow orange color with very faint red spots of light surrounding it.  I heard no noise.  The object traveled in a straight line across the sky, not speeding up or slowing down.  It was a very clear night, with a nearly full moon.

With a normal clear sky I would have never seen this object. It was slowly moving from north to south with a slight oscillating wobble about the vertical central axis.

At this time the circular object was to north of us.  After panning across the sky it dimmed as if someone had switched off a light and then became very small again and headed to the west.  After 20 to 30 minutes, my friend began to flash his flashlight upward to the sky overhead, wher I noticed to the south the same object, but much lower, repeating the signal back.  I told the other two and they confirmed this.  The light was larger and fairly closer this time.  Afterwards, it returned to the sattelite size and shot again to the west.  After becoming upset, we loaded up the truck and went back to Lewistown.  My friend riding in the back of the truck noticed the object again as we were leaving. He said it repeated a similar action to those of before. Each time the light was very bright, and much brighter than any star or planet in the sky.  It even outshone Jupiter which was clearly visible in the sky.  There were no clouds that evening to block our view.

I can remember red, white and green lights. I was so shocked, that I just sat there in the road. It hovered for a few minutes over a hickory tree which was alongside of our drive.  I wouldn&apos;t get out of my car, but I asked my oldest son (who was 12 years of age, where the object was and he said it was just stationary over our car.

I observed the object for approximately 8 seconds. My view was blocked for about 1 second by a tree in my yard. The object traveled at a steady rate of speed and appeared not to veer from its southern course. I could not determine its altitude. There was no sound during or after the object passed over my location. The object was the shape of an equilateral triangle, dark in color (slightly darker than the night sky), with what appeared to be dim off-white lights under each corner facing downward. The &quot;lights&quot; on each corner reminded me of the new round LED brake lights used on trucks and buses. The lights were steady in brightness and did not flicker or pulse. After the oject had passed, I wondered why an aircraft would have such lights mounted on the underside. Maybe they weren&apos;t lights. Perhaps this was the visible effects of propulsion.....I don&apos;t know. As a size reference, after the sighting, I cut out a &frac12;-triangle from a piece of paper.

We arrived in the middle of the night and our parents chose to leave us sleeping in the back rather than bring us in. I remember waking up to a very bright blinking light and waking my sister up to tell her I thought maybe Dad was outside swinging a lantern or something. I sat up to look and saw this huge light. It was shaped long and oval sort of like a saucer, hovering between  our two barns. It no longer blinked, but glowed like a giant light bulb. I immediately yelled for my sister to look. She becamed very frightened. We layed down and held on to each other until we woke up in the morning. We told out parents and our Mom told us how she had seen a bright light, but didn&apos;t think anything of it until know she realized the house is about 1/2 mile from the road with nothing behind it, but woods for miles.

As I did this, the tiny star type light grew in intesity until it was brighter then any other star in the sky. By this time, my brother easily saw it.

Then, as we watched, the object made a cloud around itself. At first the cloud was light and then became darker and darker until everything vanished. I put 9:30pm but I am not sure about the exact time. We swim a lot after dark and our development is close to an airport. We see planes going and coming. This was not anything we are familiar with. What really got our attention was that this object never moved. The light came on but did not shine all the way to the ground like a helicopter.

We were driving from Minnesota to New Jersey, and I believe it would have been I-80 or I-90 that we were traveling on in Ohio. The incident occurred in Ohio while driving on the highway in a very isolated area.  My husband was driving, and myself, sister and daughter were sound asleep in the car.  My husband said that it had been hovering along side of us in the car for quite a while, and he was stunned by it to the point he couldn&apos;t speak to wake me up.  Finally, when he hit me in the leg to wake me, I instantly sat up and saw this thing with bright lights.  If I remember correctly, it was an open isolated area with open fields around it and I would guess that it was hovering along the highway over the field. It was incredible, and I was so excited I wanted to get the camera but it was in the trunk.  I jumped toward the back seat to awaken my sister who sat up to see it.  It was as though once we were all awake and saw it that it moved behind the car over the highway and hovered behind us.  It was as though it knew we were all aware of its presence.  I looked ahead to see an overpass approaching where I wanted to stop so I could get my camera.  When I looked back, it was gone.  My husband said that it flew away in the blink of an eye.  My sister was traumatized by it, and even at 28 years old will start crying when the subject is brought up.  I don&apos;t think my daughter remembers it at all. The strange part of it also was that my husband was driving down the highway the entire time fixated on this UFO and not even paying attention to the road, yet he kept the car perfectly straight.  The time was asked above, and I can only say that it was a couple of minutes from when I had been awakened.  My husband on the other hand, said that it had been following him for quite a while...  Even though my sister and myself were sound asleep, it was so incredibly huge and bright that the second we opened our eyes we saw it right there in front of us.  There was no pointing to look at any object, you could not miss it. It had extremely bright lights, but I do not remember it having a &quot;plasma&quot; appearance as described in some sightings.  I believe that the pictures that described it that way was a result of the camera or the fact that it was moving very fast that made it appear to look blurry.  It was approximately the size of a football stadium. I called the (800)SIGHTINGS number to report it and left a message, and if they have record of my call you could determine the date that this took place.  They never called me back.  It was a couple of months after our sighting that I reported it. In summary, I have to say that when I was looking for my camera and considering pulling over...that the only other thoughts that were going through my head were if we stop under this bridge so I can get the camera out of the trunk...will they abduct us.  They really were that close that I was starting to get worried and why they were following us like that... FYI...  My cousin, ((name delted)), who sits on the International ((deleted--aviations organization)) (or something like that), referred me to this website to report it after a family gathering where it came up in conversation.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

School went into recess for a month to allow students to participate in the potato harvest (in the northeastern tip of Maine).  My best friend and I were &quot;picking potatoes&quot; one afternoon and as I was taking a breather I noticed a silver disk slowly skimming across the top of a narrow strip of trees about one-eighth of a mile away.  I didn&apos;t hear any noise at all and did not observe any lights. It was not rotating. I said to my friend, &quot;Look at that!&quot;  It continued on its path just above the swath of trees until we could no longer see it.  I observed this object for about 10 seconds.  My friend and I both decided to do an oral English report on our sighting, but he backed out and I ended up doing it alone.  I got the whole spectrum of reactions. Loring Air Force Base was in the immediate vicinity, about 5 miles away.  I grew up watching all kinds of planes fly through our rural skies (including B-52s).  This thing was nothing like what we were used to seeing flying out of Loring.  I&apos;ve always felt that it was extraterrestrial.  That was the strong impression I had at the time.  I have come to believe that this craft was scoping out Loring A.F.B.  There was an incident, called &quot;The Loring Incident&quot; which occurred in 1975 wherein discs of unknown origin hovered over Loring&apos;s nuclear weapons depot unchallenged, 5 feet off the ground; it resulted in about a dozen more Air Force Bases nationwide being put on a heightened state of alert. I had another sighting in July 1972 in the same general area.  I was laying on my back on the high-dive of a camp pool on a cloudless Maine night.  The stars are so clear and thick on these Maine nights that you feel you can reach out your hand and scoop out a bunch of them with your hand.  Zero urban light interference. What I saw was a medium-bright &quot;star&quot; in the night sky that zig-zagged down the horizon, paused, and then retraced its path to where I had first seen it move.  Then it faded to black and that was the end of it.  This lasted about 15 minutes.  Again, this UFO was, in effect, if not in actuality, directly over Loring A.F.B. Loring A.F.B. was the SECOND air force base to store atomic warheads. (The first was in New Mexico where the bomb was developed.) I had a third sighting in West New York, New Jersey, in March, 1997 (across the Hudson River from New York City).  At sunset I looked out a window facing south and saw a bar of bright light suspended in the sky; it did not move.  I looked at it through my 10-power binoculars.  It looked like pure energy.  No surface or texture of any kind was visible, just this blazing cylinder of golden-white light.  It was beautiful. It was three times as long as it was wide.  It was hanging in the sky at an angle, not straight up and down. I watched it for about 30 minutes and then had to get some sleep before going to work that night.  When I woke up later it had gone.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Both lights where equal distance apart,(about one and a half fingers apart at arms length) red in color and about the size of a star. The lights also had a strange pulsation to them. The lights would fade in and out, but would not fade compleatly. I asked for my wife an my sister to hurry and come out and see this. We stood out on the driveway watching the lights for about a minute and a half untill we could not see them anymore. After we lost sight of them, we went back in the house. I then started to write down the time and any relevant information. I asked my wife and sister what they saw to verify my notes. That is when I found out that the color of the lights were red, because I am color blind.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length over the telephone with this individual, and we found him to be a quite credible witness.  Satellites do not course from east to west, except in very rare occasions.  Also, given that the object was moving from left to right, as seen by the witnesses, had it been an aircraft, the two female witnesses, who presumably have normal color perception, would have seen a green light, not a red light.  Standard lighting conventions on aircraft and vessels require a red marker light on the port (left) side of the craft, and a green light on the right (starboard) side.

At about 2pm, looking south out over the harbor at the south shore of milwaukee on a clear, sunny afternoon on 4/7/97, I noticed what looked like either an extremely relective object or the other alternative would be to describe it as a large ball of sparks descend from the sky, move along the tree line north to the south shore harbor where it descened further, skimmed across the water a short distance and then either descended into the water or simply burned out.    As I was trying to figure out what I had seen, I noticed another object which looked the same, perform almost the exact same manuvuer. Then, in rapid succession I observed 2 or 3 other objects do the same thing. I have NEVER seen anything that looked like or manuvuered like this in my life.   The two most unusual aspects of the sighting were:  1.) The very odd look of the objects  2.) the way they cruised so closely (almost touching) the tree tops in a very populated area and then go in the water?!The closest explaination I can come up with is,  that possibly they were flares, except for the fact that flares don&apos;t manuver over tree tops like that and why would they be shot over a populated area in broad daylight??

We; myself and 3 or 4 other surfers heard an aircraft overhead and we spotted at about 750 to 1,000 ft. a triangular craft pure black no markings and very thin approximately 3 ft. thick. It was silent.  What we heard was above it a twin engine civilian craft that looked as though it was &quot;checking out&quot; the triangle.  The triangle was the shape of a hang-glider but rigid wings and had two small approx 2ft. propellers at the trailing edge of the triangle about 2-3 feet from each of the two points at the rear.  As the triangle was only going about 40 mph the twin engine overtook it quickly and as the triangle went inland over the land without a change in altitude the twin engine that was about 750 ft. above the triangle banked off.  The triangle kept going inland. It went right over our heads and was flying level and was not gliding.  It was under power as proven by its level and slow flight for a long time.  It was not an equalateral triangle but had a trailing edge that was smaller than the leading edges.  It looked unmanned as it was very thin and if a man had been lying down inside of it it would have been very cramped as the total thickness looked to me about 2 feet.  I mentioned the sighting to the other surfers out there with me and I said what the heck was that? One replied a &quot;stealth&quot; obviously referring to the stealth bomber or the stealth fighter of which I have seen both in flight doing a couple of fly bys at a Stockton, CA airshow a few years ago.  This was way smaller than the stealth bomber and fighter and was very small.  I spoke to a family relative who worked at Lockheed Missiles and space in LA at the skunk works for several years and he said that the drones they were working on had wooden propellers 2 ft. long made by a local civilian.  The question is why would the military fly a craft over civilians in mid-day at such a low altitude and go over su! rfers a known surfing spot and then go over land?  There was no attempt to hide it. I reported it to the FAA at the Monterey airport and the air traffic controller said to me that if I spotted it again to please let him know.

This is a big barn, with two sliding doors on the front, each about 15 ft. tall, and 7 ft. wide.  I leave the doors open during the summer so air can cirulate.  When I walked in the was a thing floating over top of a cow.  I&apos;ll try to describe it.  It was about the size of a tire, but square, and angled down on all of it sides.  It looked about 8 in. thick, and maybe 3 ft. wide, and it was black with some kind of grey markings on it.  The thing actually looked kind of beatup.  When I walked in, the thing just floated there for a couple of seconds, then went over my head, and out the door. It didn&apos;t go real fast over me, but I don&apos;t know where it went once it got outside, and it didn&apos;t make any noise.  I looked a good while for it, but never saw it again.  I went back inside the barn to check on my cattle, they go in and out, that&apos;s where they water at, and found the cow that the thing was floating over.  She looked and acted alright, but I found a place on her ear that looked like she had been poked with a needle or somthing.

The craft looked as though it was not that large, meaning, the size of a truck. It seemed to refect the sky on the top, and more dark on the bottom half. It was not high at all, as far as my view, a half mile ahead, it looked like it was maybe a hundred feet over the highway. If I were to hold out my arm and clench my fist, the object would be about half the size of my fist. No one else, as far as I could see, saw the object. But, because I love looking into the sky, (FOR UFO&apos;S) I am more alert to the stranger objects then most people. This was not a plane, not a bird, not a helecopter. The object kind of teetered back and forth as it went pass. Almost out of control. I have seen ufo&apos;s many times, this was the second time that a UFO was within a hundred feet from the ground.

It had very faint amber aura on the leading edge and was blackish/brown in color...very difficult to see unless looking directly at it. It appeared to be huge, dwarfing any aircraft that I have ever seen flying, cruising high (est. 10,000+feet), moving swiftly and silently in a straight line. It covered alot of arc in the sky in a brief time, I saw it for about 10 seconds.

To my friend (who wears glasses and has rather poor eyesite) it looked to be in the distant sky. To me (with very good vision) it looked like it was much closer than a star, like maybe a mile or so back in the woods, over the trees, but still small. Of course, it&apos;s hard to tell. The second night there were two of them. These did look far away. One in the west, and one in the north sky. Again, these were moving back and forth and in little circles.

The only thing is, none of the other &quot;stars&quot; were moving, regardless of their brightness or position.((NUFORC Note;  We observe that the description is not inconsistent with a celestial body, a star or a planet.

Behind the light was a trail (vapor?). The object was a size I have never seen before. It would appear to have been over either the Garden State Parkway or the New Jersey Turnpike. These highway systems at thes point are about 5-8 miles apart. At a point the object and the vapor simply disappeared. It was as though someone simply turned off a light switch and a room went dark.

Directly after this, I noticed that not only was I seeing and object, I was seening 3 points of light triangular in shape moving at the same speed and never getting any nearer or further from each other. This entire object or group of objects was moving to the south-east at a very steady pace only seeming to get slower as it neared the horizon.  All three lights seemed to be the same in intensity as well as size.  If these were seperate objects, they must have been at least 700 to 800 miles apart if not more.  It was about a 2 finger widths distance the hand measure.  I went inside and told my friend that he needed to come see this and He saw the same thing for about 20 more seconds before a gradual decrease in brightness caused the object/s to not be visable.  It would be important to note here that the decrease in brightness happened about 18-20 deg above the horizon.  I have heard of Geo Syncronized Satelites and geo-stationary as well. I am assuming that Geo Syncronized means several satelites are syncronized to do work like global mapping and such.  To do such work effectively would take at least 3 satelites to triangulate a position to be compared to the ground ;ie (temprate rainforest studies) and so on.  This might be the most logical explaination to my sighting and to a another reported sighting that was in May-Englewood California. Please let me know what you are thinking on this.

The light was white in color and became visible while it traversed horizontally, so as to become visible from behind a set of trees. While moving, it was at least three times brighter than the lights of a commercial jet coming straight at you. As it moved just beyond the tree line, it slowed and concurrently so did its lumination. Its light source appeared to close in around itself to a dot, then no luminousity could be seen. This sighting lasted about 10 seconds, with myself, my father and my girlfriend as witnesses.

We stopped between Cle Elum and Ellensburg at the Indian John Hill rest stop for lunch.  While having lunch I was looking north toward the Mt Stuart range.  I watched a jet airliner pass across my field of view eastbound above the mountains.  Looking upward at about 45 degrees to see if I could spot another plane I noticed a chevron-shaped formation of small silver blobs.  I was wearing polarized sunglasses and could just barely distinguish the lighter silver of the blobs from the blue of the sky.  I removed my sunglasses to see if I could see the formation better but without the sunglasses,  I could not see it at all.  Putting my sunglasses back on I could once again see the formation but it was becoming more difficult as it moved northward toward the horizon.  I guickly handed my sunglasses to my wife and asked if she could see anything.  She could not and then my daughter insisted on a look.  By the time I had my sunglasses back, I could no longer find the formation.  In all I probably only saw the formation for ten to 15 seconds at somewhere between 1:20 and 1:30 PM PDT I am unsure how may silver blobs made up the formation, I would guess either seven or nine &amp;#8211; one at the point and then either three or four in each trailing arm.  While the chevron pointed west, the movement appeared to be to the north. At first I assumed this was a flight of geese but there was no shifting of position or movement.  The formation remained rigid.  I also thought it could be a formation of high flying military jets and cannot fully rule this out.  I was however struck by the consistent pattern of the formation, how none of the silvery blobs shifted in relation to all the others.  And of course I am intrigued that without the polarized sunglasses, the formation was essentially invisible.", "((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.  Pd))Object resembling airplane light blinked in random patterns, moved strangely, then very quickly for a sec., turned red and dissappearedFour of us (3 guys and one girl)  were sitting on a beach (Sheffield&apos;s cove) in Jamestown, at night, and one of my friends said, &quot;I thought that airplane over there was a firefly.&quot;  So we all looked in the direction of the airplane, and sure enough it looked like an airplane flying in the distance, pretty far off.  (It was a small light)  We all thought it was funny our friend would mistake an airplane for a firefly.   It caught our interest, and we all kept staring at the &quot;airplane&quot;. It was blinking, more like pulsing,  a white light, and it was pretty dim, and there was no repetitious pattern to the pulsing, it was a completely random order.  It would blink a bit, then not blink for a few deconds, then blink a few times rapidly, and so forth, and something about it seemed odd to everyone there.  (Except one of us, who we later discovered was looking at a real airplane in the sky, and thought we were nuts. We realized he was looking way to the left of the object were staring at) I couldn&apos;t figure out if the object was moving or not, it seemed to remain motionless, but then i made the suggestion out loud to compare it to the tree level to see if it is moving right or left.  The trees were pretty far away, and there was an inch of sky between the object and the tree line from where we sat.  (You know what I mean)   So we all (except for the guy who wasn&apos;t looking in the right direction) were in agreement that it was moving to the right a bit.  But then it seemed like it was back where it had been.  We watched this thing for a few minutes, debating whether we were hallucinating or if was really was moving from side to side like this, but never the less something seemed very strange about it.  Then it obviously moved higher in the sky, before dropping back down and to the right in a very quick motion, so fast that it left a trail in our vision. It had moved about an inch to the right in the sky.  Then it was motionless again, while the three of us were all kinda freaking out and &quot;did you see that?&quot;  sorta stuff.  Then it sank below the trees, reappeared about 20 seconds later, just above the tree line, when it changed from a white light to a pulsing red light.  Then it sank back down and was gone.

Northeast slightly.((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS:  I already submitted the report, but I left out the date and time, which is important I assume.  Also, it was a very clear night outside, and yes there were airplanes in the sky that night, one flying at the same time as the object we saw, this being the plane the 4th person was looking at, thinking it was the object we were all bugging about.  He made no suggestion that the plane he was staring at was acting in any strange way.))", "Houston, Texas - Red pulsating light which &quot;dropped&quot; another light; disappeared in the skyI spotted a bright red light to the left of a star in the clear sky.  I dismissed it as a plane since it did not move in relation to the star within 5 minutes.  Another red light &quot;dropped&quot; from the light approximately 1 inch below the primary light and then disappeared.  The primary light moved to the right slowly during a 5 minute period.  I grabbed my video camera and tripod hoping that the zoom feature may shed some light on what was causing this bright red light.  During the next 10 minutes, I observed the light &quot;pulsating&quot;- growing brighter like a light on top of a tower to almost disappearing in the clear sky then brighter again.  The light then gradually moved up above the neighboring star (during several minutes) and then stayed still. The light would dim to almost nothing then appear again.  Eventually, after 45 minutes, the light disappeared.  Please note that the sky was clear, no clouds or wind, no rain, and the neighboring star remained constant and visible during the observation dismissing the possibility of clouds interfering with the brightness of the light.

We were camping out on the river by Salmon La Sac, Wa on Friday night.  It was a brilliant night, milky way very visible.   Sitting by the river in almost complete darkness, the moon had not risen yet, we noticed a very bright white ball hovering to the south of us.  Initially we thought it was venus, due to the fact it was due south, but when we cinally focused on it (2 minutes) it became apparent it was moving downward to the peak of this mountain. We then observed it after 1 minute, explode non-violently into two smaller spheres, and float around.  They moved toward the very top of the mountain when a craft appeared heading toward it. No noise, not fast, almost as if it was coming into land on or in it.   The craft was about the size of a bus from our vantage, as we could not really see the craft, we could only see the four lights under it.  None of the lights signified it as a airplane, as none were blinking.  The lights were 2x2 and were glowing a very magnificient orange. The craft got closer, to the two spheres, and they both went over the mountain, out of our view.  Then a second ship, identical to the first, made the same trajectory towards the location of the others, and almost zig zagged to manuever over the peak of the mountain. There were other sightings that evening from others at the camp, but this was the only one I was privy to. This location is far from any municipal or federal airport.

At the height of the event, it was moving  as fast as a jet across the sky and the head was very bright.  Suddenly the streak (tail) disapeared and about a second later apearred on the opposite side of the head (in a 10&apos;clock position).  At that moment it stopped moving downwards and seemed to stay in a relatively stable position moving slightly upwards again in the distance.  After this it just got smaller and smaller as it faded towards the horizon.  All in all this occurred between 9:05 and 9:25 pm with the most dramatic part being about 30 seconds.

I phoned the news stations when I got home, but although they said they had recieved calls about it, without camera footage they did not care.  In retrospect it seemed to have been a comet or meteor entering and exiting the atmosphere with the moment when the tail suddenly changed direction probably being the time when it was closest to the Earth (and land/water).  Actually scared the #*!@ out of me during that moment because it was so bright and fast (and probably a HUGE object up there).((NUFORC Note:  NUFORC received a telephone call from a Vancouver, B.C., radio station, reporting that witnesses had reported the event to them, too.

They were &quot;stacked&quot; directly above each other. The size would be comparable to the size of your thumb nail when held at arms length, each light appeared to be about 3 - 4 times their diameter apart. The objects were framed by the trees that lined both sides of the road in this area and they appeared to be about 1/4 mile above the ground. They almost appeared to be a ball of flame as I tried to figure out what they could be. We approached for about a half minute at which time I pulled over to the side of the road to get my camera from the trunk of the car. At that time the objects were about 1/4 to 1/2 mile away, but as I pulled over to the side of the road the objects moved straight up and the distance between each of the objects increased to about twice the previous distance.

At the same time keeping the same positions above each other. After retrieving the camera my friend and I watched the objects for about 3 minutes, unfortunatly the camera I had was one of these disposables and was really disposable as nothing turned out, to fast of a shutter I&apos;m sure. But when I started taking pictures with the flash the objects changed formation immediately and formed what resembled a perfect triangle on a horizontal plane with each light forming one corner of the triangle about 1/2 mile above the ground. We watched them for about another minute at which ti! me we de cided to proceed further down the road to try and find a better vantage point to view from. We moved about 1 mile down the road and came to a spot where the trees were a little further from the road, at no time did we loose sight of the objects.

Am I glad I saw your flash go off I knew you guys saw them as well. No airplane can fly like that in 90 degree corners. This was really wierding me out&quot;. At that time we got out of the car again and the lights began to rise more rapidly increasing speed as they got higher. And suddenly they were gone as if someone turned a light switch off, meaning they didn&apos;t rise and simply get out of sight.

My son and I were on our way home from work about 9:35pm, we both work in the &quot;rent to own&quot; industry. We were traveling south on Nova rd.,in Daytona Beach, Florida when all of a sudden my son, who was looking out the driver side window towards the east,said &quot;what the hell is THAT&apos;? I began to look out the windshield in the direction that he was and what I saw is VERY DIFFICULT to describe. I saw what appeared to be a single &quot;cloud&quot;, almost due east from our position. At what is best described as the top of the cloud was a single bright white light. My first thought was that it was an aircraft of some sort with it&apos;s landing light on, only the light was NOT moving, IT was stationary and there were NO other lights. As I watched, the cloud began to loose it&apos;s density, almost like it was fading away and it seemed to diviide down the middle, the light however, remained at the top of this divison and continued to stay stationary. I took my eyes off of it to check out the road ahead of us as my son was focused on on the phenomena and was not entirely focused on the road. I did NOT see this next part, as it happened when I took my eyes off IT to examine the traffic ahead of us. He (my son) claims that a part of IT OR a second light seperated from it and fell towards the earth. The location of the light was due east of Daytona and would have been over the ocean. MY second thought was that it was a rocket that had been fired from the &quot;Cape&quot;, but the light was WHITE and NO orange to be seen, besides it was too far north by position to have come from the Cape (due east, NOT south east). It was about this time that the &quot;cloud&quot; disappeared completely along with the light itself. The moon at this time was located to the west of us an played NO part of what we saw. As i reflected back, IT reminded me of how the moon sometimes &quot;peeks&quot; through clouds with just partial light being seen, but the moon as stated was no where near the phenomena. In MY 47 years, I have NEVER seen anything such as this.

Sometime around the year 1968 I was visiting my Grandparents in Scottsville, Kentucky for a while.  We would go outside and sit on my Grandparents porch practically every night to just talk and so on.  This particular night my Grandmother and I were sitting out on their front porch as usual talking.  Let me tell you that the night was totally dark-not a star in the sky. I dedided to go out in the front yard to look at the sky (I have always been facinated with the sky and stars etc.).  When I got out in the yard, I looked up and saw a huge disk hovering directly over my Grandparents house.  The perfect outline of a disk could be seen, and the disk had lots of lights all over it.  This object made no noise what so ever.  I yelled out for my Grandmother to come and see this &quot;thing&quot; for herself-which she did. We were both astonished and amazed at what we were witnessing.  She then called out for my Grandfather (who was inside the house) to come out in a hurry to see this object for himself.  He too came outside and witnessed this disk.  It just kept hovering over their house for five to ten minutes.  Then, in the blink of an eye, it was gone.  It had to have taken off at a very great speed.  As I recall, their were several reports from all over Allen County that night of people witnessing the same type of crafts.  Several were seen by a friend of mine-and he said one landed in their field.  It was possibly on our local news the next day also.  We were told that what we witnessed was a meteorite.  As I recall, meteorites do not hover over a house (or anywhere) for five to ten minutes, and then fly away.  I am a Christian and have an open mind about many things, but this incident-I cannot explain it.  This story is true-we DID see this object.  We saw no &quot;little green men etc.&quot;, but we did see something somehow beyond human comprehension.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate; source is anonymous.

The second light was smaller. The bigger light would pulsate and grow very dim and then bright again. It moved from side to side and up and down. It would move in a circle and turn a green color. The smaller object would follow it everywhere it moved and was on its right side or to the north of the larger object. We watched for about two hours through binoculars. Through the binoculars when this light grew dim we could see the dark shape of a disc. When it grew bright we could not see its outline. When we went in to the house at about 23:00 pm they were still there. There was no sound and we could also see planes flying in the sky and it was nothing like a plane.

I&apos;ll never forget that night, for it was like it happened yesterday.  It was Wednesday night, 8:30pm, and this new show I had been anticipating to watch was starting to begin...I remember, seeing the credits listed at the start of the show, then all of the sudden my sister screamed my name, and it was in such a way that I thought something had happened to her. I ran upstairs, to find her looking out of our bedroom window, ran over to the window myself, to discover a saucer-shaped object approximately 45-50 feet hovering behind our backyard, outside our fence toward the canyon. The saucer was dark, but it&apos;s outline was really defined, and the bottom of the it was silver like in color with rotating flashing lights.  Anyway, the object began to give us a show. It continued to hover over the outskirts of our yard, and it&apos;s lights began to change, first blue to red, red to white, then white to orange, and it continued doing this.  Then all of the sudden, the object disappered, then reappeared, but this time in another form.  The object looked like the letter &quot;T&quot; lying on it&apos;s side.  Actually it&apos;s reminded me somewhat of a the little twisty key like object on a container of corned beef or spam, the kind attached to the container, used to open it; I hope this makes sense.  In any case, this &quot;T&quot; shaped object was dark, but very defined as well, and then it disappered, and the saucer-shaped object reappeared. The saucer continued to rotate it&apos;s lights a little while longer, going from red to blue, white to orange, and then it started to move, swaying side to side, going west. The craft contined going west, swaying side to side, until my sister and I could no longer see it, and then it was gone.  Realizing it had been there for a while, I looked at the clock after it left, and it was 8:55pm. How we ended up seeing the object in the first place, is that my sister saw this blue flash of light coming over the hill, east of our house (which is behind my parents&apos; home). My sister mentioned two years ago--the first time we&apos;ve discussed this matter in years, that when she first saw it coming over the hill, she immediately ran to lock the front door, then called me upstairs, which explains the fear in her voice when she yelled my name. To this day, I&apos;ve always wondered how we ended up with this object hovering behind our backyard, but I will certainly carry this memory around with me the rest of my life.", "This yellow dot is driving me nuts.It was about 10:00pm i was comming home from a buger place when i looked at the stars when i saw a yellow light way up in the sky it was so high for it to be picked up on radar my dad saw this also it was headed in a strat line.

Then we ran to tell my mom and she came outside to see if she if she could see it too.  But it was gone so she went back in the house.  Right as soon as my mom went in the house we saw a shape again but it was sort of a more triangler egg shape.  Then the shape started to shoot out something in a line, and sort of looked like a lot of small triangles hooked together. The shape was like a silvery white color and was about as big as maybe a mansion.  The color of the  things that shot out of the shape were white. Then my friend and I ran back to our house to tell my mom again while my sister stayed back to see if she could see anything else.

We noticed a flash of bluish-white light to the left of us, and then another flash of the same light to the right of us about 15 seconds later.

We did find it a little strange because we usually see lightning behind our house, and the &quot;lightning&quot; seemed to just appear and move horizintally instead of the usual vertical lightning.  My friend and I then went into the house.  We were sitting on the couch, and looking out of the window when suddenly we saw an egg-shaped craft of the same color as the &quot;lightning&quot; in the sky a bit south of our house.  It was about the size of a house.  We ran out the front door and saw it disappear.  In hopes to see it again, we then ran down the street towards the direction in which we had seen the ship. My sister came out of the house.  We told her what we had seen and she joined us down the street.  It had been about one minute since the first sighting when we saw the craft again.  It was the same size, shape, and color.  It was a little further south of the area in which it first appeared.  The craft stayed in the sky for about 30 seconds and then disappeared.  We ran back home and told my mother.  She came outside with us and we went back down the street to the place we had been during the second sighting.  We were out there telling my mother what happened for about 2-3 minutes.  She then went in the house. About a minute or two later, my friend and sister and I were standing in the same spot when a second craft appeared in the place where the first sighting had occured. This craft was the same shape as the first, but it was twice as big.  It was a light silver color.  An extremely bright, white beam of light shot and of the craft and sort of beamed around the ship.  There was some kind lightning-like bolts that seemed to be coming out of the beam of light which gave of white squiggly lines and small triangular light.  The ship disappeared and we ran back to my house to get my mother again.  She was outside with us for about 5 minutes but saw nothing and went back inside.

Our neighborhood is surrounded by canyons and my sister noticed red lights flashing around some trees in a canyon about 4 blocks south of us.  My friend and i started walking back to my house and my sister followed.  A minute or two later, I went back down the street to see these red lights.

I was in the passenger seat.  Myself, the driver and another passanger all saw the same thing.  We kept seeing this really bright light over the road several miles ahead.  It was in the middle of nowhere and at first we thought it was some kind of plane, or airport.  But then we kept seeing it going back and forth so we figured that it was an overpass and we were seeing trucks cross over.  But when we got closer we realized it was something else.  It was literally swooping right through the traffic -which was fairly heavy considering it was 3:32 am in the middle of nowhere.  It had 3 bright white lights and when it would swoop from east to west over the highway it would shine an incredible bright beam down onto the road and surrounding ground.  Then after it swooped through the traffic and rose again the beam and the 3 white lights would go off and it would turn to one red blinking light.  It was not blinking consistently the same.  The speed at which the red light was blinking was changing, sort of like Morse code and I wondered if it was some sort of pattern.  Then it would flip around and back to the starting point.  I&apos;ve NEVER seen anything move like that.  It was truly bizarre.  It turned in all directions, end over end and side over side.  It was very graceful and smooth.  It didn&apos;t jump at all.  It kept repeating this pattern.  We passed under it and kept traveling south.  When we drove under it, it was very high up with the red blinking light and it was flipping back to the starting point again.  We watch it make several passes.  At least 10.

It was very hot that day.  I was 14.  My Mother was in the backyard swimming alone in our doughboy pool.  I was inside of our house and heard her screaming.  I ran outside thinking she was drowning and she was pointing up in the northeastern sky screaming &quot;LOOK!&quot;  I looked up and saw 3 triangle lights that appeared to be about the size of a quarter to the naked eye.  One was a little bit larger than the other two.  I am not good at judging distance, but they were very high in the sky, at least a mile I would guess.  They appeared to be playing &quot;tag&quot; in the sky.  They were white.  The larger of the two raced across the sky vertically and stopped, and the other two would follow.  The speed was unbelievable.  They went back and forth, up and down for nearly five (5) minutes.  This was over 30 years ago and our technology did not have the ability to dart completely across the sky, hover and then dart the opposite direction and stop again, defying inertia.  After they finished playing tag, all three went straight up in the sky until they were out of sight.  There was no sound.  They were perfectly quiet. I will never forget this, it is etched in my mind forever.  That memory is as clear in my mind today as it was 30 some years ago.  I called the police department to report it but they told me that I had to have been mistaken.  It made me feel very afraid to say anything since that time.  It is something my Mother and I only told our family about and kept it to a very close circle of friends, but I have always wondered if anyone else saw it.

I waited until it got darker to see if maybe i was looking at a star but ther was no star bright enough in that part of the sky.((NUFORC Note:  The third aircraft the witness describes is not inconsistent with an EC-135, which has a bulbous forward section to its fuselage.  We do not know what the bright object was.  Given that the sighting occurred approximately 45 minutes before the unannounced launch of an ICBM, probably from a U. S. submarine, we wonder whether the presence of an EC-135 eastbound over Texas may have had something to do with that launch.

I walked outside to the campfire to have a smoke.  Earlier that evening there were thunderstorms, but the skies were clear at the time of the sighting.  After about ten minutes a flash lit up the campground as if it was daylight, I look up and saw what appeared to be a shooting star with a long tail behind it moving Northeast. It was not as fast as your normal shooting star, because if I had actually seen a flash from a real shooting star against the ground, by the time I look up the star would have already been gone.  The whole sighting lasted approximately 7 seconds. About 2-3 minutes later I heard one single boom. Then I knew for sure it was not a shooting star because I had heard what appeared to be an explosion. Earlier that evening, my family and I were watching lightening flashes and counting the seconds after the flash.  I told my son I believe for every second the lightening is a mile away.  If this is true than the explosion had to be between 120-180 miles away. I looked on the CNN website today to see if we had lost any satellites, but there were none. My brother had asked me how high I thought the object was, the only thing I could tell him is it appeared to be much lower than a shooting star. There were no running lights and the object  turned into a orange fireball with a tail of 1/3 of the skies length.", "UFO over a failed Laser Light show at Six Flags Park.While at 6 flags Darien Lake, NY, we were in the amphitheatre, waiting for the nightly laser light show.  It was a clear night, the rides had stopped, and I was looking at the stars while people sat down around me, and kids played nearby. The amphitheatre had a grass field we all sat on, with a stage at the bottom of the slope, where a screen was set up for the lasers.  Finally the show started and within 3 minutes, all the lasers quit.  The crowd booed and complained, and a voice on the PA said the usual apologies along with Technical difficulties excuse.  I went back to watching the stars while the crowd pissed and moaned.  Suddenly I noticed a spot in the sky that was darker than the sky itself.  At first I thought a bunch of balloons were floating slowly by, but I then noticed, it was a triangular shape, with a &quot;Y&quot; shape, along with many barely visible curving light traces, almost like black light neon.  I had time to say, &quot;what&apos;s that?&quot; and point, whereupon my wife looked and exclaimed, &quot;What the heck IS that?&quot; and then it just dissapeared.  It was like it Melted out of sight.  It did NOT zoom off.  It just dissapeared as it slowly drifted over the edge of the ampitheatre.  No one else immediately around me said they saw it, and as everyone started looking at us funny, we dropped it. However, the lasers never did come back up, and we drove home nervously looking at the sky.  I only told 2 close friends about this until I found your website tonight.

My 2 friends, my brother and I were out late that night (after 10:00 pm). I was 11 yrs, my brother 9, the others about the same age. We were playing some game on the sidewalk, and we noticed a huge yellow light in the sky, approx. 1/16 diameter of a full moon. It seemed to be very high in the sky or in space. The small airport called Sunland Park was visible in the west accross IH 10, and the lights from some small planes could be seen in the vicinity of the airport. The light was very high above the airport, and slowly moving to the north. We were excited, and I said to my friend that we should run up the block to his house to get his new telescope. At first he didn&apos;t want to, being afraid we would miss something while we were running up. But it kept moving so slowly that he agreed, and we sprinted up the street to get the scope. When we got to his house his Dad was out getting ready to call him and his brother in. He said &quot;Dad, LOOK AT THAT!!&quot;, and his Dad took a long look at it, then called his wife and the older sister out to look. By this time, the light had crossed 1/2 the horizon, but was still very high (in space?). Soon thereafter it stopped moving, and after hanging there for 15 secs. or so, it began dropping smaller yellow lights out of the bottom, one after the other. The lights were about 1/10 the size of the larger light. It proceeded to drop about fifteen of these. The craft was at about 10:00 high, and these smaller lights would each disappear at about 08:30 high. When they began disappearing, the number of them and the realization that they could fly over us invisibly made my knees start to wobble and give out from fear- the only time in my life that has happened. After the last of the lights fell, four lights simultaneously broke off the object at each corner or quadrant, then fell to the same area and disappeared. After that the entire craft just blinked out.

Right as I passed the California/Arizona border I noticed what looked to be three glowing lights in the sky, just above the horizon.  I commented about them to my friend because unlike aircraft lights these were glowing an orange color, were much larger, and appeared to be motionless, like they were hanging there.  At that point they did not look like fireballs. I thought they could be tower lights but they were much too high, the wrong colors, and there were no towers around.  We passed behind some hills and lost site of them, and basically forgot about them. About fifteen minutes later we were in an open stretch of the desert when I saw the lights again streaking parallel to the highway but far off and very high.  Rather than lights I could see more clearly there were several huge white-orange fireballs streaking across the sky at high speed, just like meteors but seemingly much bigger.  They were so clear and vivid (no clouds, haze, fog) not to mention bizarre, we pulled off to the road to watch them.  Several would streak across the sky, then another couple more would come, then several more and so on all following the same &quot;path.&quot;  Again these fireballs were huge.  They streaked from east to west, directly to the glow from the city of Palm Springs (which was hidden behind a mountain).  What was especially memorable was that while some streaked by with meteor-like trails behind them, those already in the distance appeared to hang motionless in the sky (quite possibly because of our angle of vision). The fireballs did not appear to have a manufactured shape, like a saucer, have any visible manufactured elements such as lights, or move in a controlled fashion across multiple planes; they simply streaked. Then it suddenly occurred to me: this must be the Mir re-entering the earth&apos;s atmosphere.  I knew the station was supposed to come in over Argentina but no one knew exactly where it would go.  It looked just like a body entering earth&apos;s atmosphere and breaking up.  I did question some elements at the time though, because the fireballs seemed very large, much bigger then pieces from the Mir, but then again I don&apos;t know anything about the Mir.  The other question my friend and I discussed while watching this display was why it had been going on for a good 25+ minutes.  If the Mir came in I would expect it to be more or less one &quot;clump&quot; of little fireballs. In the distance, the exact direction the fireballs were traveling, they seemed to arc down toward the earth, like they were falling gradually.  Then there were large flashes where they appeared to fall.  Seeing the arcs and flashes (which looked like lightening in clouds far off in the distance) I thought the &quot;Mir&quot; was breaking up and hitting the earth, although the flashes seemed surprisingly large.  Although it sounds absurd now, I actually thought the LA area was being hit with &quot;debris.&quot; After the display ended we kept driving west.  I turned on the radio near Palm Springs only to hear that at the Mir re-entry was not due for another 45 minutes and indeed it was coming in over Argentina.", "The observer was driving his auto with a companion along route 27 on the service road east.

I write it as a story of the events that happen. I have no answers to why me? You all can call me I cannot run from this any more. Visitors on A Cold Night Sometime last year I received a visit from two strangers. As the year passed, I have not heard from these strange visitors. One day out of nowhere they came in the earlier morning to see me. This day was very cold. They came from a far away place that was not known to us. One day during the week it was very cold. The wind was blowing very hard so my home was cold. The heaters did not do their job very well. As the night fell our trailer was getting colder. My family and I had blankets over them to stay warm. We all sat next to the heater as the wind and cold came through the trailer, so the evening was very cold. Bedtime came and I put my boys, B((deleted)) and J((deleted)) to bed. Even, though their room was cold their heater did the job, as it was suppose to. B and J fell asleep. My husband ((deleted)) and I went back to the living room to sit down and have some cocoa to warm our cold bodies. Then we went back to watching TV for the rest of the night. As time went by we became aware it was 10:00 p.m., the news came on. Even though it was very cold in our trailer, we still enjoyed each other&apos;s company. After the news I decided to get up and go to bed. It took a few minutes to get settled down for a good night sleep. I do remember laying my head down on my pillow for a few minutes. I do not remember anything until 1:30 a.m. in the early morning. I do recall waking up for a glass of water and going to use the restroom. Then I returned to bed and fell back to sleep. Suddenly, I heard this sound that woke me up out of a sound sleep. This sound was so far away as it traveled in a downward, vertical descent from the sky. This sound was nothing like a plane engine. The noise had been getting louder and louder as I had been lying in bed shaking from the fear of what was going to happen to me. I could not even move out of my bed to get my family up so they could hear what I was hearing. This shaking and terror that my body was feeling is something no matter what I say will never allow a person to understand what it felt like to be so afraid that your body can not even move to get help. The time was 2:00 a.m. in the morning when I first heard this noise. I tried everything to move; no matter how hard I tried I began to shake worse from the terror that I was hearing coming down toward me. My fear had been so strong that I could not protect my family and I tried to hide like a scared cat running away from what I could not see. Suddenly, I turned and looked at my clock, which said 2:30 a.m. The visitors were in my room holding on to my shoulders one on each side. I do not even remember how I became very warm and standing straight up; I was moving, but my legs were not. It felt like I was leaving a house front door and going into a doorway with a bright white light. Both of these little people had long arms and big black eyes. They were shorter then me. Their heads were bigger then their body and came to my shoulder. I felt as though I was not in my trailer at all. I do not have a door where my bedroom windows are.  Even though I felt at peace with whatever happened to me, I still do not understand it all. I do not remember anything after I went to the light. When I was returned to my room on my bed, I was shaking from fear again from the sound as this noise was now leaving straight up into the sky. I turned my head to the clock and it said 4:30 a.m. After the noise left, I calmed down; it took me a little while to stop shaking. I finally got up to go through the doorway to get my husband. Suddenly, there were smells in my room that I could not tell where they came from. They were very strong in odor. Then in just a few minutes the smell was gone. I still to this day do not know what happened. I was awake. I am one who will always find a way to protect my family, but this time I could not protect anyone, not even myself.

It was spherical and had multi-colored lights along the base that were chasing each other, and it had a red ball on the top. The body was dark, and I didn&apos;t see the underside of it because of the treeline.

It was a very clear sky without moonlight so the stars were very visible.  Took dog for a walk in a large field and took the opportunity to stargaze. Immediately noticed movement low on the Northern horizon.  Braced myself against a fence to make sure the two lights were in fact moving.  I estimate a low flying object no more than 1000 feet altitude and 200 feet in diameter (large).  The trailing light was at about 35 degrees lower than the leading light and this attitude and orientation was constant.  Both lights were white and steady and I could make out a very light white or light blue light arc of light or forward rim on the leading edge, suggesting a saucer shape.  There was no sound and the movement was rather slow for an aircraft.  I counted 10 seconds and judged it at about a 1/2 mile... -180 mph.  At its closest it appeared to pass within a 1000 yards of me (a fence stood between me and a high school football field, so I had a decent basis of comparison).  At this closest point I had a horrible few seconds during which it appeared to stop moving forward and seemed to be getting either bigger or closer.   It did however, slowly proceed northeast without a sound.  I followed it with my eyes for about 2 more minutes before it was gone, low on the northeast horizon past Palatine and towards Mt. Prospect. Interestingly, I realized I was hearing a &quot;wooshing&quot; of air shortly afterwards.  I saw no aircraft in the sky at all, but there was no mistaking the sound of a subsonic jet passing overhead, but not like any I had ever heard.  It sounded extremely low and &quot;muffled.&quot;.  There were no chem-trails (I was looking for chem.-trails to appear from the first craft).  My watch read 3:05AM.  This too was followed by a distant, low rumble, which I presume to have been a high altitude supersonic aircraft, again unlike any I had ever heard and much more subtle than the ones I have heard.  Although I have no explanation for the first craft, I speculate that the last two craft were chase planes -one subsonic following closely and the other supersonic circling at a distance.  The sounds clearly occurred over to great an expanse of time to be physically connected to one another or the siting. This is the second siting of &quot;unknowns&quot; I have recently enjoyed while walking my dog.  I hate the idea that such phenomenon is commonplace above our suburban skies.

The street lights of the city illuminated the bottom of the object and revealed a flat, light gray surface. It appeared round but not like a ball. If I compared the size of the object to that of the full moon in the night sky, I would say it was approxiamtely one-tenth the size.

The duration of the sighting was approximately twenty seconds.", "Large hazy amber orb with two bright greenish-blue orbs circling object wildly.My wife and I and at least 50 witnesses were out at Long Lake Recreational Area outside near the north end of Long Lake (located east of Fond du Lac County). At approximately 10:05 p.m., a series of very unusual events began occurring and continued late into the early morning hours. At 10:05 p.m., we were looking south and could plainly see the planet Mars off the southern horizon. Slightly east of this location, a large bright amber colored light rose straight up from behind a forest of trees in the distance. The object went up approximately 25 degrees off the horizon and moved in a northerly direction at about the speed of a fast moving airplane. As it was removing, it seemed to drop round orbs of amber colored lights. It continued and disappeared in the northern horizon. As it disappeared, a second object reappeared exactly as before and followed the exact path as the first object. This object also headed north and seemed to stop before the northern horizon. At this point, a third object rose again at the same exact starting point as the other two. It rose up and became extremely bright white and accelerated in a northerly direction in the same path as the previous two. Along its path several times, it seemed to flare up bright and dim and several times it seemed to drop amber balls of light. As it approached close to the second light, the second light blinked out and the third light continued northerly and finally blinked out. This series of events started at 10:05 to 10:20 pm. At this point, everything seemed to calm down. At this point, we were excited but some of us felt these 3 events could perhaps be described as airplanes or pyrotechnic devices, therefore, no one seemed to draw irrational conclusions. This was only the beginning of several strange events that were to follow. At approximately 10:35 pm, a 4th amber ball of light rose from the general location as the previous three. At this time, the fourth light however headed westerly instead of northerly and seemed to hover approximately 30 degrees off the southern horizon and was blocked by trees approximately the first 20 degrees. Now the object after it headed west seemed to head north directly toward us and became quite large, approximately the size of a small finger fingernail at arm&apos;s length. At this time, became extremely white bright and then extradionary the orange&apos;s object seemed to have a definite halo or fog around it. Outside of this halo were two distinct bright greenish-blue tiny orbs that continued to circle and rotate wildly around the object. At times, the two greenish-blue orbs would seem to stop directly in front of the object and at times, they would stop and change direction wildly. Other times, they would circle around the top or bottom or around the side of it. This wild movement continued for approximately 35 minutes and was seen by at least 50 witnesses, some had video cameras and still cameras. After approximately 35 minutes, a major event occurred. At this time, the large amber object seemed to split into two. One piece shot directly down towards the ground and was covered by the trees. The second piece seemed to disappear. At this time, one of the intense greenish blue orbs &quot;shot&quot; directly up and northward at an extremely high rate of speed covering the sky from where it had been to the northern horizon in perhaps 8 seconds. The other greenish-blue orb continued to stay in the general area above where the amber orb seemed to have descended or crashed to earth. The time now was approximately 11:15 pm. The one remaining greenish-blue orb continued to move wildly up and down, side to side doing circles and loops but stayed in the general close area. The single orb continued to move wildly into the early morning hours. Unfortunately, I left for home approximately 12 midnight and drove home. Several friends of mine stayed until 1:30 am and the object was still there and doing its wild dance. I don&apos;t know how long this continued because most people left near or at this time. During all these events, I had a 35mm camera equipped with a 450 mm lens mounted on a heavy duty tripod and was using 1600 ISO rated color print film. While looking through the view finder and centering the object in the microprism, I could clearly see the object move wildly and I know my camera wasn&apos;t moving nor was I. I shot approximately 30 shots of film during both major events, the first three and the fourth. Also, I used a 10x50 BAK4 optics glass binoculars meant for astromonical use and viewed the object. Clearly, I could see what appeared to be an envelope of haze or fog that surrounded the amber light. The two greenish-blue lights appeared clearly and extremely bright and very distinct with no haze whatsoever surrounding them. The greenish-blue orbs reminded me of what appeared to be bees flying around the object in a nonrestrictive orbit, changing directions and paths many times.((NUFORC Note:  Several reports.

Not again&quot;.It was the exact same thing my girlfriend and I saw 8 years earlier.It was a big blob of light hovering and bobbing a bit above the horizon line with another smaller &quot;wingman&quot; looking light lower and to the left of it.They were both moving around a little in strange bobbing motions.Sometimes they would appear to get to get bigger and then shrink back.I watched for about a half hour before noticing 2 more in the same formation in another area and not so obvious to the eye.Then I started trying to search the entire sky.They appear to be yellowish and sometimes blueish in color and unlike the actual stars around them.Alltogether I counted 10 of them (all in pairs).8 years ago we saw one pair of these bobbing lights but that time they came right up instantly and we got a full on close up look at the craft and we were absolutely terrified.We thought we were going to be abducted for sure.It came right at us.It had to have seen us atop a dune next ! to the w ater.It turned a bit though and went over the water in front of us then cicled in toward the houses and floated completely silently at practically rooftop level over the town area then reappeared down the beach where it came from originally(it was cicling the area).So then it came back for another run staight at us again.We were back to clutching each going,&quot;Omigod, this is it!&quot;.This time it took a left and floated out over the water and into the darkness.There was no more yellowish light in the distance after that.It was over.I&apos;ll never forget that.Definately the most bizarre thing I&apos;ve ever seen.The actual craft looked like this:Basically a giant tic-tac,metallic in color with three &quot;windows&quot;,two small ones on the ends and one big one in the middle.They had etremely bright light coming out of them.It made absolutely no sound whatsoever.On the front pointing down was like a headlight(oddly enough)and when it was flying low over the water the reflection from the light on the water showed that it was only about 100 ft. up(at the most).I thought for sure I&apos;d be reading about in the local paper.Surely someone else was going to see it.It flew RIGHT OVER town at like rootop level at 10 o&apos;clock at night.But nobody saw except us.Oh well.Last night when I saw the same far away lights I&apos;ve decided to try and tell my story to whoever will listen.Thanks.", "Green Fire BallGreen fire ball was seen by 5 people while sitting in back yard.

(Sightings of strange lights were seen over Boise about 2 weeks earlier and I had seen one of them over Ontario and had mentioned it to my wife).   When I got out of bed and quickly went outside she pointed them out to me.   There were Two very bright lights in the North East sky about 5-10 degrees off horizon.    If you were to hold out your hand, they would be spaced approximately one palm distance apart. They were brighter than any star around them or any type of planet.   They were bright like aircraft Taxi  lights.    I thought that because of the brightness, they might be aircraft however the lights never changed direction as would be expected. I was in the USAF for 6 years as a Avionics Specialist so I&apos;ve seen hundreds of aircraft coming in for approach.  Within less than a minute or so I ruled them out as being aircraft coming in for a landing.  (There were no Airports in their direction anyway). Object (A) was Left of Object (B) and slightly lower over horizon.   It was dimber and yellow orange in color.  It was still much brighter than the stars. Object (B) was much brighter even than Object (A).  Its color would change from yellow to white.  Its intensity would also change.  I was looking at it though binoculars.  It seemed to pulse at irregular intervals.   This could also be seen with the naked eye. We stood outside and watched them for a half hour.  I took pictures of them with my camera on time elapsed exposure.   As time went by they were were not moving upwards as normal stars would be but they were moving South.   It was slow movement.   I could tell this because I was resting my camera on the roof of my parked car and the objects were creeping slowly  south torward a near bye neighbors tree and eventually into it. The neighbors tree is East of my location.   I called New Channel 7 in Boise and reported the sighting to them at approximately 0400. I also called a man at a nearbye prison who works in a Tower there.   He could also see the lights. My wife stayed up and watched the lights until the sun came up and then stopped observing them.

My wife had not been watching, and I described to her what I had seen, and commented on its oddity.  A few minutes later, I observed the same light.  I pointed towards it, and said &quot;there!&quot;  My wife looked up and saw the light.  It remained for approximately 3-5 seconds, then again suddeny disappeared.

While coming to the stop sign at the intersection of Meridian and McMillan I saw a Green light coming from the field northwest of the intersection. It was about 50 feet high in the air, moving parallel with McMillan about 40 feet north of the road.  It was coming towards me and then the Green light dissapated.  I could still tell their was an object flying in the sky and when it came to the point where it was going to cross meridian road, it banked and turned 180 degrees and was then heading west.  I was probably fifty yards from the craft.  Then, the belly of this diamond craft lit up like white lava and radiated very bright light on the ground.  As soon as the craft lit up, it dived for the ground and then pulled up back to about 50 feet from the ground.  Then the plasma light on the belly completely shut off.  I saw It then bank, and turn another 180 degrees and it was coming towards me again, still moving parallel with McMillan coming towards meridian road.  Then the Front of the craft illuminated it&apos;s front &quot;Head Lights.&quot;  It had three very large lights on the front of the craft.  The lights remind me of lights in a Football stadium.  The middle light was slightly higher then the other Lights on each side.  Then the Diamond shaped UFO started to radiate colors from the end of its wings.  Not blinking lights like an airplane, But slowly appearing light that gradually became brighter in color.  I beleive the first color was blue, then red then green.  It took about 5-7 seconds for each color to come on very dim, gradually become brighter and then dim out-to start the next color.  After the green color on the edges of the UFO dimmed, the front headlights shut off, the UFO banked and turned again, the belly lit up and the CYCLE repeated itself.  Instantly I knew I had encountered it again.  Absolutely nobody was on the desolate farming roads except for me.  I had a sensation ! of an ov erwhelming feeling that I needed to leave the area ASAP.  The only logical thing I could think of doing was to drive where lots of people were, so I headed towards boise down McMillan street at a very fast pace. July 28 2000. While coming home from work at 1:20 in the morning on a late thursday night (Friday morning),  I saw the exact same UFO I had just described.  Except this was the first time I had ever encountered a UFO.  The exact coloring, shape, plasma bottom, three head lights and the cycles of going in circles  were all the same.  But, I didn&apos;t recognize it untill I pulled into my driveway at home.  It was probably 100 yards away from me and the three headlights (It was so bright, that Is all I could see)was coming straight for me.  I scrambled inside of my house, and paced back in forth in disbeleive of what it was.  I  kept seeing the craft fly about 30 feet high off of the ground on my street where my house resides.  I quickly woke my father up to tell hime about the flying crafts outside of our house.  He woke up and walked outside with me.  Nothing was their.  He went back to bed thinking I was insane.  About 20 minutes later I heard the distinct humming noise this diamond craft makes and I immediately went back to wake my father up.  We went outside again and the craft was farther off in the distance.  Within a minute or so the craft was in our back yard, doing the cycles and my dad was so scared, he ran in the house (of course I did too).  We peeked out of our windows and watched the craft for about an hour and a half, going back and forth inside and outside.  While watching the UFO, it did it&apos;s cycles in three spots within about a couple of miles.  The first cycle was right near our house.  Then the craft would fly about 2 miles southeast and do some cycles  there.  Then the UFO would go directly west and do more cycles and then come back to our house, (northeast) and continue its cycles.  Three different spots of continuous cycles and then repitition.  This lasted for nearly 2 hours..... The UFO was quiet large.  I would say it is bigger then an average size home, Especially the width.  For how big it was, It meandered through the air like a hang-glider.  For something that big to be flying 50-60 feet off of the ground and turning around and diving towards the ground, ruled out any logical explanation of what I think it could be.  I also realized that when I had come across the UFO for the second time, it was one day away from being exactly one year from when I saw the first one.  The only thing I can conclude, is that both experiences happend on the last thursday night (Early friday morning) of July 2000 and July 2001", "Round black circular object,sighted in a feild in north wales uk.It was about 20.30 hours and i was a fanattical power kite flyer.i had been doing this sport for about one year.but on this particular day i happened to look at the sky when my kite had just been landed and saw what appeared to be a black circular object.this object wasnt large from where i was stood becauese it was in the clouds.I watched it move quite gracefully,it would drop like it was gliding slowley down and then it would go back up at a very very fast speed to where it had just dropped from.but the speed it went back up at was as fast as turning on a light switch.then it moved slowley to the right and disappeared behind a cloud i watched it move through the cloud and appear again the other side.it then climbed a bit higher and kept moving to the right,and dissapeared behind another cloud where it never reappeared.I waited for 10 minutes but it never reappeared.Shortley after seeing this i became very very depressed and had to take 8 months sick leave from work.I never did work out why i came depressed i am 25 years old now.I dont know if it had anything to do with the sighting but philisophical questions kept running round my head for a long time after.questions like why are we on the planet,whats life all about.anyway thats my true story straight up no lies.I live in north wales and theres lots of country side.", "At apprx 0415 on 7-13 I went outside to turn water off to my parched garden.

At approx. 11:00 PM I notice a very bright object in the south/southwest sky, approximatley 25 degrees above the south horizon. It was the brightest object in the sky by a factor of 4 and I showed it to my wife. It originally had a south to north trajectory and a velocity that should have taken it slightly west of our position and over the north pole. I thought it was just another low orbit satellite. However, at 40 degree above the south horizon it&apos;s velocity slowed and it&apos;s brightness/color changed from bright white to slightly yellow orange. I had the impression that what ever it was has just bottomed out of a dive, in an arc. It then changed direction and accelerated/fluttered/skipped almost directly away from us getting dimmer as it went into the upper atmosphere.

In an instant, something caught the attention of my sight in the lower sky just above eye level. I witnessed a large object on fire with a trail of fire behind it shoot accross the sky. At first I thought it was a plane crashing to earth. The 3-5 second span that this object took to fly accross the whole sky canceled this theory. I then braced myself to feel the effect of the impact of such a large object falling towards the earth at such velocity. There was nothing. However, I knew there was Something!!!!!!!

As I walked back toward the house, I noticed a single white object high in the clear sky over my house. I stopped and watched it for about 30 seconds. It appeared somewhat balloon-like, being a very small and/or high-altitude, white colored, vaguely spherical object. It did not have a strongly defined path of travel, but seemed to drift about. It was definitely not a plane or other aircraft. The only possibility I was considering as I watched was some sort of balloon. I ran inside and got my digital camera. When I came back out, I saw that there were now several objects in the sky. Three of them were in a large equilateral triangle formation. The entire formation rotated as it moved off beyond the treeline. There were several other stray objects. After snapping a few pics, I went back inside and got binoculars. As I was walking into the house, I saw that one of the objects made a sudden controlled descent, dropping downward below the distant treeline as if tugged by a string. When I came back out with the binoculars, I saw that only one object remained. I looked at it through the binoculars and saw that it appeared to be oblong in shape, and part of it flickered as if reflecting sunlight. This object eventually rose very high until it was almost invisible, then moved beyond the treeline. It is possible that these were balloons, but their behavior seemed suspect. I have seen UFOs before, one of which I reported to NUFORC several years ago (1998, I believe). Only one of the digital photos came out with a visible object (what can I say, cheap camera). I posted that photo on a UFO message board. It can be seen at (http://www.ufoalert.com/pictures/159.html).

It was very low, only a few feet above the trees, and it was really creepy when it hung over my garage and it seemed like the whole incident lasted hours but when I looked at my watch, only 10 minutes had passed.

To the right of the car, we both noticed something strange in the sky; three triangular objects.  What drew our attention to them was the fact that there seemed to be a center object (larger than the others) hovering, while the 2 objects surrounding it moved rapidly from either side of it. These objects had lights at all 3 corners (two red, one blue) and a larger white light in the center.  What was so amazing about these objects was their ability to hover, as well as their incredible speed.  We stopped and got out of our car to get a better look, but within about 5-10min they were gone.  A little later in the evening, closer to 10pm, we went out again to see if we could spot these objects.  As we drove on the interstate closer to Raleigh, they appeared again.  It seemed to me that we saw between 3-5 of these at various locations. Again, we got out of the car (with camera in hand) and one of the objects flew fairly close to us to allow a better look.  This object appeared to be similar to the center object we had seen earlier.  Also triangular, it appeared to have two very bright white lights at the top-most point, with red lights on the bottom two.  In the center was again a larger white light, and right above these were two strange markings of white light (resembeling &lt;&lt;).  This object came close to us, but made absolutely no sound whatsoever. In total, over about 1-2 hours, we witnessed between 3-5 of these objects.  While I was skeptical, I just can&apos;t explain what it was that we saw.  Another strange thing was that there was a much higher amount of air traffic (airplanes) in the area than we normally see.

Although, several minutes later I noticed it in a completely different part of the sky and still moving from north to south. It was hard to keep track of because it was so small and dim. I gave up on trying to keep track of it after a while, and then all of the sudden it started growing in brightness, and for a second it was the brightest thing in the sky. After this brightness dissapated, the light kept moving in the same direction and dissapeared.((NUFORC Note:  Report is consistent with the flare of an Iridium satellite.

Then it just stopped, without slowing down.  As I turned onto my road, It was hovering over this house.  I was trying to get home as quick as possible so my family can see it. I got to my driveway and it shot across the sky again, as silent as can be.  There was NO sound coming from this object.  It went so fast it seemed like it didn&apos;t move.  Then it just hovered over my neighbor&apos;s field.  Where I live, the neighbor&apos;s have about 5-20acres if land and woods in the background.  But, It just sat in the sky, for about 4 minutes.  It didn&apos;t bob up and down or move in the slightest bit.  I ran inside to get my video camera (but the battery was dead), I went back outside and it was still there, over the field.

When I looked to my right (southeast) and there was an object.  Triangular in shape, the tips of it were very smooth and round.  There was a white light in each corner and a bright red light in the middle.  It hovered there for about 30 seconds.  As I came closer it shot over to the left (North).  The object was at a complete dead stop and it went so fast.  It didn&apos;t start slow or slow down to stop.  It stopped as fast as it went. It just sat there in the sky perfectly quiet.  It didn&apos;t bob up and down or anything, completely still.  It stayed there for about 1 1/2 minutes.  I turned onto my street (north).  I couldn&apos;t see anything for about 1 minute because there were trees.  When I did, it was at the beginning of my street, the south tip.  It was hovering over a house there.  It took me about 2 minutes to get home.  When I got to my driveway I couldn&apos;t see it anymore until it shot across the sky so fast.  I couldn&apos;t believe my eyes it went so fast.  I had never seen an aircraft go so fast and be completely silent.  It went over my house and went two houses down from mine (north) and hovered in my neighbor&apos;s backyard which is about 20 acres.  It wasn&apos;t very far from their house though.  It again just sat there in the air with no movement or sound, like it was watching me.  I sat in my car for about 2 minutes and watched it.  I was stunned.

We live near Mobile and drive this route to and from the valley daily.  We were westbound, approaching the Queen Creek Road overpass at I-10E at approximately 1/4 mile.  At that  point, the road curves to the southwest as it crosses the interstate. As we were comming out of the curve, and at the same moment, we both saw a bright orange fireball traversing the sky originating from the south and moving in a direction toward the northwest.  This object was situated approximately 20 degrees off of the horizion and moving apparently parallel with the horizion.  It did have a long tail, approximately 10 times its diameter which was also bright orange.  We live 20 miles southwest of the valley (by way of the crow flys) separated from the valley by South Mountain and the Sierra Estrella range.  Thus,we experience very little reflective light from the metro, so viewing the night sky is a nightly occurrance. We routinely observe shooting stars, civilian and military aircraft and even military arial flares lighting the Barry Goldwater Bombing Range 20 miles to the southwest of our home. This object was in the wrong part of the sky, and not moving like an arial flair.  For the past 10 days or so, Mars has been very bright in the southern sky.  By comparison, this orange fireball was at least 12 times the diameter of our view of Mars.  I phoned Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, AZ within moments of the sighting from my celphone and later in the week.  They have no record of such a sighting.  If it was a meteor, it was a large one.

Well, I too have seen this object many times traveling on the Nashville Road going to or from Franklin, Kentucky.  This object(s) does not appear every night-just at various times.  I cannot explain what we (my friends and I, and others) are seeing, but it IS real.  Most of the time the object(s) seem to be to my left as I am driving toward Franklin, Kentucky.  The object glows really bright with a red light sometimes appearing at the bottom or center of it.  Then, all of a sudden the light will go out.  At times the light wil zig-zag for a time.  One night as I was going home from Church, I looked up and there it was, glowing like fire on a very dark night.  The object then began to move at a very slow pace and was getting nearer to my automobile.  I was a little concerned to say the least.  Then I looked underneath this object and saw 2 more smaller lights flying faster underneath it.  They were very visable.  As I approached Bowling Green, the fireball light was still there.  As I got closer to the light the object seemed to take on a triangular appearance.  I cannot be sure because the trees were obscuring my view, but it appeared that something was there.  I must mention that one time previously at my friend&apos;s house we saw the object, and we took out his binoculars to take a look at it.  The object looked rectangular or diamond shaped, and had a purple glow to it.  There could be a reasonable explaination for this-but I don&apos;t know what it could be.  As I said before, on various nights this glowing fireball can be seen clearly, and it seems to big to be a glowing star.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Source is anonymous.

We had been standing there talking in her driveway for about 2 minutes when something caught my eye.  I turned and looked at a LARGE reddish light, directly south of us, about 40-50 degrees above the horizon. The light appeared to be at least the size of my thumb nail when my arm was outstretched. I&apos;ve been observing Mars for quite a while now, and I read that it was supposed to be at it&apos;s nearest distance from earth last week. I said &quot;Wow!  Look at Mars.  It is HUGE tonight!&quot; As I said that, I made about a 45 degree turn to my left and looked at my friend,and there, way up in the S.E. sky at about 70-80- degrees, was the REAL Mars, looking sort of pink, and maybe less than half the size of my little thumb nail.  It was a clear night and the moon was out in the S. Western part of sky.  (The light was smaller than the moon.) I personally witnessed the yellow light formations that have been seen repeatedly over Rockford in the last 2 years, plus I&apos;ve got 2 videos of the same phenomena, taken by a friend who saw the lights at other times. (Peter,I sent you his 1st video, and if he ever copyrights the second one, as you suggested, we&apos;ll send it to you.)This new light was alone, at least we only saw one. The color was reddish brown, with maybe a yellow haze around it.  We both thought it looked more oval than round,and to me the light shone out from top, bottom and sides the way the &quot;Star of Bethlehem&quot; is depicted, but that could be my eyes.  I thought the yellow lights looked that way, too, but in the videos they are round.) We watched the light for about 10 more minutes, and I believe I saw it blink several times, and then it started to move slighty to the west. Within a minute or two, it went behind a large stand of trees. My friend lives 1.3 miles N. of East State street. (The lights are often seen by witnesses near State St.) Judging by the size of the light, it seemed relatively close, and we could still see the light glowing through the trees, so I got in my car and went to look for it, but by the time I got out to the main road it was gone.  I did see 2 airplanes flying in the direction of the light--one while we were still looking at the light, and the other when I reached the main road. The airport is in the same direction, though, so the planes may have been a coincidence.  I drove back to her house about the same time 2 nights later and stood in the same spot and looked for a long time to see if we could have seen a street light from E. State Street, or somewhere in between.  There was nothing. I saw a stand of trees about 4 blocks south. I think they were the same ones.

They were in formation with the first object we had spotted being in the lead. Actually, I believe that the first object dropped (descended) and then the other four obects fell in behind.  As I watched the objects disappear, the whole mountain over which they had flown or floated was completely bathed in a light that was glowing a reddish-orange color.  I ran to get a witness other than my now terrifed child and an elderly lady also witnessed the whole mountain lighting up.  I tried to rationalize by convincing myself that these were jets and one of then at least had crashed into the mountains.  No plane crash as far as I can find out was reported and also five jets would not have been flying over Lavendar Mountain as low as this.  I did find an article in the Rome News Tribune about a spacecraft, or flying saucer looking object that the Berry College students had designed and actually gotten to fly..There was a picture of the &quot;flying saucer&quot; in the paper.

It moved about 300ft to the left of the still lit, first light and came to a complete and sudden stop. At this point, the second light did the exact same thing as the first (eg: same split, same size, same light trail, same distance, same sudden stop) leaving three identical lights above the mountain for about three seconds.

Your first sighting followed a few months later. I enjoyed hearing that you were so young when it occurred for you. At the time of my experience I wrongly concluded that it would be announced in the next decade. No such luck and the Government is still keeping the lid on it. Perhaps the problem is they don&apos;t understand it themselves.      The object made an erratic arc in the sky from San Jose toward the San Francisco Bay Area. It seemed to scan back and forth over what is now Silicon Valley.

This is really off the wall but once you witness an event like this it defies all our known physical laws and anything may be possible.It is always good to meet a Stanford man and especially one who has spearheaded this adventurous project.

I curiously kept looking at it to try to identify what kind of object it might be.  I got off my bike to look more intensely at it.  By that time it was directly overhead.  I could not tell if it was circular or slightly oblong at that time.  When I first saw it I thought it might be a blimp. But it seemed to be much to high to be a blimp, but it seemed to be elongated at first.  Then looking at it for about eight minutes straight up trying to shield my eyes by different means, I thought that if it does not move then I might as well be on my way.

It was east of me, behind me as I traveled westerly.  I would glance back at it here and there to see if it was sill there.  Then at one point I clearly saw the white bright object as very distinctly cigar shaped and closer than ever (the length being about five times the height and horizontal).  I raced home which then was about a block away to view it through my binoculars. By the time I got to see it through my binoculars it was drifting northeasterly and still seemed to be quite high.  It was a bright white color with a red hue along the bottom (this hue could have been cause by refraction of the binoculars). It was fading in the distance and no longer horizontal.  It faded into the distance looking again as a star and then no longer visible. I called my three sons to view the object, but by that time it was to far for them to see. I do have very acute vision as compared to them. The whole experience could have lasted! 30 to 4 0 minutes, most of my time being spent in the bank.  There were no distinguishable features on the object--no windows, no wings, no projections. It did not move like a balloon.  There was wind, but the object did not drift with the wind.  The wind actually was blowing about 10 mph from north to south at the time it was directly overhead, but it did not move for that time it was directly overhead for about eight minutes.

Close to home where I came into a clearing between 6-story apartment buildings, I was looking up facing south, and between about 60 and 75 degrees above the horizon, a small disc-shaped, grayish or silvery object caught my eye as soon as it emerged over the top of a building to my right.  It was travelling east (from my right to left) and was about to fly over, by my best estimate, John F. Kennedy International Airport.  It was probably between one half and one mile high and seemed fairly small...my guess would be about 10 feet in diameter.  It had no distinguishing characteristics.  I saw no smoke trail, heard no noise, and felt no strange vibes other than my own nervousness.  I don&apos;t think it was more than a half a mile away horizontally.  It never made any erratic movement and was moving at a quick pace...I&apos;m guessing about 150 mph.  A few seconds before it disappeared over the top of the building to my left, it had begun a smooth right turn toward the southeast and appeared to be climbing.  No wings were visible, and at this point it looked more like a cigar with a reflecting metal surface.  Then it was gone.  I was able to see this object clearly as my eyesight was perfect then, and I knew I&apos;d never seen anything like it before.  I remembered feeling shocked, perplexed and concerned, for I had no idea the source of what I&apos;d seen.  I was also annoyed that there was nobody else around for me to call attention to it.

This continued for one to two minutes before the objects were completely out of my view. I cannot really say if it was one big craft, or three smaller crafts, but they formed a perfect right triangle, and moved at the same speed, and stopped at the same time the entire length of the event. My parents tried to write them off as satelites moving across the sky, but we all know that satelites don&apos;t form perfect geometeric shapes, and stop in random spots across the sky, and more so with a satelites they need to be constantly moving to stay in orbit.

(Story): A school friend and i camped outside(after the last day of high-school exams) in the backyard at his parents place...my friend was listening to a recorded tape of a football game from the previous afternoon.  I didn&apos;t care to listen to it so i positioned myself so that half of me was outside the tent(laying down on my back). I folded my hands behind my head and looked upward&apos;s into the clear night sky to look at the stars(amazingly... at that time in Edmonton... one could still see the stars at night).  After a short while(30 to 60 minutes)... i saw something very odd and striking directly above me... very high in the sky. It was very Black...very clearly Triangular...with rounded edges, not sharp or pointed edges. Because i could make out evenly spaced lights all around the triangular circumference of the object, i could see that it had rounded edges... and interspersed within its shape was a limited assortement of lights with no pattern or organization. All the lights were white(no-colors)...and perhap&apos;s a little less brighter than the star-light( it blended almost perfectly into the black starry sky).  Like the other witness said... if he hadn&apos;t been directly looking at that exact position in the sky he probably would have missed it...this was the same for me... i was afraid that if i took my eyes off of it... that i might lose sight of it( the lights of the ship blended with the stars making it hard to see). It indeed was stealthy and hard to keep track of visually. It was without any sound at all!. At that moment my friend&apos;s dog which was inside the tent with him went absolutelely berserk...barking like mad...(the dog was quiet all evening)...I quickley got up off the ground to stand up to track it as it moved at a startling speed(no jet travels that fast...ever!) from the ! north-we st to the south-east in a straight line towards the horizion where the very 1st indications of the next morning&apos;s sunrise glow was just barely dicernable. As i got up i had only enough time to call out my friend&apos;s name 3-4 times to get him to come out of the tent to see the object with me before it was gone altogether!. He didn&apos;t even have a chance to come out... this whole scenario was over with in less than 10 second&apos;s... his dog returned to his normal quiet self!. Correctly or Incorrectly i evaluated this object as being very large... i thought that it must be approximately a half a mile to a mile long... it did not look like it was small at all!.

I had looked at the clock, because I was waiting for my wife to return from the airport.  I immediately noticed a red light, moving generally from west to east.  It was bright enough that I initially thought it was a low flying, small plane.  I thought it would turn, at some point and I would see a blue or white light.  When I did not, I continued to watch it move in the direction of my house.  Then, it slowed and seemed to make a very tight semi-circular turn, then stopped,and became motionless. At this point, I thought it must be a helicopter, but I continued to watch it.  It gradually became a smaller red light, like it was moving straight up.  Then it seemed to stop again.  It appeared to be slowly spinning now, because about every 20 seconds, it seemed to have a dark band, running vertically. I continued to watch it (by now about 15 minutes had elapsed), I saw what looked like a short burst of silvery threads below it (about 2 inches proportionately in the sky ).  At this point, it had the appearance of a red star, in the sky, vs the earlier appearance of a low flying plane.  It then slowly disappeared, as if it was moving straight up.  The sky was clear that night, with no small moving clouds, in the area. I have been thinking about what I saw, since that morning and decided to search the internet, for a place to report it.

I am a affluent, professional, business man, rational, and not under the influence of drugs.  Once I foud your web site and read the other 2 sightings of the same object, I almost did not report it.

The object was first thought to be a large firework, but the object did not explode, nor did it stop rising after several  seconds. I then thought that it might be an airplane taking off, as the airport is in that general direction.  The object then appeared to stop rising and track horizontally and southward after it had risen approximately three finger widths at arms length.  At that point, the odd nature of the object instilled curiosity and a desire for further investigation.  I went outside, and through my binocularts tracked the object as it approached me at somewhat an obliwue angle.  My binocular power setting was high at first, and revealed what appeared to be two orange lights seperated by a small distance.  My hands were shakey, and at that power things were hard to focus, so my thought was that it was an airplane with wing-tipped landing/takeoff lights.  However, it struck me that the object was making no sound and the typical red and green marker lights were not seen. I then reduced the power on the binoculars, making it much easier to focus the object, and the thing I saw revealed itself.  The object had a large central orange ball of light, in which a smaller orange ball of light circled at approximately one orbit per second.  Several seconds later orange debree was seen falling from the object, and slowly fading in color, as though it were cooling, and disapperaed prior to reaching the level of the trees and houses across the way.  It was then that I thought the object might be burning material caught on an updraft and prevailing winds, but there were not winds sufficient enough to move the object across the sky as fast as it was travelling, nor did the object&apos;s shape and characteristic change after the falling debree.  I continued to track the object for several more seconds until it just vanished.  Through the entire incident no sound was heard, and no other color was seen other than the orange of the two balls of light.  Whether it was one object or two is not known to me.  I wonder if others have seen this same object and can confirm what I observed.", "Randomly flashing red and green lights at night. No visible body even when illuminated by lightning. Saw from commercial airliner.I was on a SW airline flight from San Jose to Phoenix, ~35,000 ft and 500 knots. I don&apos;t know the exact location because the plane flew futher west than usual to avoid a thunderstorm. We were over CA 15 minutes before because I recognized all of the city lights from the San Jauquin valley. Then everything went black, so I assumed we went far enough east to be in Nevada. I was looking at the lightning going mostly cloud to cloud in a 50 mile wide thunderhead to the east at about 40,000 feet. Then I saw red and green lights fly at a 90 degree angle to the plane (I was on the left side of the plane, and it was flying east. I assume we were flying south). It was flying at about 20,000 ft. I watched it for a few seconds, and didn&apos;t think much of it until I noticed how fast it was going. I spent four years in the Air Force, so I just thought it was a fighter. It was going at least 1,000 mph, because it was going at least twice as fast as other airliners going perpendicular to the one I was in. I always get a window seat and I spend most of my flying time looking out the window. Then I noticed that the lights were not flashing periodically like a plane, but randomly. Sometimes there were more than one red, and the lights didn&apos;t stay on for the same durations either. It actually looked like the whole aircraft was either red or green because I could not see an aircraft body unless it emitting either the red or green, even when lightning lit up the sky, which it did at least once. I watched it intensely. After about five seconds, it did a u-turn (changed its bearing by 170 degrees to about 280) in less than 100 milliseconds. Not only are there no planes that can do that, that stunt would have instantly killed anyone in the aircraft because of the g-forces. Then after about one-two seconds of heading almost straight toward the plane, but still 15,000 feet lower, it headed straight up to about 25,000 feet in less than one second. I figure one mile per second is 3,600 mph, straight up. Then it changed course and he! aded NE and disappeared into the thunderhead in less than one second, at a speed more then twice before. It seemed to be seeking out the lightning. In other words, If I was in an aircraft with that much capability, and I wanted to be hit by lightning, that&apos;s the exact flight path I would have took, assuming that I was coming from the west. About five minutes later, I asked the stewardess to ask the pilot if they saw anything on radar back then. They said no other aircraft in the vicinity for longer than that. After we landed, I told the pilot and he didn&apos;t seem to care and told me to report it to the FAA if i wanted to.

The object was somewhat boomerang shaped, the middle was more flattened out however, one source has labeled it a flying rod. A hair on a camera lens comes to mind, as does a tree twig, but the object was seen before it was photographed. The object appeared dark in color, the sun was out but there were numerous big white clouds in the sky. The day might be considered a day of filtered sunshine. (?) Beside myself as a witness, I was able to photograph 4 military aircraft flying by. The military planes were flying in a westward direction, as the object was moving past me in the sky in an eastward directn. The object maintained its shape from the time I saw it until I actually photographed it. After I photographed the object, I lost track of it. Note also that I have sent the photographs to Langley, AFB &amp; had received a thank-you letter from the commander at that time, now retired, but no explanation from the military as to what I had photographed. I don&apos;t think the object was any cause of the F-117 later crashing, believing the occurence to be something of a coincidence. This unknown was very obvious, but possibly very short lived in terms of duration: I believe nothing has been mentioned in the media about it.

However, I saw the shape seem to shrink and wondered at this until I realized it was moving east away from me. It moved or &quot;shrank&quot; very quickly and then suddenly began a southern line of flight again within 2 or 3 seconds. I watched it move south until tress blocked my view.

We have an International airport in the city, so I guessed Commercial Airlines used it as a waypoint, thus frequently passing overhead. Anyway, on this occasion, a strange thing happened.  As I stared at the aircraft&apos;s strobes flashing away, an object like a star (but without the twinkle) suddenly appeared at some distance behind the aircraft.  This object then suddenly sped up towards the airplane at incredible speed and stopped right behind it, then it started moving from side to side, as if studying the airplane.  It would move back abruptly, then suddenly flash forward, but never overtook the aircraft. What fascinated me was the irregularity in speed and distance to the airliner.  There was no pattern that would suggest some sort of light reflection or something like that.  Anyway, after trailing the Aircraft for about 20-25 seconds, it changed direction completely to the right, traveled some distance,(to scale with the aircraft, I would say about 10-15 lengths of the wingspan) then simply vanished.

The V was laying on its right side.  It looked like a flying &quot;less than&quot; symbol.  Only two edges were visible.  From what I could tell, there was no third line to connect the two arms.  There were no lights on it.  It moved very smoothly in only one direction.  It had to be very large.  There was no noise whatsoever.

It was unusually cold.  The wind was strong and from the NW, which is why we were walking backwards against it.  The location was roughly 100 yard west of a used-car lot (which is still there) and perhaps half a mile east of what was then Martini&apos;s diner.  The sky was bright with stars.

It was impossible to judge its size.  Relatively speaking it was about the size of a full moon.  Because the tree line was about one or two miles away, the sphere must have been of considerable real size.  It wobbled slowly upward and in our direction until it was almost directly overhead, then made an abrupt turn to its left.  By this time my friend and I had stopped walking and had begun waving and shouting at it.  It wobbled in the same falling-leaf motion until it disappeared over the horizon to the north.

I thought perhaps it was a reflection from a near-by carnival or something, so, when I got the opportunity, I looked as to try and quell her uneasiness.  Then I saw it as well.  It was about 10-12 blue slashes of light in an oval shape.  Once again I thought it was an reflection of something, but when it followed us from half-way between DC and Baltimore to Baltimore, I knew it was no such thing.

Both the unidentified object and the passenger airplane hovered as if set upon invisible pedestals, while the jet flying ovetr the u.f.o. was ascending quickly, either to investigate/attack the u.f.o, or to avoid its path.

Was reported before but did not get posted.  Was on another short vacation in Colorado in Buena Vista Colorado and stayed at the Rainbow Lake Resort located almost at the top of Cottonwood Pass.  While on a wind down walk with my mother-in-law, we both stopped to view the many stars in the sky that we otherwise could not see where we live in Texas.  While gazing at the stars we both noticed, at the same time, some movement within the milky way star groups.  What appeared to be a star that was stationary began to move and drop out of formation.  We figured it was a star burning out and shooting across space.  With further viewing with the binoculars we both noticed that it slowed down from going north and then started changing colors to blues, purples greens, orange in many revolutions of colors then it fired back into the star group within the milky way.  Strange to see this, we both thought, then the object zapped out of the group again and then with incredible speed zig zagged across the sky like no jet or object of flight the man can build. The directions were qucik and precise and at angles that no airplane we could design. I am ex-Air Force Special OPS and have never seen this display of exact super speed movement.  My mother in law proceeded to ask me what that was, and I advised that we may have just experienced a UFO.  The object continued to change direction back and forth at different angles and of course changing colors in its movement.  The colors seemed to increase in speed with the super fast speed of its directional changes.  Then the object became almost stationary but still showing very slight movement....moving northward.  Then the colors became intense and the objects colors started a revolving movement and it increased in speed faster than any jet I have known of...and proceeded north in the direction of Canada across the sky at very high speeds until it just disappeared. My mother-in-law to this date does not want to talk about what we saw that night.  She i! s a very Christian women and this defied her beliefs.  My understanding of this UFO is that it is not of our world, and if it is our government toy, we stole or enhanced the technology from another world to make this happen.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date may be approximate.

I have wondered about it since. After we watched it hover there, all of the sudden it took off over the horizon. But we thought it went down a couple of blocks over in my neighborhood. So, we went on our bicycles to see where it landed. Then we realized that it had gone over the horizon and not in our neighborhood. It was an inexplainable experience.

PD))Flickering Golden Lights in NJThe original story from the Star Lerger.  Police received about 15 calls, 75 cars stopped on NJ Turnpike to watch, even the police themselves saw it.  Newark airport, National Weather Service, and McGuire AFB all report no explanation.  No planes, no unusual weather, no air force. Late-night Carteret light show a mystery 07/16/01 BY DORE CARROLL STAR-LEDGER STAFF A drowsy mother in Carteret saw the flickering golden lights in the sky and ran for her camera. A hard-boiled Navy veteran traveling the New Jersey Turnpike spotted the slow-moving, bright-yellow V-formation and pulled his car to the shoulder to get a better look. Police officers on patrol at 12:40 a.m. yesterday couldn&apos;t believe their eyes. Within the hour, Carteret police dispatchers said they heard from at least 15 callers reporting strange orange flares blazing high above the Arthur Kill. The eerie glow had people at backyard barbecues mesmerized, with heads upturned and mouths agape. Almost 75 vehicles pulled over on the New Jersey Turnpike to watch the spectacle. But no one seems to know what caused the luminous vision. Police could not identify the source of the lights, and Newark International Airport authorities reported no unusual flight patterns. A meteorologist with the National Weather Service said nothing in the atmosphere would have caused the bright disturbance, and an airman at McGuire Air Force Base said none of their military planes were in the air at that hour. Whatever it was that lit up the sky above Carteret was by all accounts weird. &quot;It wasn&apos;t fireworks, and it couldn&apos;t have been a hot-air balloon, not at night near the airfield,&quot; said Steven Vannoy, who pulled over on the turnpike with his girlfriend on their way home to Perth Amboy. &quot;What we saw last night qualifies as a UFO. It was an unidentifiable flying object.&quot; A Carteret police sergeant on duty called the State Police and neighboring departments in Linden and Woodbridge to find out what was causing the strange glow, but he said none had received reports of the lights. Bob Wanton, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Mount Holly, had no explanation for the lights. &quot;Weatherwise, there was nothing that would have caused it,&quot; he said. The aurora borealis, a spectacular show of light high in the northern hemisphere, is seldom visible in New Jersey, said Wanton. The lights normally appear in the winter, he said. &quot;It&apos;s very unusual for the northern lights to come down this far, especially at this time of year,&quot; he said. On Staten Island, a spokeswoman for the 123rd precinct in the Tottenville section suggested the display might have come from a nightclub on Arthur Kill Road that frequently uses search lights for promotions. The club had been ordered closed by a judge on July 11 and its phone was disconnected yesterday. Airman First Class Andre Steverson said no planes from McGuire Air Force Base were flying at that time. An operations manager at Newark International Airport said there were no reports of unusual activity and said the lights &quot;could have been almost anything,&quot; from a group of military helicopters on flight exercises to a blimp. Maybe, said David Stich, who saw the bursts of light from his back yard in Carteret. But those flares didn&apos;t look to him like spotlights or anything else he could recognize. &quot;I never in my life saw anything like it,&quot; said Stich, a lifelong Carteret resident accustomed to the roar and flight path of aircraft from Newark. He compared the lights to volleyballs, dwarfing the surrounding stars, and said they clearly moved in formation. Around the corner, Pam Russell&apos;s husband woke her to see the show. She saw a diamond-shaped pattern in the sky and noticed smaller lights leading the pack and bringing up the rear. &quot;I ran for my camera,&quot; said Russell. &quot;But they disappeared.&quot; Afterward, she said, the skies were dark and silent.((END ARTICLE))", "We saw a fast moving green light  (with no tail) in the sky above the horizon and just below the moon.My Boyfriend and I were coming home from seeing a movie in Rockford.  It was about 11:30 p.m. when we saw a bright green light &quot;shoot&quot; across the sky moving in a southwest direction.  The light moved in a straight line at a very high velocity, with no tail.  From the moment we first saw it, it seemed as though it appeared out of nowhere, it shot acroos the sky and disappeared in an instant. The light seemed to be traveling just below the moon. Even though it was a little after the 4th of July, it traveled much to far and fast to be any type of fire work or flare.  My boyfriend and I don&apos;t particularly believe in aliens, but what we saw couldn&apos;t be identified or explained by either of us.", "Daylight sphere/orb follows above conventional aircraftI was outside my house a few minutes ago and looking up into the sky to see what the cloudcover was for the day, when my eyes caught sight of a very normal appearing aircraft of some type (unsure as to whether it was commercial or military) traveling at a normal speed from due north to south.  I wouldn&apos;t have even given this aircraft a second look had it not been for what I saw ABOVE it. I witnessed a definite orb/sphere shape above this aircraft.  The orb/sphere looked to be somewhere on the lines of about 500 or less feet above the conventional aircraft and was flying in PERFECT unison with the &quot;normal&quot; craft.  As both crafts moved overhead I was able to see the glint of the sun off of them at one point, and this is how I could best relate to the shape of the orb/sphere.  I am not a pilot or in-the-know about flight altitudes; however, I estimate that the conventional craft was at about an altitude of 20,000-25,000 feet and, as mentioned, the orb/sphere was about 500 or so feet above the conventional aircraft.  I have never seen two planes fly so closely above one another and in perfect unison unless, of course, I was watching an air show.  Also, as mentioned I could distinctly see that the uppermost craft was of an orb/sphere shape. This event occurred at 10:38 a.m. (Pacific) time.  Once that I observed the spherical nature of the uppermost craft, I immediately ran back inside to get my camera.  I did take a photo of the crafts as they travelled away from me, but by the time that I got back outside with my camera (about 20-25 seconds later), they were both a considerable distance away.  If the photo turns-out I will most assuredly send it to you. The day was clear with sparse clouds.  This was a daylight sighting.

As we were returning home, we were passing through this small town when I looked at the driver and he was staring straight ahead.  When I asked him if he was okay, he just looked at me with a terrifying gaze and said...do you see those lights?  I was in the front passenger seat and hadn&apos;t noticed them because of the color of the lights in his vehicle reflecting off the inside of the glass anyway.  To our left (south) through the trees we could see a grouping of lights (about 20) moving along with us at the same speed we were traveling, about 30 feet off the ground.  There is a mountain ridge also to our south, and the lights were below the ridgeline, between us and the ridge, and appeared to be about 300-500 yards away.  The lights were all blue and randomly scattered about the object.  The color could best be described as a cold electric blue.  They didn&apos;t flash or rotate.  We stopped the vehicle about a mile down the road and the object also stopped.  It span of the lights were about 100 feet and were about 20-30 feet high.  We could see the lights very well through the trees.  It just stayed there as we got out (and got a soda).  There was no sound.  When we left a couple of minutes later...it continued to &quot;follow&quot; us until we went through a cut in the hill.  When we came out the other side (the valley opens wider), the object burst out from behind the hill into the open and immediately flew over the south ridge.  We never saw it again.  We knew &quot;what&quot; we had seen and it still gives me chillbumps to think about it.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "On July 27,2001 I saw lights that outlined a large oval from which three other bright white lights detached and flew away. fromI was locking the doors and putting out the lights on my roof terrace which overlooks New Jersey and the Hudson River. It was a beautiful night with small clouds and patches of sky in between.  There was an oval of diffused white light which appeared to be coming from behind the clouds.  Only th outline or the rim of the object was illuminated. It seemed as if it were over New Jersey, but I could not see any beams of light coming up from the ground. I moved away from the door and windows to turn out the terrace lights--literally an instant--and when I looked again it was gone.  I watched the sky for a couple of minutes and all of a sudden I could see it again.  It appeared as if it switched the lights on and off and had been there all the time.  It had just not been illuminated which is why I could not see it.When the lights came on again, they started off a soft lavender color and then went to pink and possibly green.  Again very diffused soft colors.  Photographs I have seen of the aurora borealis came to mind.  But this light was stationery.  No movement  The first time this light turned off was 3:04 in the morning. I believe it turned off once or twice again. I believe that one time it turned off when a helicopter went down the Hudson River.  After the helicopter was out of sight three balls of light (one at each end of the oval and one in the middle) flew away from the central light and instantly disappeared. They flew faster then any plane  I have ever seen.  I believe this happened at least three times.  The closest visual analogy I could make is the huge craft that the scientists played the music for in &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind.&quot;  As a matter of fact this object looked exactly the same.  My friend was sleeping soundly during this so I called WCBS and ABC (whose studios overlook the same  part of New Jersey as I do ). I wanted to see if anyone else had phoned in after seeing this.  The people at both numbers were polite but obviously didn&apos;t believe me.  At 3AM I&apos;m sure that many of th! eir call s are from people who are far from sober.  My friend heard me on the phone and woke up.  I excitedly told him what had happened, but since there was nothing in the sky now he had difficulty understanding what I was talking about.  However, as we were watching the sky, I saw a faint light, then two.  Once I brought them to his attention, he could see them, but since he hadn&apos;t seen the entire object as I had, they didn&apos;t mean much to him.  As I noticed a third light appearing, they suddenly flew off whoosh into the skies behind us. That he saw.  He couldn&apos;t figure out any logical explanation either nor could I.  I am aware that people in Virginia and some of the other southeastern states had seen something which was described as a fireball in the week prior to my experience.  What I saw was nothing like a fireball.  It was almost as if someone were projecting a slide from &quot;Close Encounters&quot; onto the clouds. I am retired, although I am only 55 years old.  I was the president of a company which  manufactured women&apos;s clothing. The most unusual thing I have ever seen in the sky was what I believe was a fireball over the Pacific off Tahiti.  The reason it was described as a fireball was that it looked like a bright meteor travelling horizontally.  What I saw over New Jersey was not a natural phenomena.  It was perfectly shaped and would appear and disappear as if someone were flipping a switch. I am terribly interested in knowing if anyone else saw this that night.  There are millions of people in New York.  Granted few are looking at the sky at 3AM, but someone had to see this.  It was huge.  I would also like to know about other sightings of objects similar to this. In the space for number of craft seen, I answered four.  I decided on this figure because I saw one huge craft and no more than three others at any one time.  However because three craft flew off at least three times, I have no way of knowing if they were different craft each time.", "Hello Peter,JIm ((name deleted--UFO investigator from Oregon)) suggested I send this to you.What: Don&apos;t knowWhere: Iron Mtn.

PD))", "Two solid ovoid objects with occasional light flashes drift like balloons overhead, but against the windSeveral friends and I were taking a break from remodeling a newly-purchased duplex in northwest Denver, standing on the porch and chatting.  I am a sales professional and the other witnesses are business owners and real estate investors, all in our mid-thirties.  There had been some nearby thunderstorms during the afternoon and early evening, with sporadic sprinkles and a cool breeze.  At 7:20 the sky was partly cloudly, with more storm clouds beginning to develop and move in from the mountains.  As I was facing east, I noticed a tiny black dot in the sky about 20 or 30 degrees above the horizon, and appearing to move west very slowly.  I observed that it was not a bird, so I said to my friends, &quot;Look, there&apos;s a UFO&quot; and pointed.  I said it was probably a helicopter, but whatever it was, at this point it was a UFO, and my most skeptical friend said, &quot;Yes, exactly, it&apos;s an &apos;unidentified flying object,&quot; with a little laugh.  It &quot;drifted&quot; our direction much like a balloon would, and initially, that&apos;s what I judged it to be.  As it got closer to being overhead, I could see that it was actually not a balloon.  It was moving in a very deliberate fashion against the wind. The clouds were not moving fast by any means, but they were slowly drifting eastward, while this object moved steadily westward.  I grabbed some binoculars from inside and another of my friends had binoculars in her car, so she ran and grabbed them, and we watched as the object flew directly overhead.  Only two of us were incredibly interested in the sighting, so we looked at it through our binoculars.  I considered it to be football-shaped, and she thought it oval.  It was a dark reddish-brown colour -- very solid and not self-luminous.  But as it went over, we both saw a pinpoint light flash on the middle of the bottom surface a few times.  &quot;Did you see that flash?&quot; I yelled, still looking through the binoculars, and she said, &quot;Yes, I definitely saw a flash!&quot;  At that point, we both felt sure that this was not an explainable event.  We cou! ldnt&apos; fi gure out, of all things, what would present itself like this.  Not a plane, not a helicopter, not a balloon, not a blimp, but an apparent ovoid-type craft with a single light which flashed just a few times, which we could only see when it was overhead.  It still appeared to be &quot;floating&quot; like a balloon, without slowing or changing directions, but more with intention.  From the time I spotted it to the time it disappeared into the clouds to the west, it was probably close to 5 minutes, though we didn&apos;t keep track on a watch.  We both estimated the altitude of the object at between 1 to 2 miles, but it was hard to judge.  I figured it must have been about 20 to 30 feet in length and probably 2/3rds as wide, and it was traveling in the direction of it&apos;s longest length.  Again, the true size is hard to judge, but the apparent size was approximately one centimeter at an arm&apos;s length as it flew overhead.  When we lost sight of it, we both chatted excitedly about what we had seen for a few minutes, and then I spotted another apparently-identical craft directly south of our location, moving west.  It was on a trajectory about 20 degrees south of the first object, so it did not pass directly overhead as the first one did.  We lost sight of it within a minute as it flew right into a cloud, and never did catch this one through binoculars.  But it looked like the same type of object and it was moving at the same apparent speed as the first one, and in the same direction.  Once again, I looked at the clouds to confirm their movement, and they were driftly slowly eastward.  So whatever these UFOs were, they were deliberately flying westward at a steady rate of speed.", "driving  into town when car just died thats when we saw a yellowish oval floating overheadwe were leaving friends house heading home. outside mccamey about 7 miles the car just died. we got out and checked under the hood. we counldnt find anything wrong. we were about to get back in the car when we noticed an oval object hovering overhead. it was a hazy yellowish color. it suddenly zoomed off and the car started back up after it was gone.((NUFORC Note;  Source is anonymous.

With the exception of a few high level clouds (cirrus), it was a clear day, 80 degrees.  Looking over the top of Fry&apos;s electronics in Wilsonville, I noticed what I first thought to be a black mylar baloon floating above the parking lot.  I looked again, and noticed that it was stationary even though there was a slight wind moving approximately 5 knots to the Southeast.  I looked again, and realized that it was not a baloon, but was much larger and farther away than I first thought.  I pulled into the Les Schwab parking lot on the North side of town center loop, stopped the car, and looked at it in more detail.  We get a lot of aircraft in our vicinity since we are essentially in the Northern approach to Aurora airport.  I thought that this might be one of the larger hellicopters that are operated by Evergreen Aviation, a Sykorski Sky-Crane, or similar. What struck me is that this thing was hovering , then moved toward the South.  There was no sign of the rotor on top (normally I can see the disk that&apos;s formed by the rotor), there were no lights of any type (strange, being in the Northern approach of the Aurora Airport, and within an hour of dusk), no sound, no protrusions out the side for wings, no tail, nothing.  I called on my cell phone to a friends house where I had just left.  I explained what I was seeing, (I told her as it was happening that it was hovering, then moving to the West, then moved upward, then away to the South again.  I asked if she could see it from her house (less than 1/4 mile away).  She ran out and looked where I was describing, I lost the signal from her cordless phone and drove back to her house.  I didn&apos;t find her at home, and decided that I must have passed her somewhere on the road without seeing her.  I back tracked my route and found her standing down the street pointing to it.  She said that It had continued to move away to the South and that she had watched it for 5 minutes.  I could no longer see it since it had just become a dot in the sky, and I had lost sight of it while driving.  She continued to watch it, until we decided that it had dissapeared into the distance, and drove back to her house. The best way to describe its shape is the following: I was viewing it primarily from the end rather than the bottom of the object.  It was roughly triangle shaped as viewed from the end, but had rounded corners on all three corners.  I described it to my friend as shaped like one of the black licorice candies you get at the theater.  When I was describing it to her on the phone earlier, I said it was like a pyramid shape, but with rounded corners.  My friend said that she saw it moving straight up, but that when she viewed it, that it had not gone into the clouds, but had continued to move upward, and had made a jog backward to avoid going through the clouds she saw.  We compared our timelines, and decided that the cloud I saw it go through was before she had arrived at a location where she could see it, and that when she watched it, it had continued to climb, but avoided the other clouds on its way up. Compared to all other aircraft we see in the Wilsonville area in and around airports, this thing moved really slowly.  I have experience being in and around aircraft, have flown in and piloted light aircraft including helicopters, and can not explain what I saw.  I think that several other people may have seen this object since it passed over Interstate 5 in the vicinity somewhere between Boone Bridge (Willamette River) and the Donald exit (5 miles to the south of Wilsonville).

Just before dark, we (my mother, sister, brother, my mother&apos;s niece and myself) were standing in the yard talking and just looking at a clear evening sky.  We noticed a bright light (about double the brightness of Venus) streaking from the south to north.  It appeared to be very high in the sky.  Just as it got nearly overhead, the (light) divided into two lights and each turned abruptly, one east, the other west.  The turn was immediate, not in a slow arc as you would expect.  Each object then disappeared over the horizon...one east the other west.  We knew we had seen something, but didn&apos;t understand what it could have been.  The speed at which this object moved was not dissimilar to the speed of a meteor, and the objects were gone in a matter of seconds.

I saw, looking northwest (more North than West), about 45-50 degrees up into the horizon, a moving object going from North to West in a steep, downward, diagonal trajectory. It was an ORANGE  fireball, which went by very quickly. After but three seconds or so of viewing, it then disappeared (and not behind any object, nor did it appear to even come close to the ground.

The orange ball that I saw was very pure in color, and I did not notice any hot (white spots), or any other colors, nor did it seem to have any gaseous or particulate streams associated with it. I didn&apos;t call anyone, or any organization as I thought in my mind I had seen a meteor, and, it&apos;s no big deal.... but what got me - thinking about it afterwards - was that it&apos;s spakler tails appeared to be even in shape, and intensity.

I departed from Fort Lauderdale around 9:00pm in my car and with my cat on Interstate 95 North.  Around mile marker 167 on Interstate 95, south of Daytona Beach, I was listening to my Yanni cassette while driving 70 mph on a dark empty northbound freeway, looking around for any sign of town lights because it was very desolate in that particular area.  It was a scattered cloudy night with patches of clear Florida sky about 3:00 am on Tuesday morning, June 19, 2001.  I was looking around the road ahead when something caught my eye to the right.  At first, I thought it was going to be one of those bright beacon lights for aircraft on a hillside.  When I turned my head eastbound to look up to check what it was, I was captivated by the sight I saw through my windshield.  I immediately took my foot off the gas pedal and on my brakes to slow down as I watched this bright orange rectangular object, positioned in a vertical &quot;I&quot; angle in the night sky, gliding smoothly from behind one cloud in a horizontal direction and it disappeared behind another cloud.  I kept looking at that cloud for about five minutes to see if the object would appear on the cloud&apos;s opposite side, but nothing happened.  The bright orange rectangular object seemed to move quickly in a straight direction between those two clouds, therefore, I assumed it would fly out from the other side of the second cloud.  I had to take my gaze off this object every 30 seconds to watch the dark freeway ahead of me (which was a level straight stretch), so I was able to watch this strange object for approximately two minutes.  There were no rocket flares (I&apos;ve seen the Fort Lauderdale Air Show on May 5th where Navy jets flew at night through clouds so I recognize the rocket glare from behind the aircraft and how it made the clouds glow), no extra lights emitted from it, no trail or glow of this object as it flew behind the second cloud.  I checked my mirrors and ! around t he dark stretch of freeway for other vehicles or road lights, but I was the only one on that part of dark Interstate 95 at that moment as my car&apos;s speed was down to 40 mph.

I did not want to wake her in fear of her possibly scaring the craft away by getting up and screaming. I was frozen in fear and curiosity. I watched the craft slowly slip by, stopping for a few seconds at a time and continuing. There was a very slight hum amongst the silence around me. It was very eerie. At one moment, the craft emitted a dull blue beam from the far edge of disc as though it was searching for something. When this craft, which was now clearly visible as a shiny disc, came to a complete stop again, I crawled towards it hoping it didn&apos;t detect me. I kept thinking that this craft might have infrared or heat sensors to detect any movement outside, but there was no deviation from its course/task. At one point, the craft got to about 2 feet from the ground and the humming became louder.

I live on a corner lot next to a large park. I was standing at the corner waiting for my dogs to catch up, when I saw what I thought was a lightning bug across the street at the park. I followed this green/ yellowish light as it went streight up slowly. When I first saw it, the light was already above the tree line, so I could&apos;nt tell how close it was. I thought it odd that it was&apos;nt flickering, just getting smaller. Then the light started moving south to north. I never heard a sound as it flew its course. I thought it must be a heliocopter and did&apos;nt take my eyes off of it because I thought it was interesting that I could&apos;nt hear it yet. As it got midway between the park and my house I could tell that it was not assending any longer and I could see some reflection from the city lights on the underside of the craft. It&apos;s then when I could&apos;nt belive what I was seeing. I saw a round saucer shape with only one green yellowish light at the rear of the object. As it went north iI was able to follow it north untill it slowly went out of sight. I thought to myself, Did I just see what I thought I saw! I could not tell how high the craft was, how fast it was moving, or hear any sound at all. I do know that the cloud deck that night was around 8000 ft ASL. and winds aloft were less than 5 knots. The craft never went behind the clouds the whole time that I saw it, so I know it was under 8000 ft. I,ve never seen anything like this before....Ever!", "unlike anything  i had ever seenI am so pleased to finally be able to tell someone about this experiance In those days we were at war in angola and alot was top secret I was picking up a friend to go to the airport for a conferance, this is our summer time, in those days i new a lot about aircraft as i was amember of the local historical aviation society and had, had to give up flying in1974 because of the fuel crisis. If you look at a map of the cape peninsula, thats at the botom of africa I was standing at a place called froggy farm, south of simonstown, where the railway ends looking across a bay known as false bay towards the hottentots holland mountains the craft flew from left to right. in those days the airports opend at 0700((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The moon was so bright I didn&apos;t need my headlights. I noticed some lights to my right moving my way. I watched the lights move toward me. I just thought it was a helicopter. I had the truck window down and begin to realize I couldn&apos;t hear any noise and the lights were moving closer. Curious I pulled over and stoped the truck. The lights were getting quite close by now and I still couldn&apos;t hear any noise. So I turned the motor off and called to my wife who was sleeping in the sleeper. I got out of the truck and realized that craft was directly above me. The craft set motionlessly about 20 feet above me. The craft was cicular in shape and the edges were curved up like a ball. It was about 100 feet in diameter. The bottom of the craft was made up of hugh metal sheets that looked like they had been exposed to supreme heat. The craft set directly above me for about 5 minutes. The hugh craft hovering silently above me was to much I begin to get scared. As I started to get back in the truck the craft started to move away. As I said before the moon was so bright I could see for miles in the open desert. The craft started moving and within seconds was out of sight. All of this was done without the slightest sound.

We looked through the binoculars and saw a oval shape with a row of colours in the centre of the craft. We saw this for about three nights and we thought it was weird just sitting there but we saw some times more than one object eg. sitting in the sky and a yellow flash (shape of a dot) came up (mean while driving) and then we went behind a building and when i went to look next it was gone. There was another time how 2 more came out of the one flashing then the centre one shimmered side ways and then dissapeared.((NUFORC Note:  Sighting seems consistent with sighting of celestial body.

We had crossed the boarder of Wyoming, headed in a westerly direction through Montana.  We&apos;d approached some foothills, exited off the I, and had taken a scenic, two lane road, bordered by trees on both sides.  It was approaching dusk, still bright, but the sun beginning to recede.  I was in the passenger seat with the window down, staring at the scenery.  Suddenly, a fireball rose up from behind the tree line on the right side of the road, lolled over the hood of the car, and disappeared behind the tree line on the right, as if to crash. It made a nearly perfect arc over the road and our car hood, directly in front of us.  I believe I managed to count to four as the fireball appeared and disappeared, but my friend stated it was closer to three seconds in total sighting.  To all remaining details we agree.  The fireball was orange, regular flame color on top, but was a striking green on its underside and at the edges toward the front of the object.  It looked almost as though the fireball &quot;housed&quot; a hard object; as though something the size of a VW Bug had been enveloped in flame and catapulted across the road.  If one dipped a wadded piece of paper in gas, lit it, and swung it on a string in a slow circle, you&apos;d approach the effect.  It moved so slowly there was very little if any trail. The track it took would have made a perfect circle if one used the center line of the road as circle&apos;s center; the fireball entering our view seeming from directly behind the tree line, and descending directly behind the opposing tree line.  It sputtered as well.  The effect was similar to grinding a piece of pitted metal on a wheel.  Sudden bursts of flame and sparks jettisoned from it.  From its appearance and close proximity, we would have expected the fireball to make a noise like an approaching express train, yet the was none.  Part of the oddness of the event was the fact there was no sound whatever.  We could hear ourselves gasping at the sight. My friend immediately pulled the car to the ditch, and we tensed, waiting for the sound of a crash or explosion.  There was complete silence; not even a sound of birds or crickets.  It was as eerie a silence as you could imagine.  We debated on whether to leave the car parked on the highway and hike into the brush toward the fireball&apos;s point of decent, but decided not to.  Equally odd, we discussed it for a few minutes, shook our heads, and promptly forgot about the event until five or six years ago. I have since scoured the web and books for pictures of entering meteors that looked similar to what we saw.  Nothing even approaches it.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke by telephone with this witness and found him to be quite credible.  We suspect the event is accurately portrayed, although the date may be approximate.  It was at about this time that a major and celebrated sighting of something occurred, and was photographed with a movie camera, over Montana, the witness reports, as well.

The site at an elevation of approximately 350&apos; was close to the ocean which was directly to the east. 2 Fishing vessels were observed on the ocean earlier in the evening but had moved from the area. The area is within 3nm of an airport and also a transatlantic route for aircraft. Equipped with a 5&quot; wide field refractor I was joined by 2 friends at 10:00EST and spent an hour touring the totally clear skies looking at different star and galaxy formations. We were also observant of numerous &quot;high flyers&quot; (aircraft), satellites and the occasional &quot;shooting star&quot;. At 11:00, one of my friends spotted an elliptical light toward the ocean and brought our attention to it. It moved very slowly from North to South, then at the same slow speed and direction descended. It ascended and headed directly due east until it completely faded from view. While transitting from North to South, it was observed through the telescope which revealed an elliptical source of light at the &quot;front&quot; and a blinking light towards the back. First thought: aircraft, possibly helicopter. Not likely. Myself and one of the other people present are experienced observers, also involved in the aviation industry and knowledgable of aircraft activities in the area.

The skies were clear, there was no precipitation.  I was sitting on a couch in the lounge reading when out of the corner of my eye I saw something big, red and moving.  Looking out the window I saw a very large RED FIREBALL descending rather slowly, apparently over the north Sound area.  It was quite large, appearing to be nearly half the size of the almost-full moon.  It was extremely bright, a glaring reddish-pink in color.  It was definitely burning as it fell, not sparkling or hazy, no diminishment in size as it arced downward through the sky.  I watched it as it went behind the 3 radio towers located atop Queen Anne hill - I could clearly see the framework of the towers illuminated from behind as the fireball descended behind them.  It then fell out of sight behind Queen Anne hill itself.  There were no bits of debris of any sort that flew off the fireball as it fell, no ejecta, just a BIG red ball lazily falling through the night sky.  I was miles away, and this thing, whatever it was, was huge.  Needless to say, I have no idea what it was I saw.((NUFORC Note:  This report may address an apparent emergency flare that was reported by a tugboat, whose crew reported that they thought it was somewhere over Lake Union.

It was moving fast and began to come closer to the ground and to our car.  When we stopped at the stop light it stopped also.  When we turned right it turned right and followed us at the same speed.  We would slow down and so did it and so on.  As we approached the nexted stop light it stopped again.  We turned left and then it turned left.

I saw it pass, but as it did I saw what I believed to be another satelite but it was moving much faster and coming in from the west and heading east. I started watching it when it changed course slightly north. It was late so I thought I was tired and seeing things until it stopped and sat there for about 30 secs before it started moving again.

After about 5 minutes of this I ran and grabbed my camcorded to try to record it. I woke up my wife and asked her to come out but she was half asleep and told me I was dreaming so I ran outside with the camcorder. I couldn&apos;t see the satelite size objects in the viewfinder but recorded anyway and kept speaking so I could explain what I was seeing if the tape didn&apos;t come out.

I stayed at Salmon lake in a cabin for a week with my family, so that is why I do not have all the location information. I had never seen anything like them before, looking at them made me afraid, for whatever reasons I am still trying to understand. The lights were near the horizon and very bright. The light they emitted was a white light. The first light I saw was the brightest. It cast a reflection on the lake. It had 3 different shapes that it kept alternating into every few minutes. The first shape looked like two balls that were stuck together, then it appeared to move closer to me and would turn into a five point star, then it appeared to be moving farther away from me and change into a fine point of light. The light did have an aura around, but you had to look hard to see it. The light appeared to be stationary. A few times it did move rather rapidly, but would stay in near the same place as it moved. The first time I saw it move was when it made a figure 8. A few other times it moved ever so slightly, but didn&apos;t really go anywhere. It also made a few &quot;sparkles&quot; but that only happened when other aircraft came near it. I saw 5-6 planes go near the two objects, it was hard to see them becuase that didn&apos;t have very bright lights flashing like most air liners you see. The planes could have been from the military, it looked like one of them shot a missile at it one time, (that is when I saw the first &quot;sparkle&quot;) but I dont know if that idea would be true, or becusae I have wathced to many &quot;UFO&quot; shows in the past. The 2nd ufo I saw was higher in the sky than the 1st, and it stayed in the same spot the whole time I was watching. It was not as bright and was about 1/2 the size as the 1st light.

What was espesially different about them is that their was a pattern to their changing quanity, some what of a fibbinocii sequence.

These objects were difficult to see against the dark night sky, but were more visible when they passed below scattered clouds.  They gave off no light,made no sound and could be mistaken for night flying birds if they were nit so fast.  The two outboard objects came close together and then return to their original posions.  The object did not seem to oscillate ,flap or vibrate.  My best guess as to the altitude was 3000-4000 feet.((NUFORC Note:  Three reports of these objects, seen on this night, and also several nights later.

It was a beautiful, silent summer evenening, without any wind.  The sky (and clouds) had some red and orange colors of the sun.  I was in the living room when my father &amp; mother called me to come and take a look at the sky.  There was something &apos;rare&apos; they said.  My father had his pocket-telescope and we looked at it.  Actually it was my mother who noticed it first.  She must have got goooood eyes because the object was very small (because it was far away).  By the time i was watching, a friend of mine came in the kitchen too (we were all watching through the window in the kitchen) and he saw it too, even without glasses.  I took the telescope and looked at the thing.  It was a glittering thing that didn&apos;t move.  I could see that it didn&apos;t move because it was placed between two electrical wires (it was much much further than the wires of course, but it was a reference).   I continued to stare at the glittering thing, and saw that it took different colors.  I don&apos;t know if they came from the sun or what, but the colors slightly differed (which my friend confirms).  The thing was hanging there for 3 or 4 minutes (that we know) and i (we) didn&apos;t stop staring.  Suddenly it started moving up at a constant speed.  It wasn&apos;t sensational fast, but if you consider the distance it must have been away from us,it can&apos;t have moved very slow neither.  So the thing rose and then there was a real FAT cloud after the thing.  First we (me, my parents and my friend ) really thought it was an aircraft that was crashing! It seemed to be falling. It&apos;s a kind of cloud you see after a BOEING aircraft but at least 10 times broader.  The cloud had an orange color (was it a reflection from the sun? it did have approximately the same color) and was moving fast (not from our point of view, but again considered the distance...).  After 1 minute or something the cloud was suddenly vanished.  We looked around and some little further there was again this little tiny glittering object that ! we saw b efore the clouds were there.  Then me &amp; my friend saw the different colors again. After 1 minute it restarted moving.  It was moving further away from us.  Again, when it started moving, these clouds appeared.  When the clouds were there, you couldn&apos;t see the object.  Okay, it was real far away from us now, so me and my friend jumped in the car and drove into the direction where it was located.  I had the pocket-telescope with me, i could still see the thing from inside the car.  It was really un-necessary for us to move, because it went MUCH faster than we did, so we drove back home.  The last thing i saw (at home again) was the cloud (but very far away), i stared at it, but at once it was gone. i never saw it back. In my opinion, it was no balloon, that&apos;s too slow An aircraft... i don&apos;t know, i&apos;ve never seen such big clouds after a plane.  Besides, what aircraft can hang still in the air? I have absolutely no idea what this was, but it was a strange phenomena. I&apos;m not making this up, i&apos;m too tired for jokes... Maybe someone else has seen something like this too, or maybe it can be explained... I hope to find an answer or hear about it. Bye...", "I worked on my computer as my friend told me over internet i should look at the sky. I called my mother and we saw a glowing light,seemed to be not far away,after that i saw an orange light moving very fast from left to right. At this time,6 of us saw these objects. I called my friend and we met late in the night to watch out for more objects.In this night we saw more orange lights moving on the sky and then flying away with very high speed.Like in Star Trek if the spaceship warps in hyperroom.((NUFORC Note:  This report, indeed, was submitted from an e-mail address in Germany.

It was a reasonably clear cool night with good visabilty.  There was some cloud but not that much.  I know that the object was very high and due to its looking very much like a shaped star (star in the night sky sense not geometrical) i feel it was either a satelight or something i something else i hope you can exsplain.  It took approx 1-2 mins to traverese across the night sky in and out of cloud cover until it disapeared from site.  Can you confirm if this was a satelight or something else?  Did anyone else see this?  This light appeared about 20 seconds after a plane heading south had passed overhead.

It was a very clear night and there was no clouds there was only one explanation what it could be, an alien scout...", "White oval shaped object over Edwards Hospital in Naperville ILWe were driving around 2 friends and I, when I looked up at the sky and saw a white oval shaped craft slowly floating above us, Id say about 20000feet, just where the clouds began to get thick, i got the attention of the driver, and the passenger to see it, they both confirmed it being there. Meanwhile at a stop sign still observing, I caught the attention of a motorcyclist to also see the object. We then parked and I just happened to carry my sony cybershot s30 camera with, i managed to take pictures of the direction the craft was in, but since the camera had no light filter , the pictures are bright, the craft was hidden in a cloud over &quot;Edwards Hospital&quot; I took as many pictures as i could if you would like them i will email them as soon as i getem off the camera, i even turned on the &quot;negative&quot; camera affect to try and get the object to stand out in a few pictures.", "Fireball inside a cloud on the ocean in the Bermuda Triangle area.I live on the Ocean in Florida.  I took out the dog at 9 PM and noticed a cloud about 5 miles out in the ocean East north East of our East facing condo that was all lit up from the inside as if a continous bolt of lightning was inside the cloud.  Then I saw a very intense light like a fireball come out of the cloud horizantaly to the West  then go back into it.  I ran and grabed my video camera and began taping this when a second cloud lit up.  The lights faded after a couple more minutes.  As I waited for the lights to return, I could hear a small airplane near by but could not see it.  Then it appeared in the street lights as it flew low over some houses south of hear.  The plane had NO lights and was coming from the direction of the clouds out in the ocean.  I had just enough time to point and film the airplane with the camera on night shot and focus set to infinity.  I went to play back the footage and see what I had captured.  There was only a small segmant of the cloud on the tape becuase the screen went blue.  Im certain I was taping because the adio footage of me and the neigbor talking is on the tape.  The screen was blue for the plane footage as well.", "Slow moving, quiet, dark object wandered up and to the South, avoiding a big cloud.My friend had just left my house a few minutes before, and then called me from his cel phone.  He said, &quot;I don&apos;t know how far South you can see, or if you can see this.  I&apos;m looking at some sort of object in the sky.&quot;  He told me that he was in the Les Schwab parking lot which is about 3/4 of a mile from my house.  He said it was a huge black triangle shaped thing with rounded corners, no lights, no wings, no landing gear, no rotor, no other visible details. I said that I was carrying my cordless and was running down the street, that I&apos;d keep talking as long as I could.  He said that it was moving very slowly, and that it changed directions, then started moving up.  Then I lost contact with him.  I ran a total of about 2.5 blocks from my house into the parking lot of a retirement home.  I looked toward the South and saw a black object in the sky.  It was still daylight, clear sky overhead with a few clouds to the South and West.  It was far enough away from me that I couldn&apos;t make out whether it was a triangle or a squashed diamond, but I could make out that it had corners at the widest part (wasn&apos;t a round ball and wasn&apos;t flat). I watched the object move very slowly up and to the South (a little bit East).  It seemed to be heading into a big high flat cloud.  Then before it entered the cloud, it changed directions.  It seemed to come back toward me and a bit to the West.  Then it went up and over the cloud, not through it.  Then it continued to move South and up, very slowly.  I watched it for a long time, probably at least 5 minutes, during which time my friend drove by looking for me.  He went to my house.  I walked backward through the parking lot to the street, keeping my eye on the object.  By the time he came back up the road from my house, it was almost too small to see. I called KEX radio in Portland to report it.  I was surprised that no one else had.  It was right over I-5 most of the time.  I also called the Oregonian news paper.  They also said that no one else had reported anything. My house is on several flight paths.  Small planes land and take-off from the Aurora airport to the South.  There&apos;s a helecopter company there too.  Also, jets fly overhead many times each day on route to/from the Portland International Airport, about 30 miles away.  So I&apos;m used to what aircraft and helecopters look like, how long they stay in view, and how they sound.  This thing stayed in view far longer than anything else I&apos;ve ever seen.  It left no trail, and did not move in a straight line, but rather kind of wandered a bit.  I heard no sound at all, but I would have expected to, if it were a plane or a helecopter.((NUFORC Note:  We have talked to the other witness to the same event, who was in a different location at the time of the sighting.  However, the two witnesses were communicating by telephone.  Triangulation on the location of the object may be possible.

I am a corporate pilot, at that time we were flying between DIX (aviation aid)NC, to Mrlin intersection (aviation aid)in the Bahamas, atlantic route 1 (AR1), to Fort Lauderdale FL. at an altitude of 39000 Fts. About 160 NM east to the Jacksonville coast FL, in the Atlantic Ocean, heading SW (210&ordm;stm), we saw, at the begining, like a cream color, small oval, moving east to west, heading (110&ordm;stm) about 25&ordm; up of my left horizon, and making light curves and little circles in an up parabolic track. Then stop moving about 80&ordm; up. At that moment the cream color oval switched to a massive super bright white light (hallogen light) like the sheriff helicopter lite. And just the light started moving like searching. I could see the shadow of my left arm inside the cockpit (weird!!!). I saw a giant cloud forming around the lower and the upper side of the light (like a mushroon upside down). Suddenly the light turned off, but the big cloud remained there loosing the bright. We flow for an hour and ten minutes more at 300 Kts, (about 300 miles) and still we could see the cloud. We couldn&acute;t see any kind of body object, or object aproximation because of the super bright of the light. I read the Nuforc note in all the sighting reports that mentioned the launched of an ICBM from the Kennedy Space Center, but when I saw the light I was over the Atlantic Ocean and I saw it starting from the deep east side(Atlantic Ocean). As a reference, my airway (AR1), was like if you draw a straight line between Beaufort Inlet NC. to Fort lauderdale Fl.

The sphere was hovering a few feet above my lower legs. Suddenly, the sphere, which appeared to be seemless, opened to reveal a camera lens about 2&quot; in diameter. I automatically moved my arms slightly away from my torso,as well as moving my legs slightly apart, so that none of my body parts were overlaying or touching any other part. I laid very still with my eyes open, while the sphere scanned my entire body.I cooperated automatically, and I did not feel frightened at all. It moved from my feet upwards to my head, slowly photographing/imaging every inch of me. It then settled back above my lower legs, closed it&apos;s lens, which left the sphere seemless, once again. It departed through the window,which was open,but there was a screen there. I immediately got up to brush my teeth due to a severe metallic-sulpher taste in my mouth. I called out to my father, who is a painter, and always works late into the night. When I went to find out why he did not answer me, I noticed that he was sleeping on the couch! Yet, at the time of the scanning I could hear him taping his paint brushes against the water can, he uses to rinse his brushes. I awakened him, only to find that he was not sleeping, but almost in a paralyzed state. After several minutes, he sat up and I told him what had just happened to me. He reported to me that he was painting when he suddenly experienced the most excrutiating headache he had ever had, and had to lay down on the couch.((NUFORC Note:  We will attempt to have the father submit a report, as well.

I could not estimate the size of it; it was hard to tell if it was near or far. It passed the plane on the left side.

My home is in the mountains and I have a very good view of both the city of Santa Fe and the city of Los Alamos. I observed this light for a while and noticed it seemed to have different colored lights flashing or something.  I got out my binoculars, and observed that there were indeed different colored lights.  It was too far away to observe the actual shape.  The object at first appeared to be stationary over the city of Santa Fe.  It did not appear to be moving at all.  However over a course of approximately an hour and a half, it very slowly moved over the city of Los Alamos, then very slowly moved lower in the skies until it appeared to disappear behind a mountain in or behind Los Alamos.  It went down not far from a red flashing light in the mountains, so I thought it might have to do with some sort of test or research going on in Los Alamos.  During this same period of time, I also noticed two other very bright white objects which appeared to be either round or elipse shaped in two different locations in the skies over Santa Fe.  Neither object appeared to be moving.  Both were very far away.  I observed an airplane during this period and compared the plane to these objects through my binoculars.  The three unidentified objects bore NO resemblance to the plane.  Two of the objects were still in the sky when I finally went to sleep at approximately 4 AM.  All of these objects were lower in the skies than the stars.  It was a very clear night.  All of these objects were much brighter than the stars and were easy to distinguish from the stars due to their extremely bright lights and to the fact that they seemed at times to move, although VERY slowly.

The porch faces North-East, toward the Taryall Mountains and an expansive valley in between.

The object seemed solid, and i couldn&apos;t see any details, it was just shiny and black.  It sat there for about a minute or so then started to move East, accoss the valley, and it gained altitude to about 300 feet, as it did so.  The thing that really caught my attention about it was that it made no sound that I could hear.  I&apos;ve seen plenty of low-flying airplanes in the area and know that the sound they make echos through the valley, no matter how far away they are.  But the object didn&apos;t make a noise.  It glided slowly accross the valley and continued to gain altitude until it was above one of the mountain peaks in the distance, my best guess is that the mountain is about 10 miles away from my cabin.  The object then seemed to momentarily stop above the mountain and then shot away at a great speed to the North and disappeared.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was traveling from east to west, and doing so at GREAT speed. It ( as I saw it) came from my left, and went to my right, (I was facing south). I am a US Marine, not given to flights of fantasy. I have been observing aircraft for many years, as I am a pilot. The light was constant, not pulsing in any way. It was moving VERY fast. Then it stopped and after only a half of second or so it went straight up until it was out of my view. After stopping and changing direction, I watched the light for 5 seconds or so. In that length of time I believe it was extra atmosphereic,based on my ability to determine the size reduction and rate of same. It could have moved slightly higher and reduced it&apos;s size similtaneously, however this did not seem to be the case to me, and I had no sense of this possibility at the time. Not knowing the distance to target, I unable to extraplolate the size of the light or source of the light. My best guess based on my experience is 15,000 feet Mach 2.5. or approximately 2250 MPH. I have never seen anything even close to this before,and with 46 years of information stored herein, I have no idea what this could have been. It was not &quot;usual&quot; and was unidentifiable with the limited amount of information. It was not a conventional aircraft of any kind.It may not have been a craft at all. Flight path and G forces endured would suggest other. However a platform for such a light does not currently exist in common knowledge. This observation suggests it does exist elsewhere, in fact it proves it (to me).((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates a date of October 01, 2001.  We will attempt to obtain the correct date.

As I come over a hill, I looked to my right, the passenger side of my car, and noticed a bunch of lights.  At first I thought it was only a cattle yard or something to that nature, until I looked a little more closely.  I seemed paralyzed when I saw what I saw.  I don&apos;t, or didn&apos;t, believe in ufo&apos;s or aliens, but what I saw was unexplainable, and unbelievable.  I seen a round object, about a quarter or a half mile from the highway.  I know it was round because of the bright lights that went around it.  They weren&apos;t colored lights, just white lights.  It was hovering above the ground, motionless.  Not horizontally, but at a slight angle.  Stunned, curious, but honestly and regretably a little frightened, I slowed my speed a great deal as I drove by.  I stared at the object as I drove right by it.  I wanted to stop, to go toward the object, but something inside me said to keep driving.  I have no doubt what I saw, even though I know I can never tell anyone close to me about this, because it sounds ridiculous, like there should be some kind of explanation.  But I&apos;ve driven that road many times and I know it well.  I know what I saw, I even try to dispute it to myself, but I can&apos;t, because I know what I saw.  Now I feel like I&apos;ve done something about it.", "Bright orange light hovering above the treesI was sitting in my home which is located just outside of town, we have a big window that faces to the north, when I noticed a bright orange light hovering above the trees in the distance.  I went outside, it was still there it started to pulse, the light fading then brighting up again then all of a sudden it shot up in the air so fast that it was hard for me to keep my eyes on it, it hoverd there for about 1 minute then it shot off to the east so fast it seemed to disapear.  I noticed it again from afar, then the light faded away.  It was one of the strangest things I&apos;ve ever experienced.", "Flashing mulitcolored lights on hilltop dip behind hill and reappear as rectangular  strobing craft.On A warm clear Saturday night my wife and I were sitting outside on our deck on the south hill in Missoula Montana.  I was pointing out to her where I saw what I thought to be a fire on Waterworks hill on the northside of our small town of about 60,000 people.  As we were looking a flicker of amber light appeared.  I thought this wa rather odd so I  got out my very light sensiteve binoculars and waited to see if the flicker reappeared.  I was supprised to see the light appear again only this time the light changed to a brilliant white.  I continued to watch and found that the light would change appearance.  About every 20 to 60 seconds light changed color, location and duration although the light flashes only lasted a maximum of about 10 seconds per incedent.  The light firsh was first amber, then white then amber then amber then red   then blue...  I had thought that perhaps these were left over fireworks but the short flash of most of the lights and the intesity considering that it was about 15 miles away made it seem unlikely.  As I contiunued to watch the light then moved behind the hill and projected a beem of   light upward in a &quot;V&quot; formation  so that all that was light was the air itself.  Then positioning itself back atop of the hill it flashed two short green flashes.  About a minute and a half later it then flashed a combined blue and red combination light.  As I waited there were no more light flashes for about 10 minutes then out from behind the hill a craft slowly appeared from behind west side of the hill.  This craft had a stack of three amber lights horizontally and vertically.  In the center very brilliant white lights strobed from left to right.  It then changed direction and started moving slowly north toward the small community of Saint Ignatius, Montana.  I watched it slowly drift north for about 3 to 5 minutes.  A comercial airliner then flew directly over my home and within seconds the unidentified craft made a extreamly quick turn to the east and accerlerated.  I would say the ! craft by that time was 30 miles away and during its acceleration covered 10 to 15 miles in about 3 to 5 seconds and disappeared bihind a group mountains somewhere in the St. Ignatiius Valley which is in the Mission Mountain range area.  I have never before seen a craft that I felt that I could not explain but both my wife and I were and are baffed. I was not going to report this for fear of being thought of as I may be accused of causing a mass halucionination with my wife but our local radio station that they had received several calls from people around the Missoula area that a green light had been seen moving about our city late Saturday afternoon.

They seem to be as high as the satellite but moving at a greater speed. So fast that even a low flying plane could not possible fly as fast given thier apparent distance from me. They were flying perpendicular to the first 2 stars of the Big Dipper.

We were right around exit 10 on the turnpike and we saw a whole bunch of clustered bright lights about 1000 &ndash; 2000 feet in the air.  We figured these were approaching planes, however, as we got closer they appeared to form some sort of pattern and were kind of hovering.  There were about 50 cars stopped on the side of the turnpike.  My wife believes that the lights &ldquo;reorganized&rdquo; to form a different pattern.  I really didn&rsquo;t see any reorganization happen.

It appears both objects were independent of each other but traveling together, like two flies following each other. The objects radiated a bright white light like a shiny star but more intense and closer to the earth. The light intensity changed, possibly flickering but remained very bright. The lights would disappear and re-appear a split second later in a totally new location similar to fire flies but moved at high-rate of speed.  At times the light kind of just bounced.

As I laid my head on my pillow, I noticed a light in the sky. I thought it was a bright star at first but as I kept looking I knew it wasn&apos;t a star.  So, I thought it must be an airplane. I then saw a red and green flashing light. I thought it was surely an airplane but it was not moving. It just stayed in the spot it was in when I first noticed it. I continued to lay in bed and look at the light, why, I don&apos;t know.  Suddenly it looked as if it were falling very fast and then stop instantly.  It did not fall a very long time but it was fast and then an abrupt stop. I felt a little funny inside when I saw that and got out of bed to look out my window closer.(It was 12:22 a.m. at this point) As I strained to look out my screen, the light seemed to by spinning and I could see flashing or spinning red, green, and gold/yellow lights. I looked aroud the clear sky and compared what I was looking at to the other &quot;stars&quot; in the sky. They did not look similar. The stars were plain and not moving and this light I was watching had color and movement. I just continued to watch because I wanted to see it move again.  It did move again and this time it was in an &quot;S&quot; movement up and then down again. Not too high or low just small movements within a certain area (I was looking between two tall trees and could see it the whole time)The movement is what kept me watching, it reminded me of playing video games and how fast and over exagerated we can move objects with the controllers. Then it  began moving toward the trees very slowly and sometimes with a little dip or two. I watched it until it disappeared behind the trees. It was 12:50 a.m.", "low iredescent  V shaped lightFor the mere fact that I live in Roswell it&apos;s a little hard to report this, typical responce would be , Yeah.......right. I was at work and went outside for some fresh air. Had I not been looking up I probably would have never seen it, because it was very dim. I have a hard time calling it a craft because I didnt see any structure to it. It was in the shape of a &quot;V&quot; and it just materialized in the night sky. It was stationary when it appeared for maybe 30 seconds then slowly began to move south then it just disappeared, no sound no lights no colors. It looked the same as if it were a spotlight on the clouds, a dim kind of grayish look, but with very distinct lines forming the shape.

The triangle subtended a huge arc of the sky(a distance between 10:30 and 1:30 elevation )  This huge spread attracted the man&apos;s attention and he told his girl friend to look at this phenomenon.  Both were quite amazed and emotional. They both observed for five minutes.  During this time the leading star-like object stopped and the other two objects fell in line behind it.  They then faded away as they got low on the horizon. The man is a military veteran and held secret clearances.  The night was very clear with the Milky Way visible.

Then, I saw a big slow fireball coming toward my direction (from east to west) then going where the porch roof blocked the view overhead. I thought how weird a meteor could be that slow and big.

Not really sure if it is a UFO per se, but it is definately not like anything I&apos;ve seen before. Would love it if someone could explain what it is. Around about the same time it was before, 4:00-4:30 a.m., I went outside for a smoke because I was having problems sleeping.  Outside, over I 43 west of Beloit, going towards Milwaukee, there was one very big extremely bright and intense white light in the sky and a smaller light on it&apos;s lower right side, stationary in the sky.  I noticed it right away because as I stepped outside the garage it was located directly in front of me.  I looked around to see if there were any other &quot;stars&quot; in the sky, because the sun was about to come up and I was surprised to see such a huge bright light at that time of the day.  As I turned back around, to look at the bright light and the smaller one, I saw another smaller white light  coming from the east side of the big bright light moving west towards it.  (It was small like the other light on it&apos;s lower right side.)  When it got in a position to where it made all the three lights form a triangle, it stopped.  Maybe 2 minutes after that, (still smoking so it wasn&apos;t that long)I heard and saw an airplane fly towards the smaller light that had just recently moved towards the big light.  As the airplane got closer to the light, the bright light in the center, changed shapes, it got oblonged and grew 2 armlike looking things from it (like a stick person without the legs). While it was doing this, the light got really intense.  The airplane went around it.  Then, not more than 1 or 2  minutes later (still smoking the same cigarette), another airplane to the right of me this time came from behind me, and flew towards the triangle and again, when it got close, the big light in the middle got oblonged and the arms came out, and the brightness increased. The airplane flew past it.  I came inside the house but went back out just before the sun came out (about 45 minutes later) to see if it could be seen in the day light.  When the sun came out, I could still see it. (It was that bright!) But it didn&apos;t stay long.  It got smaller and smaller and just disappeared, in a matter of seco! nds.

The ones that look like F5&apos;s) flew nearly overhead  of my location in East Mesa. Unusual but I&apos;ve never seen trainers here before. They flew in a tight formation, north to south, at an estimated altitude of 5000 ft, disappearing from view in approx. 2 minutes. Although the speed must have been nearly supersonic, at the capacity of military power(without afterburner) the engine noise was really quiet...less than a Lear jet cruising. Falcon Field airport is a few miles away, I&apos;ve seen plenty company jets. Williams Gateway airport is a few miles south, and Chandler Municipal Airport a bit south of that...I believe all have radar. As the aircraft diminished to a dot on the southern horizon I noticed what at first I thought was a vulture riding the thermal air currents just to my south, between the jets and my location. We see that all the time out here. My assumption was short lived. What I witnessed behind the trio of trainers I thought to be a large bird in the distance playing in the thermals--a thick, short horizontal line moving back and forth, then in lazy circles, above the clouds then below, behind a tree then behind a house then vertical. The object moved like a balloon on the wind but had the flat appearance of the thicker edge of a matchbook held at about 15 feet. The object vanished into a cloud bank about 90 seconds after the jets faded from view, south of my location, slightly east of the trainer formation. From the time I lit a cigarette and the jets flew over to the end of the sighting was less than the time it took for me to finish my cigarette. There was no metalic reflection, just flat black.

I actually stopped a lady walking down the street and asked her to look up. She described exactly what I was looking at without me describing it first. She said two of the lights were red. I only recall seeing one red. She also said she saw movement. I am positive I saw movement because the formation I saw changed shape. Not rapidly and not all four lights at once. There was a gradual but distinct and unmistakable shift over the course of ten minutes. I am postive of what I saw. These lights were suspended extremely high in the sky. There was a gradual controlled movement, and after approxamately ten minutes the lights dissapeared from my vision.((NUFORC Note:  We presume the witness means July 23, not July 24.

The sky was really clear because the stars and mars was clearly visible, the moon as well(cresent shape).  I had noticed a blue and red light in the sky and looked at it. It caught my attention because of its brightness.  I had only been looking at it for a few seconds to try and figure out what it was when it started to grow dim.  Within about 2 seconds it had grown dim to the brightness of a star and not a second after that it was completely gone.  I looked at my brother and he confirmed what i saw.  About 10 minutes after the sighting was over I met up with my other younger brother and he told me he had seen the same light, he described to me the same light I had seen.  At first I thought it might of been a plane and the angle of the plane made the bright light, but in this case the light would have been a yellow or white color.  The light I saw was a distinct blue light on top and red light underneath the blue light.  It did not move to the left, right, up or down.  It keep the same position and only grew dim in a very short amount of time and then completely disappeared.  Also there were no other planes around the light and very few in the sky.  This is all I can think of at this time.((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the cluster of reports that appear her for the evening of Monday, June 25, 2001, were caused by the launch of an ICBM by the U.

Noticed a slight white flash, as if something popped below the clouds ahead to my right at 2 oclock... thought it was sunflash off of a plane, but the flash didnt diminish, so it caught my interest.  My next thought was how fast it seemed to be approaching, following the line of the highway.  As it got closer I saw that there were no wings, then that it wasnt a helocopter.  I also observed a strange aura/trail around it similar to the heat that rises off a hot road. no sounds, seemed also to have a slight wobble; maybe caused by the aura, as it seemed to blur the outline.  object silvery, seemed to have black on it; shape seemed to resemble a trashcan (or R2D2 from star wars) Continued to approach, and passed overhead and behind me and I lost sight of it.  observed other people in the cars around me also looking into the sky as they passed me.  total time of sighting less than 7-8 seconds", "teardrop shape, bright, lime-green glowing orbLast Saturday night, my wife and I were sitting on a porch looking out at the ocean.

Approx 20 minutes after some of us saw a very bright meteor overhead we saw an object in the distant sky in the SE heading NW at a constant rate of speed. As it grew closer it appeared to be diamond shaped and an orange in color. It flew directly overhead and at its closest appeared to be about 1/2 the size, possibly 3/4 the disk of a full moon. There was a near full moon this night so I did try to make a rough comparison. I saw it pass in front of a bright star which confirmed to me that is was indeed a solid object and gave me a very immediate sense of depth that it was somewhat low in the sky but how far up it was I could not say for sure. It appeared to be luminescent in some fashion but illumination by the moon could not be ruled out as it was a very clear night out and the moon was bright enough to light up the lawn. Several people in the group described several small points of light, &quot;like the ends of a fiber optic cable&quot; said one friend (number varies between 6 and 7) offset but surrounding the diamond shape. I am slightly nearsighted with a -.5 prescription and unfortunately was without my glasses this night so I was not able to make out the surrounding lights personally but I very clearly saw the orange body of the object. As it passed overhead we heard absolutely no noise coming from the object. Minutes after the object disappeared from sight an airplane took off heading east over our heads from O&apos;hare airport. The comparison to a low flying commercial airplane was easily dismissed as we observed blinking navlights on the wing-tips of the plane, take off lights and an audible engine noise. The observed craft had neither of these. As the craft receded from us a girl in the group grabbed her 35mm camera and attempted to photograph the object with her telephoto lens and managed to take two pictures of it. At this time it was pretty far away so we are not anticipating a detailed image. The group of witnesses of saw the object consisted of people between the ages of 24 and 30 working in fields from business to art. Some of the group are very admitted skeptics and others are believers in the UFO phenomenon but the group consensus from both sides of the fence was that no one had ever seen anything like it before and could offer no explanation other than possibly a blimp or a balloon. Before we got in to to much detailed description within the group I had two of the witnesses go inside the house and draw the object independently based on their own description. I personally am into astronomy as a hobby and have witnessed meteors and satellites many times to know exactly what they look like. I can identify all the visible planets as well as the star Sirius. I know it was neither of those.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found him to be an excellent observer and reporter of the facts surrounding the case.

The sky was clear,and moonless. We witnessed a formation of three &quot;military fighter jets&quot;, displaying normal navagational lights, and flying at apx. 15,000 feet on a due West heading. We clearly heard the familier sound of their engines. Trailing the formation of fighter jets (at apx. the fighter jets 8 o&apos;clock position)was a quite large &quot;Chevron Shaped Object&quot;. We were able to see shapes quite well, as the OBJECT and the Jets were being backlit by the starlight of the &quot;Milkey Way&quot;. Using the fighter jets size as reference, we estimated the OBJECT size to be 100 yards from tip-to-tip of its Chevron Shape. The OBJECT had three &quot;white colored&quot; lights -- one at the apex, and one at each end(or wingtip)of the &quot;Chevron Shape&quot;. The OBJECT did not display ANY OTHER navigational lights. The OBJECT matched the jets air speed and seemed to move more like a glider than a powered aircraft. The OBJECT and the jets were observable for apx. 2 minutes. My girl friend and I are very familier with the air traffic in the Tioga Pass area of Yosemite. There is a major East-West commercial air traffic corridor that follows the trace of Tioga Road (HWY 120). The steady stream of air traffic is quite familier and predictable in this area. Military flights are also quite common in this area. The flight path of the OBJECT and the three military jets we observed was south of and parallel to the commercial air corridor that follows Tioga Road.

The light hit my van and as it did I rolled down the window and waved above my van. Even though I could not see what I though might be a police helicopter. I realized something was wrong. I couldn&apos;t here any helicopter blade noise! It was at that time I also noticed that the car behind me had slammed on it breaks and was stopped in the middle of the road a ways back.

There was a fool moon out that night with a few clouds and you could see this thing as bright as the moon it self! About a sec. After I first saw this thing, it shot out in front of me. I hit the gas and followed it. I was doing about 60 chasing it, when we got to a park that was in that area. It suddenly went right, towards the park and stopped for a minute, above a big tree. I turned in to the parking lot almost flipping my van and grabbed my video camera from under the seat. I started filming! Thank God I had my camera in the car. It slowly drifted southeast. No sound what so ever. There were times it would just shoot off at real high speed and I would have to find it again with my camera.

It is remarkable too that I talked to those girls who laughed at me ( I thought so at that time), my words was that &quot;If you laugh at me again, I am going to ask my father, God to punish you.&quot; And later at another one place i have seen another sport plane flying and disappeared into the oval object when the bright light covers it.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have arbitrarily assigned a date so that the case sorts to 1978.  We have no other information about the alleged sightings.  PD))", "Fast, dull-white light multiplies and changes formation multiple time.What follows is exactly as witnessed on the night of September 8, 2001.  My wife and I were out on our balcony at our apartment complex.  We have somewhat of a limited view of the eastern sky from this vantage point due to trees, however, I was watching a distant storm cloud moving northeast. It had my attention because flashes of cloud lightning were brillantly illuminating the cloud itself.  These ended and while talking with my wife I noticed a dull white light moving at a very high rate of speed, seemingly in the cloud itself.  It&apos;s speed is what first drew my attention.  Being in Fort Worth, approximately 15 miles from DFW airport, there&apos;s quite a lot of air traffic in the area.  But this was moving faster than even low flying aircraft move in the night skies.  At first I thought the light was within the cloud itself, moving out of it.  Although now upon reflection that couldn&apos;t of been the case:  this storm cloud was much too far off to see such a light.  And indeed it wasn&apos;t behind or in the cloud.  Upon reaching the cloud&apos;s edge and emerging from it, I realized the light had the same dull white appearance as it did while seemingly in the cloud.  The light had to have been much closer to us than the storm cloud.  At that point I stood up from the rocking chair I was seated at, and moved quickly to the railing to get a better look.  At that time, the object - or light- which originally was singular became a group of three or four lights of similar hue and size.  No blinking or FAA lights could be seen.  These were not airplanes.  They continued moving in what seemed to be either a diamond or a square formation.  Then at that time, and, of course, this is what really peaked my interest, the object(s) split into a &quot;V&quot; formation.  Or, if not trully a &quot;V,&quot; then a formation shaped similar to a banana with a slight to moderate curve in it.  Following this, the object(s) distanced themselves from one another, still in the same formation, but spaced apart more.  (And I should mention at this point that e! very cha nge in formation occurred almost instantaneously.  I could see the movement, but it was faster that anything I have ever before seen in the sky.)  Still moving at what was a southeasternly direction, a single light of the same brightness, shape and size moved into the formation from ahead.  It moved into the formation seemingly at the same rate of speed as the other object(s) that were moving toward it.  This independent light joined the formation at dead center or perhaps slightly below this point.  Then the object(s) regrouped into the box or diamond formation and slowed significantly, if not stopping.  Together they rose in altitude slightly before again forming the tight &quot;V-banana&quot; formation.  At this time the object(s) were about to enter the blind spot of my balcony so I ran outside, downstairs, and around my apartment building in an attempt to gain view unobstructed by foilage.  However, because of the strong light from the rising moon and the faint, dull light of the object(s) themselves I was unable to again locate it.  And realizing the speed at which the object(s) seemed to be moving at, I knew the sighting was over.  Upon joining me downstairs, by wife did say before she lost sight of the object(s) the tight &quot;V-banana&quot; formation loosened up. Again, this occurred at approximately 00:30-00:35 hours on September 8, 2001.  The weather conditions were windy and partly cloudy with the wind and clouds moving in a northeasternly direction.  And while the sky was cloudy, an equal amount of clear, visible sky was to be seen.  The object(s) moved in a southeasternly direction which, from where I live, would put in on a crow&apos;s flight toward Arlington, Texas.

I said, it is a plane with its bright landing lights on, for we are very near Fernandina airport and private planes come and go all the time...But it kept on coming toward us and going lower...I would say descending from maybe 5000? to 2000? ft over a minute or two, but absolutely silent.  The trouble was, it was quite a big circle of light, bigger than any star, white w/bluish tinge soft but strong, like florescent light? When it seemed to be about maybe 2000 ft due east of us, over the sea, it just stopped and remained stationary from then on.  At that point its apparent area was about a fifth the size of a full moon in AREA.  Never any sound at all.  After it had hovered like that about a minute, a mist or cloud was emitted by it from what seemed like 3 sources below its midpoint like at 8 6 and 4 o clock, so that the light came to be &quot;sitting on&quot; a small mist or cloud in the completely clear sky.  This is in the dark of the moon, just a fingernail already setting opposite this in the west.  Then it began to emit the mist or cloud also from vents above it, say at ll and 1 oclock.  Thus it was completely enshrouded in the mist but still the light was there in it so the &quot;cloud&quot; stood out definitely in the sky for maybe 20 sec.  Then the light was switched off, and the little cloud stood alone in the dark sky.  The size of this cloud was about that of an ellipse with long axis up and down, about what would be covered by a 2 inch or slightly larger cookie held at arms length.  The cloud stood there about 60 sec fading but little, then whoosh, it disappeared in 5 or 10 sec leaving nothing.", "Streaming lights moving above trees.I was walking up to the pay phone and I looked out into the sky like looking at the stars and I noticed a row of lights that were streaming back and forth which changed from red, white and blue.  It was hovering above the trees moving slowly east towards Rhode Island. I saw other airplanes in the sky and this looked or moved nothing like them. Then eventually it disappeared.  The entire event lasted about 5 minutes.", "While canoeing at 3:30 AM we saw a blinking light in the sky similar to that of an aircraft. Suddenly it lit up &amp; sped away9 people. 3 canoes. I was in a canoe with two others. We saw everything. The other canoers saw nothing. Strange...We were on a summer canoe trip in the Boundary Water Wilderness Area of Northern Minnesota. We got up around 3 am that day to paddle in the moonlight. We left at 3:30 AM. About half an hour in, I and my two canoe mates (3 to a canoe) saw something in the north sky. Actually it started being visible (or maybe we just saw it for the first time) when it was very close the the big dipper.It was a blinking light in the sky. Moving at a steady pace for the first few moments. For the 1st few moments we just brushed it off as an airplane (it looked alot like an airplane would at night) but it was kind of strange--Since when do airplanes fly over Ely, Minnesota? It is the middle of nowhere! OK, maybe we could pass this off as an aiplane taking an alternate route to get to San Fransisco or somewhere. But this was before the spectactle that turned my friend into a believer in UFO&apos;s and the like.The whole sighting lasted oh no more than 2 minutes and it looked just like a plane going thru the sky for about a minute of the two, blinking and moving steadily. But then all of a sudden it lit up (it stopped blinking and got visibly brighter), and then went extremely fast and went out of sight. We were all awestruck", "Blinking light moving very fast in an airplane contrail.I&apos;m not sure if the date is exactly the right. A few days in both directions at most. I was sitting out on my balcony taking some sun as it was a clear warm cloudless day. As I took a break from it I watched an aircraft fly over me at cruising altitude leaving a contrail. There is a flight corridor right overhead (west -&gt; east) for most likely intercontinental flights. About five to ten minutes after the aircraft went out of sight (balcony&apos;s ceiling). I noticed a bright white light moving thru the sky. It was a constant blinking light in about one second interval, moving in my point of view in the exact same place and direction as the contrail left by the recent aircraft. But the speed was 6 - 8 times faster (or even more) than the normal aircrafts that slowly move across the sky. There were no change of speed what so ever. I didn&apos;t see any object during the &quot;no light&quot; period. Maybe it was behind the contrail. But the blinking light was so strong it seemed to be below the contrail. This made me think this thing was actually moving IN the contrail. The contrail wasn&apos;t affected in any way as it was slowly disappearing. The size of the light was about twice of a big airliner flying at cruising altitude. I&apos;d say the light moved over the part of the sky I can see (about 40% of total) in about 15 seconds.The huge speed, bright blinking light, moving exactly where the contrail was, made no sense to me and still I&apos;m wondering what it was. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "As we looked toward south Seattle, there was a single  bright white light moving in erratic patterns (small circles) and various speeds with a flash of red occassionally. The first one then started heading north north-east, still doing the herky jerky and dimmed out of sight. Within  a minute there was another one about the same size, but this one had a smaller one above it copying the larger ones every little herky jerky motion. I grabbed my scope to try and get a better look at the thing. Wow, it looked like a shere of bright flashing light with beautiful red flashes about its exterior. I wish could describe it better, but I have never seen any thing like it. They followed about the same path north north-east. If anyone can explain this, _PLEASE, post it.", "i belived it was going fast to cover the distance that it did. it was no airplane!!i happened to look out the window around 8:45 pm. on the 14 of sept. 01. when isaw what i thought was a star. but i realized it was too big to be a star. it seemed to be in one place, then it started to move. i called for my mother to hurry. to come and see. by the time she came into my room it had reversed it&apos;s self and started to go in the other direction. it went behind a tree, and slowly dimmed out. my mother saw a red light on it, that was not blinking. i didn&apos;t see that.", "Odd Lights in Colorado SkyAt about 5:15am I awoke suddenly and was immediately compelled to look outside in the southeastern sky. The sky was clear and many stars were evident. I first saw what appeared to be a military aircraft flying from south to north - a white light with a red light and a blue light on it, and was flying rather fast. Not an odd occurrence given that there are several military bases in the front range area here in Colorado. However, I knew it was not a military craft when it stopped in mid-air and the red and blue lights disappeared. The single white light, which was now a little brighter (like a very bright star), started to bob up and down and around in the air, almost like a flying insect or a moth. I knew that since I was seeing this against the fixed backdrop of the stars that this one object was indeed moving, and it wasn&apos;t just my eyes. It became stationary, and while I was watching for additional movements I fell asleep. The total time I watched this event was about 15 minutes. I heard the rumble of two other military jets crossing the airspace during this time but did not see them.", "Two lights in the sky interacting with each other in the most astounding wayA light caught my attention as me and my friend were standing outside the house and talking quietly late at night. I looked up at a plane flying past and a small light dot in the sky caught my eye. I asked my friend whether he could see what i was seeing and it took some time before he confirmed that he could see what i saw. We stood there for 20 seconds and we watched it move in a sharp parabolic path and then resume a straight direction as if it were turning on to a course. I got very exited and i asked my friend whether he had a pair of binoculars and he said yes and ran to get them from inside his house. Once he got out i still had my eye on this faint object. At the beginning of the sighting it was bright and then later it started getting darker as it moved over away from us towards the distant horizon in a diagonal motion. I managed to aim the binoculars at the light dot by using one eye to focus on the light dot and the other eye to search through one of the binocular lenses. Next, I saw the most remarkable sight that almost sent me into tears from exitement. I saw the little dot clearly in my binoculars and obviously it was much larger due to the binoculars&apos; magnification. It still was a light dot though but a bit larger and no real distinct features were seen. Further on through the sighting, I kept focusing on the light dot as it moved and then i lost sight of it due to myself shaking from the cold. I managed to regain the sight of the light dot but i also managed to gain sight of something even more astounding that i cannot comprehend clearly. The light continued on but it &quot;met up&quot; with a larger cigar shaped craft that was around 12 times the size of this light dot. I could see the whole craft and it was truly enormous compared to the light dot. The dot then moved towards this huge craft and went up very close to the cigar shaped craft and stayed really close for about 30 seconds and then started shining brighter and became a bit larger and move perpendicular to the cigar shaped crafts hull ! or fusel age. It moved away to the left in my point of view and i felt heart broken to have to be able to choose which craft to observe since they both were increasing their distance from each other. I decided to look at the light dot and it was bright for a short period of time before resuming to a darker shade like the shade observed before the approach of the cigar craft. I was describing everything that i was seeing to my friend who was standing next to me and asking what was happening. Once the craft was some distance away from the cigar shaped craft (I presume) then it started travelling faster and faster until i could hardly keep up with the binoculars. It kept going faster and became darker and darker and dissappereared into black. I tryed refocusing back on to the cigar shaped craft but i could not find it in the night sky. I knew that i was viewing all of this near the horizon but it was up in the sky, very high up. I was shaken because of the sight that i encountered and I till today remember it very clearly. It remains one of the greatest sights that i have ever seen in my life. I have sighted similar lights when i was out on holidays but i never saw such variations in movement and interaction with other lights in the sky. I currently go out in summer on hoilday to the country just to dedicate time into viewing the lights and/or even greater observations.", "It was 10:30 am, and one of the most beautiful days of the year, I steped outside in my back yard and looked to the North West of my house. Toward hwy 33 in Ventura. I noticed a light in the ski that wasnt moving. It was long and streght like a bar. It stayed there without moving. I could not tell the size but it had to be very large comparing the distance it was away from me. I called my daughter out to look at it as well just to conferm that i was not just seeing things. She saw it also. I then started to slowly get smaller and smaller still in the same spot then it disapered.I went to work on the following Monday and told a co-worker of my experiance and she said she saw it also on Wed. 26, 2001 while she was laying on the beach sometime mid-day. She said it was over the Ventura Mountain Range.

It was to left side of my neighbors house (from my point of view) and was almost down to the ground.  So I know it couldn&apos;t be a star or plane and I know it wasn&apos;t a car because you can&apos;t see the road behind my neighbors house from window behind the trees. So I watched it and it started rising in a diagonal moving left.  It went behind the trees and came out into clear view. It was going faster than a plane so I didn&apos;t have to time to check it out with my telescope so I used my binoculars. It was a disk shape. The bottom of it was just a big white light but around the perimeter was a single strip of colored lights blinking on and off in a pattern. It went out of view for a second but turned around and started moving right. But it was farther away now and it went behind some trees in the distance. (not next to my neighbors) I tried to keep an eye on it but it got smaller and smaller until finally it disappeared and I never saw it come out of the other side of the trees.", "meteor like objectThe night of the sept 11th disasters, i went outside to verify that there were no aircraft flying.

I am an avid &quot;skyfisher&quot; with my camcorder and enjoy sky watching. I was looking (as i do throughout the day) for &quot;odd&quot;/chemtrail activity but instead saw two unusual objects. The more stationary of the two was larger and seemed  to exhibit no anomalous motion. approximate range seemed to be about at least 2-4 miles. Clear blue skys (for once ;). The smaller object appeared to be moving southeast at about double the speed of the first. The larger object appeard brighter than the smaller, mobile object. My impression was that of two mylar ballons catching the sun, but why at that range would one move consistantly away from the other at twice the speed, while the other remained relatively motionless?

I did some quick research on the web and found the Satellite came down on March 12 1996 at 11:05pm EST. As I recall, I saw the UFO at about 5.30pm UK time and I think the satellite had come down around midday but I didn&apos;t know this at the time of the sighting. I was walking home from the bus stop after college, it was dark but the street lights were still an orange colour as they were still warming up. I glanced up at the moon and a light to the right of it caught my eye, it was the same colour orange as the street lights but was bigger and at about twice their height. I stopped and stared at it, trying to figure out if it was a light on a crane or something but as well as being illuminated it also seemed to have a spherical metallic surface and I started to think maybe it was a helium balloon. Then it started to move, it floated up with a slight arc (not straight up) and seemed to be swallowed up by darkness. I lost sight of it and continued walking, still looking up in case I could see it again. I then noticed some small misty white lights above me, as I looked at them I suddenly realised that they were arranged around the sides of a huge black shape which was blocking out the stars. I&apos;m about 95% sure that it was triangular, it definitely had straight edges and there were 5 lights as I remember. The object pretty much filled my whole field of vision which combined with the fact that it was a black object against a black sky made it hard to be 100% sure about the number of sides. There was also a rectangle of light in the center but it was like light reflecting off a flat raised section rather than a light source, the long edges of the rectangle were sharp and the short ones were more diffuse. The object passed directly over me from right to left, rotating very slowly. It was completely silent, and I&apos;d estimate it was flying or rather floating at roughly treetop level. Altitude and size are pretty hard to judge from below but I would estimate it was about the size of a house and the orange sphere was about the size of a beach ball or maybe a bit bigger. The triangle(?) slowly gained altitude and I lost sight of it as it passed over the houses to my left. I kept looking for it as I continued home but all I saw were the lights from normal air traffic which wer! e at a m uch higher altitude than the object I had seen. I kept an eye on the local press for a few weeks afterwards but I am not aware that anyone else saw this object.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was heading left in our field of vision then, raised and fell. Since we were going down a hill it left bwehind some trees, but when we crested the next hill to investigate it was gone.

Our front door faces southeast, and there&apos;s a roof overhanging the front steps. My wife and I had just gotten back from shopping and brought the groceries in. I had heard the droaning of an airplane engine and went back out on the front steps to see if parachutists might be jumping, which is a common occurance on Sundays at a small airstrip located about a mile northwest of our condo just off route 111. I put my head out from under the overhang to look for the plane, and pulled back quickly as the bright sun was right overhead. Just then, from above the overhang came a small round silvery object. My first thought was that it was a white bird, but quickly discounted that as the object moved straight and steady towards the east southeast at a pretty good clip. I watched it for three seconds and it disappeared. I don&apos;t believe it was reflecting the sun as the sun was almost straight above it. It was round, possibly shaped like a ball or a disk, silvery white in color, and about the size of a round 1/8&quot; grape seed held between the tips of the first finger and the thumb at arms length, and it covered the distance of a 12 inch ruler held at arms length in three seconds. About two seconds later the airplane came into view moving in an east northeasterly direction. In comparison, the airplane was the size of a grape held at arms length and it moved the distance of the 12 inch ruler in about seven seconds. I&apos;ve seen high flying jets from the same location in the past, but there&apos;s always a lot of noise involved, usually following the jet at a distance. There was no noise from the silvery object. I don&apos;t know whether the object was small and close or large and very high in the sky, but it&apos;s possible someone on the airplane spotted it as it passed in front of them.

Our flight left at around 9:30 am London time. The plane was in a steady climb. Our altitude was only around 10-15 thousand feet. We had just passed above the puffy sparse clouds that were in the area. I had two windows available next to my seat. I was looking out the forward window, looking as close to straight down as I could, I saw some sort of movement between the ground and the puffy clouds right below us. As I looked closer I could see that the ground was being distorted as this object passed above it. It caused a wavy appearance to the ground. Looking closer I could see a definite line where the distortion ended, it looked like a huge contact lens, or a clear plastic disk. I watched this thing pass under three or four clouds and always continue on the other side. I could only track it so far because of the small windows on a 777. I then leaned back and could still see it in the window that was in line with my shoulder. It was traveling in the opposite direction as the airplane, and going maybe three times faster than the clouds passing below us. I watched it until I could see it no more due to the small windows. Right after it was gone I noticed directly below us a nuclear power plant. This object was traveling away from the power plant. I believe this was not a reflection as it was observed from two different windows.  It took me a few seconds to realize that what I had seen was really there.

Anyway, we kept driving and when we were heading into grapevine California which is just over tejon pass and into the valley we started to encountered black smoke like something was burning  but apparently there was no fire so the source is unknown but we no longer saw what appeared to us to be a missile either....Anyway, this had both of us quite alarmed and freked out so we stopped in a parking lot to calm down a bit and as we sat in the car we saw a small ball f light flash and dissappear with incredible speed that surprised both of us and this light seemed to come from no where as well. That is about al I have to say about what i saw except that it was very freaky and I probably will not be forgetting it anytime soon.((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.  We will check for missile launches out of Vandenberg AFB, which account for some sighting reports in this area of California.

The city lights were illuminating them enough to tell they are a light color,a dull silver or grey. I&apos;m not sure how high up they were but they were below cloud cover. I would guess the size of them at 15-20 feet in diameter. They made no sound. They were flying fast but I was still able to watch them for 15-20 seconds.I am 32 and have lived in Calgary my whole life, married with a 6 month old daughter and 3 yr old son.

Not bright lights.  One was red, one was blue, one was yellow - the primary colors.  The craft zigged and stopped at an awkward angle at a higher altitude.  This happened one more time, then it just sorta faded away - disappeared.  It didnt shoot off, it faded like pulled a cloak over itself.  I tried chasing it, but, it didnt work.  I noticed some bright lights in the distance, East I believe.  I went to check them out and got as close as I could (in my car) and saw that they were six apache helicopters.  I know they were apache helicopters because of my military training.  The choppers wouldnt let me get close, they would veer away.  As I watched, they seemed to be searching the fields for something.  Earlier that night I was in the country looking at the sky and noticed what looked like stars zigging and zagging about the sky.  Definitely not any sort of commercial aircraft.  I have some friends who have also witnessed such a craft, but, had never told anyone until I told what happened to me.  They too said it had first been noticed at the graveyard.  Human or extraterrestrial I do not know.  What I do know is that this is real.

The wind shifted and I looked up to make sure no sparks were going to hit my roof, when I noticed a twin prop commercial plane heading south, appearing behind it, closing at a high rate of speed was a small silver object. Estimated speed of object 2000 miles per hour plus. I walked from the garden to my 800 foot front lawn, still watching both objects. The silver object seemed to come to a stop behind the small plane but stayed with the plane for about 20 seconds. All at once the object moved back towards me, made a loop, came to a dead stop and accelerated out of sight at a 45 degree angle. At that time I considered calling my wife outside, but hesitated. As I went back to the garden to check the fire, a commercial jet heading south about the same altitude, flew over. I proceeded to observe this one also. From the northeast sky another silver ball closed in on the jet, staying behind the jet about one half mile. This one was weaving from side to side. It stayed behind the jet for about one minute. It then sped off in the same direction as the other object. This one seemed to travel a little faster then the first object. At this time I called my wife outside. As my wife came down onto the front lawn, two more objects appeared, not accompanied by any commercial aircraft. They both raced off to the east. My wife did not see these objects at this time as they moved too quickly for her to catch sight of them. I went into the house to get my binoculars. I do not own a video camera, which I really regret. At this time my wife and I started noticing a dark area, we are not sure if it was a cloud, fog or mist forming directly overhead, it appeared to be 25000-35000 feet high, estimated. It looked like it stretched in symetrical shape, about two miles. As this &quot;cloud&quot; seemed to get darker activity increased, at this time only with small objects appeared. Now my wife started to see them also. Let me state at this time the sky! to the north, south, east and west of this &quot;cloud&quot; was extremely clear and blue, except for the &quot;cloud&quot; directly overhead.

They came and went so quickly my wife didn&apos;t see them. Remember, I had been looking through binoculars. These objects seemed to just disappear from my sight. For the next 4-5 minutes the cloud, mist, fog got a darker grey in color.

The exact date I cannot recall as it&apos;s been about 11 yrs. I was pregnant with my daughter, i must have been approximately 4-5 months, as I was not showing much. My husband worked a Saturday at a plant close to Regina, sk. where we lived at the time. He did not come home straight after work, and being a Saturday night, I decided to go looking for him, so i could also have a night out. So because we lived on the west end of Regina, I decided to use the backroads to Pense. I was not very familiar with these roads. There was pavement for a few miles, but after a while it turned to gravel. So once i hit the gravel, it was very difficult to drive due to the heavy raining. still travelling west, i knew i&apos;d have to make a left turn in order to get to Pense, but was not sure which road was the turn-off. So, i took a guess, and saw lights, which appeared to be a small town(it was). So i made a left. When i was turning, I saw no lights, directly in front of me, but once i completed the turn i looked down for a second looked up and there appeared to be a vehicle in front of me. I thought at the time how weird this seemed, but i thought that perhaps someone was pulled over and started their vehicle right then. So i slowed down and followed what i thought to be a vehicle of some sort. i thought the lights at the time seemed unusual, but i kept making excuses, like maybe they looked weird because it was so dark? at first they kind of looked like a vehicles lights? maybe. it was so long ago. but after awhile there seemed to be wiggling lights in between two red lights. i thought &quot;what the heck would make wiggling lights like that?&quot; i thought &quot;ok, it must be a car or something, maybe pulling a trailer, and that would maybe explain the wiggling ?&quot; I was a little afraid, but calmed myself down be thinking i was imagining things. So i was! getting closer and closer to pense, this thing was in front of me, i looked down for a brief second and up again, and whatever it was completely dissapeared. Far fetched hey? i thought there had to be a logical explanation for this. There was no right hand turns for this vehicle to go down, it was not ahead of me as i would have seen it, as highway #1 was ahead a few miles and the road was a little illuminated by lights, so i would have seen it, and the left hand turn into Pense would be the only place that this vehicle could have turned onto, but there was not enough time for this object to make a left-hand turn into town. But i decided to go down this only road and drive fast and look to see if there were any vehicles that may have just turned, but there was nothing for vehicles around, and the adjoining streets also had nothing for vehicles. and that is my story. I still wonder about that night. there are absolutely no explanations. this is the gospel truth, i swear!((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It passed the tip of the crescent moon travelling west to east and was as tall as about 1/8 to 1/6 of the moon&apos;s diameter.

It was moving faster than a jet would appear to move at high altitude, but perhaps as fast as a jet appears to move at a lower altitude. Since it was silhouetted by the moon&apos;s halo, it must have been travelling below the high level cloud that created the halo.

I believe my perception of altitude was enhanced by my witnessing a meteor around 1987 while standing on the rooftop of a local 10 story building. The meteor&apos;s trajectory was virtually straight in from my vantage point. I was very fortunate to be in the right place and time to witness it from beginning to end. Furthermore, regarding the U.F.O.&apos;s, what truly amazed me was the movement of the one object that veered closer to the other was that it didn&apos;t fall into a position slightly behind the one that stayed on a straight path. It seems as though it turned , accelerated and then matched speed again with the other all in less than 1 sec. over the previosly mentioned distance of separation.

These three objects moved as if they were being dropped by parachute. The other objects moved about the same area. Then three or four other lighted objects appeared in the same general area.

The fuzzy, indistinct object seen just to the right of the fireball erupting from Tower 2 (southern tower) is more difficult to ascribe to anything we are familiar with, but our suspicion is that the object(s) may be the engine(s) from UAL Flight 175/Boeing 767 which, because of their mass, penetrated through the building well ahead of the fireball and other parts of the aircraft.

I know it was not a single triangular craft, since they did not blot out the background stars. The formation was an almost perfect &quot;V&quot;, two of the lights were slightly out of line with the rest. They did not make a sound, nor did they seem to affect my visibility of the stars they passed. The lights were pale and steady and did not blink or change color.It&apos;s hard to guesstimate the altitude, but I&apos;ll say perhaps 25,000 feet. They moved fast, the formation entered my vision near Monoceros, went through outer Orion and faded out of sight.Aircraft schedules have become a bit strange since the WTC incident.

Nothing more was said but the last two days (Oct. 8 and 9th) in Las Vegas, NV while viewing Telemundo, a major Spanish speaking channel, there has been much airing of the footage, actually extended over what what shown during the day of the event.  This time it was being commented on in Spanish and shown on the screen was the object, a disk shaped, silverish object, quite large, seemingly the size of a couple of busses seen to be hovering between the towers, after the first airplane hit, but before the first tower collapsed and before the second airplane crashed.  The footage was being shot from a close by helicopter and narrated in English by a female newscaster. She pointed out the object to the cameraman with a startled &quot;look over there, what is that&quot;.  The cameraman&apos;s comment was much more graphic, such as &quot;what the **** is that?!&quot;  He filmed it for a few seconds and then the disk shot out from between the buildings and directly towards them.  The woman sounds like she is exclaiming, screaming slightly and the camera guy says something and actually leans back and films from a reclining angle as the object careens rapidly up and past them.  This footage has been aired several times and each time seeing it it&apos;s quite startling.  My original comment to the kids before seeing it was that it must be some kind of secret surveillance craft that we have and don&apos;t want anyone to know about but upon viewing it, one just can&apos;t believe that we have such a capacity.  I&apos;ve seen the comments from around the world of people who viewed something like this and would like to have this investigated.  Is there some sort of news blackout that has prevented this particular shot from being re-aired in the U.S.  Interestingly today it was announced that Sony is buying this network.  Maybe the type of freely decided upon ! news for mat will be curtailed.  Hope not, because this is really happening and people deserve to have some sort of explanation - if only to be told that the government is aware of, or acknowledging this as &quot;real&quot;. We typically don&apos;t watch this channel, but our son does at times.

Any comments?", "Light FormationsMy husband and I went outside to smoke our last cigarette before bed and I was looking at how many stars were out, then I noticed one of them was moving.  I might not have taken notice of this except there were no planes supposed to be in the sky after the events of the day.  We initally noticed one light that was white and small, at first glance it looked like a star. It was due west. It was flashing not twinlking, one single white light then we could see three vertical lights, two white and the one in the center was red, the lights were in a row vertically.  It appeared to drop very quickly from what I assume to be a very high altitude and moved from side to side, almost insect like in it&apos;s movements. This is what raised the hairs on our necks, it was not swamp gas, a harrier jet or military planes, it&apos;s movements were like nothing I&apos;ve ever seen. Ever. It continued to come down all the while flashing it&apos;s red light every so often. Finally it got to be too low in the tree line to see. Then after watching it for so long I noticed movement in the sky to the northwest, my husband and I identified this second object same as the first, it was moving in sequence with another light and another.  We made out three triangular formations in the sky comming from the north and going west. Each point of the triangle was a seperate moving and flashing entity.  Then it started to change into a circular pattern and the second light began the same descent pattern as the first.  This one appeared to be larger than the first, there was a quick white flash from it that went towards the other lights, we could tell they were headed away from us (west).  Eventually they became to small to watch and were gone.  There was no sound. Just as an after thought, at one point while watching the first light it became three lights and moved as if it went upside and back, more than once.  It was just the way it moved that set it apart from anything logical and reasonable.  My husband and I are not the type of people who go looking for this or frequent UFO websites but this was real and not of us.", "Brite lite in sky over southern Idaho.Thought the brite lite was a planet - in fact thought it was Mars by its color, it was an orange white lite - never moved - just stayed in one spot for 7 to 8 minutes.

I did not know what they were, but then the bottom 2 lights started moving around, much faster than any plane that I have seen.  For a while, they looked like they were almost chasing each other.  I watched them intently for about 20 minutes, then disappear, leaving only the top light.  Slowly, over the period of anout 5 minutes, it moved away.

At the time I was looking in the diection of Logan Airport so I didn&apos;t give it much thought.  For some reason though this light kept catching my eye. I reached the intersection of the street I lived on and rounded the corner all the while keeping my eye on it. it would slowly drift one direction, stop and drift back the other way. Something in the back of my mind told me to stop in my tracks and observe it (which I did) and it seemem to almost be taunting me with the way it moved. It&apos;s movements were subtle but most unusual in that it seemed to have no clear direction. Also of note was the fact that the light remained at a farly consatnt magnitude unlike the lights of say a circling helicopter would if one is standing still observing it. It almost seemed to be taunting me as if it knew I was observing it. I must have watched this thing for a solid ten minutes just playing &quot;peak a boo&quot; descending just below and ascending just above the tree line drifting left to right. As I watched A black sedan pulled up near me and one of the occupants asked what I was looking at. They were three middle aged men three in the front one riding shotgun. The man in the front passenger side asked what I was looking at. Before I could answer he flashed a badge and said he was a Boston undercover police officer and that people had been reporting UFO&apos;s in the Roxbury Blue Hills avenue area. My jaw dropped and I told them I was indeed watching something in the sky I couldn&apos;t explain. They asked me a couple more questions that I can vaguely recall and drove off. At that point I felt very unsettled and tried to relocate this object I had been viewing but it was gone. I continued walking down the street keeping my eyes glued to the Eastern horizon and saw nothing until I got to the next intersection. I saw an object flying very silently and very low directly twoards me and i rememb! er feeli ng how surreal it looked because it was somewhat hazy that night and I couldn&apos;t make out any detail only that it seemed awfully low and traveling awfully slow. My ears kept straining to hear engine sounds but I heard none. There were two people approaching me and it appeared to be directly over their heads. I asked them to stop and tell me what it was but one didn&apos;t even look up, and the other gave me the sarcastic reply &quot;UFO&quot; dude. I felt like I was in the twilight Zone. After they past me the craft approached my position and hovered directly over head. I was so surreal triangular in shape silent with a solid red light at the nose and yellow green and blue lights that blinked rhymithicaly counter clockwise. It was huge. The size of maybe the infield of a a baseball field. The thing seemed to have some type of light absorbing field around it like a halo. It hovered above me for what seemed like a minute. Out of the corner of my eye I saw someone else across the street and I shouted for him to look at it and tell me what it was. He was by a gas station and I realized from his vantage point he was looking almost directly into a street light. In the moment I asked him and released my gaze from the object it had completely vanished from sight. I could not fathom how something that big could move that fast but it was completly gone from view. It was almost as if it knew I was watching it.It seemed to leaze the air with an ozoney kind of electric charge like just after a thunderstorm.It was the most unusuall/unsettling thing I have ever experienced.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

My friend and I noticed when it started getting distant it looked as though it was droping something, like pieces of it were falling off and then fading away (like little gold drops).  We first thought it might be a flare fizzing out, but since I live in an urban area of Phoenix there are very rare instances where military jets fly over dense areas of the city and I don&apos;t remember flares being gold color and traveling at that speed.  We thought the light was going to fade out but it didn&apos;t, it kept a constant speed (a little faster than an aircraft.)  There were no sudden speed increases or change in course.  My friend suggested it might be a meteor, but from what I know I don&apos;t think it was.  It was too slow for a meteor and too fast for an airplane.  I looked for blinking lights but it had none.

While in my backyard, I saw a commercial aircraft going overhead apparently only moments after take off from the local airport. I glanced up at the plane and noticed, in the blue sky at a much higher altitude, a star like object. Had the plane not passed over, I probably would never have noticed the object. It looked like a star of average brightness, but this was 1 in the afternoon, and the only object of its kind visible. The object moved very slowly from east to west, perhaps slightly southwest. At one point, the object abruptly changed its course and moved south for about one minute. Then it once again resumed its westerly course. As I said, the object moved at what appeared to be a very low speed and was at high altitude. While watching, I observed two high flying commercial jets flying over Memphis, apparently bypassing the city enroute to other destinations. These planes were leaving contrails, but appeared to be at a lower altitude than the object. They were also moving at a considerably higher speed than the object. At one point the object came to a dead stop in the sky. It appeared to hover over what appeared to be the center of the city for at least ten minutes. It was absolutely stationary. It then resumed its westerly course. There were no erratic manuevers or sudden changes in speed other other than the 10 minute period of hovering and the brief change of direction to the south I mentioned. The object moved in straight lines. I ruled out a balloon figuring winds at such an altitude would have driven the object across the sky at a much faster rate, and balloons tend not to hover and remain stationary for ten minutes at a time. The entire sighting lasted aproximately 30 minutes and the object could not have covered more than 45-50 degrees of arc in the sky during this time. It did not appear to emit light of its own. It reflected sunlight and the intensity of the reflection varied as it moved across the sky. I am not a trained observer, but if this object was indeed as high as I thought, flying higher than airliners bypassing Memphis, it must have been  a rather large craft based on the intensity of the reflection.

I am the Armed Response Force Team Leader at Millstone Nuclear in Waterford, CT and several of the witnesses are Armed Response Force Members and/or Licensed Nuclear Reactor Operators. From a distance of approximately one half mile, we witnessed what, at first, appeared to be a rapidly approaching plane heading toward our facility from the direction of Orient Point Long Island, NY.  This appeared as a very bright light approximately 300-400 feet above sea level, moving toward us at a high rate of speed.  The object was flying parallel to the ground at this height until it reached a distance approximately 1/4 mile from our shorline.  It then began a trajectory at approximately 60-70%, still headed in a North-Easterly direction (toward Providence, RI).  At this point, we were able to discern the outline of the object.  It was approximately 35-40&apos; in length and shaped very much like a rocket or missile.  It had a four-fin tail end and swept back wings near the front end.  The wings extended back and outward from the body, but we could not discern the distance they extended outward. As the object began to gain altitude, there were red sparks and bluish/white smoke erupting from the rear.  Although the flight path maintained a North-East bearing, it was evident that the object was not flying in a straight-line manner once it began its&apos; ascent.  The flight path became somewhat erratic as the object continued to gain altitude and proceded northward.  Because of the amount of contrail (which remained visible in the sky for nearly an hour) and the amount of flame being emitted, many of us were convinced the object was going to crash.  Many of the witnesses are former Naval Nuclear personnel and most thought the object was a &quot;Polaris-type&quot; missile or some other type of nautically-luanched device.  The weather conditions at the time of this incident were clear, mild, and very little wind,  The air temperature was approximately 60 degrees Farenheit.  There were no other objects visible in the sky and the sun was just rising above the horizon to our East.  we were able to view the object for approximately ane and one-half minutes prior to it becoming indistinct. Because we are a Federally Regulated Nuclear Facility, I made immediate notification to the FAA.  The FAA made inquiries to all the airports on the North East Corridor and none reported any planes down or in trouble at the time of the sighting, however, the FAA had recieved several other phone calls conerning this incident.

The body of the craft fluctuated, acting as if it were floating atop the waves in the ocean. The lights all appeared to be fixed to the craft, and moved in unison with body. The craft appeared to be bigger than a full moon in size. The craft appeared to be moving steadily, and my view of it lasted approximately 7 seconds. What was interesting, is that it seemed like you could look through the body of the craft, and see the sky behind it.", "round orange objects over london, englandI came home from work at 23;30(I had&apos;nt drunk even one beer!)and went out into the garden as it was a hot clear night. I saw a very bright comet, so I got out a chair to sit down just in case there were any more. Then I saw 2 orange round solid objects that gave off their own light, up in the upper atmosphere or just outside it moving very fast from southwest to northeast, they crossed all the sky I could see in 6 seconds without a sound, keeping parallel to each other and moving at a constant velocity.", "Me, my wife and her sister were driving on highway 138 near Lone Pine, Ca when my wife noticed a very bright light flying above the Inyo Mountains.  It was pulsating different colors of light from blue to green to white.  I stopped our car and we watched it slowly fly north along the mountain range.  We were scared but more fasinated.  The light then seem to get bigger and bigger and it was then we realized it was coming towards us.  I got scared and turned off the headlights.  The light seemed to pause for a little bit, then it sped away at an incredible speed to the north.  Within a second it was gone.", "Stationary silver ball very high in daytime May 1980 observed approximately 45 minutes.One clear  day in May 1980 I saw a stationary silver ball so high in the sky as to be practically invisible. I found it totally by accident while on a lunch break in a park called `Sugarhouse Park`. I was lying on my back gazing at the contrails in the otherwise clear sky. I spotted it and couldn`t believe what I was seeing. I lie there 45 minutes or so before I had to go and tell somebody and of course I could not find it again. Later on TV news was reported two similar sightings. One in Brazil, and one in Australia. The one in Brazil was moving at a high rate of speed at tree-top level with no sound and lasted about 90 seconds. The Australian sighting was out over the ocean off of a beach. It was stationary and was video taped until dark. The next morning it was gone. This all happened in a time of about two days.Absolute truth.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Washington State: 9/10/01 Two bright white burning, falling objects, one may have hit the groundWhile enjoying an evening walk near sunset (Appx 8:00 - 8:15 p.m.), we heard a small child walking on a perpendicular street exlaim &quot;wow, fireworks&quot;.  He and is two parents and a small child stopped and looked toward the sky in the SE, yet north of Mt. Rainier.  The two of us looked in the direction they were looking and saw what might be described as a falling object, very white in color, falling quickly toward the ground.  It looked almost like a Roman candle fire ball or some form of signal flare, but it was falling quickly.  No planes appeared directly in the vicinity, although 3 commercial flights were lined up for a Sea-Tac landing in the distance.  It&apos;s trajectory was not perfectly straight, nor it&apos;s speed steady.  It struck me of how a piece of plywood would fall from the sky, falling fast, then slowing and even changing it&apos;s horizontal allignment slightly as it &quot;caught air&quot;.  This first object appeared to stop burning before it hit the ground (if it hit the ground)at about 25 degrees above the horizon. My partner then stated that she could see another object, dark in color, falling very fast in the sky above the first.  I could not see it with my naked eyes but she continued to watch it and tried to point it out to me.  Within 10 to 20 seconds, this object appeared to burst into flame and burn in the same manner as the first object.  It&apos;s rate of fall and trajectory was similar to the first.  This object continued to burn and possibly did hit the ground.  Our view of it was obscured by a tree in the neighborhood, but we saw it flame down to within 5 degrees or less above the horizon when it went out of view, still very bright.  We did not hear anything nor did we see any smoke or any sort of a flash when it hit the ground.  The object flamed long enough to come down west (toward us) of the Cascade foothills in the vicinity of the White River valley SE of the City of Enumclaw. We continued to watch the sky but did not see any further activity.  We could not say for sure that the planes changed their courses, but the closest did seem to stay higher than the following two.  Upon reaching our home I did try to contact the closest FAA office in Auburn and was dismissed by the operator as a nut.  She stated in broken english that they had no reports of any such activity, laughed and then hung up the phone.  We assume it must have been some sort of space junk but are curious about why it would fall for some time, then appear to &quot;catch fire&quot; and then burn until it hit the ground.", "A stationary object stood for hours the night sky. It had three flashing lights, yellow, green and red.This one object was far away in the sky. 30 degrees east, northeast. I looked through the binoculars at it. What struck me about it being unusual was that it remained stationary in the same position, not moving. It had three colors, red, yellow and green. I thought it may be a helicopter at first, but when it was still in the same position after 15 minutes to a half hour, I thought it odd. The lights flashed. It was not a star, it was not a plane and it was not a helicopter. What it possibly could have been was a satelite, if they have flashing tri-colored lights. It appeared the next night in the same position.

I did not expect anything but this time there was a cluster of 5. I was riding a bicycle and when I got to my brothers house at approx.4:35, I made them look. We counted 7 small circular &quot;lights&quot; far up in the sky. I don&apos;t know if they had lights or were reflecting light. I watched one move in front of or behind and appear on the other side of another. They were moving in diferent patterns. Once all in a straight line. All moving north. One of these &quot;objects&quot; was much lower than the others. I thought it must be something else but my brother had binoculars. This one looked like an E and it was a spectrum on it or green and yellow lights. We watched this for about 15 minutes before they disappeared. The other events happened in the daylight also and on clear days around 5:00. The 1st event I saw 3, two stationary and 1 moving south(my neibor saw this one).

Well not quite, it was too bright and moving too fast and steadily from the NW to the SE. The light moved horizontally. Not vertically, so it was then that we realized it was something of the extraordinary. As this object got further we noticed a duplicate coming back in the opposite direction which would have been the SE heading towards the NW and the object seemed to have picked up in elevation, rising further away from earth. Have you ever seen a falling star that seemed to be falling into space as if it came from earth? We both knew we had experienced something unusual.

Two yellow and one red on one occation. One yellow ball exactly one week later@around the same time of dayThere were accually two events that occured in one week. I am not sure of the exact month, but I remember it being warm enough to go with out a coat. Both sightings happend on a Thursday and both occured at around dusk. I was in high school at the time. On the first sighting two of my friends and myself were standing on Owen Hill Rd. near the four corners of the small town of Killawog, looking south. From up over a hill to the south, maybe a mile and a half in distance, I saw a bright yellow light. I pointed it out to my two friends and as you can imagine, the three of us were mystified. I could not tell whether or not it was just a ball of light or if it was a light attached to something. The light was too bright for me to clearly see if there was a shape behind it. It was flying somewhat towards us. Mainly north-west, us being to the north. It passed over a hill to the west, out of our view. It was in our view for about 30-45 sec. Within 10 sec. of the first yellow light leaving our sight, a second ball of light came of the hill to the south from the same location as the yellow one. This one was much different. It was bright red and at least 3 times as large as the yellow one. It flew in the same exact path that the first one did, and disapeared from our view over to same location on the hill to the west. The third and final ball of light came exactly as the previous 2 had gone. the third ball was the exact same size and color as the first one. My friends and I waited where we were for about a half an hour. Partly to see if there were anymore, but mainly to listen for engine sounds. We heard none. The balls of light were definatly not traveling fast enoughto break the sound barrier. At first we all thought that they were helecopters, but we quickly relized that if they were we would have heard them. The next encounter I had was exactly a week later at roughly the same time. This time I had a different friend with me. I had told him about it and he just laughed at me. That night (dusk) we were in the ! yard of a residence a few hundred yards from where my other two friends and I had been a week prior. There is a hill that is fairly tall and has a very steep incline roughly 50 yards behind this residence. I again was to first to see it. It was coming over the hill behind the house to the south. From the south to the north. I quickly pointed it out to my friend saying &quot; See!I told I wasn&apos;t lying!&quot; As soon as my friend turned to look it appeared that the craft had turned 180&apos; heading back in the direction it had come from.((NUFORC Note:  The date is approximate.

That was around 21, or 22:00 hours, it was hard to tell the direction it was going north the zig - zaging made it hard to tell, but later on that night about 24:00 hours I saw these lights going east then it made right angle turn north, then once again made same turn, and headed east into some clouds. Never saw it again after that. It could not have been a plane because planes don&apos;t turn sharply like that, and planes don&apos;t leave trails of gas,or whatever.

I was toweling off when a fast moving &apos;golden flash&apos; caught my eye.  I looked up and saw two extremely fast moving objects flying through the sky coming towards my North Phoenix home (trajectory was southwest headed northeast). However, the objects flew on a heading to the northwest. As the objects flew past my home, I saw a third light (object?), also golden.The objects resembled chaffe or flares, but they were not falling.  They were moving horizontally and at an extremely fast clip..  They appeared to be flying in a very tight bunch. I expected the objects to fall towards the earth, but they elevated at that time.  I then went inside to see if any explosions had been reported in the area.  I checked the net &amp; televised news.  Nothing at this time.Immediate thoughts: Shooting stars (much too close to the ground), asteroids/space debris...errant missles from an F-16 (Luke Air Force Base is located in the direction that the objects came from, approx. 15 miles from my home). I must point out that I&apos;ve seen F-16&apos;s at night and during the day. A friend used to work on them at Luke. The objects were in no way near the size of an F-16.At no time did I see traditional form to the matter that passed by. No wings, smoke or trailing airstreams. However, the objects were moving so fast that the gold color trailed. One other peculiarity, there was no sound at all. I live in a sleepy residential area and at 1:05 AM, I should have heard something from objects so close to the ground. Believe me, I am 42 and have never seen anything like this.

Today (8/27/01) when I stepped out my door I first looked at the eastern horizon and noticed the planet Venus.  Then I turned towards the North and noticed a very bright light high in the NW.  Odd because I knew there were no planets in that direction, and no stars that bright (about 2-3 times the brightness of Venus).  My first thought was should I go back in &amp; get my binoculars, or just proceed towards work?  I went back in and got them.  They are Orion 9x63.  With them I expected to see only a point of light, as that is all I could see with my eyes (an apparently very bright, motionless star).  But I was suprised to see a disc.  The object had a visible diameter which immediately told me this was not a star (nova or otherwise).  I became immediately interested.  The color was pure white and very bright.  No details were visible within the bright image and for awhile no details surrounding it.  I kept watching debating whether or not to call my brother (hoping to get a triangulation) and not wishing to take my eyes off it when there was a sudden change.  I noticed the emergence of a &quot;puff of gray smoke&quot; off towards the northerly direction.  Inside this thin vaporus and expanding cloud were a number (6-12) of swimming points of light moving somewhat erratically in the same direction (generally northerly).  I then moved closer to the house and supported my arms on a step ladder to steady my view and the same event happened again, thoug the &quot;puff&quot; moved generally south and again about the same number of points of light moved off in that direction.  They did not seem to move off with any great rapidity.  The small points of light seemed to have variable brightness to them (some were brighter than others).  They did not seem to move with any purpose, but somehwat sluggishly and randomly and even seemed to slow somewhat the further they got from the bright disc, which never changed position or brightness the entire time.  Now I! really wanted to call my brother and get a triangulation, but just as I was about to do so the entire event ended with the abrupt fading of the entire scene.  Not fading, cutoff.  It just disappeared. The morning was calm, and partly cloudy.  The event was seen thru thin clouds perhaps at 10,000&apos;.  The object was above these clouds the entire time and did not move while the clouds slowly moved in a generally ESE to WSW direction.  Knowing the two locations I stood at to view this event I later used a compass and plumb bob to find the horizon coordinates, which I estimate to be the following: Elevation: 72 deg Azimuth:  300 deg (NW) During Civil Twilight I have observed balloon flights from my house quite often.  This was not a balloon, at least not a hot air balloon.  Hot air balloon are easily identified and are usually accompanied by noise when the fuel is burned for lift.  Even at high altitued one can detect the flare event from from the burn.  If it was a weather balloon (or some reasearch balloon from the University of Alaska) then I would also expect it to have changed position somewhat during the 10 minutes I observed it.  I noticed absoultely no change in position.  There was also absolutely no noise during the entire event.  If it was a balloon venting at high altitude (accidental surface rupture, or deliberate puncture) then I do not understand why the bright central disc did not seem to change position or brightness during the &quot;release event&quot;.  I also do not understand why the entire event just shut off so suddenly.

The weather was warm and the sky was blue with no clouds or obstructions. When I first observed the object it appeared to be a small dark mass resembling a spot the size of a pencil point. However, when it reached the vincinity of Liberty cap rock formation,which is at the top of the plateau, and is approx. 7000 ft in height, the object dived down towards the ground to a height of approx. 50 ft off the ground and in so doing changed directions and shape. While desending towards the ground the object continued to move at a speed of approx. 50 mph and had no sound associated with its movement. During the decent, the object chanded from a dark mass to gray/white appearance that had no defined shape. It appeared as though it had a electromagnetic field around it that was giving off a heat signature. When it reached the ground it changed shape to a perfect sphere that was pure white and extremely brilliant that resembled the light passing through a diamond. It maintained this appearance while traveling approx. 1 mile to the South at an altitude of approx. 50 ft. off the ground. When it stopped at the one mile mark it begain to hover and in so doing changed from a bright white flashing sphere to one of a bright orange. It continued to hover approx. 50 ft. off the ground while maintaining the brilliant burnt orange color. After approx. 10 min. of hover the sphere shot straight up into the air at approx. 200 mph and stopped at an altitude of approx. 8000 ft and started hovering again while maintaining the orange appearance. At that time a jet aircraft approached from the South and appeared to narrowly miss the flying object. When the jet passed over the hovering object, the unknow craft appeared to be as large as the front of the aircraft. After the aircraft flew pass the object, the object changed back to a brillia! nt white color which started to flash as a strobe light. It then flew off to the north at approx. 100 mph while maintaining the appearance of a flashing strobe light with no discernable appearance between flashes.

The F.A.A. had made a public statement that their computers had experienced a glitch that had shown flying objects over the Grand Junction area that has appeared to merge with air traffic. They wrote it off as soft wear problems. The following day, a c130 aircraft flew along the cliffs where I had observed the flying sphere. It flew at approx 200 ft. off the ground and made two passes along the cliffs in a dangerous flight path. The was the first and last time that a military aircraft was observed flying in this dangerous manner at a height and speed which would never be flown in a normal operation. I have it on good authority that the F.A.A. placed the radar data on a plane and flew it to Washington the day after the so called false sighting over Grand Junction.

Just after passing the eastbound scanner and block signal at mile post 576 (10 miles north of Laramie), I looked out of the front window of the engine just to my right, and saw an orange fireball go straight up in the air, just beyond a rise in the terrain, and come right back down again. I said to my colleague, &quot;Did you see that!&quot; But he was reading, and didn&apos;t notice it. The object from where I was, looked like a baseball that had been soaked in gasoline, and set on fire. It resemebled the sun on a bright day, but with flames all around it. I would say from where I saw it, it was the size of an old school kickball. (I initially thought it was kids, but the area there is sparsely populated.) Upon proceeding with the train through the cut in the rise, about 3/4 of a mile further on, I looked back to the Northwest. I noticed what looked like a very bright, orange ball on the ground.  This would have been the correct location from where it had gone up in the air , and came back down again.  There are no houses or other structures there, just open field. I looked several more times, and the object at that time looked like a bright campfire, about the size of a baseball, as at this point, I was about 2 to 3 miles from it, and moving away. Since I saw this, I have looked over there to see if there could be a Ranch house or other structure, but there is just open range.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length, and we found him to be exceptionally credible.

We had been partying with loud rock and roll music with our car doors open, when someone yelled &quot;look!&quot;, pointing up in the sky.   We looked up and there in the sky was this huge red orb.  It was hard to tell how close.  I thought it actually looked like a planet ~ I quickly sought out the moon.  The moon was clearly visible a great distance from the object.  The reason the orb looked planetlike was because it was fiery red, glowing, opaque and had something around it, like a grey cloud or through it. Fortunately or unfortunately it just hung there.  It made no sound, it didn&apos;t move.  We watched for maybe 1/2 hour, then people got worried, jumped in their cars and we all drove off.((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.

With commercial air traffic stopped for 3 days, the skys were sadly quite. I do not wish to add to the current state of confussion, but feel I must note any strangness in the skys around NYC. On this day Sunday Sept 16 2001 at 3:30 pm in sunny warm cloudless skies I saw what I thought could be a Mylar balloon or satelite at high alttitude. The size of the object when first sighted was 1/2 to 1/4 the size of a marbel held at arms lenght. The strange aspect of this object was it appeared rock steady showing no movement. It also showed no dissernable shape, and seemed highly reflective of the bright sunlite. Because size was hard to determine, I would guestimate an altitude of 20,000 feet( a full size commercial jet appeared in the sky but not near the object) the jet appeared as large as a marbel at arms lenght but at only 1/2 the objects altitude. At the time of the sighting I was sitting on the stairs of the Garden City Long Island railroad station, facing due east. The LIRR runs east to west for easy referance. As I had 2 young children in my care at the time, and because of close proximity to the train tracks, I could not study the object to closely. I decided to walk the children 3 blocks to there home. In the 15 to 20 min walk home the object did not move at all. Once home I ran into the house for a pair of Busnell 10 x 50 binoculars. The object appeared to be over central Nassau county in the area of Mithcel Feild/ Uniondale.( a side note this object would have had a clear line of sight view of the World Trade Center 22 miles away) If I were to point at the object my arm would be at about 60 degrees. SMy freind also looked at the object through the binoculars, we both feel this object did not look--- and more immportanly act like a balloon. I ran into the house and went online for an AOL weather report for our zip code, here is the live weather for the sighting. Clear sunny skies temp 70 degrees--winds south at 8 mph---humidity 49%--barometer 30.07 . I next ran to the local grocery store and brought 3 crome look mylar balloons. Since the object was to my east one would excpect when I released the mylar balloon it would follow on that path ( if the object was also a balloon too). The balloons when released acted like what I  would excpect a balloon to act like, and followed the winds to the south, 45% away from the object I first viewed 39 min earlier. I should also note the balloons had nowhere near the same reflectivity as they twisted and turned on thier accent, with an occassional flash of sunlite, simular to a cameras flashbulb. Also the balloons I released stayed low in the horizion, and went no higher than 25%, but that could be attributed to the amount of helium in the balloon. It was futher determined, that infact the object did raise up in altitude, or reduced in size slowly through out the sighting untill it was no longer visible. I feel confident this was no balloon or satelite and will be even more vigilant of our great cities skies.", "Large v shaped object buzzes house and shines lights in window while people eat and viewers seem non existant to all others in house.Its been awhile . . . I was in or just out of high school and the years were between 1984-1987, (I know I was driving so probably closer to senior year of 1985), and had driven over to a friends house to hang out. We were listening to tapes and talking upstairs when the entire house began to rumble and shake. The window sills, door frames etc actually were vibrating and shaking. It sounded like a plane, low distance rumble which slowly increased.  We both ran to the window and to our amazement were shocked to see a v shaped object with wings and windows and coloered lights flying just over the tree tops of the house and development.  It had to be at least 100 feet long. Lights shot out of it hitting the ground and house. As it moved over the house we ran to the back window and looked at it.  It appeared to change shape or get smaller with long red, yellow and blue beams shining into the house windows on the first floor.  During this time my friends family had guests over and were eating in the dinning room.  We ran down the stairs to see the Dining Room flooded with these beams of colored light but no one seemed to notice us or was even aware of the lights except for my friend and I.  It was as if we were privy to see this and no one else was.  As we watched what must have seemed for awhile we noticed the lights scanned the entire inside of the home where my friends parents were entertaining.  Everyone appeared to be moving in slow motion but us. We diliberaely stayed aware from the lights.  We grabbed our car keys and ran out side to the backyard which was boardered by trees and watched as it slowing moved over the shubbery and out over some empty farmland in back.  The shape appeared to be long and rectangular but the beams of light gave it a spider like quality.  We then hoped in our car hoping to follow it, the car didn&apos;t start right away and when we got out to where we could see it again it had just head out towards NYC up into the air.  The funny part is -my friends parents didn&apos;t see anything we! re compl etely unaware of anything during the whole experience.  Needless to say, to this day my friend won&apos;t talk about it and what we saw I can not explain - just that later that summer, I and my mother were visited by a bouncing ball of blue light which slowly bounced across our backyard and then after I got back in bed appeared at my bedroom window - flooding my bedroom with an electric blue light.  My bed shock and I was paralized and unable to move unitil it left. To this day,  I do know that since I have been real little I&apos;ve had experiences at seeing things and encounters up to my present age. I just don&apos;t have anyone to talk to about them or to turn to.  If anyone during 1984-1987 saw anything like this late in the evening can you please right about it.  I know this was to large for someone else not to have seen unless it was meant to happen like that.  Please note, at this point in time I would like to remain unknown.  Thank you.

I had never travelled this highway before, but was told later that it was remote, unpopulated ranch land.  As I approached a rise, I could see the reflection of a flashing blue light in the haze on the other side of the rise, but could not see the light itself.  I assumed it was the flashing light of a communication tower.  When I topped the rise, to my left was a flashing blue light about tree top height over the fence line, right next to the highway.  To my astonishment, the light, which appeared to have been hovering, immediately went from stationary to 65 miles per hour, traveling still over the fence line next to the highway, as though looking at me through the drivers side window of my van.  The light was bright blue, about the size of a basketball, flashed about every second, and I heard no sound from it. For several minutes the light stayed right beside my van.  I thought maybe I was beside a train or something, but later found out there were no tracks beside the highway.  The light drifted behind me, and I slowed down to do a u-turn to try and figure out what I had just seen.As I slowed to about 10 miles an hour and was about to turn around, the light appeared outside my drivers side window, again as though staring at me through the window.  Now I am scared, and I jammed on the gas, only to see the light accelarate at the same speed I was going.  For the next 15 or so miles the light travelled right beside, behind, or over my van.  At times I could see it over the highway in my rear view mirror.  At other times I could not see the light itself, but could see the flash reflected in the haze, realizing that it was right over my van.  It would also move over the ditch on the other side of the highway(Blowing my theory that I was beside a train running on tracks beside the highway).  As I approached the city of Post, the light finally disappeared from view.  I reported the incident to a deputy sherriff I saw coming out of a cafe, assurring him I was not some crazy person or high on something.

Then the other witnesses came out and I told them what I had seen and they too looked in the sky and saw it. It appeared to moving by then so we got in the car and drove not far from where we were and watched we saw other objects in the sky but they seemed to be planes and didn&apos;t have the same lights and light patterns that the object did. Then we drove to a marina to see if we couldn&apos;t get a better look and we could, it was far away by then but it was still noticeable we watched for about half an hour and it stood still for a long time then it would almost zigzag again and the stand still and then do it again and then go up and down quit always and then go back to its original position when we decided to leave it was in about the same spot it was when we first saw it at the marina.

The photo was taken at Arches National Park at around 7:30 or 8:00 pm (not completely dark yet) when I stopped the car to take a picture of a beautiful rock formation with the almost full moon in the sky.  I only noticed the object after the film from the vacation was developed, and even then, it took about 3 or 4 times looking at the photos to even spot it.There is only one object in the photo.  It is positioned in the upper left-hand corner of the picture of rock formations and the almost full moon.  It appears to be  disk shape with the faint appearance of a dome.  It appears to be gray or silver in color.  It appears to have some type of illumuniation around the circumference.  There were no sounds that caught my attention while taking the photo.  The sky was very clear, without any clouds, and it was nearly dark.  The weather was warm and comfortable.((NUFORC Note:  We have requested a copy of the photo.

It was not big.", "Wedge formation of 5 round (or disc) shaped objects glowing pale green flying north incredibly fast  on 9/30/01 @ 7:15PM over Portland((NUFORC Note:  Witness states dates of January 30 and September 30.  We presume he means September 30.  PD))Saturday, January 30th ((sic??)), 2001, approximate time - 7:15PM The sun had set with only the slightest pale blue afterglow in the West horizon. The sky was perfectly clear with many stars visible. I was out on my back deck with 2 friends having dinner.I was leaning back in my chair admiring the clear night sky when I saw an extremely bright white falling star streak across the Eastern horizon moving incredibly fast toward the south. It was literally only visible for 1 second, but left a long streak across my retina. I remarked excitedly for my 2 friends to look, but it was already too late. It was only because of the falling star that we saw what happened next.For the next minute we all stood there craning our necks staring at the sky. At this time, there appeared a passenger plane at cruising altitude over to the east, moving slowly towards the NW.Literally less than a minute passed before the friend to my immediate left said &quot;What&apos;s that?&quot; and pointed straight up. I had been looking toward the East where I saw the shooting star, but I looked straight up and saw what she was talking about. The third person with us never saw anything, because the event was over in just a few seconds, and she never locked on.Basically, this is what we saw: Directly overhead there was a formation of very pale greenish dots. They appeared to be very high, but immediately looked very strange and unlike anything I had seen before. The lights didn&apos;t appear to be navigation lights, as they weren&apos;t points of light, like on a plane, but actual round shapes. Also, the light itself was very strange, because unlike stars, especially falling stars, and/or lights from a plane, they were very pale against the black sky - almost stealthy. It was as if the objects themselves were glowing, and giving off an eerie glow or haze immediately around each shape, as opposed to having lights on the surface.The shapes were arranged in a wedge formation, with a point craft, and 3 more falling back on the right side at a 45 degree angle, and 1 off the point on the left side at a matching opposed angle. 5 objects total. They were close together, and looked like a formation that fighter jets might have flown in, but nothing (in my opinion) man-made could possibly move that fast, and there was no sonic boom or any other noise from them.They flew in a perfectly straight line heading north. They were moving so fast that they literally flew across the whole sky and out of our sight in less than 4 seconds! It was amazing! To give you a reference, the commercial aircraft literally had moved maybe 3 inches across the sky from our perspective in the time it took these objects to span the entire expanse of the open sky and disappear into the horizon, and it was visible to us for several minutes after the formation vanished.Naturally, we started yelling &quot;Oh my God - did you see that???&quot; and the like, and found out that unfortunately only 2 of us had seen them. We compared what we saw, and every last detail, including the arrangement and color of the objects was identical. I racked my brain to try to figure out what it could have been, but couldn&apos;t think of anything that made sense. If a shooting star hit the atmosphere and broke apart, it is highly unlikely that the peices would have formed a perfectly spaced formation, and would have been bright white in color, like a magnesium fire, not pale green. If it was a missile, again, why the formation and the color? I am sure it wasn&apos;t a plane because of the impossible velocity.I was very curious to see if anyone else saw these objects, as it was a warm night and I&apos;m sure there were thousands of people like us out enjoying the weather. Also, the passenger plane was in the vicinity, and flying in a trajectory that would have eventually intersected with the path the formation had flown, so I wondered if they could have seen them too.It was so strange and awesome that I literally was beside myself for a few minutes, but now I am stuck in a rut where I want to tell people that I am pretty sure I saw something unnatural, but am afraid of being ridiculed. I would love to find out what it was if there is an explanation! So there you have it.", "Cigar shaped, aproxematly 100 ft. long, lights on each end that changed color, and made 3 musical tones.Me and my friend were out on my porch when we looked across the river from my house and saw a cigar shaped u.f.o.

Above the antena group, I saw this jet black rectangle that had four small white lights on each corner and in the middle was a greenish gold light in the center. It hovered there for what seemed to be a couple of minutes.  My partner and I watched it as we were driving northbound on the interstate.  We knew what radio stations were broadcasting from that tower group.  We tuned in those radio stations and there sememed to be no interfearence from the object.  Shortly thereafter, the light in the middle of the object turned a bright greenish white and took off at an incredible accelaration towards the north north east.  There was no sound from the craft during hovering or during it&apos;s departure. I figure that the size of it was roughly the same as a football field, judging it&apos;s position relative to the ground and radio towers.

It was approx. the size of the horizontal tail section of the tanker, not very large.  It kept it&apos;s position until the last tanker flew over and then the object instantaneously began flying along side the tanker at the same speed.  This means it went from zero speed to whatever speed the tankers were flying, I&apos;m guessing 200 mph.  The object followed the tanker until it went behind a row of trees.  The object did not seem to be making any sounds of it&apos;s own at least different from the tankers, but then the tankers were very loud and the object could have been making some kind of sound.

Kanata Ontario, Canada.There was a clear and nice blue sky. I always observe the sky. I was in my car and my wife was driving north. We were going to the movies. I first saw a jet plane flying high going west at an altitude of 45 degrees. I could clearly saw the white trail the plane was leaving behind. I watched the plane until it disappeared in the distance. One minute after, I look southwest and I saw what I first believe to be another plane at an altitude of 30-35 degrees.  It looked to be closer than the commercial jet plane, but you could tell it was very high. It was moving northeast at a steady speed. The first thing I noticed is that there was no white trail, and it was moving just too fast and high to be a glider or small airplane. It looked like a metallic object (commercial jet plane like) but perfectly cylindrical. Looking with more attention, I noticed a quasi-transparent dome shape attached to the top of the object (similar in texture to what you can see when the moon is barely visible during the day)and what appeared to be like a variable haze sorrounding the object. I immediately told my wife to look. Even though she was driving, she could see it too. I though then that it was high altitude balloon, but again the payload seemed just too big and it was moving way too fast. As the object became closer (altitude of 60-70 degrees) I had to stick my head out of the sunroof to look at it. I laugh to myself because the shape of the object was just like a UFO portrayed in a bad cartoon or B movie; transparent dome like with metallic base. As we were moving north, I saw one person walking at the street looking at it puzzled. Once we reached the AMC parking lot, I saw a helicopter flying at ~500m above, this gave me a point of reference. The apparent size was of a big commercial jet plane flaying high.

We were on our way home one night in July, and through the trees that lined the street, we saw somthing that scared us both to death, and that we did not talk about untill just recently.  Through the trees, we saw three bright white lights in the shape of a very large triangle.  It was easily 150 long and at least 50 feet wide.  It was floating very slowly, heading west.  There was a noise coming from the craft...a very low humming sound.  It was almost undetectable - as a matter of fact, if we wouldn&apos;t have been looking right at the craft, we probably wouldn&apos;t have noticed any noise at all.  It traveled slowly, maybe 10 miles an hour.  Neither one of us could believe our eyes, and we continued to chase it all the way down the street.  The most incredible thing about the craft was how low it was flying.  At most, it was 50 feet off the ground.  The white lights on the corners of the craft did not illuminate the craft so much as the street, so we couldn&apos;t really see what color the craft was, or what kind of material it was made of.  As we reached the end of the street, we were almost directly underneath the craft.  It then started to bank to it&apos;s left (south, tward the woods).  It traveled a bit further, at the same pace, and then we lost view of it because of the trees.  We could still see the white lights through the leaves, and then, abruptley, their was a huge flash of purple light from the center of the white lights (and if I remember correctly, the humming got more irritating...the pitch didn&apos;t change, it just got more intense), and then it was gone.  Neither one of us saw any of the lights lift up into the sky, they were just gone after the explosion of purple light.

It did not flicker, and remained totally visible unless I would lose sight of it behind a tree. When this happened, within a second or so, it would reappear from behind the object. In spite of the erratic and random nature of its movement, it did seem to be confined to a reasonably small area of the ski. I would estimate the horizontal boudaries of its excursion to be perhaps 30 or 40 degrees, and the vertical, perhaps a little less.After a minute or so of watching it, I ran into the house to grab a video camera and ran out to try to catch it on video. I was never able to get it into the view finder, a failure that I found rather disturbing, sine I am very adept at video movies. For what it is worth, not once did I get a glimps of it in the view finder. I speculated that the intensity was not sufficient or that it was moving too fast for me to catch it, though the latter does not seem to be a reasonable explanation.Eventually, it disappeared by moving behind a tree, down toward the horizon.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length, and we found him to be an exceptionally good witness.

It was square shaped with two blue lights on the two corners to the left as you look at it and two red lights on the two corners on the right. There was a white or yellow light in the center, but it didn&apos;t attract your attention as much as the blue and red lights did and the fact that it was square.  The sky was pitch black so you only saw the lights on the formation of the square.  By the time I slowed the car down to a stop the object was in the sky above the tree line, but far enough away you couldn&apos;t see details, just the shape and the lights.  It didn&apos;t appear to be moving and we couldn&apos;t take our eyes off of it.  When my passenger rolled the window down to see even better, it took off heading west, but only for a split second and then was completely gone from the sky.  It wasn&apos;t a helicopter; there wasn&apos;t any noise and it was square, and of course we know what a helicopter looks like.  It wasn&apos;t a plane obviously, because in wasn&apos;t moving, simply above us in the sky and again it was square and planes don&apos;t hover in one spot above the trees.  I&apos;m thankful there were two of us that saw this object.  There was another car on the same road as us and they slowed down also.  We would love to know what they saw.((NUFORC Note:  The witness seemed exceptionally credible to us.

The delineation of the night sky and &apos;Popo&apos; are very clear. My Live-cam updates in a minute. Then there was a frame of a group of deep bright blue lights, a centre and 5 around it --very clear and in the same foreground distance as approximately the parked headlights.

The size of one of the ships would be relevent to the distance of your index finger and your middle finger spread out.  Though the sun was very bright, and we could only see the two objects in the shade, they seemed to be very high up in the atmosphere.  But what puzzles me, is that the objects nevertheless took an half an hour to leave sight, but they didn&apos;t leave any after burn trail at all like our aircrafts do.  On the two objects the lights seem to be a very bright color, not determined because of the brightness of the day, but they seemed to be a bright white, all six in unison.

PD", "Triangle shaped, 3 lights, at night, gliding over the city, seemed transluscent in a wayDate/time is approximate..since I only wrote this down later from memory...I never have considered myself as destined to sight a UFO, but did I? The other night I heard a jet passing overhead.  I looked up.  It was low but...the distance wing to wing of it&apos;s lights was small.  I can&apos;t guess how high it was but it answered a question I had been considering for a few weeks now.  This craft was not super high up and not low...and I could hear it clearly over the road noise.  And the distance, wing to wing of its lights was quite small.  Why is this important? A couple weeks ago I was about to enter my home.  I live in the suburbs.It was a very clear night.  Stars could be seen.  The city lights obscured the horizon though.  I looked up.  At about 45 degrees I saw something.I say something because I stared at it and could not figure out what it was.  I ran every explanation and captured as much detail about the experience in my head as I could because I knew I would be trying to recognize what I saw for some time.Hold your arm out at 45 degrees.  Spread your index finger and thumb apart.  This is the approximate distance tip to tip of two of the lights on this thing.  The front light, making a triangle, was not way out in front.  It made the shape of a  hangglider, not a jet.  There were 3 lights in this triangle shape.  The lights moved synchronous with each other so I assumed that they were attached to the same object.  Given it&apos;s wingspan I figured it was either very low...or if high...it was very big...If it was very high then it was larger than any aircraft I could even conceive.If it was very low then I should hear the noise of whatever was powering it.It was totally silent...not a bit of noise...it simply floated by.  It could have been a hangglider but it&apos;s movement didn&apos;t suggest that and there was no hill and again no sound from a motor so it would be governed by the wind...it did not suggest this...besides what idiot would do this in the dark? The &quot;thing&quot; simply cruised across the sky at a steady speed..not fast..not slow.  Making absolutely no noise.  It took a matter of about 20 seconds for it to move from me spotting it above me until it just vanished into the horizon lit by the city lights....it just sort of faded into the lights.I had an idea that between the 3 lights there was a craft yet it seemed like I could see thru that part to the dark sky behind it.  Since I was in the city and the stars...although visible, did not fill the sky...I had no means to determine if I could see the stars thru the craft or that there was a solid mass between the lights which would block out the stars.That&apos;s about it.  I keep replaying this happening for me in my mind. Over and over.  Trying to determine what known flying object that could have been.  I never dreamed that I would ever be destined to see a craft from another world...but now I&apos;m reconsidering that.", "Circular ball of fire racing across the sky on the day america was attacked.A couple of friends and I were looking to the skys for any air traffic since there was only military traffic alowed. We saw two Air Force Jets in single file heading toward Otis Air Force Base in Cape Cod. They were fairly close together and in quite a hurry. Approxamatly one minute after these jets flew out of sight, my friend pointed out a circular object orange in color moving at an enormous rate of speed across the open sky. It seemed to zigzag and dance across the sky as if it was intelligent, and then disapeared behind some trees. Ive never seen anything as fast as this in mid air. About ten min past and we kept looking in amazment for anything else when the same object came across the sky again from the east to south west with the same speed and spiratic movement, and again disapeared behind some trees.

The craft was about 20 miles away above a Air Force called Wright Patterson AFB. The craft was really just a very bright light, thats why I said the shape was unknown. I said there were possibly 2 because the craft moved around for about 30 seconds and then it disappered, and then re-appeared, so I don&apos;t know if this was the same craft or a second.

At first, I thought the objects might be large birds, but as they neared, I could see no wings, nor did they seem to act like birds.  They were in a close group.  I turned left (south) on Washington Blvd., went one block, u-turned, and parked the car at Diamond Oaks Blvd. and Washington Blvd.  We both got out of the car and continued to observe the objects. There were six objects, all oval-shaped, no sound, and were maneuvering in various patterns, close to each other.  At the nearest point to us, they were approximately 75 to 80 degrees above the horizon, i.e., not directly overhead.  These objects moved under their own power and performed fascinating maneuvers.  For example, they formed three pairs in a loose triangular shape, they would move into straight lines, into a semi-circle, into two groups of three forming a &apos;delta wing&apos;, then move into a curve, etc.  Two or three times, the objects moved away from us, but then they would move in an arc, change from white to bright silver, and come back near us.  At one point, they reversed direction, but without performing a turn.  It was difficult to determine the size of the objects or their distance from us, but I had a strong feeling that binoculars would have been the perfect tool for studying these things, i.e., they were just slightly beyond my ability to see exact detail. As an experiment, my wife removed her sunglasses for a moment, and said that the objects could barely be discerned, as they matched the sky&apos;s background nearly perfectly.  But with sunglasses on, they were very discernable.  After five to ten minutes, the objects again formed into two groups of three in a delta shape, and I watched them as they rapidly moved in a north-east direction and vanished into the sky.

The Red Light had a duratino of approximately 3 to 10 seconds, with an elevation of approximately 400-500 feet. After the red light disappeared, there was a large bright-white &quot;explosion &quot; between 50-100 feet above the original location of the red light. The &quot;explosion was then accompanied by a smaller flashing blue-white light, hich appeared to be flashing in a pattern. In a rural area, this light was extreamly unusual as there are no power or cellular towers in that direction and area. After observing this for about half an hour, I confirmed with the Local Municipal Airport Radar Control(Mansfield Lahm Internation Airport) that there was indead something in the sky. According to the Controler, there were four objects in that general location that were appearing on radar, but thaey were not any form of known aircraft. They appeared to him as ghost objects on the radar, but kept re-appearing, and were moving almost due North in a straight line, and were moving at an abnormally low rate of speed. After confirmation that what I was witnessing was indeed real, I started observing the lights even closer. The lights appeared top be on a translucent structure between 400-500 foot tall. THere were four red lights forming an almost perfec geometric square. After the Red light would disppear, and before the White lights would start flashing I could see the structure, it was very narrow in appearance. Approximately 20 foot wide. While the lights were not on, I could notice a &quot;cloud&quot; at the very bottom of this structure, but there was no real substance to the structure. I could see landscape behind the object, but it appeared to be distorted, or out of focus. When either of the lights would reappear, the cloud at the bottom would be gone. Also, upon closer investigation ( I Got out the binocular) The red lights appeared to be emitting a laser of some form. You could see the beam due to! the hum idity in the air. At approximately 23:00 I witnessed nine aircraft flying over the vincinity, and appeared to be in a search pattern over the unknown object. Also, I was able to write down the flashing pattern of the lights, and it appears to repeat itself.

I had been doing pretty well fishing, when I noticed a white light on the other side of the lake. I figuered it must have been another fisherman&apos;s lantern. The light appered to be moving slowly as though someone was walking with the lantern. All of a sudden I saw two bright red lights from the area where the lantern was. At first I thought who ever had the lantern was getting into their vehicle and leaving. It seemed strange (too big for a car or truck)so by this time I was entranced on the lights. They slowly moved up the side of the mountain and as it moved up it turned sidways and there it was, a cold black triangle shaped craft, the lights had become three light fading from red to amber almost pinkish. I watched the craft, which was probably 100 feet long in comparison with the background which is very familiar to me, move back down the side of the mountain and began hovering over the lake. It moved silently around skimming over the top of the lake. All of a sudden the red lights went dark and they were replaced by one very bright white light. At this time I heard the sound of something spinning, it made a wobbling sound that would speed up and slow down. This went on for sometime.

I felt compeled to look directly up and noticed a kids round mylar(bluish)balloon drifting by at about 15 mph @ 150&apos; and rising while it was heading to the head of the bay.While I was watching the ballon I noticed directly the right of the ballon a most peculiar shape that seemed to defy description.It was pacing the balloon as it went along about 40&apos; -50&apos; away from it.It appeared to be 30&apos;- 40&apos;circular.....damn hard to describe.I&apos;ll have to use an analogy.Take a frisbee, construct it out of cellaphane. Remove the top centre flat portion leaving just the edge.This transparent circular thing was becoming more visable in someplaces and hardly visable in others about it&apos;s circumference.It was kind of like the edge was rolling up and then unrolling as it paced the kids balloon.As the balloon slowly stalled and just floated higher the circular phenomenon&apos;s visability just tapered off to nothing.It was truly spooky,I would have photographed it had I the chance. P.S. when I first noticed the kids ballon I was wishing that the poor souls and victims of the hijackings in the U.S. could find some solace.((NUFORC Note:  I believe we spoke with this witness, and we found him to be quite sincere and seemingly credible.

It looked like it was kind of low, so we continued to watch it. After a few seconds or so, all the lights in the front went out, like they didn&apos;t want to be seen. We kept waiting to hear the sounds of a plane but none came. It passed a few yards above our heads, still without making any noise at all. It was so strange: it looked like a plane until it passed over us and then it looked like a wedge of cheese cut from a wheel.There were five flashing lights under it: red, blue, amber, green and white. We couldn&apos;t see through it. After it passed over us, it headed across the access road that lead to the water treatment plant.

The sky was clear and there was little or no wind.  Another item worth noting is that because of the World Trade Building attack there was no air traffic.  This item was north west of me and looked to be a mile away.  The item was silver in color and seemed to be disc shaped.  I watched this item for about five minutes.  During this time the item would fly level and then turn on edge.  It did this many times.  When it would turn on edge the sun would shine off of it and I could tell that it was disc shaped.

I was about ten miles out of Lafayette In. traveling twords my exit. I noticed an object in the sky at this point to my left. The highway is very dark, it was nine at night, and there are NO street lights lining the road. I first noticed the red &quot;globe&quot; of light in the middle of the object as I approached it. The object was floating VERY close to the road and quite low. It was on the other side, (North bound lanes) of traffic so I had to look across to see it. At this point I am still approaching it and think it is a red light on a tower of somesort, then I start to become horizontally in line with it as I pass, I look ,and as soon as I saw the 5 or so red flashing lights on the bottom of the craft that were flashing on and off slowly I knew what I thought I was seeing. I had a very good view of the object At this point, and so did others in the northbound lanes because I remember every car that approached the scene started braking. The object itself was about 2 to 3 hundred feet in the air and I just stared in awe. What I saw was a craft that was very dome like in appearence, the thing that was most odd was how this dome that made up 80% of the object was transparant this is how I could see the red light that never flashed in the middle. The red lights around the bottom were the same size as the one in the middle, and they appered to be attached to the saucer bottom part of the craft that the dome sat on. These lights flashed in unison at intervals of about 2 seconds. It was just like I saw on tv, it was like a movie was being played in front of me in the sky, I couldn&apos;t believe how fictonally sterotipical this UFO looked. I passed the object, kept staring and followed it until I was out of sight of it. I never saw the object zoom off, it really just hovered slightly as I was passing it anyway, no supersonic blastaways. I rac! ed to ca tch up to my girlfreind who was in my truck who was about 1/2 a mile in front of me, all she had noticed was the people braking, not the object though.

We were standing on my private road in a dark section of my property, and kind-of pointing out various constellations. I live in a rural section of the mountain/desert areas north of L.A. It was a totally clear night, maybe one or two extremely small bits of cirrostratus cloud, hardly bigger than your finger on an extented arm. There was a small amount of scattered light from the urban areas to the south, but not too much. There was no moon, and the air was pleasant, about 70 degrees. I, and the others, happened to be looking over the mountains to the SE (Mt. Gleason) and there we saw what appeared to be a comet, low on the horizon. I was watching it for about 5-10 seconds, and I said to Anthony, &quot;Is that the comet you&apos;re gonna look at when you set your scope up?&quot; He was looking, too, and he said, &quot;There&apos;s no comet supposed to be there this early in the year,&quot; Well, as we look at it, it gets MUCH brighter, and suddenly seems to surge toward us, passing either into or behind a small cirrostratus wisp of cloud, which lit-up interactively. It continued in a NW direction, very quick, accelerating much faster and glowing much brighter than any plane or chopper. It now appeared to be much lower and closer, maybe 20,000-40,000 feet altitude, somewhere over the San Gabriel Valley. It was approxamately 40 degrees above the horizon. Suddenly it came to an abrupt stop, and just as suddenly shot off to the north for about 2 seconds, it&apos;s sky track paralleling the horizon and covering about the width of your hand with your arm extended out front. Another sudden stop. Another abrupt course shift, back toward us, heading NW. No regular aircraft could withstand the G-force required of such instantaneous manuevers. It then shot hard to the west for another 2 seconds, stopped instantly, glowed incredibly bright, and shot straight up, fading to nothing in about 1.5 seconds. I remember saying, &quot;It&apos;s clearly exhibiting some non-ballistic movements.&quot; It was quite evident this was a strange craft. It glowed like a bright star, with a hint of changing color around the edges. It really didn&apos;t have a shape, per se, but for a star, it did appear... thick, or fat. The star&apos;s disk was bigger than Jupiter on a good night. It also appeared to briefly leave a very faint trail, which disappeared within1/4 second from being laid down, almost making it&apos;s movements look the way pionts of light used to look as seen by old Vidicon tube video cameras with their slight, brief trails.", "What is best described as an elongated off-white irridescent oval object, appeared in the center of the clear sky, going silently to the west.

It was flying very low, about 100 feet above the tree tops. It was in sight for about four minutes, due to trees blocking the view. I had assumed that discs were silver, and the triangular ones were black. It was rather large. I would guess it would take up about 1/2 an acre if it landed. It DID make a sound. It sounded like a pulsing jet engine. It wasn&apos;t particularly loud, however. There was a lot of air traffic last night. Particularly high flying, fast jets.

This event triggered my curiosity as to seeing if I could spot any other aircraft overhead as time working in the yard passed by. At approximately 2:15pm I noticed a shimmering object in the sky and instinctively went for my binoculars thinking I would see another airliner. What I focused in on was not in my opinion an airliner. It changed shape and color,and disappeared/reappeared frequently.I have no idea what its altitude was,but it was close enough to distinguish shapes and colors in the binoculars.For approx. 15 min it did not change in size or position, so it was obviously stationary.It changed from glowing metallic to a blood red fireball every 2-3 seconds, then disappeared and reappeared in its same position every 5-10 seconds.When it changed to the fireball, it seemed to look as if the fireball was surrounded by a black ring.(I know it sounds like an afterburner from an f-15 but jet fighters move quickly and this stayed in place for 15 min. with no change in size or position.)No audible sound was heard. In the process of setting up a telescope to get a closer look, I asked my wife if she would keep an eye on it but it disappeared before I could get a focus on it with the telescope. My connection at Newark Airport informed me there were no other flights in the area at that time. If anyone else saw a similar event at or near this time, please post it.

It may have been a lot higher but I&apos;m not really sure about that. The Object was circular, solid in appearance but without any distinct markings. It almost resembled the color of a cloud.( offwhite) The object I feel was going supersonic speed because it was out of sight in no time at all, headed in a Northeast direction.

The object was much higher in altitude than a blimp should be.  The alititude that this object was at was at least the cruising altitude of a aeroplane.  It was bigger in size than a aeroplane by a huge amount. The object was very stationary, and had a reddish rustic tinge of colour to it (there were no obvious trails of smoke, there was no movement from this object, it was just suspended there. I told my my husband look at that up there.  Of course, he was driving the car so he had a few seconds here and there to gaze up and look at this object.  He said &quot;that&apos;s strange what is that&quot;?.  I continued to observe the object in the sky, and he continued to drive the car as we were heading back to our home in Surrey, B.C.  We turned right onto a main road (called Willingdon Avenue) this road would lead us to the freeway back to our hometown.  The journey down &quot;Willingdon Avenue&quot; would probably take us about 7 minutes to get us onto the freeway. I kept my eyes on this object in the sky, as we travelled down Willingdon Avenue. I could see the object the whole time, aside from the occasional tree, in the way.  My husband glanced over many times to confirm for himself that it was still there.  So, for about the next several minutes, I observed the object sit there in the sky and not move at all.  As we now came in sight of the freeway sign to take us Eastbound back to Surrey, I looked behind me to get a fix on the object.  It was still stationary for a few more moments.  Then the object moved across the sky at an increadible speed towards the North West. I told my husband &quot;oh my god&quot; it&apos;s just moved over.  He said &quot;where, where&quot;?  I asked my husband to pull over and check this out.  We were on the left side of the HOV Lane (2 or more person freeway lane) we slowed down and stopped the car. (Not a particularly safe place to stop) but we both wanted to check this object out.  I told my husband &quot;look up there&quot; as I had been keeping very close tabs on where the object went.  The object now appeared as a dark dot in the sky.  The size of the object at this new location (North Western sky) was about the size at the end of a ballpoint pen.  The colour of the object now was black and the shape of this object from this distance appeared to be a circle.  The object was definately a lot further away than when originally spotted. My husband and I watched the black dot in the sky on the side the freeway. We were running out of time, as we had an engagement that evening downtown Vancouver,so we left from that location, and headed home. We could not believe what we had seen.  My husband said he had never seen an object move with that speed and could not imagine any man made engineered object with propulsion capabilities such as would move a great object of that size at the speed we witnessed. About 1 1/2 hours after we got home to Surrey, my husband and I, had to get back onto the freeway to go to our engagement with family members in downtown Vancouver.  I was again the passenger in the car, and we were now travelling West towards downtown Vancouver.  I was observant of the skys, and I was talking to my husband about the object the entire journey into Vancouver.  We were near the border of Burnaby and Vancouver (but still in Burnaby at this point), I noticed a black object, stationary in the sky again.  I said to my husband &quot;honey, If I told you I can see it again right now would you believe me&quot;!??.  He said &quot;what&quot;?  I told him &quot;pull over again and get a look at this&quot;.  He then looked up into the sky, it must have been around 7:30 - 7:45 pm and he couldn&apos;t believe his eyes. It was the object again, oval shaped and very dark black background, no light or colours eminating from it, just a large oblong/shaped thing in the sky.  We watched for a few minutes.  Again, we were very pressed for time, so we took off heading for the downtown part of Vancouver. All the way driving into downtown Vancouver , I was fixed on the object which didn&apos;t move location for a long time. I observed it for a least 10 minutes more, but after that, it seemed to be getting smaller (probably either moving away (such as going south or it was moving upwards towards the atmosphere), but it definately was going somewhere.  I lost complete sight of the object when we got to the location of 1st and Main Street in Vancouver.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found her to be exceptionally eloquent and credible.

At first we thought it was a plane but then it stopped and just hovered above us. I ran inside and got a high voltage torch and pointed at the object it was a rectangle and was spinning in circles. It sat hovering for about another 10mins and then as quick as it had come it was gone.((NUFORC Note:  Monday was August 13.  We have changed the date.  PD", "11:15 pm.  Looking South from the Halekulani Hotel on Wikiki beach, 6th floor. I had arrived earlier that day with my wife, and had NOT been drinking.  The hotel balcony is only about 300 feet from the ocean.  I first noticed a disk shaped object hovering what appeared to be 30-40 feet above the beach.  At first I thought this was a seagull sized bird flying in place against the ocean breeze.  This seemed unlikely, since it was 11:15pm and the wind was barely blowing.  My next thought was that this faintly outlined disk shaped object could be a kite.  The object was bobbing and moving like a kite would from my vantage point.  5 seconds later this object moved to my right about 10 degrees behind a palm tree and shortly thereafter re-appeared to the right of the tree.  This convinced me that this was not a kite since the object moved too fast and started to ascend slightly.  The object continued moving in a slightly ascending trajectory to the West (my right)  This movement covered roughly an additional 20 degrees.  Somewhere near this phase of the sighting, the object emmitted a dim red/orange continuous glow, and that&apos;s what I tracked for the remainder of the sighting.  As the object moved across the sky to the right, it suddenly reversed directions and started moving East in a relatively straight line. Now I knew that this was like nothing I had ever seen in my life.  The object then moved in a counter clockwise circular motion, followed by another pass from left to right. Finally the dim light stopped for a few seconds and then went straight up and slightly to my right.  After this point, the light became dimmer and dimmer in the black moonless sky.  I called my wife out to see, but she could not pick up the very faint light at this point, roughly 45 degrees off the horizon.  This episode lasted 30-45 seconds.  The next morning I repositioned myself on the balcony in order to guesstimate how far away this object was.  Clearly, the object. depending on it&apos;s size, was between 1/8 and 1/4 mile away at the early stages of the sighting. (Well below the horizon) This would make the object size about 20-30 feet across.  I am college educated, and I know what airplanes, helecopters, sattelites, and shooting stars all look like in the night sky.  I did not hear anything; my encounter was only visual.  All these signs tell me that this object was definitely out of this world.  Needless so say, I could not fall asleep for several hours.", "Saw a large triangle shaped craft moving slowly along beach.I was standing at the the very edge of the beach at Cardiff State Beach when a dim pattern of lights in the sky caught my attention.  I immediately found this interesting and thought it might be a formation of planes.  Through some low clouds, the craft appeared and it turned out that the light pattern was just 1 side of this triangular object.  The main body of the object was black with rows of lights on each side of the triangle, with 3 bright lights on top at each corner-top and bottom.  The object moved slowly south out of a low cloud, stopped, and rotated about 60 degrees.  When it rotated, it wobbled.  During the entire event, there was no sound (no sound louder than the crashing of the waves on the beach).  I would estimate the object to be approx. 2000ft above the water and 2500 ft off of the beach, and the width of the object itself to be 450 ft or more.

I was stunned by what I saw.  An object traveling from the west to the east was blocking out the stars in the sky as it flew past at an extremely high rate of speed directly over my head.  The object was triangular in shape with the widest part being wing tip to wing tip.  The shear size of the object took my breath away.  It flew low to the ground, less than 600 feet.  From wing tip to wing tip I would estimate it to be 300 yards across.  From nose to tail approximately 100 yards.  It appeared to be rather flat from top to bottom, no more than 20 yards thick.  All of the edges seemed rounded, not sharp or crisp.  This object had no external lights that could be seen from below.  It had a dark, dull metallic sheen similar to the dull side of aluminum foil which reflected city light from below.  It&apos;s stealth and speed was nerve shaking.

I waited for the sonic booms to follow as I new that this aircraft was traveling in excess of Mach 1.  I have seen small Air Force jets at Mach 1 or greater and know the speed and sounds they create at those speeds.  This huge object flew faster than any aircraft I have ever seen and did not make a sound, not even a low rumble.  There was nothing but silence.  I was in awe and disbelief of what I had witnessed.  I stood there for 30 minutes or more hoping to see another flyby and still contemplating what I saw and if I really did see it.  The total length of time of this brief veiwing lasted no more than 5 seconds. I waited for days to read something in the newspapers to verify what I saw by others.  I lived very close to March A.F.! B. and t hought that surely they picked this craft up on radar and would leak something.  I have told only a select few friends of what I witnessed that night, not wanting to be labled as crazy.  They think I&apos;m crazy.  I just happened to be at the right place at the right time, looking up at the sky.  What prompted me to write my account at this late date was an account by someone else that was very similar to mine, who posted with your site.  The occurance date was 4/27/2001, location-Alpine, CA. and Triangle shaped.  My mm/dd/yy may be off slightly as I am not sure of the exact date but I can pinpoint very close due to certain events that took place during that time.  Haley&apos;s comet was to be visible by eye and a certain pilot of a famous politician or celebrity died in an experimental aircraft testing crash in the Nevada desert I believe.   I am an honorably discharged veteran of the Air Force and have seen many of our government aircraft including the stealth bomber and stealth fighter aircraft as well as the SR-71.  This craft is none of those or even close.  I only hope that it is one of ours, if it&apos;s not, we are seriously outmatched!((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "It was a large hazey golden glowing ball with 4 or 5 smaller starlike objects preceeding it traveling at a high speedIt had just turned dark and one of our group said, look at the &apos;Balloons&apos; and as we all turned to look and watch; we soon realized that it wasn&apos;t balloons at all. There were four adults and one 7 yr old child there that evening. All are credible individuals, 2 local city gov&apos;t employees and a mechanic and an office accountant. What had appeared in the Southern sky that looked like a large group of illuminated balloons, was coming North in our direction. When IT was much closer than at first site, we could see a large golden glowing ball about the size of the face of the moon. It was hazy and seemed to have some object in the glowing round haze, but you could not make out what was inside the haze. Just in front of the glowing Ball, was about four, maybe five, tiny star-like objects.  They seemed to be in a formation just in front of the larger object. All stayed exactly in their formation and made over our heads in Northerly direction, never changing or blinking and never with any sound whatsoever. The tiny starlike objects seemed to be taking or leading the larger object away. They traveled at a high speed and moved out of our view over the house. We all agreed that we could not identify the object as OUR aircraft nor could we think of anything it could have been, other than a UFO.", "Strange bright light blinking multiple colors west of Sedona near Secret MountainWe witnessed a light that changed colors from Blue, red, yellow, and white.  We were on a dirt road near the &quot;Bradshaw Ranch&quot; and noticed as we were driving in its direction it slowly decended towards the horizon near Clarksdale.  When we stopped to witness what type of movenment it was making, it hovered for about 10 Min. Then suddenly it zig-zaged west to east and back again.  Thats when I realized for sure that this was a unconventional object.  It soon decended behind the mountain and was gone. It reappeared on the north side of town on our way back to Boynton canyon at much higher altitude and remained there for another half hour until we decided that it was time to goto bed and was seen from our hotel door at the Days Inn in West Sedona. It was the brightest thing in the sky and had to have been witnessed by other people in town.", "UFO flies over Lewiston, Maine 08/22/01At 10:00 p.m. while at my computer, I began to hear the sound of what I thought to be a in the distance, a low flying jet plane. The closer it got, the louder it became. I felt a sense of fear as it seemed to pass over the top of our home. I felt that it might crash as it was so close. I immediately got off my computer and turned off the loghts, to see if I could see anything out the window. It was a very skies and stars were very bright, buti could only hear and not see any plane. I saw a huge bright light cross from one side of the lake to another, and then the noise completely ceased for a few brief moments, only to return again, coming closer back over our home once again. I knew that this could NOT be a jet, as it would not have had enough time to turn around so soon, and this is something that jets do not do as a rule anyway. The noise continued to get louder and closer,and disappeared again just as it had done the first time it passed. This time it did not return again and no more bright lights were tobe seen. My husband at the time was on the phone downstairs, but said he had heard the loud and low flying object, he too thinking it was an extremely low flying jet. The very next day in the Lewiston Sun Journal, was a write up of the hundreds of people who had called the Lewiston police, to report the same exact thing as we had heard. Lewiston police called the FAA, and they said there had been NO jets on radar in our area at this time. BTW......all the people who called in to the police reported that it was 10:00 p.m. This phenomoner was also a big story on all the local television news reports Thur.8/23/01. No one seems to be able to tell what it was, but it was darn sure scary. Almost the same thing happened just over one year ago. It was around July 22, I believe. This time it was in daylight, and in late morning. The skies were very overcast, and I was sitting on my back porch, when I heard a plane approaching over my home.((NUFORC Note:  We understand that many reports of this incident were submitted to the news media in Maine.  PD))", "2 bright red lights blinking very fast one on top and one on botom, the lights went on for about 20-30sec. then instantly lights stoped blinking and the object on top FLOATED up and to the left and stoped, by then insantly another object apeared to the left of the 2 floated over to the others and they formed a perfect and i mean perfect triangle!!!!  (by this time im sitting out of breath) then out of knowhere they all at the same time floated left together at the exact same speed not one of the objects were out of order, they were perfectly the same. then the trees got in the way and 1 i barely saw while the other 2 were knowhere to be seen, they disapeared!!!.   U TELL ME WHAT I SAW. NOT PLAINS", "A green ball of light.I went out onto my balcony for a cigarette and that&apos;s when I saw it. I was leaned up against the banister out on the balcony and started smoking my cigarette.I also had a glass of water in my left hand.  As I&apos;m smoking,I&apos;m looking out into the open straight ahead and all I see is a mall parking lot and my apartment building parking lot.As I went for a sip of water,my head slightly tilted back and my eyes were pointed sort of at the sky.  Right then a green ball of light eminated in front of my eyes. There was a slight cloud coverage and I could recognize a light green haze around it.  So I kept looking on and it started to move to my left and there was no sound and it moved in such a straight line.  It started to accelerate and it disappeared leaving a green trace of light and I have seen lots of planes and this was definately not a regular plane. When it moved to my left it moved horizantly and not on an angle.  I have seen shooting stars and they go by really quickly and they look white and they don&apos;t go by horizantly or slow enough that I could describe what it looked like. This has been my first sighting ever and it was really exciting and chilling.", "Multiple flashing white lights...While watching the Monday night football game on 08/27/01 at 20:30:00 I witnessed one flashing white light out my bedroom window at 280&deg;. I live in an area where privet airplane traffic fly right over the house in route to or taking off from the Danbury airport.  I watched kind of surprised, it was foggy; nevertheless you could see the bright white flashing light fine, I thought it was an airplane. This went on for about eight to ten seconds. Shortly thereafter the sky lit up there were flashing white lights all over the place sporadically and extremely fast then at one point throughout what was happening they were sequential and lighting up all together diagonally. I called my wife upstairs she witnessed the spectacle for about ten seconds. Then like nothing happened they were gone. I don&apos;t know, I know I&apos;m not crazy I&apos;ve never seen anything like this in my life. I took a ride in my car to see if others witnessed what I had, there were plenty of people out however all were just going about their business. My wife calleed the Danbury Airport She actually talked with someone in the control tower, she was told there were no aircraft in that location at that time. There was one aircraft in the sky located at 180&deg;.", "No shape to craft since distance was too great.  From my location in east Vancouver.  Compass direction of aprx. 140 degrees. Elevation was aproximately 70 degrees.  Direction of travel is estimated at 150 degrees moving from north to south. First noticed a faint light appearing to be a satelitte.  The light quickly grew to the size of a penny held at arms length.  The light was similar to the landing lights on a commercial airliner at aproximately 5 miles out and coming straight on.  The light diminished as quickly as it appeared to the point that it resembeled a high orbit satellite and disapeared from sight very quickly.", "a light form ripping around the skySome form of light (bright white light) was quickly manuevering straight, then darted downward and upward, then shot through the sky.  It then came to a stop (for a few seconds) then began manuevering again and disappeared into the clouds. It all lasted about 2 minutes.", "Extremely bright light falling almost straight down in western sky -white tail and appeared to explode orange to red - was VERY bright.  Seemed to fall in southern Wyoming or northern Colorado", "Uniform dots of lights, smooth, quick, unique, straight line vector dissappearing into the sky.I was sitting outside watching the stars and thought I seen 2 bright flashes of light almost directly above me. I guess it would have been about 10-15 degree south, south east of the zenith of the sky. The flashes were about 5 minutes apart.  This would have happened about 21:45 hours.  The moon was slightly obscured by scattered clouds, but there seemed to be a straight line of clouds just above the moon, and than above that open sky.  I just happened to look away and than look back at the moon.  5 or 6 lights, dots, red bluish, whites light in the form of a boomerang, or wing, with what appeared to be 3 or 4 dots/lights on one side (east) and 1, possibly 2 on the right hand side (west side).  What I thought odd was how fast, smooth and how they moved without loosing their altitude or grouping.   The dots did not disappear behind the cloud; rather they disappeared into the sky. My watch read 22:00hrs MST. I am not much of a stargazer, but this did catch my attention.  The dots seemed to come from the north or above me very quickly, but clearly, very clearly.", "green fireball ocross nite skyas heard on 10:00 komo 4 news seattle", "6 lights moving in a steady paceA formation of lights (could be either one object or 6 seperate objects) appeared while we were looking at the little dipper.. it was moving from down the hill (east) up the hill (west) at a steady pace. There was no sound, and no blinking of the lights. They moved quite slowly. The lights were in a semi-circular pattern, so were either one edge of a disc or several objects flying in formation.

But I was wrong.  I quickly turned her attention to a rapidly descending white object apparently coming down out of the sky.  Since falling stars tend to disappear rapidly, I was very surprised that as the object fell, it did not disappear.  In fact, it slowed down! then appeared to stall, not moving at all.  I could not tell you how large it was, or how close it was, but I DID think it was a shooting star (at first), if that gives you some idea of apparent size and brightness.While the object appeared to not move, i referenced other planes&apos; movements to compare. Well, there was no similarity. And it made no sound.So, now this was strange, but here is another strange phenomenon...One moment, it appeared to be in front of us, glowing bright white, and within a couple of seconds, it WAS ON THE HORIZON, now red in color.  This movement was like something out of MC Escher, where perception changes in an instant.We just agreed we saw a UFO and left it as that!", "I contacted some other site about six months ago about this but heard nothing.I was at a Prep School, Junior year, in Dublin, NH. I was on our &quot;Upper Field&quot; with five friends when the event took place. I was not the first to notice the object. At this time I don&apos;t recall who actually saw it first; however, what I saw was basically triangular or &quot;an arrow&quot; in shape. It was heading in a Northerly direction. It had a series of lights on both sides (window shaped?)in two rows, over and under. They were somewhat rectangular.When it passed over (not directly over) I noticed the back had what appeared to be a series of lights moving towards the center from the outer ends. This was continuous. The underside (if memory serves) had I believe three lights. equally spaced.I also recall that it made no audible sound. At least non that we or I could hear. At first we thought it was some kind of a plane; however, once it got closer it became obvious that it was no plane that any of us had ever seen. We were also no where near an Air Force Base. The closest was Pease which was about a two hour drive east.I hope that this is of interest. I never gave it mush thought after that until recently.

I got my binnoculars to get a better look, and it looked as if it were something coming through and burning in the atmosphere.  I could vaguely make out a small dark spot at the front core, but the rest of it looked like a huge fireball with &quot;tails&quot; or &quot;trails&quot; coming from either side.  I watched it continue to travel to the east until it went behind the clouds.  I am not saying it was a flying saucer, because it didn&apos;t look like one... no metal object, just a huge fireball.I am just curious as to what it was, if anyone has information.", "Long white rectangular object seen over Ventura, CA.My wife was driving and we were headed north on Highway 101 along the ocean. Just as we were entering Ventura, I looked up in a kind of north westerly direction and saw a long white rectangular object heading slowly east.  I thought that it might have been an airplane but the length and width of it were not consistent with either a jet or a small winged plane.  That&apos;s why I kept watching it. As it was moving east, it kind of dipped on the right side and disappeared. I looked all over the sky where it had been but could not find it.  I tried to rationalize that it might have gone in to some haze along the ocean, but as we continued north, there was some haze but not enough to cover the size of the object. When I say &quot;long white narrow object&quot; I mean that the width of it side to side was about 5 to 6 times it&apos;s height.

Some time in the early afternoon probably about 1:00 PM I heard what I thought was jet noise and looked up. There was a long narrow object silver in color with what appeared to be windows.  However there appeared to be no wings or tail.  I would describe this as a long cigar shape. It seemed longer than most jet liner fuselages. I proceeded to rationalize this away thinking that I could just not see the wings. I thought that the lighting made them blend against the sky.  For that reason I did not tell my friend about it.  I looked at it for only a few minutes. I since have thought about it and realized that I would have seen any wings.  The sun was high in the sky and I would have seen the shaded bottom of the wings not to mention the engines. Also there are two major airports near the area. So jet noise is common.
