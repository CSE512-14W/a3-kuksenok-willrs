["Strange light above San Francisco BayMy girlfriend and I noticed a bright light outside her bedroom window at approximately 11:00pm on September 4. The light, about the size of Venus, appeared in the eastern sky, about 25 degrees over the horizon.  It flashed white, red, yellow and green.  As we watched, the light began bobbing up and down in variants of about 3 degrees from &quot;center&quot; position, then rapidly shifting to a similar left-right motion.  It continued doing this for at least 30 minutes.  Several planes flew near the light in a north-south direction, likely headed to SF Airport while it was in the sky - this light was far different from the plane lights.  We watched until falling asleep.", "Bright Lights in the Southern Sky over Phoenix.Just before 10:00 pm, I could see two large redish/orange lights about 45deg. in the sky. I am located in North Scottsdale and was looking south towards South Mountain.  From my vantage point, I could not tell exactly how far they were from my location, but I would guess closer to South Pheonix.  The two lights did not move at all. They stayed in a stationary position, until one seemed to disappear.  A few seconds later, the second one disapeared.  About a minute later, I could almost see one again, but it never was as bright as the first time. I have served in the military, and I know what flares look like...  I can also say that this isn&apos;t the first time that I have seen these lights in the same general direction.  What is going on here? Why isn&apos;t there more exposure to this?  Or have I missed something altogether?", "On 5 Sep 2001, at approx. 2049,A bright white light, that swelled and disappeared, was seen from Parkersburg, WV in the north sky.At approx. 2049, myself, mother, father, and family friend(who was out of line of sight)was setting outside. I noticed in the north sky a light that starting getting brighter and brighter, as if it was coming closer. The light was a brilliant white. I have never seen any color of light like this. I said an exploitive and my parents turned. My father saw over half of the incident. My mother witnessed it and stated it was an air plane. As she was making that statement, the light began to dim and get smaller at a slow but steady pace. It continued this unitl it loked like it went away from us, seeing the light dim to nothing.", "A dark gray object traveling across the night sky.On 10/25/01 I was up late (1:30 AM). I decided to go out side before going to bed.    I was looking up at the sky, as usual, and I saw what I believe was a UFO. It didn&apos;t have any lights on it (that I could see) but I was still able to see it (very clearly) traveling across the sky, low to the horizon. It was kind of a dark gray in color. It was traveling from east to west. It was oval in shape, and appeared to be traveling at about the same speed a plane would, flying at a low altitude. Yet it appeared to be high in the sky. To get an idea of how big it was from my point of view, go out side, stretch your arm out and hold a &quot;quarter&quot; up to the sky, flat side facing you. That&apos;s approximately how big the UFO was against the night sky.", "As we observed the red sphere, it occured to us, that it appeared as if it were looking for something.I was outside enjoying the evening and I noticed what at first I thought was a plane, watching it I realized that it stopped and changed directions.I ran inside and called my sister who lived down the road to come out as well.  When I returned outside the light (sort of a glowing round redish orange in color) was  on the ridge across from my house. This ridge is app. 1/2 mile from us and follows at a straight line with a full view of 5 miles in length ( we live in a rural area with no other lights around).The sphere followed the ridge silently in the tree tops, sometimes in front of the trees, sometimes a little above, and sometimes it was behind them.The trees here are oaks, bl. walnut, standing 50-60 ft. tall on the adverage.  As the sphere traveled it would stop, back up, and procede forward again.We had our father come outside as well, he was somewhat of a sceptic on such matters, he watched with us and stated, &quot;well I know what it&apos;s not, it&apos;s not an airplane, or a helicoptor&quot; so he did decide it was unidentified.  We watched it for app. 20 min.About 1 &amp; 1/2 hours later I went outside again, and it had returned, following the same path as it had previously taken, doing the exact same thing, following the same ridge, very slowly, this time taking about 35 min.  We called a neighbor, about 1 mile away in that direction, and he had seen it the first time, but it was low for him and he thought it was a cars single brake light. He watched it as well the second time, only it was higher this time.He told his wife, who had been traveling that night home from the same general direction of the light, and she stated that while traveling home she had observed several times, a light coming down from the sky onto the hills beside her, no sound, very fast, like a white search light going on and off. She could not see where it was coming from but saw it 4 times very fast.", "Young boy spots UFO in North Carolina.The craft was Huge and cigar shaped and covered in multi colored lights.

I thought, wow look at the north star tonight, but then I noticed that it was brighter than normal and looked more like a spotlight shining towards my direction than a star.There was absolutely no sound. But it was about the same size in diameter as the stars all around it  which made me think this object is extremely far away and not a star, and not an airplane either. I could see no motion, no blinking, and no flickering whatsever. Then all of the sudden the light went dim, it was about exactly the same brightness of the stars around it then. And to my astonishment, it started moving Northeast in the sky away from me and faded away after about 3 to 5 seconds. The sky was absolutely clear, stars all around it clearly visible, but this object completely disappeared in just seconds. It was obvious that this object was headed towards the ground, then made a sudden turn and went the other direction. It did not cast a beam of light in the new direction it was headed which also makes me believe it was way up there above the atmospheric dust and moisture. I have never reported anything like this before, nor have I ever seen anything that I couldn&apos;t explain either. But I am absolutely sure this was no plane, no meteor, or anything that I have ever seen before.  I feel extremely fortunate to have seen this and doubt I&apos;ll ever see another one, but I would love to hear from anyone who might have seen this thing as well.

This was a familiar sound as I have heard a Sonic-Boom many times before; the characteristic Boom, followed roughly 1 sec. later with another Boom.  I went to my mothers bedroom to see if she dropped something on the floor.  She said no but had heard the noise.  While we were talking, there was another Boom, though with roughly twice the energy and only a single Boom!  That one really rattled the windows!! I turned on the Scanner to see if any thing was reported to the local authorities-nothing.  I got on the Web and checked several sites that have instant reports of quakes and the such-nothing.  While on the Web, there was another Sonic-Boom (characteristic again) at 13:35 hours, local time.  Again, the windows really rattled!

The Notice stated this was a planned event and was in effect until 14:00 hours local time.

They went out of the car to have a better view, but jumped back inside as it looked like the object was going to crash in the midtown. They experienced the situation as threatening.There was no sound. What originally looked like a helicopter was completely silent. After looking like it would crash it changed direction and flew out the Vefsn fjord and disappeared. As the witnesses thought it had crashed in the fjord they went to the police to report an accident. They could see the object as long as a couple of minutes.When the police got the report they immediately sent policemen out to find the area of &rdquo;the crash&rdquo;, and prepared to send out ambulances and medical personnel. &ldquo;Hovedredningssentralen i Bod&oslash;&rdquo; which is the offical headquarter for accidents at sea were, were alarmed and preparing for action.

The direction of the flight was from West to East directions in the Connecticut/Massachusets state border. The object had distinctively observable 4 ligth beams (similar to high beams in the cars) alligned in rectangular format and a flashing white ligth in the center. But, it could be in a diamond format from my point of view.  The sound of the craft was very unusual for a plane or a helicopter. It almost sound it like a metal to metal rubbing with a very high pitch grinding/roaring sound. The time I observed was at 5:16 am with a clear night view in the background.  The 4 beams on the corners and the center flashing light were pointing downwards, making the area below the craft relatively brite.  The speed of the craft was steady, with a speed comparable to a slow flying helicopter.  The altidude of the craft may have been in the range of approx. 1/2 km to 1 km.

The area is farmland for the most part, therefore very dark beside the highway with city lights visable in the distance to the east. Two large blinking lights appeared in the blackness between the road and the city lights. The lights were blindingly brilliant with a bluish cast. We first thought they might be crop-dusting planes, as crop-dusters were still prominent in the news following the Sept. 11 attack. We then decided that they must be something else, given their brilliance and the speed at which the first light suddenly moved toward the south. The second light moved northward, turned toward us but hovered near the roadside as we passed.Shortly, a 3rd light appeared ahead and to the left the highway (same color and brilliance). It then seemed to &quot;jump&quot; to the right side, instantly. The third light rose to a higher altitude, separated into FOUR distinctly separate lights of equal brilliance and proceeded to move toward the south. Unlike the first light which also moved at what we took for &quot;impossible&quot; velocity, the third seemed to pulsate twice: i.e., it &quot;disappeared&quot; only to re-appear INSTANTANEOUSLY further south against the stars, in both cases radically changing shape. It swelled to enormous size prior to vanishing, then re-appeared in smaller mode. After doing so twice, it sped upward and southward at such tremendous speed I could not track its motion with my eye. (I was in the passenger seat, so was free to safely turn my head as it sped away). A combination of features convinced us we had seen no crop-duster, military plane or other easily explained phenomenon: that the light divided into four distinctly separate luminaries, melded into one again and &quot;jumped&quot; as it moved... then, that it altered size and shape still pulsating through the sky and finally, that it left with unnatural and amazing speed.

Attempting to follow or count very faint strobes in binoculars is not easy, but it appeared that as many as five different strobe sources were present as well. The brightness difference between the stobes and the orange flares was extreme enough that I couldn&apos;t tell if it was the strobing crafts that became brilliant or if the source was just very close by.  I enjoy stargazing as a hobby and am familiar with varied phenomenon of the night sky. The appearance of the bright orange lights was in color like that of Mars, which was close by this evening for comparison, but with the brightness of Venus, about 1 to -1 magnitude in range.  The area would be towards the south side of the Army base Fort Leonard Wood, or could have been even further southwest. There was no practical way to triangulate for a proper distance.", "We saw objects in the sky that could not have been stars. We observed them through bionoculars and saw 9 objects that hovered, pulsated with light ranging from green to red light. These were not commercial craft...because all planes were grounded on this day 9/11/2001. They seemed not to move, perhaps only slightly...appearing to get smaller or larger in size, only slightly. The light changed in a free flow manner from one color to another. They all appeared to be the same size, with the exception of one, which was larger, bright yellow light. There was some &apos;hazing&apos; around some of these objects. One object was much larger in the southern sky...it was light colored. The others with the colored lights hovered in the westerly and northern sky areas. These sightenings occured after the tradgey in NYC...that same night. They hovered over 9/12/01 as well...the next evening in approx the same positions by 5 different people.((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous, save for an e-mail contact.

Suddenly a small cloud appeared directly to my north.  I thought where did that come from since it was a cloudless night.  Then I noticed it was moving and realized it couldn&apos;t be a cloud.  As I followed the movement it became black against the dark sky moving south directly toward me.  There were no lights visible on the aircraft.  It was moving in a direct flight path.  As it passed overhead at an altitude of not more than 1,000 feet, I leaned over the wall of my patio to see the reflection of the lights in our parking lot hit the bottom of the aircraft.  It refkected a dark gray metal and v-shaped.  I cannot positively say it was triangular.  There was absolutely no sound as it passed overhead nor afterward.  My thoughts were &quot;What the hell was that thing?&quot; As I sat contemplating what I had so quickly witnessed, I thougt at first it might be a glider plane. In the wake of recent events, I thought maybe the terrorists are going to use gliders next.  But even gliders make a noise as they swish by!  Then I thought of how the object must have appeared as a cloud at first.  Our town has no street lights.  It is relatively dark.  One half mile away there is a small plaza with a lit parking area amd a senior apartment complex with a lit parking area.  This craft must have reflected those lights as it passed over. When it passed over the empty lot across the street was when it beame black on black.  I did not report this to anyone as I was waiting to here of another siting by someone. But this has been preying on my mind all week.  I don&apos;t think a military craft would be permitted to fly so low with no lights over a populated area.  I don&apos;t even know if we have silent aircraft.  That is what I question most of all was the silence and no lighting.", "lights, high flying objects and an oval orange objectGenerally looking at the sky when we saw a bright flash lasting only a second,a pinprick of light of high intensity, followed some 10 secs. later by another from approx. same place.

Nothing further to report, except that we have witnessed unusual phenomena at this location before (see report from March 00.)", "Triangular shaped with &quot;mother of pearl&quot; swirling light...six green square lights all on bottomI was driving to an event for my brother.  I was late, as usual, so I was driving fast to get there.  I was whipping around the back roads of Malvern, PA. The road in particular is called Providence Rd.  People in the area know it as a short cut, but it is very hilly and out of the way.  I remember it was Sunday night, about 9:00 PM.  Noone on the road and as I came over this one hill I noticed three white lights in the distance (20 miles).  I was a clear night, and not that dark.  The sun had gone down not that long ago.  I thought this is cool, must be some sort of military jets or something because it looked like they were in formation.  But the more I looked they weren&apos;t that close together.Separated from each other by more than 10 miles or so, but they looked similar...three bright white lights.  I was heading north on Providence so two of the objects were heading east, the ones farther away from me, and then I realized one of them was heading in my direction, heading south southeast!  Once again, I was excited because I just thought this thing was like a F-15 or something.  It kept getting closer and closer.  So I slowed down because noone was around and it looked like it was going to pass right over me so then once I realized that I came to a complete stop.  I opened my moonroof to get a good look, thinking I would see afterburners etc.Instead, I was shocked.  First there was no noise...nothing. The car was stopped and this was a desolate road. The only thing I heard were crickets.  The white light was on its front, but then it started to pass over.  I would say it was about 300-500 ft. up, actually very low for a flying object.  The speed was also slow, almost like it was giving me a show or something.  I could make out that it was a triangular shaped object.  Not a perfect triangle though.  It had a point in the front(where the white light was) then two straight lines/edges down the back and then two triangular shaped wings.  It really did look like a plane kind of, but trust me it was no plane because what I saw on the underbelly of this thing was like nothing I have ever seen, unless our military is way more advanced then I give them credit for.  Near the front of the craft on the bottom there was something I cannot even put into words.  It was a ball shaped object which almost looked suspended from the craft, and the thing that always sticks out and why I feel it was extraterrestrial was the color of this object.  The simple fact was, there was no one color.  It constantly changed color, and not like blue one second and then red. Not like that at all.  The only way I can describe it, it was like &quot;mother of pearl&quot;.  The white would form with other colors...mixing..blues greens reds and yellows.....then swirl to another color, but the white was always the background.  It just kept changing as it passed over.  Then behind it were 6 green square lights three on a side in a row.  To the right and left of the last green lights was where the wings were.  I was so in shock and so stunned, I just stared as it passed.  I mean I am an intelligent guy, I believe that there could be life out there.  I guess I never thought I would see it.  Of course I didnt have a camera or anything.  After it passed I just sat there for about five minutes in shock.  Not thinking I should follow.  Then it dawned on me that I should and talk to someone about it! or reco rd it.  I started the car and kept going north looking for a place to turn around, and I saw the two other white lights again...still heading east.  I started to chase them but I realized they were too far and I couldnt gain ground on them...moving to fast. I am not sure if those were jets following it or other UFO&apos;s, but the thing that passed over me was definitely a UFO.  By the time I turned around to find that one, it was gone too.", "at least 300 foot dia.  50 foot  in height .

My specialty, Aircraft crewchief. My security clearance was secret. The exact date was approximately June 15,1975. The reason I say this is because the movie &quot;Jaws&quot; had just came out at Drive-ins and Theatres. I was double-dating with a friend of mine and we decided to go to the drive-in to see &quot;Jaws&quot;. The Drive-in had Four Screens which were positioned North &amp; South, East &amp; West. My friends and I were waiting for the movie to start, we were facing the East Screen. The Sun was beginning to set below the Horizon which at that time the movie that was playing on the West Screen started. I had turned around in the car and was watching it when I noticed a bright object approximately 30 to 40 degrees above the horizon, West by Southwest. I thought to myself that it was a bright star. I watched it thinking to myself that this was kind of odd because it was still light. I watched it and it began to move at a high speed from West to East. I thought I was possibly watching a SR-71 aircraft from Beale A.F.B. stationed at Marysville, CA. and it was in full afterburner and this was why it was moving so fast. At the time I knew the SR-71 was a Mach 3 Or Mach 5 acft. I told my friend ((name deleted)) to check this out. As we were watching it, it stopped suddenly and turned 90 degrees North toward us. It came straight toward us and hoverd 300 feet above and than dropped behind the Eest screen. People got out of their vehicles and watched in amazement.

We were scared but more in awe than anything,we will never forget the size of that thing.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

After searching and on my way to bed, I looked out my front door window which looks down the street.  I immediately noticed an exceptionally bright light 2000-3000 feet high and approximately 5 miles away.  I thought this was an aircraft, which have holding patterns over this part of Connecticut.  I continued looking because the light was so bright I wondered what type of aircraft it could be. The light was at least 20 times brighter than an aircraft&apos;s landing light. The object then starting moving up and down, mimicing an oscilliscope wave.  My binoculars were 10 feet away and I ran to get them.  Upon returning to the window and before I could get the binoculars out of the case the object moved straight up (maybe 5 degrees off of vertical) at a speed that was so incredibly fast I knew it was no aircraft.  It also left, only for a few milliseconds, a white phosphorous trail that had to be at least 10,000 feet long.  It then disappeared into the CLEAR night.", "ufos watching over america??I was in Louisville visiting my sister we were out on the front porch having a cigarette.

My boyfriend and I went to the state forestry down the street. We took a telescope and binoculars. There we witnessed a least seven of these objects dance around and flash lights like they were talking to each other. They seemed to stay in star formations. Anytime a plane would go over they would move towards it as if watching the plane. We saw several military planes go over us. One made no noise at all. These things had flashing lights all around them almost as if they were planes. They would get bright and then dim and occasionaly move together at same speeds and movements. They made sharp turns and triangle patterns they were definately trying to stay in formation at all times. We watched two appear out of nowhere.

They appeared to be in a fixed position, perhaps a bit lower than the stars. Their movement was slow, just like the stars, indicating the objects&apos; perceived movement was actually due to the Earth&apos;s rotation. The base of the Y-shape was the brightest, looking somewhat like a cluster of three adjacent stars. The angles at the top of the Y were like lighted lines, not as bright as the base. On some nights we have seen a short line extending downward from the middle of the base of the Y. We have since seen these objects moving from west to east between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. every night when the skies have been clear. They are probably visible much later into the night, but we haven&apos;t stayed up later. Our suspicion is that these are U.S. spy satellites grouped in position for sightings of overseas locations as part of the War on Terrorism, but attempts to confirm this have failed. We have been told the spy satellites are too high in the sky and to small to be visible without powerful telescopes, but we have also read that newer, and perhaps bigger, spy satellites have been in development for some time.

They caught my eye because there were no planes flying at that time due to the terrorist attacks.  I went outside to get a better look.  They were far brighter than any of the surrounding stars.  They were aligned at the same latitude, about 40 degrees up.  The one on the right was blinking, the one on the left was not.They were stationary for the most part, however the one on the right seemed to &quot;jiggle&quot;.

I tried several times to zoom in on the one on the right which was more active, but the digital zoom had difficulty focusing on it.  However, the video does show some interesting things.  First, when I zoomed in on the object on the right it is blurry but you can clearly see the changing colors - white, red, green, gold changing very rapidly.  Second, there is a point when the object on the right can clearly be seen moving quickly from left to right, then stopping and remaining stationary.   Several people have watched the video and agree that it does not look or behave like stars, planets, orbiting satellites, or aircraft.

On the horseshoe of Nike Ave. I saw against the mountains ( north of the  artillary range area) what looked like fire.  The year before we had fires in the same area and this caught my eye.  But this orange ball of fire moved  from upper part of the mountains downward onto the White Sands Missle Range where I work.  This ball then moved horizontally northward and then eastward in my direction.  I was driving westward towards the object.   The horeshoe is just a curve in the road on Nike Ave.  and after the curve it is a straight road for about 9-10 miles.  As I drove towards the objest ( about 5 miles ) it also came towards me. It traveled about total 8-10  miles (not sure this distance) from mountain top to middle of the missle range where I stopped my car midway down Nike Ave.The object in its travel changed color from fire orange and circular to a luminous white.  It was about  a block away in the desert.  It looked like a huge lightbulb desending from a height of about  30 feet  to where I thought it might touch down on the ground but it did not.  It kicked up a little desert dust for only a second then huvered in one spot about 10 feet off the ground.  It did not wobble or drift in any direction from the first time I obsevved it to the time I later lost site of it.  It traveled like it was programmed to follow a digital course or never made any course corrections as it moved.  I figure it took about less than 5 minutes to travel from the mountain top to the middle of the road or the 8 mile trip.When I stopped my car on the road I stopped delibertly  to have my headlights facing the thing.  It did not land but stopped and did not move in any direction.  It just stayed put and it did not rotate or pitch.  It looked like a lightbulb about 6 feet across and about 10 feet tall.  glass end up.it had a dark socket underneith....just like a litebulb.   I thought it might be a hot air balloon but it was incondesently bright.  If people were in it they would have to be in the glass section the bottom socket section was too small.  There was no ropes between sections.  The two sections were connected directlly together.  I then saw the thing turn its light off and I told myself don&apos;t blink and watch to see if this thing would turn on again.  I was thinking if it was a hot airballoon I would see the delay of small fire ignition to maximum turn on of full throttle propane burn.Well, I did not blink and I thought I could see beyond the thing (like it became transparent for a second)  then it turn to full brillancy instantly (like you turn on a lightbulb).  There was no flutter of flame as a hot airballoon does and the thing never changed altitude.  I thought  that if anyone was in the thing they would have had there night vision obsured for the high intensity of the light that came from within.  I couldn&apos;t see anything inside if it even had a inside.  All I saw was a giant lightbulb flying in the air.  Next I decided to flash my headlights on and off to see if anything would happened.  At that point the thing started back the same way it had came back the exact course traveled before up to the mountain top.  As it was heading back I followed down the road in its direction but it was faster than my car.  Then it went over the mountain top and I lost site of it for a few moments.  About 10 minutes later it came over another mountain top and it looked like two car lights coming over the mountain top (above the mountain).  Each light came north together then flew away from each other (one east and the other west like synchonized swimming and then flew back to the mountain to be lost from site.  I also absorved a flashing red lite that looked like the light on a helicopter above the mountain right where the two lights flew.   Also this object didn&apos;t make any sound as it travel or stopped in the air.  When the object first came down along the mountain it lit up the mountain with its orange glow.  If this was balloonist they were flying in an are forbidden to fly (White Sands Missle Range artillary range) and they would be flying over very trecherous and dangerous mountain at night.  When the object flew back over the mountain it remained luminous white.   I don&apos;t know if it turned into two headlight at the end of the trip but these two lights were alot smaller in size and the flashing red light would be a third light .  All three lites were three seperate units.  The red lite stayed motionless over the mountain top while the white lites were moving in two different directions to each other.  All three came to the same are on the far side of the mountain and that is where I could not see them anymore.It was the one day in my life I wish I has had a camera.

When it reappeared again, it blinked in a totally different spot only lower than the original spot.  It blinked again, and again it disappeared.  When it reappeared again, it had moved to a different place in the sky. It blinked again, and it disappeared again.  When it reappeared again, it was in a totally different area, but almost seemed like it had appeared and reappered in a triagular fashion.

It was the size of a small plane or helicopter.  The object went up above the mountain and hovered in place.  I had two co workers look to see if they could see it.  We decided it was a balloon.  The only problem was it was not moving.  Then it veered off the the right and then went back to it&apos;s original position.  I continued to watch.  The object disappeared then reappeared in the same spot.  Eventually it decended on the back side of the mountain and we couldn&apos;t see it any more.  This is the second time we have seen a similar type object.  A few months ago a white object came down a canyon then cased the mountain in a v pattern.  It went up the next canyon then back down.

It began to move west as I approached the intersection of Routes 7 and 164. It was at this point that I got a good look at it. In the middle of the thing was a sunset-orange, horizontally oriented rectangular light. It shone relatively brightly and had a solar quality, like the sun in its setting position. Set directly above and below the orange light were 2 smaller horizontal rectangles, powder blue in color and dimmer in comparison to the middle of the object. On the top and bottom object were singular, whitish lights blinking on and off about twice a second.After watching it closely for around a minute, it began to head directly towards the west, kind of quickly in my opinion, and hung frozen on the distant horizon. Eventaully, I lost sight of it because of the terrain of the highway.This was the first night planes were allowed back in the sky since the attacks on 9/11, so I was shocked to see such a unconventional thing in the sky sharing airspace with several other visible, normal looking aircraft. I thought perhaps it was a blimp, but have seen them at night before, and this object looked quite dissimilar. Plus it moved way too fast for such a thing. I then thought it was military, but if it was, taxpayers should be mad because this thing looked functionless and of the dumbest design compared to any other military craft I have ever seen. I doubt it was a helicopter since I could see no solid outline anywhere and the object was void of any kind of noise that I could here.I am an experienced television director so I am used to making quick, detailed observations.

I quicky paid my bill and exited the building hoping to find some Anbesol in my glove box to help with the tooth ache. I got about half way to my car when I noticed that the tooth ache was subsiding. At the same time I noticed that a faint humming sound in my ear. I don&apos;t know what made me do this, but I looked up at the sky, to the northwest I believe, and noticed a tight formation of 5 aircraft. At first I dismissed them as military planes doing training maneuvers. But as I continued to watch them, they did some pretty remarkable things. The three that were closest to me (5 miles?) suddenly descended from about 25000 feet to about 500 feet.  The other 2 craft, in the rear, simply disappeared. A bright beam began to shine down from one of them. That is when I blacked out. I came to about 30 minutes later in a farm field 10 miles away. I felt refreshed.

The object was a single color (as like just plain metal, no lights, etc.). The third night we were again observing it when several small flashes appeared underneath it. About 5 minutes later, a silver ball shaped object dropped straight down through the broken clouds, executed a right angle turn and moved off to the east. The second ball moved to the north-east, the third and fourth to the south.It is interesting to note that I was able to train the binoculars on one of the balls. It looked like a ball bearing or a pinball machine ball, chrome-like, no lights, window or other variations on the surface. I observed it going through clouds, leaving a trail of water vapor. The ground was covered with snow and the night was clear, so observation was about as perfect as it could be. My guess is around mach 1 with no sound or sonic boom.My neighbor said he would contact the Air Force. He was in his 40s, I in my late teens, so that seemed logical. I didn&apos;t see him for a few days. When I did, I inquired about whether or not he called anyone. He stated firmly that he never saw anything and neither did I. The interesting thing to note is that my neighbor was a &quot;&apos;60s liberal&quot;, i.e. antiestablishment, VW bus, peace protester, demand answers from the government kind of guy.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The direction of Crown Point is curving roughly South West (SW), and when stopped at Blair High Road intersection, you are facing just about SW. In the distance I saw a black shape moving through the air almost directly eastward. With many years of Air Force experience and familiarity with the air traffic patterns of the area, my immediate presumption was this had to be either a dark colored B1 or possibly B2 bomber heading in for a landing at Offutt AFB. Then, to my utter surprise, the object &apos;banked&apos; giving me an edge on view...and what I now saw was a very long, narrow angled black triangle. Having seen number of 747s at that distance, I would estimate it at about that length. It was clearly not the shape of a B2, which I have seen in daylight and night flight configurations. It was not a B1, first, because the only time it&apos;s wings are back in a &apos;delta&apos; type configuration is when it is flying at high speed (which this craft was not), and second, because the shape was way to narrow and triangular. I determined to stop and keep watching this craft, but I first looked down to my Van&apos;s clock to see the exact time...and when I looked up, the craft was gone.", "White ball shape, with grey bottom and single row of multicolor lights,decended from cloud, traveled East to West overhead.White ball shaped object descended from a dark cloud following a wind gust.

We saw one line of multi colored lights on the bottom of the object. No noise was heard. It was observed by my brother that in the grey area there were four evenley spaced holes that we assume could hold the landing gear. And there was also one square shape in the center of the bottom.

It was silver and round and looked about the size of a BB held at arms length.  I said &quot;what IS that?&quot;.  She said &quot;it&apos;s not a bird&quot; and I said &quot;it&apos;s not a plane&quot; at the same time and just at that moment it disappeared, like it had some type of cloaking device. There were no other clouds in that part of the sky and it just disappeared from view as we watched it. I suspect that it was hidden behind the lone circular cloud because at no time did I see it enter my line of sight from north to south.  As soon as I called her attention to the cloud, it was just there in front of it. The strange thing is that I got the feeling it KNEW we had spotted it and were discussing it. It covered about 1/3 of the sky from horizon to horizon in about 10 seconds.  It was traveling faster than a jet.

As it came parallel to our position I did a angle check by hand (a trick I learned in astronomy class) I found that it was about 30 degrees above the horizon over due south. I could not judge its distance as I realized that I was not dealing with just any standard aircraft, and these things could really be any size. I could not detect any sound coming from the craft.

The light was moving forward (west) and slowly down, with the jet and behind it.  It appeared as though the light (object?) was dropped from the plane, and shortly thereafter the plane gently veered slightly to the north.   My first impression was that it was a star or planet.  My secon impression was that it was a military test of some kind.  2 more lights were observed a few minutes later, more toward the north, but in the same apparent altitude.  We also thought that they might have been smaller, lower flying business type jets.  Because these objects were definately moving, they couldn&apos;t have been stars or planets.  The 2nd or 3rd light spotted, at one point, moved very rapidly straight up.  The airplane contrail was at least several miles long, but none of the 3 lights gave off any sort of contrail of any kind.

It&apos;s a Fire Ball!!! No...it&apos;s moving too slow, it would of hit by now. The light that it&apos;s emitting is equal to that of a street lamp. Why is it floating above the lowest clouds and under the highest ones? To this I would point and yell to my friend of the unexplainable sight.  We were both frantic. But not as frantic as when the second light appeared from out of the clouds.  I pulled over immediately for us to get a better observation.  It was at this point that we could both see more than just light.  It was an actual physical object.  Very Dark Gray, slightly darker than the clouds.  Once the third light  finally exposed itself we were able to fully identify the shape of the floating object.  It was a perfect triangle.  The lights were located at the ends of each angle, but the angles were not pointed. The were rounded off. My friend and I were sobbing, crying in sheer terror, but we were more overwhelmed with happiness for we knew we were taking part in witnessing the unbelievable. Once we were both able to make full visual contact of the object we became very serious in order to obtain more visual information.  I will now become more descriptively technical so that there is no misunderstanding as to where I was positioned according to the &quot;object&apos;s&quot; location and my own. Going North on 287 we pulled over to witness the clouds come in from the North West and move South East.  The object also moved in this direction.  It moved in a straight linear axis from left to right where we were standing.  But while it was on this axis it rotated 360 degrees clockwise, patiently, without a sound.  All of a sudden the object in its immense proportions snaps into a perfect 90 degree turn and would begin to rotate instantly into a Counter Clockwise rotation North East from us.  In essence, the object&apos;s movements were perfectly geometric.  And so it was with this turn that it would make it&apos;s decent into the thickness of the low cloud cover. We could not tell of the object&apos;s full dimensions, for we witnessed it from below.  If it was the bottom of the craft that we may have been looking at then we do know for a fact that it appeared flat.  Nothing protruded from it in any way.((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident may be approximate, but was in April 1997.  We spoke with this witness and found him to be quite credible.  PD))", "Multiple UFO sightings in Pueblo 09/22/01Four of us were sitting on lawn chairs out on our deck at approx 9:00 p.m MST, Sept. 22nd 2001 in Pueblo, Colorado. There was a nice light breeze and thin clouds with spaces between them were continuously rolling over the mountain range out to the east. The moon was approx 1/4 and out to the south west about 30-40 degrees, with clouds obscuring it sometimes. Observer 1 noticed an object directly upward which at first glance could be mistaken for a bright star, only he said it was moving. He pointed it out to us, and myself(observer 2) and observer 3 also could see it moving, almost fluttering around much like a bee, kind of bouncing ever so slightly. We kept watching it and started noticing there were many more overhead that were moving around too. They all appeared as stars at first, some more intense in light than the others. The light was constant, not blinking, but fading in and out. Observer 3 said he saw a blue light coming from one of them, changing back and forth from blue to white occasionaly. I personally noticed about 3 or 4 of these things moving, dancing on the edges of the clouds, almost trying to hide themselves with the moving clouds. They never went too far from their apparent location in the sky, but appeared to all of us that they were rapidly changing up and down in altitude at times, the light would sometimes be diffused by the clouds. We called my mom out, observer 4 to take a look. She said she could see them moving around too. Remember, this is just my account of this eyewitness, and I may have forgotten a few things, as I am writing this 24 hours after the sighting. Nevertheless, it is still very freshly ingrained in my mind. I am going to encourage the others to post their accounts of this on this website too. Just after observer 4 saw these objects, observer 3 decided to go home. Us 3 kept watching the skies, and woke my dad up to come see at approx 9:30. He looked for a just a few minutes and didn&apos;t seem to interested or convinced and went back inside and went to ! bed. Us 3 kept watching, myself and observer 3 lied down on the benches on the deck so we could see straight up. There seemed to be more and more of them appearing out of nowhere, fluttering around the clouds, which were diminishing and the skies gradually getting clearer. When all of a sudden, 2 seconds of sheer terror and astonishment at the same time. A triangular shaped, HUGE OBJECT, darts across the sky, seeming to be relatively low in elevation, and MASSIVE in size. It was almost like a shadow, an ominous bird taking up a good portion of our view. It could have been a very tight formation of several craft, or just one HUGE one. I thought I saw maybe nine arrow like faint lights or reflections of city lights below all pointing forward, almost like a formation jets fly in. We yelled out because this thing was flat out the fastest thing I have ever seen in my life. It covered the portion of the sky visible to us in those one to at most two seconds we saw it. Not only that but perhaps the biggest thing too. It was probably only in view for only 1-2 seconds. All of us saw it, and realized we had shrieked out in amazement, saying what the hell was that!!!!!!!!!! I can&apos;t begin to tell you what kind of feeling came across me, and us. Goosebumps and heart racing. It was so stealthy, appearing kind of neutral in color, not dark and not light, almost transparent, but blocking the background above it. It was going due South, DIRECTLY over us. Observer 3 said it reminded her of a huge Thunderbird. It appeared to be about only a couple thousand feet up, and about as big as my hand when held as far away as possible. As we gathered ourselves and asked eachother about it, while still looking up, another one flew over, maybe 5 or 10 minutes after the first one. We all briefly screamed again, because we were excited about seeing the first one, and something that moves that fast is supposed to scare you!! We are ALL CERTAIN we saw the same thing. This one didn&apos;t appear as large, but going just as fast, who could estimate the ! speed of these things, but I would say several thousand miles an hour, that fast!!!!!!!! IMPRESSIVE.... At this point we were wonderin what the hell was going on, almost like being in a dream, where you can&apos;t believe your eyes. But it&apos;s real and you know it. We live on the outskirts of town where many people have animals, and we heard dogs barking, horses and donkeys beying, pet geese making all kinds of noise. The second (relative to the size) also appeared to be flying low, maybe half as large as the first one that flew directly overhead, north to south just as the first. They made NO noise whatsoever, and left no trails, only in view for an instant. They appeared to be going straight and at a constant velocity, real damn fast. How could this be happening? Are they ours? I don&apos;t see how they could be, given the apparent size and speed. But you never know. All the while, these star looking lights, that were moving around, almost confined to an area, started to have more activity. We witnessed several of them shoot across the sky over the next hour or so, almost like meteor trals, but the trails much much longer then a meteorite&apos;s, but not seeing that ominous &quot;big bird&quot; again. Observer 1 was freaking out a little, and decided to go inside to sleep. Myself and observer 3 stayed outside, waiting and watching when whizzzzzzzzz Two light colored objects about 70 degrees up to the east of us, coming out of the North again, going south, were two light colored Diamand shaped craft, resembling big planes with only wings and no tail or fuseloge, whizzed across the sky with the same breakneck speed, then the were gone, disappearing as quickly as they appeared. Where are they going? Back to Nevada or New Mexico? Or better question, where are the coming from? We might never know. But we have to believe, anyone looking in the Pueblo skies that night HAD to have seen it too, just too much activity, too many things moving, and the flyovers, those were enormous crafts, too big to miss, but maybe too fast for someone to see if n! ot looki ng up at all times. This had started at about 9:00 pm and at midnight, still happening. I think I had seen some sort of UFO sighting about 12 years ago, but it was nothing as convincing and REAL and fast and awesome as this. So us two keep looking at the skies and noticed a formation of flickering lights off to the east about 30-40 degrees up. It looked like a mini little dipper constellation, only the objects were dancing around this look alike formation, way to small to be the little dipper. We kept watching this because it seems to have appeared out of nowhere. The objects seemed to be about 2-3 times the width in length, appeared bluish white in light, and danced and tumbled around almost like a school of fish. We were getting tired and weary and decided to go to sleep. That&apos;s it. Hope to see them again, next time I will have my camcorder on a tripod, recording constantly looking straight up. I didn&apos;t have it at the time of the sighting and no pictures were taken. This eyewitness was just too eery and too scary not to report, I&apos;m sure some people will think I&apos;m crazy, but 4 people can&apos;t see the same thing and it not be real. Besides, I&apos;m almost certain that other people in the Pueblo area had to see it and will hopefully report this as well.", "Round glowing blue object moving very fast, changing directions twiceStationary blue round object in south sky.

I was nearing the area walmart, and was in a fairly commercial area, there were several cars infront of me, and several behind me. I looked twards the southwest, which is tward the walmart, and I noticed what I thought was an Airplane from the local airport. it had lights on it, just like a plane, but as it got closer something just seemed out of place, it was traveling very fast, and its shape just didnt look right, it was still far away, but getting closer to me and was going at a very rapid pace. I watched it and tried to keep my eyes on the road so I wouldnt crash into anything. I realized that it was definatly not a routine flight from the airport, and it was coming from the wrong direction, it was now flying directly twards my car from the right side. it had a total of 5 lights on it, it had a blue light on the very front of it, a white light just below the blue one, 2 white lights on either side, and a flashing light in the center of it. as it flew directly over my car, I slowed down, and I noticed other cars in front of mine slow down also, so I know I was not the only one who saw it. It finally passed over my car, and I could see it out of my drivers side window. there was no sound at all except for the cars passing by, I could see the shape very clearly now, It was totally black against the moonlit sky, it was definatly triangular and was wide in its shape, the back had no indications of exhaust, there was no smoke either, the back was concave in shape looking sorta like a bomerang but more triangular. I could see only 4 lights on it, the 3 white ones, and the blueish white flashing light in the center, as it passed by, I was shocked when a second one quickly followed the first same shape and same lights. They both were moving at the same speed, and same height above the ground, they seemed to be seperated by about 1000 feet. and couldnt have been more than 1000 feet above the ground there was no sound, and they were moving very fast probably above 300 to 400 mph.

We saw a light coming down a farmers gravel road (we were concerned because we thought it might be the police ~ we had alcohol in the car) and watched it closely. It seemed strange, one white ,bright light hovering above the road.  It was extremely dark (no moon that night) and it was unnervingly quiet.  It continued to move forward towards us (we were off the road) still 25 feet away.  It was the size of a beachball (est.) and had no sound, moving slowly (est 20 mph).  We became curious and jumped into the car and drove out to it.  As soon as we got close it moved backwards, without turning, very quickly, too quickly for any object what we were aware of.  It was not a motorcycle (no sound), it was not a car (no taillights, ability to turn 180 immediately) and it certainly wasn&apos;t any vehicle in production in 1965 or now that could have manevoured like that. The driver of the car became really worried and frightened, he immediately turn the car around and took off.  It started to follow us, he sped up 110+ mph on the straight road and it was able to keep up with us for some time before it disappeared.((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.

My husband an I were enjoying a campfire when he asked, &quot;Is that an airplane?&quot; as he pointed to the southern sky. We watched the light for a minute or so before it zig-zagged. I said, &quot;It&apos;s definatly not an airplane. Maybe it&apos;s a meteor.&quot; We have seen wuite a number of satelites and shooting stars ansd discussed those options before discounting them. The zig-zaggin light was way too low and bright ans it was slow moving. It moved slowly, zig-zagging once and a while, from the south-west sky in a south-east direction. I stood and followed it for a moment and it disapeared. There seemed to be a faint orangy-red glow just as it disapeared. I called channel Fox Six News to report it.

It was a clear, dry, comfortable night...I think about 60 to 65 degrees (but I don&apos;t recall exactly).  I was looking up at the stars in the night sky around 3 am during a routine hourly weather observation in a rural area of very little street lighting, when a very faint, pulsating, pure white light directly overhead caught my eye.  It was about as large as, and otherwise resembled, a small star, and could easily have been missed in a well-lit area.  It appeared to be moving very slowly in a north to south direction amongst the stars, and it gave me the impression that it was many thousands of miles away.  It moved straight and steadily, and I would estimate the pulsations to be about one per second, with the brightness peaks about twice the magnitude of the lulls.  After about a minute, it got down to an elevation of about 80 degrees south (still nearly overhead) and then gradually faded.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I say this for 2 reasons, as it shifted in a direction directly between the trees in front of me, about 60 feet away, and most importanly, in an instant stopped then accelerated 3 times, in about as many feet.

Shortly after settling into our sleeping bags, my brother-in-law directed my attention to a moving triangle in the sky directly above us, passing from North to South. It actually appeared to be three satellites, but at the moment I wasn&apos;t certain. I grabbed my binoculars to get a closer look and I could see stars passing between the points, satisfying my curiosity that these were indeed three independent objects, rather than one solid object. What was unusual was that they were moving in a perfect triangular formation. From my perspective, their distance apart from each other was about two finger-widths at arm&apos;s length. I looked at my watch to note the time. It was 10:51 p.m. After about a minute or two, the lead object faded out followed by the trailing objects seconds later.  Due to the late hour, and the location at which they faded, and the fact that they were moving slower than the average satellite, I concluded that they were much higher than the garden-variety low-Earth orbit satellites. After arriving home a few days later, I checked several of the satellite tracking web sites on the Internet in an attempt to identify what we saw. According to those databases, there were no satellites passing over that location at that particular moment.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the report may address a sighting of military/intelligence satellites, launched and orbitting in formation, but which do not appear in any publicly posted tables of orbitting objects.  The description above by the witness seems to us consistent with a sighting of orbitting satellites.  Similar reports should appear in future postings, if these objects are satellites, and if they continue orbitting for an extended period of time.   We include below a recent missive from Mr. Ed Cannon, noted &quot;amateur&quot; satellite watcher and space &quot;buff&quot; from Texas, who has been kind enough to keep us apprised of those events that seem to have a bearing on some of our reports posted here.

The entire footage lasts about 3 minutes as the object finally moved out of viewing range in the distance toward the SE.

My dad spotted what he thought was an aircraft to the north of their position.  He said it was a very bright white light that stayed in one position.  He assumed that it was an airplane with its landing lights on heading for Miami International Airport. When it didn&apos;t appear to turn he was afraid that it may be making an emergency landing on the highway! As my mom and dad became concerned, the object shot away to the west at incredible speed.

It grew some more but then turned bright gaseous looking green color and swelled up to the size of a basketball at arms length.  As I was looking and trying to comprehend what I was seeing, I had an awful feeling that I was watching an atom bomb explode or something, just seeing it grow like it did.

Oct 15 - very quiet and still to slow moving((NUFORC Note:  We presume &quot;UMO&quot; stands for University of Maine at Orono (Maine).  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD))When I first saw this there was not many posts for this type of siting and I let it go except for one post I made to some Purdue researcher that I never heard back from.  However, this is what happened. I was coming back from the computer lab at UMO and noticed a light over the trees as I passed in front of the gym.  Anyway it struck me as odd and I pulled into the parking lot on the ball fields side and looked at it. I realized that it was on my way home about over by the dairy farm.  So, I got back in my car and went like I was going to the dairy farm and while on the way I could occassionally see the glow of the light ( bright white ). As I got closer I saw the source of the light was hovering over the edge of the field.  As I turned into the road that went to the farm I almost immediately pulled over and stopped and got out of the car.  I looked at the clock and it was nearly 8 pm. I looked up at the craft and some things that struck me were the following: it sat as still as if it were on a stand somewhere between 300-1000 feet in the air.  It did not appear to be that big (about the size of a small school bus but wider. ) It appeared to be pretty flat and shaped like a shortened home plate (more delta shaped than rectangular). As I stood there I could no longer see the source of the light because I was a little under it and behind it (the light source on the object) .  I could see the glow of it though.  The next thing that struck me was the sound it made.  It was very quiet but it sounded kind of like a jet engine with the volume turned way down.  No other lights or sound was evident.  The night was still as could be. I watched it for perhaps 5 minutes and at that point it headed towards Route 2 going to Bangor.  As it got close to Brewer I lost site of it because the road was under construction and I could not get into town quick enough to get across the bridge. It never went very fast.  It was still for at least 10 minutes in the beginning and then I followed it for another 5-7 minutes as it followed the river.", "Were those points of light really satellites?While stargazing one night a few years ago, I witnessed what I thought were satellites traversing the sky from the southeast to the northwest. I would guess that I saw 5 or 6 within a half hour. I never thought much about it except in wondering why my companions were unable to see these satellites even though I diligently tried to point them out. I have since learned that most satellites travel in an easterly direction and while it isn&apos;t dramatic and may not even be significant, I have always wondered if what I saw were indeed satellites.((NUFORC Note:  The witness is correct in stating that most satellites move in a polar orbit, or they have an easterly component to their flight path.  However, because of parallax, it is very difficult to estimate the flight path, or ground track, of an object in the sky, unless it passes almost directly overhead.

Then a white beam seemed to come out of the top of the craft in a searching formation at that time the object got very bright white in color.  It was very quiet what ever it was there was no sound at all from this craft.  Also when it was in the back of the house it had little red flashing light flying up to the object craft very fast there was about 6 flashing small light that seemed to be very close to the craft in the back of the house floating up inside maybe?

The sky was clear, and since the sun had not risen yet there were still plenty of stars out. I would bet money that what I saw was actually a meteorites but it seemed very low and it streaked across the sky at a horizontal attitude. My first thought is that if was a UFO, it was over the hood canal or Jefferson County, not more than 10 miles away. It looked just like a star. If it really was 10 miles away, then I would estimate its speed at several thousand miles per hour. It was below the tree line, and visible for not more than one second due to the trees. There was an optical/visual streak effect, because it was going so fast. It was different looking than the average shooting star effect -It was not leaving a dust trail in its wake. I know that sometimes meteorites are much much farther away than they look, which could explain why this one was visible to me going across the sky on a horizontal path. It was going South to North. I&apos;m only reporting this because I&apos;m hoping somebody on Whidbey Island or Vancouver BC saw the same thing come their way and maybe saw more than one seconds&apos; worth of it.

We all saw bright chrome like, circular (somewhat elongated in direction or flight) object pass overhead at a high rate of speed.  There was no sound or sonic blast, so we assume it was traveling slower than the speed of sound.  Since it did not pass through any clouds, we assumed that it was below them, perhaps a few thousand feet above us.  It had no lights, although it changed colors from red to lavender to silver as it streaked across the sky.  It appeared like the sunset was reflecting off of it, but sun had set around 19:00.  There was no visible exhaust, flames, or vapor trail.  We first observed it almost directly overhead.  It was moving in a WWN (290 degrees) direction.  It was only visible for a few seconds, since it was traveling at a high rate of speed; much faster than a commercial airline.  Its relative size would be equivalent to looking at an object the size of a dime held at arms length over ones head.

On closer inspection of the object it appeared to have balloons at the top supporting a black triangular shape at the bottom. The balloons also seemed to be illuminated by a very dim light. The strange thing about this object was the balloons did not appear to be big enough or strong enough to support such a large object. We also confirmed that this was not a weather balloon. As I mentioned previously my father, who is an experienced weather observer, observed this object as I did and he was absolutely positive that it was not a weather balloon. We watched this object track to the southwest at a steady pace at about 20-30 knots. It appeared to be at an altitude of 10 to 15 thousand feet. It did not appear to descend or climb at all during the 20 min. we observed this object. We were both very perplexed and had no theory as to what this object might have been. After my father, a person who has observed the skies for 40 years, had no theory as to what this object might have been I considered worth reporting.", "Three saucer shaped craft with sequentially flashing multicolored lights followed young couple who experienced lost timeAt approximately 1:00 A.M. in October 1974, my wife and I, being a young newly married couple, were riding in the country, as lots of youg kids do.  We were approximately one mile out of town from Hopkinsville and had come to the end of the Concord Lane.  You had to turn either left or right onto the Greenville Road.  As we both looked to the right toward town we saw three saucer shaped craft several hunderd feet in the air and looked as if they were between a quarter to a half mile from us.  The craft had multicolored lights on the underneath side that sequentially flashed.  The sighting scared both of us of course, and I instinctively turned left and continued heading out of town. We were both looking back to see what the craft were doing and noticed they appeared to be following us.  About a quarter of a mile down the Greenville Road was a secondary road.  We turned right onto the Antioch Road and noticed that all three craft were still following us.  Approximately one to two miles out this road was a small lake.  As we started rounding the curve that bordered lake Tandy, we saw all three craft hovering above the lake and the craft in the center of the three, had flames coming from the center of it&apos;s underneath side.  I immediately turned in a driveway that was just past the curve in order to turn around.  My wife says the next thing she remembered was being back on the Concord Lane heading toward our apartment.  But I honestly don&apos;t remember anything from the point in time I turned in the drive to turn around, untill I was actually getting out of the car back at the apartment at which time we noted the time being 4:00 A.M.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The objects were seen from my car while driving.  The first object appeared to be fairly close and had a beam of light barely visible coming from the front of the object.  The second UFO appeared shortly after I spotted the first one.  They were very intensely bright, a silver color, so there was no way to distinguish a shape.  To the eye they appeared like a round cluster of with tenacles of light protruding from all sides that hung down at the ends as if they were heavy, like a tree limb full of rain or snow.  The only thing I could relate it to is a decoration that one uses at a party to hang from the ceiling that has many short pieces that hang at downward angles when unfolded and hung.  I lost sight of them at one point, but as I turned the corner and looked to see if i could spot them I could see one UFO had risen and was barely visible as an eerie glow in the clouds.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke to this witness, and we found her to be quite credible and convincing.

I lowered the camera and no more than 10 feet from me was a ball approximately two feet in diameter; with an outer glow that extended it to about 3 feet.  The shape was almost a perfect circle.  I did not feel any heat irradiating from the ball, yet it was burning bright red and emitting heat waves.  It remained about 20 seconds, then started to rise vertically, very slowly to about 60 feet, where it remained motionless for a short period.  It then made a 90 degree turn and then accelerated out of site.  I have a color photo of this event.  I called the police to report it and they had another report of a fire ball a block away.((FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATION REPORT:  ERIC BYLER, Oregon UFO Review, &lt;Oregon UFO Review@home.com&gt;.  Hi Peter,I just got back from an investigation at the coast where I got the picture you see here along with the negatives.  I am still working on the report and have to make one more follow up call with him to clarify something, but the long and short of it is that the photographer is a ((deleted)) year old man of (partial) American Indian heritage by the name of ((deleted)).  He lives alone with a rather large ((dog)) in a very nice home on the coast of Oregon in a small town named Florence.((He)) spends a lot of time on his yard as it looks quite good. On the day of the picture, he was out with his camera...a ((high quality SLR camera))mm  1:3.5 - 4.5...using 35mm 400 film... a very nice camera that he chooses to keep on automatic for the simplicity of pointing and shooting.  He had already made a number of pictures when he approached the plants you see in this picture.According to his testimony, as he was looking through the view finder and was about to shoot, this image appeared in his view finder.  He quickly hit the shutter button and dropped the camera to see what this was. He estimated the object as being a couple feet wide and glowing like fire with an outer lighter glow that emanated like a heat wave.  He pointed out however that as close as he was, only a few feet away, he could feel no heat.  He thought this as odd.After a few seconds, the object began to slowly rise until it reached tree level which is quite high as you can see in the picture, the whole time just watching in awe thinking, &quot;&apos;what in the hell is this?&quot;  Then he realized, hey, take another picture.  He brought the camera up to began lining it up with the object when it did a 90 degree turn and shot away from the house traveling west towards the ocean.  He immediately took the film down to have them developed to see if he indeed had got the object on film.  I have checked out the negatives and the package with the number of pictures that were developed and is does appear that he stopped taking pictures in his yard by the time he got to the picture in question.  My thought is if this were just a reflection of some sort on the lens then it probably would have only shown up when the pictures were developed and he would have continued taking pictures.  The fact that he did indeed stop taking pictures at number ten (the roll goes backward from 24 to 1) and then developed the pictures tell me that he may have indeed seen something of a nature that points away from simple lens reflection and does add up with his story.I spent some time in the house with ((witness)) and I found him very easy to talk with.  ((Witness) is a big man but soft spoken.  His house is very nice with lots of reference to his heritage seen in the art work on his walls.  He has three ((medals)) permanently displayed on a side table as he was in WW2.  A wall in another room had a number of framed certificates of achievements and education showing his many accomplishments over the years.  In his main den where we talked there was a large volume of books on shelves.  I saw no books pertaining to UFO material as many were related to American Indian heritage((Witness)) does not have a computer for internet access but does have basic television.He has no idea what he saw.  He did contact the police who came over and took a report.  The following day he says he talked to the assistant fire chief while in town and he (the chief) mentioned hearing of a similar report on his scanner that day but remembers it as being on 24th street, rather than 23rd where ((witness)) lives.  I am following up on this.  I did contact the state police who reports that they have had similar reports like this over the past few months in other parts of the coast but didnot elaborate.  This is being followed up on as well.Just in case the photo doesn&apos;t come through, go here... http://www.oregonuforeview.com/florence.html ... to view it.Sincerely,Eric Byler - Oregon UFO Research.((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to Eric Byler, Oregon UFO Review, for the excellent investigation and follow-up review.

Almost appear as if they are &quot;talking&quot; to each other.At approx. 23:33pm on Friday August 24,2001, myself and my father have witnessed and are still witnessing 2 objects in the sky a ways apart, flashing different colors, from red to blue to white. At first my father believed that they were &quot;quazars&quot; but one of them moved. It moved as we were standing still in one spot. It would reappear a short distance away from the original spot. When looking at these objects, I could notice that at one point it appeared they were shaped like a boomerrang, then they would &quot;change&quot; into a circle. This is very strange, how do I go about getting this investigated?

Very noticible and very intense, it was a growing pulse of white light, that after about 9 seconds shaded to a bright sea green flaring into a dark blue eerie glow about 20 seconds later, the event ended with a shimmering type display, of dark blue light vanishing without a trace. I at first thought it was a meteor, but this object was not moving and i have never witnessed a blue colored meteor. Id estimate the magnitude of the display of light to be about a 2 or 3, very bright. Unfortunatley i failed to have my camera :( ((name deleted))", "Pink anomali and the  red pulsing lightI joined my friend outside while he was having a smoke. His house sets on a little hill overlooking a small town 5 miles north. We stood on his concrete basketball court and fratenized in the cool missouri air. I looked to my east, northeast,above the horizon was a pink, wispy, cloud superimposed on the blue night. It was like a light but not, it was like a paintbrush stroke but not.  It was large, i estimate it to be around the size of 30 full moons, speaking of the moon it was directly opposite the pink anomali. As any young 21 year old of average intelligence might gather, &quot;this must be the northern lights&quot;. It was beautiful  whatever it was and it held our full attetion for its duration. But here&apos;s the clincher about 3 minutes into the sighting a red pulsing light caught our attetion, due north, toward the town. The light seemed to be between us and the town, but closer to the town of some 14,000. It was red, stoplight red,and its lights never toataly went out, but dimmed and brightened in a methodial pattern, bright 1000 dim 1000.i estimate its size at 1/10 the moons. As the round light, as i could make out no shape of a craft, moved east toward the wispy pink anomali they both seemed to slowly disappear. That was it and they where gone. Sound u ask. Yes we heard a sound even befor the sighting, we thought it was a jet overhead, but it seemed to linger, who knows if they&apos;re  connected.  I have no idea if the red pulsing light was connceted to the pink discoloration. I&apos;ve had a couple more sightings, none this intresting. My friend can backup all this 100%. What an intresting world we live in.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the pink glow in the north may have been an example of the &quot;Northern Lights,&quot; also called the Aurora boreallis.  The red pulsing light may have been a strobe or Grimes Light on an aircraft.

My friend thought it was venus, but it seemed so large and bright, and it seemed to be lower than most stars and the only star in the direction!  I thought it was the north star but realized we were facing east.  As we were about to dismiss the object as a star or planet, it suddenly darted left (straight north)  for about 3 seconds but seemed to cover a lot of ground in that short time.  We lost sight of it but then turned left as it was the road towards home anyways.  We passed some pines that blocked our view but then came to an open field and saw the bright object again.  It was hovering but then moved upwards quickly and the light totally went out, then came back on again about 10 seconds later.  The odd thing was it was a clear sky, every star was visible, so i figured it couldnt be a plane going through clouds, and the light seemed to large to just be a plane.  We watched the object for another 10 miles, and decided to go just go home cause it was now higher in the sky.   However when i got on my road i could still see the strange object, i tried to video tape it casue i had my camera in the car but the battery died about 3 seconds into taping it,  so we went in my home got my dad and drove back west down my road.  we stopped the vehicle got out and stared north northeast where the object was.  It now was a brilliant blue and red, the lights would flicker much like that of a plane, but it hovered in the same spot for 30 more minutes!!!  Plus i spotted a plane in the south western sky moving east, and it became clear the object was definately no plane.  The strangest thing about it was that it also had 3 white lights, which if connected would make a triangle.  but the triangle seemed to appear, then go away then come back once every 20 seconds or so..  we  watched it  until 11:15 and then decided to return home.

I know it wasnt an airplane but i really thought it to be a satelite.I watch it go across the horizon untill it disapairs.Then about 3 minuets after that another one catches my eye,going same direction,same pace, just a light moving acros the sky.I thought wierd i never really seen satelites like that.At this time in not really hiped up about seeing all that because i think it could have been satelites.i was more mad because ive been waiting for like 15 20 mins outside.So i pace around look at more bats in the sky looking north.Then a blue comet type fireball thats seemed to skip on water buzzed by,not super bright but it was wierd,a blue fireball type thing.i thought wow  thats really wierd,maybe im tired.But that had all my attention on the sky.Now not even a minute after i see that fireball another light goes racing acros the sky,much faster than the sattelites but same direction,exept this on was pulsating bright to very faint,that made me run in and get my cousin,she came out and looked at it to for about the last 30 seconds we could see it int he sky.My cousin even said wow that was pretty wierd and as were looking up another faint light goes in a north west direction,pulsating also but still staying pretty faint.that one was going real slow also i saw it for about 4 minuets buzz its way over the ocean.after that i didnt see anything and my cousin went inside because it was getting chilly.Also my frined came by.I hope someone here in South San Luis Obispo county seen it or someone let me know what all these strange lights are.i belive in UFO&apos;s and have been seeing alot here.

The lights were traveling in both directions, one or two together. We saw several of the lights make course and speed changes. The line of travel was parallel to the Milky Way as it appeared last night. During the hour of observation we also saw and heard commercial aircraft at a lower altitudes.

My mom and dad and uncle were on the back deck visiting. My mom called me, my friend, and my older brother to come outside to see something. I looked up and found what they were talking about. It was a light way up in the sky, not as bright as a satellite, more like a small star. This light was zigzagging in a pattern. At the time it seemed like it was moving so slow, but now I realize how fast it must have been moving. My parents and uncle had been watching it for quite a while before they called us outside. I watched this thing zig zag across the sky for at least 30 minutes and then it took off very quickly in a straight line and disappeared from our view.

One evening, I believe the 15th of July, we were sitting outside. It was about 10:00 p.m. I was getting back from the horse stable right outside the fenced property of the house with the man who owned the summer home, a family friend. As we were getting back and approaching the house, I noticed my mom was holding our camera and recording something. Her, the family friend, and I were the only ones outside at the time. I asked my mom what she was recording. She then pointed I believe Southward right over the treeline of the nearby woods. As the family friend and I proceeded to look in that direction, i suddenly noticed a diamond shaped white light. It was completely silent. It was positioned in one location, without moving even the slightest bit in any direction. I only saw the light, and no other structure around it, making it impossible to be a helicopter or any other type or air vehicle or structure. We proceeded to watch the light for about 3 minutes. It remained unchanged. Then, it became a little brighter, and I noticed the color of the object was changing to a sort of bluish light. It then proceeded to move downword toward the treeline at an unusually slow, but constant speed. It seemed to move straight down without any other movement. Then, it disappeared below the treeline. After that, we went our ways, but I kept looking in that direction every few minutes. Unfortunaltely, nothing else happened that I noticed.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Several minutes later, to our astonishment, this star began getting bigger and within a few seconds was guessed to be about half the size of the moon, as if it were falling on us.  Needless to say, all 3 of us sat up at the same time in disbelief.  At this moment a large cloud passed between us and  the star.

It came to earth somewhere in the La Garita mountains.  Scientists and locals flocked to the hills without finding a trace.  All local papers reported on it for a week or two, including the Denver Post.The strange thing is, that from NORAD it must have looked like a 2.5 ton object heading straight for Cheyenne Mountain as it was inbound.

As we watched it the object began to drift to the west very slowly.  Since it was a very bright day with good thermals possible I thought the object might be some kind of debris that had been lofted into the air by a strong thermal and wind.  As we watched the object it grew a sprial tail that was at least as wide as the object itself and two to three times as long; this tail was black on one side and silver on the other.  It began to climb very rapidly with the tail spiraling in a clockwise direction.  Since it was in the local airport traffic pattern I called a report of flying junk into the ABE airport; they said they did not have anything on radar. Given the altitude and distance of the object, it must have been about 20 plus feet in length and at least six feet from top to bottom.  The cloud base was about 12 to 15 thousand feet that day and the object climbed to cloud base in less than two minutes.  I could keep visual contact as the sun reflected from the silver side of the tail. I have thought about this object nearly every day since we saw it and came to the conclusion that it was not just some kind of junk floating around for the following.  First if it was something like a cardboard box, the rectangle would have become mishapen when the tail extended as that would have been part of the box.  Second even in a boomer thermal I have never seen an object climb that fast (no whosh or whoom) it just climbed near vertical with the spiral tail flashing in the sun.  If it had climbed in a thermal, my experience is that a free flying object would circle and float not just climb like this thing did. This object is without question the most unusual thing I have ever seen. I would be very interested in knowing if anyone else has ever experienced this type of thing and if they did identify the object.", "&apos;UFO&apos; sighted over Jurong WestChannelNews Asia - http://sg.cna.mediacorpnews.com//articles/2001/09/24/singaporenews5205.htm 24 September 2001 1540 hrs (GMT) 2340 hrs (SST) &apos;UFO&apos; sighted over Jurong West Residents in Jurong West saw a strange object in the sky on Saturday night, describing it an unidentified flying object that hovered for as long as 15 minutes over some blocks of flats.The UFO sparked excitement and speculation among the residents, some of whom called the Channel NewsAsia hotline.Resident Benjamin Lee captured the object on a video camera, but by the time the camera began rolling, it had moved some distance away.&quot;They were shouting and said some flying saucer over the place so I just came out and saw the thing,&quot; he said.&quot;They said, &apos;Take your view cam.&apos; So I started taking down the picture.

I waited awhile thinking it could be a plane but after 5 minutes it hadn&apos;t move. I then woke up my husband and we got out our Canon Binoculars and what we saw gave us both wicked goosebumps!

There was a definite distinctive dark band separating the lights. IT NEVER moved for the 25 minutes we watched it - we don&apos;t know how long it was there before 3:40 AM.

It disappeared again and immediately re-appeared at the other side of town. The only other thing I remember is that it felt like this thing was right above the telephone poles. I still remember thinking that I could have thrown up a rock and hit it if I wanted too.What really surprised us was the next day when there was an article in the local newspaper stating that there were several sightings of a UFO reported to the police station. I need to go back and see if I can retrieve that article somehow (if its possible).

In the brightest part of the sky, the night was &apos;black/blue&apos; in color but within that blue/black there appeared to be an object which appeared as brown (and maybe a dingy purple/brown).  There were no lights on this object.  It appeared as a shadow within a shadow.  I wouldn&apos;t call it triangle-shaped.  It had even sides, which flared out, and the backend portion was much wider than the front end.  It appeared to be heading northeast.  At some point it became harder to locate and I turned around hoping to catch it again but in this direction the sky was much darker as this is an area in which there are fewer city lights.

When in the triangle formation, the fourth object was off to the right of the triangle.Then the fourth came from the west to the east at a tremendous speed without sound and disappeared out of sight. Now there were three left. About five min later one more flew by in the same manner.

Trees were obscuring any more of it&apos;s trajectory.  What made it look different was the slower speed (most shooting stars I have seen are maybe a tenth of a second), and the illumination looked like maybe a landing light on an aircraft.  It was quite bright, as the night sky to the west of here is not that dark because of city lights, yet this meteor-like object was easily visible.  The tail would be about the width of a finger at arms length.  Color was headlight white, yet not as white as a halogen type light.  In the past, I observed the falling pieces of some satelite over Seattle several years ago.  Those were burning with a green glow, and seemed to be falling slowly, from north to south.  The falling pieces were visible for several seconds, and were obviously much slower than meteors.

I was just sitting there to show my presence to show her boyfriend that I still liked his company even though their relationship of two years had recently broken up and had left everyone concerned,not knowing exactly how to address each other now! I just happened to be looking to the eastern sky when I saw a brilliant bright light in traditional flight lane over Fairborn, Ohio. I ws looking at it over some power lines that run over my back yard. The light moves up slightly over the power line and seemed to hover there, in relation to the power line and my direction of vision.Within abo;ut two minutes I saw a light approach this brilliant light from the southern sky. It was headed at a normal aircraft pace to the place that the bright light was hovering. The light from the south sky approached the position where the brilliant light was and it moved straight up as if the jet(I&apos;m thinking) passed it by.Then a jet with lights blinkiing like an emergency vehicle and headed towards the bright light flew from what I surmise as around Wright Patterson field, which is close to where I live,at a &quot;bat outa hell&quot; pace and sped off toward the position of the light that is still in my vision over the power line in my back yard. When this jet approached this area something very strange happened. The brilliant light turned red and seemed to change into  not one but two  pulsating red lights and and just blinked out. The jet seemed to fly right past where it was....and we never seem the brilliant light nor the pulsating lights again.As we talked about what we had seen, I told my daughter that she probably had just leen her first ufo.

It had no wings, was reflecting sunlight, and seemed to have a verticle fin or rudder on the back. it flew very steady SE until it became a speck and then went out of site. It had no jetstream of any kind. We do not know if it made a noise, but we noticed that no one walking into the entrance of the store looked up or noticed it in any way. We have looked up every sort of american aircraft and even unmanned spy planes, and none of them looked like it. The closest thing to what it looked like is a missle, like the tomahawk missles.

T&oslash;gersen says several more people have come forward after news reports carried the account of three people in the town of Mosj&oslash;en who dove for cover when they saw a low-flying, whirling object hurtle through the night skies On September 23.  &quot;We also have several other witness observations of the same phenomenon in the same time frame on Sunday,&quot; T&oslash;gersen said.  Other people have reported sightings of additional UFOs that apparently resemble small, brightly lit balls.  While the larger object over Mosj&oslash;en emitted no noise whatsoever, T&oslash;gersen says the smaller objects are reported to have made a hissing sound.  But the most remarkable reports came from the northern city of Bod&oslash;.  There, a woman went out of her house and a flying object landed on her lawn, stoo!d there awhile, and then lifted off and flew away.  Two other separate individuals reported the same sighting, at the same time, on Saturday evening.  One of the two was driving his car when he spotted it flying over Vefsnfjorden, while another saw it while out on a veranda.  Both reported that it was brightly lit.

The object appeared like a star but was zig-zagging in the night sky. When I looked through my binoculers, I noticed that it appeared much like a jellyfish with two limbs and a light source inside. I contacted a friend who lives about 10 miles further west from me and he confirmed the object in the same westerly direction.

As we went around the bend, we could the lights through the trees, when they just vanished. Within ten minutes, we seen, what looked to be, a white light, 60ft long,20 ft.in diameter, round on each end, moving very slowly, against the back drop of a mountain. I stopped the vehicle and shut off the lights to observe this light. It moved very slowly, horizontally and started to pick up speed. It left a trail behind it that got duller the further back the trail went. This lighting phenomena lasted approximately twenty seconds and what looked to move about three miles, then all of a sudden, took off extremely fast and left no trail after itself, all we seen was the light traveling at an instant high speed acceleration that looked to travel the distance of maybe 10 miles, in less then two seconds.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))((CORRESPONDENCE FROM WITNESS))Peter,This is the reply I just got back from the other person thats now living in ((deleted)), about the report I sent him today. He had never seen the report before this.Just thought I&apos;d pass it along to verify the report.((name deleted))Hi ((name deleted))!I remember that incident just as plain as it happened yesterday. It is hard to beleive that was over 10 years ago.  Where has all the time gone? I still don&apos;t know what it could have been.  It is thought provoking that it made its appreance in a wild and remote part of British Colombia.  Almost as if it didn&apos;t want to be seen.  Perhaps we will never know just what it was?  And again, maybe we will.  Anyway, it is something we can tell our grand kid&apos;s about.((paragraph deleted))((END CORRESPONDENCE))", "Eight  objects seen within 10 minutes in broad daylight.The morning was warm with absolutely clear skys and no wind.  A group of six of us were gathered after church at one of their homes.  Four of us had stepped out into the back yard to smoke (cigarettes).  I was watching an airliner fly through the sky about 1000 Ft or more in altitude and noticed a bright/shiney round object sitting what appeared to be stationary well above and N.W. of the passenger jet.  I asked the others what they thought it could be and asked for some binoculars to view it better.  Most said that it must be a balloon.  It was to hard to see clearly what it was even through the binoculars.  It did look circular in shape.  Several of us took turns with the binocs. to see if we could make out what it was.  It remained stationary the whole time we watched it, not moving up, down or horizontally.  As one of the others was looking through the binocs. I began to scan the sky and saw another airliner heading North at what appeared to be a normal flying altitude of maybe 2000 Ft. plus.  Then all of a sudden I noticed a formation of seven Bright/shiney oval objects as large as the airliner, flying South far above the airliner.  These objects had a bright sheen to them, almost like a &quot;halo&quot; around them.  Again I brought this to everyones attention and most dismissed these as military aircraft doing manuvers, geese or something else.  The odd thing about this formation was it looked like a lower case &quot;y&quot; flying sideways, tail first and that at the altitude these were flying they were still as large as the airliner.  Also noteably peculiar was that three of these craft rotated/changed positions in the formation with relative ease.  That is to say that they dropped out of formation, dropped back behind the others, then moved to their new position with ease.  Very fluid and quick  movements, which seems a strange ability considering their size.  Their rate of speed was no faster than normal airliners as a formation.  After the formation left our view I returned my attention to the area where we ob! served t he &quot;balloon&quot; and it was no longer in view.  The whole time this transpired was no more than 10 minutes.  Our group consisted of various ages and backgrounds.  As for me, I am prior military, 44 years old, and definately keeping a closer watch on our skys.  These are not the first peculiar aircraft I have sighted or reported.  I am one that tends not to speculate to much as to where these unusual craft come from.  I believe they are made by &quot;man&quot; until proven otherwise.  Just seems strange that with all these different objects flying around, how is it that the &quot;men&quot; who makes them or flys them hasn&apos;t bragged about it or &quot;let the cat out of the bag&quot; so to speak?", "The object went diagonally downwards, changed from a white, to a dull green, to a dim light blue, to finally a dark yellow, it faded.The object in question was either a ball of light or was emmiting enough of it to make it look like it was made of light, but it made absolutely no sound. I was standing on the side of a road beside a field when my neighbor pointed out a, what looked like to be, even though distance was hard to tell at 8:50 at night, so I had no idea how big it was, a flying object. It was going diagonally towards the ground, in my view point, what looked like a southernly direction. While it was doing this, it was changing from a white, to a dull green, to a dim light blue, to a dark yellow, then, it faded away quickly, leaving no trace, sound, or, smell, behind.((NUFORC Note:  We are uncertain of the date.

The first three lights were in a semi-triangular shape.  The back two lights were changing positions back and forth.At the same time, they were  making sharp turns and returning back behind the first three lights without losing forward distance with the first three lights.  The lights travelled 75% of the sky in 4-6 seconds before disappearing into the blur of the Portland lights. The altitude seemed to be higher than a commercial aircraft and lower than a satellite.

Each flash lasted about four seconds, with the first being the brightest, and then progressively getting fainter.  When the flashes occurred they were stationary in the sky, and not moving like a meteor, satellite, or plane.  We have observed many planes and meteors for years and this was nothing like any of those occasions.  Each flash flared and then faded without moving, and then reappeared in a slightly different location still within the swan. We have no idea what we saw and are truly at a loss to explain it.  Further, we would appreciate any explanation you might give us.          Thank you", "Silver cigar over Central MissouriThis morning as my sons and I were outside preparing to get in the car, I heard an unusual sound which I have in fact noticed on several occassions in the past months.  Certainly not highway noise, and while similar to typical aviation noise, somehow much more &quot;otherworldly&quot; sounding.  This is such a subjective description, but is the best I can come up with.  We live along a creek banked by steep cliffs and have a deep ravine originating near our home that opens into the creek in a break in the cliffs.  I mention this because I believe this feature can amplify aerial noises.  I will also mention that I have been an avid sky watcher for almost exactly a year now, my interest originally having been piqued by stumbling across info on the web re: anomolous contrails, aka chemtrails.  Within a month or so of reading about them, they began appearing frequently in our skies, typically the result of what I would  say, from the planes I have viewed, are military jets doing some kind of exercise. In any case, this morning the skies were almost pure blue, but typically upon hearing that unusual noise planes will appear and the skies slowly haze over... This morning something totally unexpected happened. A cigar shaped object appeared at an altitude just under the few clouds (cirrus) in the sky, slowly moving west to east.  While the strange noise was coming from a distance through the ravine, there was no sound whatsoever associated with this craft. It was uniformly silver, with no wings and no windows that I could observe.  It had no contrails coming from it.  My best estimate as to its size would be that of a typical tractor-trailer only wider.  It had the shape of a medicine capsule, therefore I would call it a cigar shaped object for classification purposes.  Within approximately 2 minutes this slow moving craft ascended at perhaps a 15 degree angle and poof! disappeared from view.  I have been thinking about it all day - it was so unusual.  Within a minute of seeing this object, a military (I assume) jet ap! peared i n the sky emitting a contrail at about the same altitude.  Back in March, I was driving near my home looking at lingering contrails and noticed a jet - traveling next to it towards its rear was a silver orb a bit smaller than the jet.  I wished to observe this by following it in my car but had someone tailgating me, so I was unable to make a turn in order to observe more.  Other than that sphere and the cigar witnessed this morning, I have NEVER seen anything like these craft before in my life and would rule out explanations such as &quot;blimp&quot;, &quot;weather balloon&quot; or the like.  I have never &quot;believed&quot; in UFOs but the sighting this morning, as well as the orb some months back, have me convinced that there are at the very least craft of whatever origin whose operating mechanisms are nothing like those the general public are privy to.", "i was haveng a late coffee brake in my backyard when i look up at the sky and saw an object that seemed circular, because these 2 dim yellowish lights spinned around in a clockwise slow movment ,then back counterclock and it started to come closer together while it moved from the north to the south striaght overhead in the sky at 12:00 oclock high . i went inside to tell my folks and a few minuets later i went back out to see a group of star like lights in a fixed pattern like a upside down cross passing from the south to the north in the same area .", "it looked like a star from a constallation but it was moving.last evening i was laying in my hammock and suddenly i saw what looked like a moving star. it went from south to north in a straight line at a constant speed. it did not stop or turn. it looked just like a star in the sky, the same glow and size. i would say that it moved a little faster then a jet. then i saw the second one, this time i called my cousin to come look. he saw it as well. i have seen something similar in the past about three years ago. what could it bee.", "2 or 3 saucers flying in formation in the sky during the day that shot off quickly.[This is the second report from my father who is not on the internet] It was during the day, and I was driving on 74.

I left the porch light off to observe the night sky.  After a few moments I observed an object travelling at a high speed, by far faster than any aircraft I have ever seen (Military or Civilian) towards the SE.  This object had no running lights, left no contrail and was completely silent.  It looked for all the world like the detached wings of a glider aircraft.  It was silhouetted clearly in the night sky because the sky was clear and there was an almost full moon in the Eastern sky, low in the horizon.  I observed this for approx. 2 seconds as it passed through at about 20-25 degrees overhead, disapearing behind a line of trees.  I have observed many unusual sights in the night sky but this is the first that has left me completely stumped.  The object size exceeded, by far, the diameter of the moon by about 1 and 1/2 times.  There was one other aircraft visible in the night sky, identifiable by it&apos;s running lights, travelling in a similar direction but apparantly oblivious to the object.  I came inside and phoned in the report and will be mailing a drawing to the reporting center.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length, and found him to be an unusually good witness.

It first appeared to me just below the top of my windshield at about a 30 degree angle above the horizon, appearing to flare up at that point to a bright yellow-white color with a long tail and sparks and small chunks breaking off. It was about half to 2/3rds the size of a pencil eraser at arms length. It dropped almost vertically to a point just above the ridgeline of the foothills, and appeared to dim out just before disappearing. While very hard to estimate distance, if I had to venture a guess I would say 5 to 20 miles, though it could have been much further. It looked to me that it very likely hit the ground relatively near Denver. (A call to the USGS for seismic cooberation was quite unsatisfying) I had my hand held GPS operating, and checked the current heading at that time as 201 degrees. I am trying to confirm if that is magnetic or true heading, but the GPS manual does not specify. It appears to be magnetic heading based on my aeronautical chart and the road in that area. The object was just slightly left of straight ahead, so most likely about a 195-200 degree magnetic heading from that intersection. Plotting this on my Denver Area Chart (aeronautical chart), the line runs nearly through Marshdale, Silver Springs, and Bailey Colorado. (If my GPS course turns out to be True Course, shift the line 10 &frac12; degrees to the left, but magnetic course looks right on the map). This was one of the most spectacular, low and close objects of this type I have seen, and if my small plane were not in the shop I would go out looking for evidence. It may be possible if able to triangulate or get a seismic location to find a relatively pristine meteor or space debris. I don&apos;t know who to contact about meteor impacts, so perhaps you can tell me or pass this on. Perhaps NORAD/Space Command has some info on this object if they will share it with us.((NUFORC Note:  Map sent by witness.  Curiously, no other reports from this part of Colorado for this date.

The &quot;swarm&quot; of lights, each of apparently equal brightness and being similar in color and brightness to the star Arcturus, initially subtended a fairly small angle comparable to the apparent angular diameter of the moon. Over the course of approximately fifteen minutes, the &quot;swarm&quot; moved toward the northeast while simultaneously dispersing and becoming dimmer. By the time the lights were directly overhead they had dispersed enough for the swarm to subtend an angle comparable to at least ten times the apparent angular diameter of the moon, and each had become so dim as to be barely visible.

Shortly after that another light of the same nature was spotted several degrees to the right of the last.These lights didn&apos;t seem to move great distances from their &quot;original position.&quot;  I think the first light may have been an exception to this.  At first it moved around in a small area but later moved around covering greater distances than the other two but then went back to just moving around in a small area.These lights seemed to be using the backdrop of the stars as camouflage in that they A) typically only moved around in &quot;small&quot; areas and  B) moved with the stars as if to follow the earth&apos;s rotation.This got redundant after awhile.

He was sitting up resting his back on the wall underneath our window, so when I stood up I was facing the window (we had the blinds up).  While I was looking at him, a bright light outside the window caught my attention.  The object was very bright--it seemed to &apos;twinkle&apos;, and was gold in color.  My husband noticed that I was no longer listening to him and asked what I was looking at.  I told him about the bright light in the sky, and just as I finished telling him, I looked back at the object and I noticed that it was now many colors--they seemed to pulsate.  I&apos;m not sure of all the colors, but I know that one of the colors was green and another was red--whenever the red one &apos;blinked&apos; it was brighter that the others.  Almost immediately after seeing the object start to blink, two other objects &apos;appeared&apos;.  They were exactly like the first one I had observed, and all three together formed an &apos;upside down triangle&apos; in the sky.  They were motionless for about a minute, then began moving slowly, staying in their triangle formation.  My husband also witnessed this.  We stayed at the window to see if they would come back, and they did in about a minute.  This time, however, they were not in formation and there were only two of them.  They were split apart--when the three were together they were positioned between 2 trees, so they were in clear view--this time there was one behind each tree.  Neither of the trees were thick with leaves, and the objects&apos; lights were still blinking, so the objects were visible.  They stayed behind the trees for a minute, then went way, then came back about a minute later, then went away again.  We did not see them after this.  My husband doesn&apos;t really believe in UFOs, so he keeps telling me that they were just airplanes or helicopters or something, but I ! used to live in Latrobe, near the airport, and also near a hospital, so I know what helicopters and airplanes look like, and believe me, these objects were neither airplanes or helicopters.

It seemed like a referee was north and south.  At times, it appeared as if the red was firing at the blue and the 3 lights in the middle were trying to block. Also, at times there were objects that appeared to come from the other 7 objects, or trails of light.  I went inside and woke my spouse and told what I saw.  My spouse and my daughter came out and witness the exact same thing.  I have been a skeptic.  9-2-01.  Too cloudy to observe.

We are about an hour to our destination and the place is windy and no cars are behind us or in front of us and this is about 30 min before midnight. Then from afar I noticed a bright light in the sky and I told my boss that maybe its just a tower light. But he told me that no towers are present in the area. After maybe 10 min, it is getting bigger and nearer and so we decided to stop on the road because we got curious. We both dont believe in UFOs but when we stepped down we get to see a certified UFO. It stopped on top of us as if they really wanted us to see them. It is triangular in shape and full of white lights covering the whole triangular shape. It also has a single blue light on one wing and a single red light on the other wing. We stood staring on it with amazement because we dont know what it is because for sure its not a plane because it stopped on top of us and its not a chopper also because it is so quiet. Some people in the area reported the same sighting too.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We had a two hour wait, and we waited outside.  We were sitting on the bench looking out to the north and I noticed a very, faint amber colored triangular shaped object moving to the southeast.  The UFO phenomena has always interested me and I am always looking in the sky, but most of the time I am able to rule out a classic UFO.  99.9% of the time I can identify it, but this time, it was strange.  As it got closer, to overhead, but not completely I noticed that within its triangular structure it appeared to have many spheres or &quot;orbs&quot; interchanging within it.  The entire craft remained the faint amber color, although the spheres appeared to be more translucent.  My curiousity in the object, attracted a crowd who also were waiting to go inside and they all saw the same thing, including my wife and friend.  One lady even let out a startled yell.  A few gasps were also heard.  Out of the group of us who witnessed the event one lady said that they were just ballons, but the size of the object at that altitude would have meant the balloon cluster would be huge, and it retained a definitive shape, at least the outline did, the rest of the craft did appear to morph somewhat.  We watched it as it went off in the distant night sky toward the southeast, towards Fayetteville, NC.  I&apos;m not sure of the altitude, I approximate it at probably 1000 feet or so.  The first sight of it looked like a jetliner with its lights on coming into land, but shrouded by heavy cloudcover(thats what the shape appeared as intially) It was a clear cold night, only high level cirrus clouds were barely visible.  It was not a helicopter, jet, or hot air balloon or geese.  This was clearly unidentified, in my opinion.  I have also reported this sighting to MUFON.", "Cigar shaped object seen near Lake of the Ozarks, MOMy friend ((name #1 deleted)) first saw the object in the sky.  What was viewable at the time was only a bright light, about half the size of the moon or twice the size of Venus &amp; larger than most plane &amp; helicopter lights I&apos;ve seen.

It didn&apos;t appear to have wings &amp; had two blue lights in the back underneath it, then two other clear lights &amp; two red lights toward the front, &amp; of course the extremely bright head light.  We continued on down the road but were a bit shaken up by what we&apos;d seen.  I expect to hear an explosion or something because I thought it was a jet plane that was about to crash, but I didn&apos;t hear or see any explosion or anything else.  We continued on to our friend ((name #2 deleted)) house, but she wasn&apos;t home so we turned back around &amp; went back to the area just below where we had saw the object.  There was nothing to indicate that anything had landed or anything else.  We also looked at the nearby Lake of the Ozarks General Hospital, but the helicopter there appeared to have not been used recently &amp; still had tarps over the propeller blades.

West of Olathe, Kansas.Driving west on 135th Street just opposite Lake Olathe. Looking west, strings of light appeared from SW horizon. color-reddish to orange. I would estimate a 55 degree angle from the western horizon and the objects covered about 10-15 degrees vertically.The objects were two (or three) strings (possibly &quot;slashes&quot;, or a combination of strings and slashes) of very bright light. It was as if it was a meteor but it was not. The object(s) covered about 1/3 of the sky. It was very clear and the full moon was to our back. The object proceded NNE in the sky toward Kansas City and disappeared over the horizon. There was NO sound.It was difficult to tell the distance. However there were at least two, possibly three blinking lights (as in aircraft) escorting the object. The blinking lights were small to indicate a good distance. If this is the case, the object(s were HUGH. It could have been one object trailing strings of lights, or a perimeter of lights. From the angle we viewed the object it was hard to tell. They were very bright and could have been connected. The object did not &quot;burn&quot; as in a meteor but trailed away from direction of movement. We stopped the car and got out to view this phenomenom. Again, NO SOUND. We have seen meteors, and images of reentering space junk. This was NOT like that at all. The two main trails of lights traveled parallel to one another. One trail consited of two brighter trails and could have been a third trail. It was close to the other trail.

It kinda looked like maybe a triangle, but I couldn&apos;t really tell. It was huge, I would guess maybe a hundred feet or more, depending on how high up it was. It moved really slowly over the tree tops and slowed down as it came over the Ohio River. It looked like it was just looking at the water then it came towards our house. It speeded up and dissapeared over the hill to the back of our house. I&apos;m not really sure of the exact details, but it seemed to have a sphere on the bottom, but like I said it was just a distortion. The reason I think it had a sphere on the bottom(semi-sphere) is the way the stars moved. They got longer and longer, and then seemed to get really close at the middle of the distortion. This is my second Ufo sighting, but I really don&apos;t know what it was. It could have been some strange gas that can stop and move again or a military aircraft that can go invisible. The reason I don&apos;t know if it is or not is because I never heard of anything like this before, but if it was a Ufo, it&apos;s a strange one.

There is a traffic light that you have to stop at immediately on Ventura Blvd. and I noticed what I thought at first was an airplane in the night sky to the front of me and to the right.  But then I thought it was too low and too slow to be an airplane so I pointed it out to my wife and asked her what it was.  Then I noticed that it was very low and very slow and very close, so close that there was no way that it could have been an airplane but it did not look even remotely like a helicopter.  As it got closer it slowed down to a crawl and could make out more of the lights and the shape and it and all of the lights were brilliant white, steady and not pulsating and the object was definitely triangular in shape.  The traffic light turned green and not wanting to lose sight of it, I pulled into the gas station on the corner of Ventura Blvd. and Ventura Pl. and was now looking at it through the windshield of my car as it passed over the rear of the buildings right across the street .  I had rolled down my window to see if I could hear anything and my wife rolled down her window to lean out and look at the object.  Neither of us noticed any sound coming from the object!  It had now come to a complete stop and hovered for just a few seconds and then it accelerated smoothly and turned to its left and departed in a generally north-easterly direction.  I turned right onto Ventura Pl. to keep sight of it and had to stop at a traffic light again as we watched it fly over the TV studio and out of sight.  When first noticed, it would have been near to being over the intersection of Laurel Canyon Blvd. and Ventura Pl..  When it hovered, it looked like it would have been over the buildings between Ventura Pl. and Hoffman St..  When it departed it looked like it flew over the guard shack of the nearby TV studio at Hoffman St. and Radford Ave..  Its direction of travel was almost due east until this point when it started turning! north b efore we lost sight of it over the buildings and trees of the studio.  We went to the guard shack and asked the three security guards in it if they saw the object and none of them did.  It was a cool night and they were all inside.  We noticed that while they had a terrific view of the area where the object flew, their window&apos;s reflections of the brightly lit interior made it very difficult to see outside.  When the object accelerated and turned as it departed, it never wobbled or tilted and did not bank as it turned.  It was like it &quot;skated&quot; away on a perfectly flat surface.  I would guess its speed when last observed to be about 50 mph.  There is a 12 story tall bank building at the corner of Radford Ave. and Ventura Pl. and this object was less than twice its height in altitude.  I would estimate it to have been 200 ft above ground level.  Also using the building as a reference, it think the sides of the object were about 60 ft from tip to tip.  I think the trailing edge was not perfectly straight but may have bowed out or a very shallow point.  There was a bright light near each tip of the triangle but the front tip was not quite as bright or as large as the lights the rear two lights.  There was also two panels of lights near the center that ran parallel to the center-line of the object and were side-by-side to each other.  Later we watched some airplanes taking off from the nearby Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena airport flying overhead and there was no way of confusing them with what we observed.  Our location was around Lat: 34.143, Long: -118.393 according to mapblast.com.  When we got home I checked the weather at the airport and it was was clear, 73% humidity, 49&deg; dewpoint, 58&deg; windchill, 30.08s barometer, N4 wind average, NW20 wind gust and 58&deg; temperature at 20:14 hours.

This cloud bank was massive. A Sony Hi-8mm 72x zoom camcorder was being used to capture the moment when the camera caught a ping from the infrared right in the mid section of the cloud bank. Clouds typically make the camera fuzz out because nothing is there to rebound the focus. The focus was almost immediate. It became evident, real fast, that something was either hiding or being masked in the clouds. It may even have been generating the cloud cover. We guess the initial distance to be about 10km+ from our location. The film captured something of encredible size, perhaps 1500&apos;+ in length and no guess on the height. It appeared to have stuff hanging all over it. The IR was scanned above and below this region and found only the fuzz indication of emptyness, nothing to ping back. I know it sounds crazy, but everyone that sees the clip walks away with their eyes wide open and their mouths dropped open and with a stare.

Watched the shape at a distance move two different directions and then upward back into the cloud bank and disappear.Direction of movement:  West-NW, eventually moved more NW direction until out of view. About 45 minutes later a helicopter came and spot-lighted the vacinity for almost 45 minutes, spotting into the clouds and all around.  Yes, spotting the clouds.  About ten minutes later a fighter flew over, up like a rocket and loop to loop out to the same direction of that being filmed.  Shortly after that, another fighter repeated the path.Duration of sighting:  From about 7:11pm - 7:34 pm  Sound:  Very quiet. As a matter of fact, the birds were not as active.

Also, brief headaches were noted during the same period, but without the freq noise.

It seemed too bright to be a star and appeared to be slowly moving west.  As it moved closer, we were able to see about 3 flashing lights that made us think it might be a small plane.  However, the craft seemed to just stop in the sky.  Then my son said it &quot;took off&quot; at a high rate of speed and disappeared.  Then, once we were closer to home about 10 minutes later (as I was telling my son it was an airplane) I saw about 4 more (the flashing lights made me think they were planes, but then their flight pattern and hovering would say they weren&apos;t).

Then, after about ten minutes, they split again. One advanced northward, and the other remained in a hover mode, perhaps advancing slightly northward.  I then saw a very small light leave the remaining craft, and it fluttered downward erratically, kind of like a spark.As I arrived home, this second craft advanced forward again, and I noticed it was shaped somewhat like a plane, but all the lighting was white and steady.  There were no blinking red and greens that are normally seen on the wing and tail sections of a plane.As I watched it slowly move northward, it appeared not to have a body or shape.

At first I thought it was a star, but since I had been looking at the sky for the past few nights, this &quot;star&quot; seemed out of place.  It was very bright, bluish white, and seemed to twinkle more than than other stars.  It was bigger than the other stars, and didn&apos;t have a star shape.   I went back in the house, and came out about 15 minutes later.  The star was still there... still bright... still flickering.  I dont have a telescope, so I tried looking at this object through binoculars.  While I couldn&apos;t make out any shape, this object was a bright, bluish white light, and I could see red flashes.  I thought I saw what appeared to be other color flashes of blue and green, but those might have been illusions.  I did see clear flashes of red light, however.  Very clear.  I had never seen this in a star, so I sat and watched this object for a good half an hour, both with binoculars and without.  It just sat there.  There were lots of planes out at that hour, and the visibility in that part of the sky was very clear.  I thought maybe it was just a plane flying off into the distance, and figured I would see the light get smaller and smaller and just disappear, but it didn&apos;t.  It maintained the same level of brightness, and the red flashing lights - appearing to come from various areas of the border of the light - were very distinct.  It was definitely an unidentified object to me, so I went into the house again to see if I could locate a telephone number to call and report this.  I didn&apos;t know who to call, so looked on the internet and found your site.  Still not sure of whether to report this, I went back outside.  At that point, what I saw appeared to be gone.I&apos;m still not sure I should be sending this in, but I figured that maybe someone else saw what I saw.  If anyone was looking at the sky tonite, surely they must have seen this.  And if others reported it as well, then numerous reports would only lend to the credibility of the appearance of whatever this was that I saw.I dont need anyone to contact me unless they need other information.  But if there&apos;s someone there who can suggest a better way to look at such objects - e.g., an inexpensive telescope; or, what to do if I should see something like this again, well I would certainly appreciate any information.

When they began toward the house across those five feet, the &quot;space ship&quot; took off at high speed diagonally in the sky and disappeared.

The surrounding area did not have many trees and the sky was mostly visible.  There was no trace.  The girls continued to be clingy for the rest of the night.

(However, my brother and I speculated that this could not be a satellite because it didn&apos;t move enough, it changed colors, and it was in roughly the same spot over a period of about two hours.  Both of us are sure it wasn&apos;t a star--it was too big and moved; however, if forced to guess what this object was, I would have to say a large star whose light was bent by oscillations in the earths atmosphire..is that possible?  I did take several pictures with a manual camera--they are being developed.  I wonder if there is an agency (NASA maybe?) who can scan the pictures, identify the stars, and then tell me what the object is?  Can anyone help me?  Anyone else see this?

Investigator: Dean DeHarpporte, Minnesota MUFON Field Investigator. Time of Sighting: Final stages of dusk, nearly dark (~7:05 PM, 25 minutes after sunset)Weather conditions:  Clear, light wind, temperature near 40 F.Sighting Duration:  Witness 1, ~1 minute, Witness 2, ~1 minuteSighting Location:  -2 miles north of Stillwater, Minnesota on highway 96, intersection with Highway 5.Type of Report:  Witness 1, Close sighting of triangular object. Simultaneously, witness 2 saw several distant lights. Local Evaluation: Witness 1 UFO, CE1 Unexplained. Witness 2 possible CE1, probably airplane lights.Sighting background: The witnesses, a married couple, called the UFO reporting center on the night of the sighting  and witness data was relayed to this investigator in October, 2001. The investigator interviewed the witnesses on 14 November, 2001 for one hour, He did not visit the site of the sighting due to lack of enthusiasm to do so by the witnesses. Each of the 2 witnesses observed different UFOs. It is possible, but not likely, that they were related, since they were several miles apart and their appearance differed radically.    Witness Description:Witness 1.  Male, age middle 30s. Occupation: works at assembly plant in Stillwater. He was strongly impressed by the sighting and talked about &ldquo;nothing else&rdquo; that night with witness 2, his wife. However, he was not traumatized. He has not spoken about the sighting except for a few people close to him until the interview with the investigator.  No previous or subsequent UFO sightings. Witness was in good health with good eyesight. The witness did not have any particular interest in UFOs and had not read any books on the subject before his sighting.Witness 2.  Female, age early-middle 30s, wife of Witness 1. Works in local area. Witness is apparently in good physical condition. Eyesight, hearing are good. Witness was excited about the sighting (even 6 months later) but did not describe any symptoms of trauma. No previous or subsequent UFO sightings. The witness did not have any particular interest in UFOs and had not read any books on the subject before her sighting. She has done some reading after the sighting. Sighting Account.The witnesses were driving east on Rt. 96 near the intersection with highway 5 in a rural area 1-2 miles north of  Stillwater, MN ( ~22 miles east of St. Paul.)  The landscape is gently rolling comprised of  crop fields and wooded areas. It was nearly dark, but some light remained in the sky, which was clear. Witness 1, Object description.. Sitting on the passenger side of the car the witnesses were traveling in, witness 1 noticed a lighted, triangular object to his right. The object appeared to be about 250 ft on a side. The witness reported the triangle was equalateral, though his (inexact) drawing shows it as isosceles. It was not possible to discern a texture to the surface of the object. A bright white light was at each apex of the triangle underneath the craft. The lights were not bright enough to illuminate the ground beneath the craft. There was also a red light in the center of the bottom of the triangle, less bright than the white lights, which blinked about once per second. There were no other lights on the object and no windows, orifices or other surface features were visible. The color of the object was black, but not the same color as the stealth aircraft. The object produced no sound, although the witness did not get out of the car. No other witnesses are known to have observed the object. Position, movement and duration. The nearest surface of the object was approximately at a 60 degree angle from the ground when the craft was at its lowest altitude. When first seen the object was about 400 ft above ground but moved down &ldquo;quite rapidly&rdquo; to about 150 ft and hovered for several seconds, then rose up to about 400 ft. There was no apparent lateral motion of the object. The car was moving about 45 mph but slowed to 10-15 mph immediately upon sighting of the object. The object was last seen to the rear of the car and disappeared when the car got too far away for the witness to see it. The duration of the sighting was about 1 minute. Witness 2, the driver, did not see the object because she was concentrating on driving.Drawing of object. When he came home the witness made drawing of the object (Fig. 1) which looked substantially the same as the drawing he made during the investigation. The original drawing was lost. After the sighting, he read some UFO literature, including accounts of the triangular objects seen in Belgium in the early 90s. as shown in Figure 1.                                                                                                                                                                                               2 of 2Figure 1. Object viewed from below at its lowest altitude.                             Sighting evaluation: CE1. The object described is similar to the description of many triangular objects seen worldwide for the past 20 years. There is no conventional explanation apart from the possibility that the craft was an advanced military aircraft. However, current known technology is not consistent with a craft capable of hovering and moving rapidly vertically upward and downward without engine noise. Witness 2 Object description. Witness 2 observed two white lights, separated by the width of her thumb at arms length directly in front of her (toward the east). The lights were estimated to be 15 miles away (though she emphasized the uncertainty of this estimate), and were seen at the same time as witness 1 observed the triangular object to his right. Witness 1 also observed the two lights, but not closely, since he was occupied with observing the triangular object to his right. Witness 2 estimated the size of the lights to be about 1/8th the diameter of the moon and the brightness as brighter than a streetlight. Based on the inverse square law, this would mean the lights were more than 225 times the intrinsic brightness of a streetlight. As far as she could tell the object was not illuminating the ground. No other witnesses are known to have observed the lights. Position, movement, and duration.  Witness 2 estimated that the object was about 20 degrees above the ground. This would make the altitude of the lights about 6 miles (~31,000 ft). The lights appeared motionless for about 1 minute, then moved downward rapidly until they disappeared below the tree-lined horizon about 3 seconds after they began their descent. The calculated speed of movement was 7200 mph. The lights disappeared at about the same time as witness 1 lost sight of the triangular object. The witnesses observed airplanes in the vicinity but witness 2 was adamant that the lights she saw were not conventional aircraft. The nearest airport is 9 miles to the southwest, 135 degrees to the right of (behind) the direction where the objects were sighted. There are no airports within at least 40 miles to the east of the sighting location. Additional lights. During the time the 2 lights were hovering, they emitted 2 smaller lights which circled downward and back up and joined with the primary light a few seconds after they appeared. The witness had no estimate of the speed of these lights and said they were not quite as bright as the primary lights. Sighting Evaluation: Probably conventional aircraft. If the object size was 1/8th the apparent diameter of the moon and 15 miles away, it would have been a very large object, indeed. At 225 times the brightness of a streetlight, it would also have been exceedingly bright. The downward speed of 7200 mph is also extraordinary. The lack of other witnesses or press coverage of such a remarkable object as well as the inexperience of the witness and the well known difficulty in judging distances of lights in the sky causes the investigator to believe that the lights were probably much closer than estimated and thus much smaller and less bright. Despite the lack of an airport in the direction of the sighting, the presence of a major airport, MSP, 30 miles west of the sighting causes the investigator to believe that the lights could very possibly have been attached to aircraft. However, there is not enough information to make an unambiguous judgment.", "A bright flash illuminated a third of the sky originating from a point like a star.All I can remember is that my cousin and I were looking up at the sky at approximately 10:30.We were noting the constellations, when all of a sudden a bright flash illuminated about a third of the sky. The flash originated from a small point , but appeared to &quot;grow&quot; from it. We became very terrified and ran home. I will always remember it because it happened the same evening as the 7.1 Loma Preita earthqauke.", "Large triangular shaped object with large blue lights suddenly makes quick u-turn and then hovers miles away.My husband and I were driving and as we approached an intersection near a small airport, there was this large triangular shaped object (very close to the ground) slowly moving over the intersection.  As we got closer to it, it had three large blue lights (one in each corner).  About 30 ft from it, it suddenly raised up and made a fast u-turn.  In less than 5 seconds it was gone, quickly heading the other way.  About 3 miles from the intersection, my husband and I looked back and it seemed to be a hovering bright light at or near the airport.  The strangest thing about the whole ordeal was there was no sound at all.  (Note: There was a car about 2 car-lengths in front of us.  I am pretty sure they saw it too.  Believe me, you couldn&apos;t miss it.)", "5 minute video of ufo siting showing shape and lightsI have approx 5 minutes of video of an orange round bright light(zoomed), it had six smaller lights illuminating around it. from a distance without the camera you could see the outline of the saucer. Zoomed in on the saucer you could see the small lights and 1 bright orange color light that would get brighter and bigger and then fade away into nothing but then would come back again. The saucer was coming toward my direction and once I was filming it remained in the same spot. After filming I got in my car and was traveling east. As I was moving it was moving east also. I stopped at a friend&apos;s house and she also saw the red/orange color light and the outline of the saucer. It remained in the same spot. I got back in my car approximately 10 minutes later headed back west to my home. The light was still there but in a different location and further away.", "Seven to nine lights moving slowly around one another in more of a vertical formationWas driving in a car with my friend&apos;s friends (I was visiting from out of town) when I saw a cluster of seven to nine lights in a vertical formation, a bit like an enlongated oval.  They were moving slowly around each other in no particular pattern.  I yelled &quot;ufo&quot; and pointed to them, but everyone just said &quot;yeah, we know, they&apos;ve been there for days&quot;.  I tried to find out more information but no one wanted to talk about it.  I couldn&apos;t believe their reaction; nor understand it.  It&apos;s been many years since that happened.  I don&apos;t know the exact month or day.  Even the year is in question.  It could have been late 1980 or early/mid 1981.  I&apos;ve never forgotten that incident, however and have often wondered if the source of those lights had been discovered.  Could it have been weather balloons, satellites?  If they had been there for days and those people in the car had known of them, then others in that town must have seen them too.  I looked all through your data base but didn&apos;t find anything reported that was similar either in Nova Scotia or around the same date.  Have never seen anything since and would like to hear of any similar sightings.((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

The siting is within 20 miles of Chicago&apos;s Ohare airport and planes were also visible at this time and were significantly different.  THere was no mistaking the siting as being a plane and given its low altitude with no sound, I would tend to discount a helicopter.

It approached the ground at about a 75 degree angle.  I would compare the size of the object from about one quarter, to one half the size of the moon.  Just before hitting the ground, the object apparently burned out.  Distance was approx from .5 to 1 mile away.  We called 911 and notified the Sheriff&apos;s Dept, told them we had seen an object fall from the sky, but that there was no explosion or impact from what we could tell.  The easiest thing I can compare it to would be anti-aircraft fire, when seen from night vision.

A arch-weld like beam attached between the two objects, than the second objects popped back to the first object, and once again popped out. The second object moved 4 fingers away, and stopped suddenly. A third object came travelling from east, and stopped a 10 finger distance from the first object. The second object then began zig-zagging around first object and moved up-ward, between first and third object. The second object continued west over the sky, passing across big-dipper. The first object took of south, and the third object returned east, where it originally came from. This took approx.5-10 minutes. We biked to our friends home and got a binocular, and my friend said he could se the second object which was going west, dissapear behind a few clouds on a otherwise clear and bright night-sky. This took place within 20 min. After this experience, I biked home on a lonely country highway. Very frightened. At one point I could feel electricity in the air around me. I bet my hair was charged up on top of my head. I just took one short look at a bright star on the sky infront of me biking south, but was to scared to look again.

PD))", "This encounter consisted of a brief sighting of several fireballs and related streaks seemingly flying in formation.On the evening of December 1, 2001, my mother (54) and I (35) were walking our dogs when we observed an unusual aerial phenomenon.  With the exception of some high, thin clouds, the sky was clear; major constellations, such as Orion, were plainly visible.  As we were walking north on Yale Road in Richardson, Texas, between its intersections with Blake and Linda Lanes, we observed a formation of two large fireballs in the sky to the north, perhaps twenty-five to thirty degrees above the horizon, apparently accompanied by several smaller streaks of light.  They moved across the sky from west to east, at a speed similar to that of an airplane; I got the impression that they were quite distant.  One of the two larger fireballs was slightly higher than and ahead of the other; the smaller streaks, which were very faint, lay between and behind the two.  Another thin streak seemed to lead the leading fireball a small distance. I got the impression that the fireball was attached to the thin streak leading it.  No such phenomenon was observed for the lower, trailing fireball.  The entire formation was moving at a very slight angle to the ground, only a few degrees at best; it seemed almost parallel to the ground.  We observed it only briefly before it passed behind some trees and was lost.  The presence of nearby streetlamps also affected our ability to view it more clearly.  We heard no unusual sounds during the experience.During the sighting I noticed at least one aircraft pass nearby, so there may have been other sightings of this phenomenon as well.The large fireballs themselves each consisted of a large, luminous head trailed by thick contrails of smoke or vapor.  The were primarily white, but toward the end of the sighting seemed to sputter briefly red/orange, then green.  The other, faint streaks may have been smaller fireballs.Let me stress that I am certain that these were not conventional aircraft.  We live relatively near both Dallas Love Field and the Dallas/Fort Worth airport (one of the busiest airports in the world), so we see planes constantly, and are familiar with their night-time appearance.  Neither do I believe that they were alien interstellar craft.  I thought at first that they were some sort of burning objects being towed by small aircraft, given the faint streak I saw preceding one of the fireballs.  However, I saw no running lights that would indicate the streak was an airplane.At the moment, I believe that the most likely explanation is that we saw a large meteor in the process of breaking up.  The annual Leonids meteor shower occured just two weeks ago.  In this scenario, the fireballs were portions of the meteor that included low-density icy or organic materials (common to the Leonids, which are fragments of Comet Swift-Tuttle, if I&apos;m not mistaken), while the faint streaks were smaller, rockier fragments.  This would explain the impression that they were flying in formation.  The sputtering and vapor trails would have been caused by outgassing as the objects burned up in the atmosphere.  However, this explanation fails to explain why it was moving so slowly, or why it passed across the sky at such a shallow angle.  I do know a small asteroid has been observed to do this before bouncing out of the atmosphere (in 1974), and that there is theory that hundreds of mini-comets burn up in the Earth&apos;s atmosphere daily.  Clearly, I prefer to consider this a natural phenomenon.Other possibilities -- that this was indeed several planes towing burning objects (but why?) or we witnessed some sort of government experiment.  The latter theory seems overused an unlikely.  Why test something near a major population center.  I suppose it could also have been a satellite burning up in the asteroid, or even the space shuttle, except the next shuttle mission is on hold for the moment.No, I&apos;m not an astronomer, though I am very interested in astronomy.  I am a technical writer with degrees in history and anthropology, and I worked for more than five years as a professional archeologist.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness is describing the re-entry event that occurred at approximately 2120 hrs.

This was at the intersection of State Route 188 and State Route 674, going up a hill towards the small berg of Ringold. Puzzled by what the objects were, I continued driving down Rt. 188 for about four or five minutes before the objects reappeared in the middle of a cirrus cloud. This time, the objects were in the formation of a triangle, except that there was a fourth light off to the right side. Again, they only lasted for a few seconds in the sky before they dissappeared, only to return, in the same formation, minus the extra light to one side about two minutes later.

I first assumed that this was normal air traffic (probably around 30-35 degrees above the northern horizon)  but it was moving slower than what I thought was normal.  After a couple of minutes, I turned my head away for a couple of seconds and when I looked back at the light, there was a second light, white and not as bright moving from appx west to east at a faster, but not very fast speed. Had this been a 2-D screen, the second light would have been slightly below the red light.  It did not seem to be moving fast enough for me NOT to have seen it before I turned my head, i.e. it seemed to appear from nowhere.   After about 30 seconds, the white light just went out.  This got me kind of excited and I continued to watch the red light which never blinked as much as it sort of flickered, now much closer to my location still moving VERY slowly.  At times it seemed as though the light had come to a stop.  As it continued moving toward to the south (now about 45 degrees off the horizon) I realized that it had become more copperish orange in color.  I am almost sure that it came to a stop and then began moving more easterly.  It moved very slowly for maybe 20 seconds before in dimmed to the brightness of a dim star and then went out.  I kept looking for about 2 more minutes before I decided it was not going to reappear and I had to go back inside (I was at work and was watching from the first floor roof of my job site, taking my coffee break checking out the sky as I always do on my overnight shift.)  The moon was somewhat overhead and could be seen fairly clearly through a thin clould layer.  There was a slight ring around it and I could see a bright star, actually probably the planet Jupiter through this same thin cloud layer.  There was a slight band of heavier clouds between the moon and where I saw the lights but I am 90% sure that the lights did not disappear behind any clouds.((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION)) The red (to orange)light moved in a straight line until just before it disappeared when it appeared to stop for a moment or two and then began heading east. (Again, the very slow speed of the object was, to me, very strange and what really kept my attention.)  I agree that a white light moving slowly and then disappearing, under other conditions, would beg to be labeled a satellite, but the conditions at thislocation, in that direction and under these weather conditions was not right for a satellite.  One of my hobbies on weekend nights, when I do not work is to sit in my backyard and hope to see meteors.  I have seen many satellites and I would bet the farm that this was not one.  This light, though not blinding was at least as bright as Jupiter, considering that Jupiter was dimmed somewhat by the icy haze in the air.  It seemed too low in the sky to have been a satellite and the fact that it appeared so suddenly and so close to the red light (probably two to three fingers width at arms length &quot;lower&quot; than the red light) was at best very coincidental.  The location I was at is just not conducive to seeing satellites.  One cannot even see stars that low in the sky facing north.  Its just too close to downtown Tulsa.  Too much light. Of course, I could be wrong.

Where I made the sighting is about one or two miles west of the lake, as the crow flies, and about five miles east of the Woodlake city limits. It was dusk, about 8:30pm as I rounded a bend that led to the winding road through the foothills. There are two peaks about 500ft+ tall with a small valley between them. As I drove by I glanced up and noticed what looked to be a large water tank setting in the valley between the two peaks with red and green lights, alternated around the upper most rim. They were lit. I could see the curvature of the upper rim. I noticed what appeared to be the seams between the panels used to make the wall of the tank. In retrospect, it must have been huge because it filled over 50% of the space between the two peaks. I could not see the bottom of it as it was hidden behind the crest of the hill between the peaks. As I drove I said to myself, &quot; Hum! I&apos;ve been through here hundreds of times and have never seen that tank before&quot;, then it hit me there can&apos;t be any tank up there. I was meeting people at the lake and was in a hurry so didn&apos;t turn back to investigate. I purposed to come back the next day on the way home and sure enough it was gone; I have never seen it since. No one else from the area that I have talked to has seen anythig like it before but I am told there is an old Indian grave yard up there in the same vicinity. One lady from Woodlake told me she has seen a cigar shapped UFO in the area before. As far as I know there are no access roads up thereh except a few dirt fire roads.

The one on the left seemed to be wavering alot, veering towards the other two and behaving much more eratically. Then a fourth one came from below and shot off at hight speed to the right(North).

Anyway the AF jets shot these UFO&apos;s out of the sky or else were shooting at them and driving them away....my memory is vague but my sister is still alive and can give anyone more details concerning them. This leads me to believe that there could perhaps have been many encounters that our government has had with UFO&apos;s through the years and have shot them down for nation security purposes.I do not know the exact date of this, but i believe it to be in the summer sometime between 1955 and 1957.

We stopped the truck (expecting to see a plane crash) and I opened the truck door and looked right at the two lights and then saw four to six more identical lights appear in succession to the left and below the second light, almost evenly spaced and forming a semi circle as the last one or two lights appeared heading back to the right. The light positions remained static, with no change or movement, and the lights remained steady with no flickering. As I grabbed my camera, all of the lights disappeared. It all happened very quickly. The lights were much bigger and brighter than any star and we saw several airplanes as we continued our trip and none of the plane lights remotely resembled what we saw.

However, last night I saw something which I cannot explain.  As I was walking my dog at 2:55 a.m. (this is not my custom, but I had fallen asleep on the sofa earlier), I looked up to the sky to see if I might get lucky and see a straggling meteor from the Leonid showers of November 18th.  The night was clear and calm, without a cloud in the sky.  A beautiful, starry autumn night in Florida.  Suddenly, I noticed a glowing pale orange &quot;shape&quot; rapidly moving across the sky from west to east, very faint so as to be barely discernable.  I couldn&apos;t see an actual body per se (such as an aircraft), just the unbroken shape of orange light which seemed almost translucent, as if I could still see the stars through the shape.  The shape was somewhat like a boomerang or chevron, except the leading edge was straight across (as opposed to &quot;V&quot; shaped on this front edge).  It was perfectly symmetrical across its width.  I have difficulty determining the true size or speed, because I couldn&apos;t judge the altitude.  However, I observed it across a radius of approximately 100-120 degrees and it covered this distance in approximately 5-7 seconds.  This seemed to be an unbelievable rate of speed.  The object made no sound at all, moving with absolute silence which defied my mind&apos;s ability to comprehend.  The moon was not visible but if it were, I would judge the width of the object to be about 5 or 6 times a full moon&apos;s diameter.  The length of the object from front to rear was perhaps 1X a full moon&apos;s diameter.  It bothers me that I will probably never know any answers to this event.  I only know what I saw and am 100% convinced that the object was not a natural phenomenon such as a meteor or a cloud.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness, and we found him to be exceptionally credible.

I woke my mom and we grabbed our jackets and headed outside.After about 20-25 minutes or so, my mom went inside to grab some lawn chairs...looking up at the sky hurts your neck!  Meanwhile, I was searching the heavens for more meteors.  The weather was nice, but there was a bit of fog coming in from the coast.  It was then that I saw the triangular shaped object moving silently against the night sky.As an amatuer backyard astronomer, I am very familiar with the sky...meteors...comets, satellites and the like...and I know that what I saw was nothing of the sort.  It appeared to have three &quot;lights&quot; with one in each corner. I put &quot;lights&quot; in quotes because they were not like any kind of lights I have ever seen on a familiar aircraft.  Most planes and such have sharp, crisp looking lights.  However, the lights on this craft were diffused...more like a glow.  They were of an amber-red color and were large and round.  They appeared to be directly under the craft and not on the sides.I have no idea how high up it was, but it did not appear to be flying at a high altitude. I followed it as it traveled in a straight line until I lost it.  Unlike other people&apos;s posts, this craft did not stop and turn abrubtly, but just continued on a straight path.  I lost it in the sky because the object itself was very dark.  Without the reflection of the city lights, I probably would not have been able to see it at all! I do not know what I saw that night, but I am of the mentality that it was some sort of government craft.  In this day and age of terrorism, I do not believe that there is a way for ANY kind of foreign craft to be in our atmosphere without the government descending on it instantly and without everyone hearing about it.

The formation they were flying was similar to a Less Than sign (&lt;).  They were traveling from N.W. to S.E., and being a pilot myself, I would guestemate around 40,000 feet.  The sky was clear.  I watched them from about a 60 degree sky position from my right side, to about a 30 degree sky position on my left side.  They flew virtually overhead.  I saw no other lights, nothing flashing, just the steady bronze color.  I heard no sounds from them, but at that altitude you probably wouldn&apos;t.  There were no trailing streams of light coming from them.  I know the Leonid Meteor shower has been going on, but with meteor showers, the light goes extremely fast, has a trail of light, and is generally really bright.  These lights could not be meteors.

I really thought they were balloons, did not pay a ton of attention until the group of 8 divided and 3 zipped over the hill, in a SW direction and the others zipped in an Easterly direction.

Intermixed within the sparks and blue rivers of light were many round shapes which were in reds and greens.  These objects held formation.  The blue streams of light appeared to be approx.1/2 mi long though it was difficult to judge the size as it may have been very large and far away even thought it appreared to be very low and close.

This was preceded by two small light sources that looked like the eyes of the craft.  We were unable to make out any structure and could only clearly see the streams of light.  The light coming from &quot;the eyes&quot; was very contained and had no light between them and the craft, and the light source did not create a beam.  They appeared to be totally independent.

The night was very clear, and I looked up at the night sky to see if there would be any remnants of the previous evening&apos;s Leonid meteor shower. After about 5 minutes (@2:30 am) my eye caught a motion in the northern sky (about 70 degrees), and I saw an object or group of objects traveling directly south. At first I thought it was a group of birds flying very close in a wedge or v-shaped formation, but as I stared, I&apos;m certain that I could see a single solid wedge shape, with what appeared to be large grey bumps (possibly the same color as the object, but as if they were reflecting ambient city light). I estimate there were 5 to 6 bumps on the object. I watched quite closely to see if the object passed between my sight and any stars in the sky, and it appeared to &quot;blank&quot; out a few stars as it passed. In very quick order, I first thought they were birds; when I suspected a single wedge object, what came to mind was a stealth-type bomber (B2 or F-117A). The object appeared to be cruising at approx 500 - 1000 ft, and I suspect the &quot;wingspan&quot; was 100 - 150 feet. I can&apos;t estimate how fast it was traveling. It took a straight course from north to south, and I believe it passed in and out of my vision within less than 10 seconds. As I watched, I crossed further into the yard to clear the trees, and watched as the object simply faded from sight into the night sky, never changing course. I was struck by how completely silent the object was, and the night was very quiet (not unusually quiet; traffic could be heard in the distance, bird was heard afterward). If it weren&apos;t for the extreme quiet and lack of any engine glow or lighting, I would simply suspect it to be a craft from Miramar AFB (and I still think it may be).

I could see the bottom of it enough to make out something like landing gear or lights or something on the bottom, but it was dark. There were no lights at all. The only reason I saw it at all was because I happened to be looking at the sky in the middle of a city and well-lit apartment complex by a major street.

She went outside ahead of me, while I grabbed a quick glass of water for the road. It was about 2134 CST on May 18, 2001.A few seconds later she yelled for me to hurry and take a look at something which was moving slowly almost directly overhead in the sky (which was clear). I stepped out of the doorway and looked up. What we saw for the next 6 minutes is as follows: A large object almost directly overhead, slightly east of our position, which was at a point just west of Interstate 35W and just south of US Highway 10 in Mounds View, Minnesota, USA. As I have been trained in this area, I estimated this object to be at an altitude of somewhere between 8000 to 10000 feet. The object first appeared as an oddly shaped rectangle though roundish on the bottom, with a deep-orange seemingly pulsating or shimmering underbelly, similar to a liquid metal appearance, with what appeared to be brighter orange highlites (which appeared as possibly tubular openings) in the front end which I viewed just prior to it passing overhead, which then hid those frontal features. It also appeared to have a halo, or jellyfish type of bubble on the top of the object well above the shimmering orange bottom.It was moving very slowly from the east to the west/northwest, and made no sound, and no other lights of any kind were visible, though its general shape seemed to ebb as its orange underside was unstable as it was pulsating slowly.As this was something that I have never witnessed before, it seemed significant enough for me to dash inside to grab my video camera, and I  was fortunate enough to tape nearly two minutes of this object.After taping this object for nearly a minute, I was surprised to see that another object seemed to be released from the main object and zip away from it fairly quickly, with this splitting visible in the frames prior to my nervous jerking of the camera to get a better angle as it was moving behind trees. Within seconds, the object released an additional two (possibly three) objects which are clearly visible on the tape. These objects seemed to fall in a downward motion though they could have been moving into the distance. One object is shown to fall off vertically behind trees while it suddenly reappears a second later moving horizontally and completely disappearing a few seconds later. This also is clearly visible.During this second release of smaller objects, there was no apparent change in the main object&apos;s structure, though it seemed with the naked eye to dim slightly after the release.About thirty seconds later, the main object then split into two major sections and the sped off in opposite trajectories from each other though in a seemingly downward motion in relation to the camera&apos;s angle, which was pointed upward at an approximate 45 degree angle in relation to the ground. The objects then disappeared from view behind trees.I have estimated that in relation to the camera&apos;s angular position, that this object split apart in the vicinity of Coon Rapids, Anoka, or Champlin, Minnesota, or in that general region, to the northwest of Mounds View.There were at least three witnesses from our location: myself, my twenty-year old sister, and my forty-nine year old then roommate, who only saw the object briefly. I yelled for another individual who had been entering his vehicle a half-block away to look, but the person either didn&apos;t understand or didn&apos;t fully hear me trying to get his attention.My personal credentials include military service in the United States Army as an MOS 16T10 (Patriot Missile). As this is an Air Defense position, I was specifically trained to spot and identify all known types of aircraft and other flying objects (balloons, missiles, drones, military flares, meteorological phenomona, etc.). Despite my background, I have no experience with the object I witnessed this particular evening. I can personally attest to the facts presented herein, and can faithfully presume that it was not an aircraft, nor a &quot;shooting star&quot; (meteorite), nor a military flare, and certainly not a weather balloon (the wind was blowing from the west to east at about 10-15 mph yet the object was moving east to west/northwest -into the wind). Additionally, the sun had already set, yet the object was luminescent or emitting its own light on the side not facing the sunset.At the same time that this object was sighted, I did notice a high-flying commercial jetliner that was flying from west to east at an approximate altitude of 36,000 feet, and was visible from its exhaust contrail.In terms of its possible size, I would judge this object as it first appeared overhead to be the size of between a 747-400 and a C-5A military transport aircraft. The object certainly was well below the altitude of the high-flying commercial jet which was moving in the opposite direction.To describe its size in a simple form, if you basically stretched both arms over your head and put two thumbs (and possibly another half of one thumb) next to each other, that&apos;s the size it appeared at its closest point.I wanted to share this story with your investigators and the general public because I felt that it was significant enough to warrant further investigation to determine what the object could possibly have been, and as to whether there were other witnesses ( which I have noticed that there was another sighting in the St. Paul, Minnesota suburb of Hastings about 2 hours previous to mine with a similar description) and if there have been other similar sightings with similar object behavioral characteristics.There has been some local investigation by the Minnesota MUFON network field investigator, and he is apparently still putting the finishing touches on his report.I am highly interested in knowing if your organization has connections to those who may have experience with video tapes, and who would be interested in examining the tape to determine the light source evident on it, and possibly enhancing the tape to show more detail.Thank you for your efforts regarding this.In closing, I would also like to share that within a few days of this sighting, I made attempts to get local media coverage of this sighting. Copies of the tape were made in the studios of KARE 11 (NBC affiliate), WCCO 4 (CBS affiliate), and KSTP 5 (ABC affiliate). None of the organizations returned any information regarding the sighting for a possible story, which I find highly unusual.I also contacted the local air traffic control center, which is a major regional center located in Farmington, Minnesota. They told me to contact the control tower at MSP (Minneapolis/St. Paul International). I spoke to a supervisor (whose name I&apos;ll give if needed) there regarding possible radar tapes from that evening to see if an object was sighted, but was told a few days later that nothing unusual was on those tapes.I am also interested in what local television weather radar, NWS radar, and NOAA weather radar scans show for that specific time period on 18 May 01.Thank you once again.", "a bright colored lite appeard in the sky, to the left of the big dipper/ It would change colors and had bright flashes of light behind it, kind of like lighting or a strobe light was behind it.

My brother-in-law was familiar with similar sightings and drew our attention to it. It was blinking at a steady rate (not like a natural star), and not moving. After a moment, it began to move slowly through the sky. Unlike a satellite, or aircraft, this light was moving erratically through the sky: left, right, up and down - very abrupt movements. The movements were at times slow, others fast with no apparent pattern. It would come to a complete stop for as long as 5 minutes. It would begin as a single blinking light (white), and then would appear as two lights, regardless of the direction it was moving, and then back to a single light. When it would move quickly, the lights appeared orange-red in color, when stationary, white. At times, the lights would be synchronized, others alternating. Viewing through binoculars, I was unable to determine the shape (I would try to focus on brighter stars behind it to determine if they were two separate craft, or one when the two lights appeared. It did appear to be a deeper black in between the two lights, but it was too difficult to hold the binoculars still enough to determine for sure). However, when the lights were brightest and blinking, it appeared that it might possibly be triangular in shape from the way the light would reflect out. The size of the lights would change giving the appearance that the craft was moving farther into space and then descending again. There was absolutely no sound in the quiet countryside to lead us to believe that this was a commercial jet, or aircraft of some kind.

One thing that was interesting though is that there seemed to be nothing in between us and it.  It was above the trees.  It stopped when we both were looking up at it.  It felt like it was looking at us too--the strangest feeling.  It must have hung in the sky for about 2 or 3 seconds.  Then it took off at an amazing speed away from us.  It kind of went away at an angle,but once it made its move away from us, it was completely out of view in about 2 seconds.  It didn&apos;t just disappear though (as if it had turned out the lights), we could see the trail of it leaving and it was getting smaller, but then it was gone on this perfectly clear night.  Thi! s whole event took about 8-10 seconds.  It was simply fascinating.  Never had either of us even thought about such an event happening.  We did not feel that we were in harm though and look forward to sitting in those same chairs another night looking for its return.((NUFORC Note:  Both witnesses hold jobs that require considerable formal, college education.

PD))", "Slow-flying crescent made up of lots of little balls flies over downtown SeattleWhile observing the meteor storm from my decidedly bad vantage point (inner city, facing northwest), I noticed a slow-moving object high up in the sky.  The object was crescent-shaped, colored a medium grey (judging by the color reflected from the city lights below), and seemed to have a texture like it was made from dozens of small balls or spheres.It flew very slowly from north-northeast to south-southwest, and was accompanied by a very faint rumbling, engine-like noise which I could make out over the normal nighttime sounds of downtown Seattle.  Once it was nearly overhead, it turned slowly west and faded from view, and the rumbling noise faded away with it.The size was approximately that of a thumbnail held at arm&apos;s length, and it flew with the rounded portion of the crescent shape aimed forward.  There were no light emitters of any type visible on it.Its height could not be accurately estimated; I have only the amplitude of its &quot;engine&quot; noise to base any guess upon.  And if I tried to guess using only that, it would have been at least 5,000 feet in altitude.I&apos;m on the approach path for commercial airliners, and I know what they look and sound like from varying distances.  This was *not* a commercial flight.According to my handheld GPS, I&apos;m located at 47&deg;36&apos;23N by 122&deg;19&apos;51W.  This is in downtown Seattle near the monorail terminus.This is the first of three unidentifyable objects I will be reporting on tonight.Incidentally, from my decidedly poor vantage point, highly restricted viewable area, and severe light pollution conditions, I still observed approximately 150 meteors between 1am &amp; 4am; with only one being very substantial. The projectile itself glowed an eye-piercing whitish violet and was surrounded by a darker violet coma; and the long tail was green &amp; white with violet &amp; blue-violet along its edges.  It&apos;s a fair guess it left some elements in our upper atmosphere that aren&apos;t even on the periodic table yet.  All but three of the meteors I saw were Leonids.", "slowly arching light brightens into flame then trails into oblivionmy wife and i were returning home from an outing.  it was approximately 7:30 p.m.  i had gotten my sleepy daughter from the back, passenger side child seat.  i love to view the night skies.  i was standing in the driveway looking upward, as i usually do when arriving back home at night.  i noticed that from the west, from up over the roof from the back side of our home, a very brilliant fireball/reddish looking light.  i at first thought it may have been a satellite because of the slower-than-a-falling-star motion and the way it arched across the sky.  i commented out loud as to how unusual that was.  (my wife doesn&apos;t get into that kind of stuff like i do)  i watched it trail almost directly overhead in an easterly direction then slightly bank.  it still continued in an easterly direction but the color changed to a very brilliant red and seemed to either be on fire or reflecting the sun, considering it&apos;s apparent altitude.  i have studied aircraft for years and had even started pilot training several years ago.  (ran out of money)  i would judge the altitude to be something upwards of 50,000 ft.  it initially appeared to be a satellite.  i watched it seem to leave a &apos;dust&apos; trail as it slowly seemed to burn up.  perhaps it could have been a deliberate attempt to destroy some &apos;space junk&apos;.  i&apos;m not sure.  i thought that it would be unusual to &apos;destroy&apos; a satellite in that manner, though probably not completely out of the question.  the entire viewing pleasure lasted approximately 7-15 seconds.  who knows.  perhaps there were more sets of eyes that had the privilege of seeing the abnormality, as well.", "Light Formation over Kansas CityI&apos;m hesitant to report this, as I&apos;m not completely convinced the objects we saw weren&apos;t conventional aircraft (helicopters), but am reporting it for confirmation in case someone else does as well. Last night at 10:20 PM I was carrying groceries in from the car when I noticed several bright points of light in the sky overhead that appeared to be moving in a westward direction towards me. As there is a lot of conventional air traffic overhead at night I didn&apos;t pay much attention at first until I noticed that they seemed to be flying in formation; not a V pattern or anything like that (they were all over the sky in no pattern), but in tandem with each other (they maintained roughly the same distance from each other as they crossed the sky). That night was very cold and the wind was blowing from the west. There was also heavy cloud cover that frequently obscured the lights for 15-20 seconds (at times I could not see all of them at the same time, and by the end of the incident cloud cover had thickened to obscure all of the lights). At first I thought they were just stars, as the moving clouds gave the appearance of the movement of stationary objects behind them, and indeed some of them were (as I watched closely I noticed that they didn&apos;t really move). However, even as the clouds moved I could see some lights that seemed to move while others didn&apos;t, and at least three of the seven lights I saw moved across the entire sky from the far horizon to directly above the eaves of my townhouse where they were finally obscured.When I first saw them it looked strange enough that I called into the house for my girlfriend to come out and see them also (approximately 10:23). As we watched I tried to verify that the lights were actually moving by looking at them and a stationary object overhead and visually measuring the distance between them. At first I used the moon, as it was the only stationary object close enough in sight, but later I was able to use the eaves of the house as well. The objects looked like large, very bright stars (single blue-white lights just like stars but they didn&apos;t twinkle or blink; no red or green lights were visable at any time). They slowly moved across the sky, from east to west against the very strong (at least at ground and cloud level) wind, and at times seemed to change speed. As they got closer to directly overhead, the lights stopped and hovered in place for 2-3 minutes before starting to move again in the same direction, then quickly disappeared behind a very thick cloudbank and were obscured completely. As it was very cold with the wind chill and I was in short sleeves and still holding 25 pounds of frozen chickens and bottled water I decided not to wait and see if they were still there when the clouds cleared; the cloud cover was very thick by then and it didn&apos;t look like it was going to break anytime in the next several minutes. My girlfriend and I went through the townhouse and she went out the back door to see if they were visable, but said they weren&apos;t (the clouds were too thick). I went into the kitchen, where the clock said 10:37; earlier I had just come out of the kitchen and was going back to the car when I saw the lights which is how I knew it was 10:20.As I mentioned, I am hesitant to report this as nothing happened which would preclude an optical illusion (stars and moving clouds) and some conventional aircraft (helicopters) being responsible for the incident. However, it seemed strange that so many craft (helicopters or otherwise) would be moving so slowly in apparent formation over Kansas City against a very strong wind at that time of night, and that none of them looked like anything more than very bright stars. I have reported one other incident, a non-incident actually in Lawrence where a strange appearing (but conventional) aircraft flew overhead similar to an earlier report from the same area in Lawrence.", "Second sighting from the same general ground location, though not in the same location in the sky.I had previously reported spotting a black object flying very low and very fast over Winchester Road after dawn on 11/02/01. I had absolutely no expectation of seeing another unusual object in the sky, and yet that is precisely what occurred this morning.My account has two parts, so please bear with me.Part I: Leaving for work at 5:28 a.m., I stepped into my garage and hit the button to lift the door. (I looked at the digital clock just before I stepped out.) Moving alongside my car after the door was up, I saw the newspaper in our driveway and decided to pick it up before I left. Before I made it to the driveway, however, a very definite and very well-defined and lengthy shadow flitted across the driveway and our front lawn. There was absolutely no sound associated with the passing of this shadow. I&apos;m not the nervous type, but the shadow startled me so that I jumped into my car instead of going out to pick up the paper. I&apos;d never seen anything like this before. It was still quite dark, but a street light illuminates our entire yard to a certain extent. My first impression was that something huge had flown beneath the street light and cast the shadow. This explanation was quickly discarded due to the physical impossibility of such an event, but I was puzzled by what I saw. It appeared that our cat had been startled as well by the passing shadow because she ducked for cover under a hedge.Part II: Seven minutes later. It is now 5:35 a.m., an hour before sunrise, and I am traveling east on Winchester Road. There is almost no traffic. The sky is mostly clear. It&apos;s 48 degrees, and the winds are calm. A few stars are visible, even though there are city lights nearby. I am going to work early to complete a project. I&apos;ve put all thoughts of the &quot;shadow&quot; behind me as I mentally prepare for the day ahead.The usual Fed Ex jets are flying past on their west-to-east flight paths, leaving Memphis International Airport, and I pay them little attention. However, as I passed the Nike plant on my left, I noticed a &quot;plane&quot; that seemed much lower in the sky than normal for this part of the landing and take-off pattern. It definitely caught my attention. It appeared to be hovering in place at a spot just east of the Nike plant on the north side of Winchester Road. This area is about five miles away from my home. I slowed down and came almost to a stop to get a better look at the &quot;plane.&quot; It was my perception that it was not moving at all. As I studied it, I realized that there was no strobe light on it. It also did not cast its lights ahead of it, as you would normally expect to see the lights of a jet beamed straight ahead. Instead there were three white lights aimed downward. It was then that I perceived that I was looking at a triangular-shaped craft with three bright white lights, one at each corner, and a single red light in the middle of the underside of the craft.The craft was approximately the size of a fifty-cent piece held at arm&apos;s length. If I had to guess, I would estimate that it was about a quarter to a half-mile away from me, hovering in place. It exhibited no motion whatsoever, and from my perspective, seemed to be hovering over an empty field. I got quite a good look at it for a period of time I would estimate as long as two minutes.(I regret not having the presence of mind to roll down my window and listen for any sounds. I was too surprised by what I was seeing.) I continued heading slowly eastward until I lost sight of the object as I passed some trees. It was then that I resolved to make a quick U-turn and go back and get another look. I found a place about two blocks farther on to turn around, and I raced back to look at the object again. There was no trace of it whatsoever! I searched the sky for several minutes in vain. The object had quite simply vanished.What I saw was very definitly NOT a star. It was not Venus or Jupiter. I know what the planets look like when they rise in the east. This object was in the northern sky as I faced east. The object was NOT a light on top of a cell phone tower or a utility tower. (I checked on the way home, and there are no towers of any kind in the vicinity of my sighting.) It was also very definitely NOT one of the Fed Ex jets. I had an opportunity to compare the object to the jets flying past in the background, and they were very different. This craft was lower than the jets, and the lights appeared to be of a different intensity. I have no explanation for what I saw, but I decided to give as detailed an account as possible so that others in the Memphis area can keep an eye out for such an object in the sky. It might possibly be one of our own aircraft, keeping watch over the skys in this area during this troubled time. If so, it seems to be a remarkable craft indeed.Of course, I have no way of knowing if the shadow flitting across my lawn was related in any way to the object I spotted a few minutes later in the sky. When I got home this evening, I saw that a bright light traveling behind one of the tall trees near our driveway could have produced such a moving shadow. The light would have had to have had much greater candle power than the street light, however. I&apos;ve lived in this home for over a decade and have never witnessed such a phenomenon before.", "luminous orange sphere as big as a house flying horizontally then at angle of about 45 degrees flew off into sky.bright luminous orange sphere with haze around it, size of a house moving horizontaly at the back of a clump of trees.  I watched the object come from behind the trees and it flew on for about 30 secs then it suddenly flew into the sky at an angle of about 45 degrees without changing speed.  There was no trail.  It was as big as a house (approx).  It was daylight and i could see it very clearly, i was about 3 hundred yards (approx) from the object. It was not reported in the newspaper, though its flight of path was towards the town centre.", "It was as if a huge ball of light zoomed down from the sky and just disappeared before my eyes.Peter Davenport asked me to relate what happened to me.  Yesterday, 6 Dec. 01, I had a dentist appt. and I broght to his attention a  foreign object on one of the xrays.  He was curious about it and mentioned it was not part of a tip of a dental tool because it was to large for that and it appeared to be almost a perfect rectangle shape with just a slight extrusion barely visable to the eye.  I told him a dentist in Florida brought it to my attention in the early 60&apos;s and he said it was quite unusual and should not be there.  It is well above the roots and slightly below the nose,  right under it and slight to the side of it.  I remember very well one night I was out meeting a lover on the proposed causeway being dredged up and I was on my way back home (I was married at the time) and knew I had to be back shortly after midnight because I had told my husband I was out with a girlfriend.  While driving home I saw, what appeared to be a big ball of light streak through the sky and I expected to hear a huge sound but didn&apos;t.  I wondered what in the heck it was.  I lost approx. 4 - 4 1/2 hours somewhere in time because I made it home just in time to shower and get ready for work.  I was terribly confused about it but for some reason I buried the memory of it as if it had not happened.  (Looking back on this now, 40 years later) it does seem rather strange that I would just dismiss it that easily.  I&apos;ve always been a very curious person even as a child and my mom would get upset with me because I would sleep walk and sometimes end up on the front porch in the mornings.  I know I was very different from my siblings and still am for that matter, and have always and still to this day remain almost obsessed with a sense of urgency to get a message out to others about the &apos;meaning of life&apos;; however, I am cautious now and just let others come to me.   Over the years I would awaken every a.m. around 3 am to a twinkle in the sky and I felt as though someone was communicating with me.  I have seen, in the past two y! ears, 2 UFO&apos;s and they were very shiny in appearance and were stationary in the sky for 45 minutes one time.  I was out in the yard sun bathing and it was as though I was mesmerized and after 45 minutes approx. I started timing the object&apos;s appearance, it did not zoom off anywhere, it just, in the blink of an eye, seem to blink out of the sky.  I live in Lakewood, CO now and this is where I saw the two objects within the past two years.   A friend of mine saw the UFO the day I was sun bathing.   I did a series of airbrush paintings and titled them the Pleadian Series, and gave them all away but one which I still have.

The two men were traveling in a car, watching it. It had crossed the highway from the leftside, moving to the right. It was moving very slowly, almost hanging over the highway for a while.   One of the men thought that it should be moving faster and be out of site when compared to commercial planes.  It was fairly low in the sky, a little higher than treetop level, he thought about a block high.  They pulled the car over to the side and stopped to listen. There was no sound coming from it.  It continued drifting slowly until it went past a bunch of trees and then it suddenly either took off extremely fast or just disappeared.   It was angling in the direction of the Duluth Air Force Base which has been officially closed for quite some time. (Although there is some activity, I think Air National Guard stuff happening there. There have been some fighter jet activity around there, since the Sept. ll attack.)

(1988)While driving south on Craycroft from Broadway Blvd toward the Tucson airport, I noticed a triangular shaped object in the sky. It was so large I couldn&apos;t quite believe what I saw, but kept driving unsafely, until I was another mile south. I was at an intersection near Ajo Way when this object seemed just as large as before. I stopped in the right lane of that intersection and a woman in a vehicle to my left seemed to see the object in the sky also, and we made eye contact. We both stopped and I pulled over to the shoulder. The object was a gigantic triangular shaped form. It was very dark gray in color with no lights or printing/insignias on it. This was a very brilliant day, with no clouds, so this object was clearly visible, and it was not a &quot;mirage&quot; or a cloud. I stayed parked at the roadside fore at least 3 minutes watching this object hover motionless over the Tucson International Airport and the Davis/Monthan Air Force Base area. It did &quot;hover motionless&quot; for that time, because I became very hot and thirsty, and also stunned at this sight. I can&apos;t recall anyone else stopping to view it, except that one woman I made eye contact with. She was gone. The large gray object &quot;dipped&quot; its wing, so I could see a dimension of how large it really was. It was like a city block long. Very suddenly, it disappearred. I was thinking I had a dream or a day-dream, but I know certainly I didn&apos;t. I was very sobor and I don&apos;t do any drugs, so I was very afraid to tell anyone about this. I told one person, but he said that I saw a new US &quot;secret bomber&quot;. Nope.

I really don&apos;t know the exact date, but I know it was in May of 95&apos;. We saw three sphere like lights come over a hill from the north. The first one we saw was yellow. When it first came into my view it was about 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile away. It looked to be about the size of a car. After about 30 seconds it disappeard from our view by going over a hill to our north-east. About 10 seconds later the second light appeared. This one was much larger (about the size of a medium size house)and was glowing bright red. It took the same exact path that the first one did. About ten seconds after that, the third on appeared over the same hill and took the same exact route. This one was the exact size and color as the first one. They were all moving very slow. Too slow to be planes. No sound either, so they couldn&apos;t have been helicopters. Plus there were no blinking lights. Only a glowing sphere. We could not make out any shape either, just light.

The light that I saw that night was coming over that hill. It appeared to be the same exact size and color as the yellow ones that I had seen a week before. Just as soon as I pointed and yelled to my friend, &quot;Look! I told you I wasn&apos;t lying!&quot;, the object seemed to spin 180 degrees and disappear from our sight back over the hill. Sorry no pictures. To tell you the truth, I didn&apos;t even think of it. I don&apos;t think I could have gotten to a camera fast enough. Plus I might have missed something!((NUFORC Note:  One of two reports from same source.  We will attempt to have the other witnesses submit reports, as well.

The lights moved in a west to east direction and maintained a steady speed.  Elevation was difficult to assess, however, I estimate it at approximately 1500-2000 ft.   The pattern of seven (7) lights formed a &quot;V&quot; similar to a flock of geese.  The lights were very dim (similar to a 25 watt bulb at about 100 ft.).  There was no visible body to the object as it moved eastward at an increasing rate of speed.  There was no audible jet, propeller or rocket sound.  The night sky was totally clear and the path of the object did not intersect or come close to the flight path of either nearby major airports (within a 60 mile diameter).  The size of the craft would be at least that of a B-52 if not slightly larger, however, the rate of acceleration and our geographic location made me question that assumption immediately.  My interest in UFO&apos;s has been skeptical at best ... that is until I became the unexpecting witness to an object which does not fit any available logical explanation which I can arrive at to date.((NUFORC Note:  The text above was deleted from the original text, for some reason.

It was the middle of the night after the first day of the trip when I saw it. I have heard stories from a few people about golden or multi-colored shining spheres that hover silently and move at incredible speeds, I even met a guy who said one followed his car for 45 minutes once, so I wasn&apos;t in shock when I saw one myself. I looked up and I saw something moving very fast across the night sky, at least 20 times faster than a plane. My eyes had to struggle to follow it as it darted by. It was WAY too big to be a shooting star, and it had no tail either, plus didn&apos;t move like a shooting star. From what I could see in the 20 seconds it was there it had a white color, like a light sort of, so it was different than the spheres I heard about previously. It came from beyond the horizon and just as fast as it came it darted back into the sky. I wasn&apos;t that shocked about it really, I didn&apos;t even wake my dad and Bob. I thought to myself: &quot;That had to be a UFO&quot;, and then I shrugged it off and went back to swatting misquitos and trying to sleep. I think it&apos;s obvious these things exist, it&apos;s just that most of the proof of &quot;sightings&quot; either looks like or is B.S. or a hoax so it&apos;s difficult for us to find solid evidenct that these things exist. Even if I, by some lucky chance, happened to have a video camera nearby and I was fast enough to hit record in time to see that thing, it wouldn&apos;t be considered proof! . Anyone could just say I created a special affect with Adobe Photoshop(which I could do, I&apos;m a film maker) of a light moving at unearthly speeds across the night sky. The problem is most people are too ignorant for the truth, and they will always be until a UFO lands in their backyard and the greys come out for a cup of tea and crumpets. For whatever reason the mysterious pilots of those things wish to remain anonymous, and for GOOD REASON. Earth people in general are very very stupid, if the truth came out today and president Bush was on T.V. shaking hands with an alien, people would panic and raise so much hell that I don&apos;t want to think what would happen to us or the aliens. Some advice: get over it guys, life is short. We can&apos;t convince the world UFOs exist until the aliens decide to convince the world UFOs exist. &quot;A person is smart, people are dumb, panicy, stupid sons of bitches and you know it&quot;.-Tommy Lee Jones, Men In Black.((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

At the time of the sighting I was a senior in high school. I was visiting my grandparent&apos;s farm in a valley of the Blue Ridge mountains on a perfectly clear and moonless winter night. I arrived just before 9 pm. As I was going up the steps into the house I noticed a very large and bright object fly over the mountain ridge to the west. The object was unlike anything that I had ever seen. It was roughly the size of the full moon and nearly as bright. It gave off a steady, brilliant blue-white light (it was white in the center and became blue towards the edges). The object originally had a fuzzy, or indistinct outline. During the time I observed the object (about 5-6 minutes), it made no sound whatsoever, and it flew in a straight west-to-east line. After observing the object for a couple of minutes it flew &quot;behind&quot; a tall pine tree atop a small hill next to the farmhouse, and it was so bright that you could easily see it shining through the tree branches. Since it was dark I am not sure of the height of the object, however, it did appear to be at least several hundred feet in the air. I asked my grandfather (who was 75 at the time) to come outside, and after putting on a coat he did so. He watched the object for about a minute and commented that he had never seen anything like it - he didn&apos;t know what it was. The cold air forced him to go back inside the house, but I kept watching. About 4-5 minutes into the sighting the UFO suddenly changed both its&apos; shape and color. In a split second it went from being a very bright, circular-shaped object to a teardrop or cone shape with a dull orange color. When the object changed its&apos; shape and color it did so from the bottom up - like someone pulling up a windowshade, which I thought was very odd. The object continued on its&apos; straight west-to-east path until it passed behind the mountain ridge to the east and was out of sight. I did not see it again, nor in the years since have I seen anythin! g that r esembles it. I currently live near a busy airport, and I have seen and heard many airplanes at night, and NONE of them have borne any similarity with this object. Also, at the time of the sighting I practiced astronomy as a hobby, and I had spent many summer evenings in the back of my grandparent&apos;s home with a telescope. As a result I did have some familiarity with the night sky, and this object was far brighter and slower than any meteor I had ever seen (and this includes fireballs). The object was also much larger and brighter than any star, planet, or satellite I had ever observed. In short, I have never seen any other object which has resembled this &quot;peculiar&quot; craft. The next day I told my parents about the sighting but they laughed it off, as a result I have not told anyone until now about this object. I do remember that a few weeks later our local newspaper ran a story about some &quot;strange lights&quot; which were being seen in nearby communities, but I have never had the chance to investigate and find the article in question. I hold a master&apos;s degree and I am currently a teacher at a private high school in North Carolina.((NUFORC Note:  We have replaced the original report with this edited version.

I noticed that there was a mysteriously looking circle of clouds around the moon.  If you would look at the moon, the radius of the circle would be about the size of a pinky.Its colors were also unusual to see in a dark sky, you could make out colors of red and green, sort of like a fading rainbow.  We also noticed that it changed its diameter a couple of times on a small scale.  Immediately I called my mother who lives in Northeast Philadelphia, and she confirmed seeing the same thing.  To my surprise when I called 3 of my friends in Brooklyn, NY, they said that they saw the mysterious circle as well even though they were about 80 miles away from where we were.  Inside of the circle there was no sign of other clouds at all, but outside of it there were some scattered, but the circle itself was separated from them.  It finally started to fade away around 0200 on Sunday morning, December 1,2001.  My girlfriend&apos;s sister had also noticed this phenomena who was in Northeast Philadelphia at the time.I was also wondering where I can find out if more reports were made regarding this event.  I am aware that reports were made in the past years of mysterious clouds appearing, and some thought it was UFO&apos;s.I am looking forward to hearing back from you.Sincerely, ((name deleted))((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses were observing a &quot;Moon dog,&quot; caused by ice crystals in the atmosphere.

At approximately 9:20 pm (N.M. time) we observed a formation of 5 very bright spheres with long, arcing, glowing tails traveling slowly from south to north.  The first 3 were in a triangular formation and much brighter than the last 2, which were offset from each other.  The latter 2 abruptly disappeared, and the remaining ones continued to travel all accross the sky, disappearing behind the northern mountain range.  They were too slow to be meteorites, and we could see them very clearly.  My son is a physicist &amp; amateur astronomer and I am a teacher &amp; book illustrator.  Neither of us believe that aliens visit or &quot;walk among us!&quot;, but we could not explain what we saw.  We discussed all the possible explanations for our &quot;sighting&quot; and came to the conclusion that they moved too deliberately to be &quot;space junk&quot; or huge bright comets.  They were definitely not airplanes, as they had very bright, glowing trails that followed their arc of travel.  Occasionally they would flash with blue light.  They were the largest objects in the sky - impossible to ignore.((NUFORC Note:  Probably space debris.  Please see other reports.  PD))((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION))Thanks for believing me!

We started by seeing lots of triangular shapes objects darting about in very irratic paterns.  They did not fly smooth or straight at all.  Then at about 4 different points in time we saw them go into patterns like geese would do, then criss cross, then go straight down, then straight up and get back into a V pattern then they would sometimes go up and totally disappear, or go down or side ways and totally disappear.  They flew in very crooked irratic lines and very, very fast.  Sometimes they would slow down.  Then all of a sudden after about 22 minutes we saw a huge fire ball that was extremely large and bright orange and red that appeared to shoot straight up and back down with a thin white tail.  We continued to see a few more traingular shapes moving irratically then all of a sudden nothing at all..Sometimes it almost seemed as if the small ones were flying off of a real large object and flying around and then coming back.

After watching the &quot;show&quot; for awhile, my Brother-in-law went to a Whataburger (or similar establishment which is open at that hour) because he had an appetite.  I&apos;d seen enough and went inside - I was tired.  My Wife stayed outside, and several minutes later she came in the porch door asking me to come outside and see if I think this is part of the Leonids or not.  She didn&apos;t say what her opinion was.  I walked out, and she was pointing at it. At first I was focusing so far out that I seemed to just focus right past it.  Then she said pointed again, more deliberately.  At that time I saw it. At first it looked similar to some of the shots when that comet/meteor or whatever it was, broke up, in a line, then slammed one of our Planets a few years back.  I then saw that this column of lights was not descending nor were any of the parts fading. Then I realized it wasn&apos;t a naturally ocurring event. It is best described as a series of six (what must have been) large lights, orange in color with a brightness I can best describe as &quot;Low-Glow&quot;.  It was moving slowly and silently from the West when she first saw it, then by the time I got out there it had already begun South East. We both agree that there was a series of six lights.  She remembers round, but I remember them being that of an elipse. (Typical track and field) The lights all appeared to be spaced evenly front to back with the exception of the space in between the 3rd and 4th lights.  There was space there, of a size which was appr. that of the lights themselves.  Within that area, we each recalled dim, seemingly intermittent lighter-colored and smaller lights.  Like a dim,....very dim sparkler.  It was moving in such a way as to give the impression of an airliner in that, the lights were 1,2,3,4,5,6 all in a row with one being on the end it was travelling toward and on down the line, until one was at the trailing end.  I must say,...it certainly is! analogo us to a passenger craft, although no body or surrounding craft could be seen.  The way things were laid out however, a quick description of the light layout and the direction of travel was &quot;similar to the tubular design of a fuselage&quot;.  As we both stood silently watching,...it passed overhead at the appr. speed of a blimp,(no noise)with the look of a fuselage and the quietness of a bird.  It was a starry night and no &quot;structure&quot; was observed. We live within 3 - 4 miles of Houston Intercontinental Airport. I grew up around Eglin AFB and Pensacola NAS, spent 9 years in the Military, (4 USMC / 5 US ARMY SF) and am VERY familiar with military aircraft to include winning awards for same.  &quot;THIS WAS NO CONVENTIAL AIRCRAFT.&quot;  It flew silently over us, appr 1,500 feet to our North, (right over a certain Chevrolet Dealer very near I-45 and 1960, for you locals).  It is proving difficult to gauge the height since I do not know the size of the lights, although I&apos;d say it was probably several hundred feet long. It did not appear to vary in altitude or speed. The lights &quot;seemed&quot; to be large.  It passed by us, heading toward the Airport, which is only 3 - 4 miles away (if that).  Eventually, we lost sight of it due to light-pollution. and our roof.  I am mailing sketches drawn by each of us without collaboration.   The only addition I have is that my Wife did say that when she initially saw it (before I did) it seemed to &quot;move like a snake&quot;, in that it was travelling level, then seemed to hit a bump which it simply made a quick humping motion with each of the six lights doing the same thing at the same spot.

I pulled off of the road at an observation spot for the backbone, which looks out over a valley.  I could see the craft hovering down there, then it would fly up higher.  I would estimate that it never got higher than a few thousand feet, as I could still make out individual lights.  It almost seemed to be flying a search pattern, it just went back and forth, high and then low.  It seemed to be moving slowly, ground speed wise.  I am pretty familiar with the area where it was, and I know about how much ground it covered.  It took about two minutes to make one pass over the valley, which is only about half a mile across or so.  It flew by seven or eight times, then just took off like a rocket!  It disappeared from my sight in about ten seconds, but there wasn&apos;t much noise, I don&apos;t know if what I heard was the wind or the craft.

What I saw was a red light that seemed to pulse, however, after watching it for a few moments I asked my girlfriend to go and get the video camera from inside the house. The light moved around in a small area of the sky above and to the south of our home. It was at times very bright and moved in many different directions. It took a moment but I managed to get the camera focused in on it. At that moment my girlfriend ran and got the neighbors to show them what we were seeing. They too thought the light was very unusual. The most exciting thing happend whem I watched the tape I had made which was zoomed in to the object 16x. The object was close to another object or what may have been a star that can be used as a reference point.

Cloudless afternoon, north bound on the 55 fwy between the Katella and Lincoln turnoffs. The fwy in front of me is a very shallow bowl so you can see a lot of the fwy coming up. A large shadow passed (moving north) on my left side, I&rsquo;d say approx. 150 mph. I instinctively looked up to see what it was. I saw nothing. I looked back at the fwy and watched the shadow move from the left side of the fwy to the right (the distance north, covering approx. 1 mile). Alternately watching the shadow and looking up to see what it was, I never saw anything. At one point, the shadow covered the entire fwy, both sides, plus what I&rsquo;d estimate to be the width of two extra lanes on either side. The fwy, counting the emergency lanes and diamond lanes is 10 lanes. That would put the shadow somewhere between 125 and 140 feet wide.

It was traveling slowly toward the southwest and as it flew overhead at the altitude it was at I would guess that it would have appeared to be about four inches across at the rear and about five inches in length .Roughly the same size or perhaps a little larger than an A10 would appear at a similar altitude .

I first noticed a bright light to the left of me. It&apos;s size and shape was like a spotlight on an aircraft, or about the size of the end of a pencil. At this time I didn&apos;t give it much more thought. Do to the curving roads I lost sight of it, til I hit a nother open valley view. There was now two of them same brightness,shape. This time I had a fairly straight shot on this part of the road, so I slowed way down just to get a longer look at them. This was when the one in the front (I&apos;ll say) just shot straight to the west at unearthly speed. The other one seemed to start changing shape from round to elongated to diamond back to round. I had a curve coming up so I had to stop watching. When the trees opened up again on that side of the road. It was now closer to me larger in size, bright white with a lite blue edge. Needless to say I put the hammer down. As the speed increased I did pull out in front for I could now see it in the side mirror. Now at a 110+mph It was back along side of me, it now had a slight orange glow to the front edge, still changing shape. I slowed down to 85mph to go through some little town running all signs and signals. After going through there I did not see it for 10 mintues.After calming down mother nature began calling. I stopped in a wide open area to answer her call, and here it comes again from the area of that town just as I finished. This object chased me, or raced me I say this because it always stayed either behind me or beside me. It did at one time get closer to me, It looked like a very bright flying soda can at this time. I got to I-75 just out side of Sidyn, Ohio, this is when I finally lost sight of it. That was the fastest I had ever made that trip, an 70 mintues ahead of time.((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.  PD))", "Large, bright stationary light in sky over eastern LA county.As I left my office about 10pm I looked up into a clear sky in the east, and noticed a bright manilla colored light about 45 degrees above the horizon. This is also a view of the approach to LAX so you see the various aircraft at their various levels during approach.  This light was much larger and much brighter than the lights of the approaching aircraft. The light, at that distance was about 3/8 inches in diameter, and did not appear to be moving, as the other aircraft on approach were.  I took a minute or so to look at it, tried to figure out what it might be and when I couldn&apos;t left.  On my way home, I stopped to get something to eat which took about a half hour. When I got home and out of the car, I couldn&apos;t help but notice it was still there...still unmoving...total elapsed time from my first sighting of it was no about 1 hr. It was east of the belt stars of Orion. Being an amature astronomer I first tried to equate as an astonomical body but couldn&apos;t. It was much larger than Jupiter and Saturn which had already set by this time. It was too large and too yellow for Venus. It&apos;s color was like that of Saturn through a telescope. I ruled out astonomical and commercial aircraft. I gave up for the night and went in and went to bed. When I turned on the Coast to Coast program to listen to until falling asleep a guy called in from Santa Barbara and told the host (AB) about it. He said he and some friends were leaving an eatery in Santa Barbara when they spotted it. He described it exactly as I saw it to AB who began to ridicule him. He finally got angry and told the host to go out and look into the eastern sky about 30 degrees above the horizon. Finally the host said he&apos;d do it at the next break. Given Santa Barbaras proximity to Los Angeles, it would have appeared lower on the horizon than it did from my vantage point. Unfortunately, I don&apos;t believe the show host could&apos;ve seen it from his desert location. My best guess is that the farthest east it could&apos;ve been would have been Palm Springs, CA. I hate trying to guesstimate distances and heights but I&apos;d say it was probaby at about 7000 ft over the area of Riverside or maybe even further west. To rule out an astronomical body, I went outside the following night at the same time and there was nothing there. Had it been astonomical in nature it would have been there for a number of nights at least. I rued out a law enforcement helicopter which are prevalant in the area because they away&apos;s circle or move in some way...this object simply wasn&apos;t moving.((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness may have been observing.  However, we note that Jupiter currently is very prominent in the eastern sky during the early evening, and that it &quot;rises&quot; in the sky toward the zenith throughout the evening.  Unless there were two, prominent bright lights in the eastern sky, our first guess is that the observer might have been looking at Jupiter.

This light has not been there before, because I work a morning shift and I always look in that direction in the morning when I smoke. It was a yellowish round light that was twinkling rapidly. It appeared to have a red ring around it. I compared it to the building lights around me and it was nothing like it, nor do we have buildings that tall here. I compared it to the other stars, and it was huge at least twice the size of them.  I stood very still and noticed that it was moving. I thought it was an airplane or a meteor that was about to hit the earth. And then, it lulled for a moment and appeared to have dissipated. But it went upward before it was gone.((NUFORC Note:  We note that the report is not inconsistent with the landing light on an approaching aircraft, but we do not know if there are any major airports in the area of the sighting.

I was taking my dog out, I was facing north with a less than full moon to my right. I heard a strange repeating sound, very softly &quot;deedle..deedle...deedle...deedle&quot;. When I looked up I saw two faint dots of light movind from east to west. When my eyes adjusted you could see the two points of light were attached to the tips of a dark oval shaped object. I watched the object move from about ten o&apos;clock to two o&apos;clock in the sky, then lost it in the light of my light pole. I went inside to call a friend that lives close by and went back outside. While outside I was facing south, with the moon over my left shoulder. I was telling my friend about the first one when a three pairs of lights forming a triangle on angle came over my left shoulder and moved to the south east. With the light pole behind me I watched this one disappear about thirty degrees over the horizon.The only reason you could see the bodies of the objects is that they were darker than the surrounding sky. After seeing this I spoke exitedly to my friend, we both observed three aircraft in the western sky. The southern most turned out to be a plane, the other two hung in the sky to the west. You could see the colors of normal aircraft lights. My friend said he could hear the blades of the helicopter.", "a craft in the treetopsa full moon, which made this very visible. Myself and my 15 year old nephew were driving south towards Easton,Pa. on a road that runs a mile or so through an industial park. I then noticed about 75 feet off the road (which I went back the following day and realized it was an entry drive to a company and 75 feet off the road it had an area heavily shrubbed with mature trees (circular area) and then another 50 feet to the parking lot) 25 to 30 feet in air, in the shrubbed area , were some lites. We pulled into the drive and looked up out of our windows at what appeared to be a small dark triangular craft with 3 orange lites, hovering right above the treetops. This object made no sound what so ever. Next it moved exceptionally slow(almost a glide) about 150 feet away and stopped. We gave it the logical reasoning that there is a private airport a quarter mile away and it was right after september 11 and the crop dusting warnings and we thought it was govermental craft we were unaware of monituring the area as we are only 60 miles from  NY city. We watched sit still and then the orange lites (just one) blinked and it was gone.Ofcourse we asked a few people in our area if they had heard or seen anything that nite, but they had not.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was smoking a cigarette and looking at the stars(The ground visibility was a little hazy, sky visibility was completely clear.) when I saw an object flying east almost directly overhead.  It was shaped like a triangle, more so like a boomerang(my friend said like a giant glider.)  It seemed to be about the same size across as a jetliner(without knowing exact altitude.)  It was completely matte-black, not reflective at all, with no lights or beacons on it at all.  It was darker than the night sky which was lit by streetlamps.  It also made no sound at all, completely quiet.  Its&apos; rate of speed was comparable to a plane on landing approach, I believe.  It flew over our heads at a 120 degree angle. The downtown St. Paul airport is approximately 3 miles away from our location.  There were no planes in the direct area where I saw the object.  When I first saw the craft I immediately stopped the inane conversation I was having with my friend and pointed out the object.  He saw it immediately and we both watched it fly out of sight over the building.  We were both completely flabbergasted.

Whilst watching these saddening images I noticed to the right of the scene an object darting up &amp; down and left to right, it then slowed and faded away. There was no way that it could have been an insect because it looked as if it was in the distance when you compare it with the hovering helicopters. It certainly wasn&apos;t a bird for the same reasons as above and the fact that the manouvers carried out by this object would not be possible by any bird that I know, that would also be the same for helicopters or any other craft that I know of.Hopefully i&apos;m not the only person to have noticed this, unfortunately due to the nature of the images people may not have noticed this, but it certainly needs investigating.", "A disk shaped flying object followed the path of our car just above the telephone lines.My sister and I were driving down Martindale Rd. between Canton, OH and Kent State University(Kent was our detination)That area at the time was sparsely poulated and was mostly farm land.  I remember looking up and seeing a bright light in the sky and saying to my sister that I did&apos;nt remember that light. (It looked like it could have been the top of a tower but I had&apos;nt recalled seeing a tower.) I don&apos;t know if what we saw next had any relationship to what I saw later. In the next minute or so and when we were a few miles just before rt.43 the encounter began.  A silent flying craft(disk shaped) with lights around the circumference began to follow the path of our car along the road and just above the telephone or electric lines to the left. I was driving and a little nervous.  My sister excitedly told me to stop the car.  But I was scared and refused.  When we arrived at rt.43 we had to stop and choose to turn left or right. As I prepared to turn right the craft went at an angle up and over the wooded area that was directly on the other side of rt.43. and disappeared behind the trees. I don&apos;t know if the object landed but the downward course of the direction it was going suggested that it was going to land.   Then I got brave, and decided to turn at the first side street off of rt.43. We waited briefly to see if it would go up again but it was starting to get dark and I wanted to get back home.  So our encounter with the object ended there.  I have never stopped thinking about the object and when I found this website I was hoping I would find other reports made in that area at the same time.

We immediately noticed to our North at about 25-30 degrees above the horizon, a stationary red light hovering below the cloud cover. After about 5 minutes of no movement by the object, I called 911 and attempted to report what we saw. The 911 operator told me they had multiple calls about the object and they did not know what it was. I then called my son from inside the house and he also observed the object. During the course of events, the object began to randomly pulse, sometime disappearing completely, then returning. At times, it appeared to be emitting and/or absorbing what looked like white static electric discharges, but that may have been an optical illusion on my part. There were commercial aircraft in the LAX landing pattern farther north of the object, that may have seen it at around 2250. During the 20-minute observation from my POV, the object&apos;s only movement was to &quot;drift&quot; from west to ease by about 4-6 degrees and gain some altitude. The object continued to pulse until it seemed to drift out of sight up into the clouds or departed at about 2254. We called a friend in Garden Grove, located about 6 miles SSW of our location, but they could not see the object.

When the lights disappeared I walked back to my bicycle and asked observer #2 is she had seen the lights?  She saw them too because they reappeared about then.  We looked to see if they might be landing lights of a plane disappearing and reapperaing behind the clouds,  but there were no clouds.  We saw the blinking light of a plane in the same general area but saw no association between it and these lights.  The sky was  star filled. We got a reference to the mountain range that sits below and they were definitely above the mountains.  We wondered if they might be distress flares from someone in the mountains, but the lights never moved downward like flares do.  They just stayed in the same spot, disappearing and reappearing.  Each appearance lasted  20-40  seconds for about 4 times.    There were always 3 lights.  They were always in the same position but  their positioning was not symetrical.  They each had about the same intensity of light and were of the same size (about 1/4&quot; in diameter on the scale we were viewing).  One was  slightly higher than the others and slightly to the West.  The other two were closer together with the lower one slightly East of the center one.

Hypothesis non fingo.", "My wife and I observed a dark brown/black disk shaped object with a dome of sorts on its top.  I did not report this to you yesterday after having seen the object (although I did send an email to the local newspaper asking whether anyone else had seen the object), as I was hesitant to do so since, firstly, we both thought perhaps it was a balloon of some sort, and secondly because I had previously reported a &quot;star-like object making erratic movements&quot; some months ago, and felt that my credibility may have been suspect by making a second report - this one more &apos;outrageous&apos; than the first.  However, I do want to report this, primarily because I would like to find out whether the object has in fact been positively identified as a balloon, and/or whether anyone else had seen it.  As it was travelling due south, it may have been observed by others in Victoria, and in Port Angeles. In any event this is what I/we saw: I had the day off from work (I work as a paralegal with the B.C. ((deleted/government employee))) and after a night of poor sleep, I thought to get a nap on the livingroom couch at about 11:15.  Unable to fall asleep as planned, I lay on the couch looking out the livingroom window. Within a few minutes the object came into view and, in relation to a highrise about 9 stories high about a block from our home, it appeared to be moving somewhat above the highrise and to its left (east).  I generally do not like to speculate on an object&apos;s height unless I know how large it is in fact, and cannot say how large this object was. I can say that if one scaled the object down, it was when I first saw it about the size of a twonie (two-dollar coin) held at arms length, in otherwords quite large. Admittedly, I was wearing my glasses which are not a precise prescription (I usually wear my contact lenses when out and about - which actually give me slightly better than 20/20 vision). Had the object been much farther away, I would not have seen it well enough even to think it may have been something unusual.  However, because of its relatively close proximity, I was able to see what appeared to be a dome on its top and a disk shaped underside that seemed to dip slightly back and forth while moving generally south. Again, it is unfortunate that I was not wearing my contacts, since I believe that it also tipped slightly at an angle forward in a south east direction (imagine holding a pan in front of you and tipping it forward to look at its bottom), revealing its underside, and at that same time swooped a few degrees to the left and back before resuming a straight course south.  Like I say I would have gotten a much clearer view had I worn my contacts.  Shortly after seeing it and realizing it was something unusual, I called to my wife Leann (a teacher, off for the Christmas break)who was in another room.  She came quickly to the livingroom. I pointed through the window to the object, and said &quot;what is that?&quot;.  At the time that she arrived it had moved far enough off and was less than the size of a dime at arms length. She ran for the binoculars, but by the time we got out the front door for a clear look it had disappeared.  I asked Leann if she had seen the dome on the top, which she did.  She seemed to think it may have been a balloon, and because I was not seeing it as clearly as I might have, I have been inclined to defer to her better eyesight.  However, a few things seem to militate against it being a balloon: 1) it was moving very quickly and it was not windy (at least not at ground elevation) 2) it appeared to slow down, almost hover, and then accelerate 3) it moved side to side 4) it was disk shaped and dark - what balloon has these characteristics?In any event, I am not drawing any conclusions and really only want to find out if I am corroborating other sightings.((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION))Mr. Davenport:Thanks for the reply.  Yes, you may pass on my report and this email to the UFO BC group.  Perhaps they are in contact with those parties who would know whether or not a weather balloon was in the sky at the time.I neglected to mention in my report that later yesterday evening, during a New Year&apos;s evening get-together, a fellow mentioned that he and some co-workers had seen the object while taking a break at the time (which he thought was about 11:30 am).  They work at ((deleted)), a ((deleted)) operation located approximately a block to the west of where our house is situated (this is an in-city operation -  near downtown Victoria).  ((name deleted)), the fellow who said he saw the object, said he didn&apos;t pay that much attention to it, but indicated that his co-workers were looking at it with some degree of excitement, as they also were not certain what it was.  I understand, however, that they decided in the end that it Just have been a balloon.  This is, of course, hearsay, and if you&apos;d like I can ask ((name deleted)) to get one or more of his co-workers who saw the object to contact you.  As I mentioned in my HMTL report, it seems to me that there are reasons for thinking that this was not a balloon, but my curiosity has been sufficiently twigged that I would like to find out if any weather balloons were in the sky at the time (it almost certainly wasn&apos;t a regular blow-up balloon).  If there were, then it seems we could rule out other possibilities.  Frankly, I don&apos;t know what weather balloons look like - if they are dark/black and disk-shaped and generally move quite rapidly at relatively low altitude, then I suppose that is what this could have been.", "Last night in my sisters back yard I video tape a large yellow/ white looking star, I have seen this star many times before, We have many hours of video on these &quot;stars&quot; or &quot; lights &quot; we have watched them for 2 months.. last night was the second time i&apos;ve tried using the camcorder.

PD))", "UFO sighted by numerous peopleMy lady friend and I had gone to the Dollar General Store in Vicksburg, MS. She was babysitting two children, 4 yrs. old and 6 yrs. old, who were with us. My friend went into the store and I sat in my truck with the kids and waited for her. It was about 5:30 pm, and the sun was going down. The sky was very clear and still a light color but the ground was almost as dark as night. The younger child pointed into the sky and said that she saw a light in the sky, which I&apos;m sure was the crescent moon. When I looked up to see what it was, I saw the moon, which is what I think she was looking at. Then I looked to the side of the moon a considerable distance and I saw a dark object in the sky that was shaped like a plump Hershey&apos;s Kiss, or perhaps a teardrop with a slightly flattened-out botton. It was black in a apearance with a pointed top and seemed to have an extremely faint aura around it that my friend also noticed. There were no lights on it, and it made no sound whatsoever. It was due east of us, as I was looking in the direction of the Mississippi River from the store&apos;s parking lot in the Beechwood area.I got out of my truck partway and stared at it. It moved closer very slowly at a slight angle coming from left to right. I stood and watched it for about 3 or 4 minutes. It got about 30-50% larger as it seemed to come closer. Then it stopped moving and hovered in place. At this point it seemed to be at an altitute of between 500 and 600 ft. if my speculations of distance and size of the object were correct. I watched it for about 2 or 3 minutes, and noticed that several other people in the parking lot were also staring at it. A black couple in their late twenties spoke to me briefly about it, and I asked the man if it seemed like it was about 500 yards away, no more than 1000. He agreed that it was about that far away. My friend came out of the store and watched it with me. After another minute or two, it began to slowly move upward. I drove Sharon, the kids, and myself toward the object into the lot of a strip mall about a mile closer. I stopped and got out and we stared at the object until it became too small to see. It took about 10 minutes for the object to ascend out of sight. As it rose, it did not move to one side or another whatsoever. It just moved exactly straight upwards. I estimate the diameter of the object to have been at least 15 ft. and may possible have been 3 times that size. It was difficult to estimate it&apos;s size without knowing it&apos;s true distance from us.It could not have been a balloon of any kind, because a balloon would have moved to one side or another (or gotten larger or smaller depending on your perspective, as it rose. There would have undoubtably been air currents somewhere between ground level and 1,000 ft. of altitude which would have caused a balloon to move sideways to some degree as it rose that far upwards. It could not have been an aircraft, such as a helicopter, because it made no sound, and helicopters make a lot of noise with their large props, and can be easily heard from a few miles away. If it were any kind of machine with a piston or turbine engine and a propeller, it would have made a lot of sound. Furthermore, law requires that all aircraft have blinking lights so that they are visible by the pilots of other aircraft, yet this object was completely black in appearance.", "My freind and i were watching the stars lying on a long chair on the deck of a boat on the Nil. The night was clear without any moon. Then we seen a large black triangle flying from south to north in the very dark sky.It was 2 ranges of lights (about 10-11) on 2 edges pointing to the north. The lights were large like 10-12 cm, but the same intensity of a star, without any fasces. The engine edge away, slowy, smoothly whis no sound. It appear and disappear at the same distance from us, like if the lights were inside the structure and needs to be above us to be seen. If it was at 200 metres from us then it was about 15 metres wide.", "close stationary cluster of lights; strobes,solid,and beams,with No solid object noted.We were travelling west on I44,wife was driving and woke me to view lights in sky to the northwest of us. They seemed to be very close,guessing less than a mile. They appeared to be stationary with large spot or floodlight shining from center of cluster to the left or west.The lights gave the appearance of different size tails but were definitely not tails, they were light beams, as landing lights on an aircraft. The scene was definitely not a returning piece of space junk.It didn&apos;t appeal to me to be anything but some sort of a military manuever.Looked like an area of refueling helicopters. We didn&apos;t stop moving,and it appeared that the lights were still in the sky and we were passing them. From the passenger seat of our rig,I counted out loud ,6or7 red strobe lights,along with an indeterminate number of green,white and orange lights in no particular pattern.We were moving about 70 mph,and they were in sight about 4 mins. from 30deg.in front to about 15 deg behind us and to the right. My wife saw them about 30  sec longer than I did.At arms length,they appeared to be about 12&quot; to 14&quot;in length,and about 7&quot; to 9&quot; high.They appeared close because of the clarity of the strobes and we seemed to be passing them and the pattern appeared to change noticeably in perspective.  Another driver getting to OK city about 10 mins behind us told of seeing the scene accelerate &quot;fantastically&quot; ,but we saw no such movement.Must have happened after we passed by.((NUFORC Note:  Probably a space debris re-entry.

PD))((UPDATE SUBMITTED 01DE02 BY ORIGINAL WITNESS))update on OK. sighting 12/01this is an update to the above sighting --  As there seemed to be no craft involved, just a series of mismatched lights, there have been several possibilities as to just what we saw//   ==        About the first of Nov. we were travelling north on the turnpike in OK, just north of Tulsa,around dusk, and crossing the navigation channel, I looked west along the channel and saw anchored on the north shore a large barge. It had misc. red,green and strobe lights on it and TWO large spot lights mounted on a mast,about 1/3 the way along the craft. the spots were different sizes and mounted above each other but both facing straight ahead.   This scene,if reproduced as a hologram and projected skyward, would have duplicated exactly what we saw in Dec.  It would explain how the &quot;object&quot; could have moved at a fantastic rate,as was told by another witness, just by turning the &apos;projector&apos;from side to side, and then shutting off the power, to make it disappear altogether. This explanation , for me,  at least gives me a sense of possibility.  This setup could be used by anyone ( government included) to create at least a diversion that could be  moved even electronically,from place to place to be seen by as many different people as the perpetrator wished.((END))((NUFORC NOTE:  Please see other reports for this date.  We believe the lights observed were fragments of a re-entering Russian missile hull.  Probably not a holographic projection, we believe.

The light was lower than an airplane would normally fly, and then the light shot horizontally away from us at a very high rate of speed heading East leaving a trail of light and disappeared.

He observed a huge black object above him, seemingly cloaked in the clouds.  It was a calm day, with a partial cloud cover, no wind at all.  He watched the object(s) for a minute then ran in to yell for me to &quot;come now PLEASE!&quot; I ran outside and he related to me what he had seen, since the object was no longer there.  He described it as a huge black &quot;wall&quot;, but it almost seemed to be changing shapes within the cloud.  He said it was at least 2 football fields in length from his perspective.  I continued to watch the sky with him and about 1 minute later, we both observed a solid, black disc shaped object fall like a leaf from the clouds, about 1/2 mile from where the object originally was seen by my husband.  It seemed to be heading N/NW This was seen above the treeline, so we didn&apos;t see where it went, just that it fell.  Then directly above that, in the clouds again, I saw what appeared to be two large black objects &quot;dancing&quot; in the clouds.  I immediately said &quot;oh, look honey, they&apos;re hang-gliders!&quot;  But they were seemingly quite large, in fact it could have been one object, as the clouds were obscuring parts of whatever I was seeing.  They or it continued moving for about 10 seconds, then completely disappeared into the cloud cover.  This is the first time my husband or I has witnessed anything remotely unexplainable in the sky.  We are at a complete loss as to how to explain it.We&apos;ve thought of kites, hang-gliders, balloons, airplanes, blimps, stealth bombers, none of it seems to fit.  There were no visible lights on the object(s), it was just big and black.  It made no noise whatsoever, and there was no wind at all.  It was afternoon, with about 1 hour left of good daylight.I am a professional, working in the health care field here in town.  My husband is a stay at home dad, caring for our 2 year old son.

We also notice that is amber object was coming closer and closer to us. My mother have the nerve the say, go out there and see what is that,I said,&quot;HELL NO&quot;. I told my mother let&apos;s go home,she wanted,to go down the street to the police station and report it. So as we got near the station another man came by too,and question want was in the sky.So by that time there were about six of us looking and pointing in the air. But someone must have call the police, because there was a helicoper in the sky circling around it. And the helicopher stop circling, and stop in mid-air like helicopher do. And a surreal thing happen it went away, did&apos;nt even break the silent. So I told my mother,if she mention this I would deny it, if course she mention it and I deny it.

My initial impression was that of a hang-glider due to triangular shape and lack of sound emination. The object was approximately 300 feet in length and was at a height of 500-1,000 feet heading due south.  Best guess of speed was approx. 150-200 kts.

But as I was watching this object which I had centered in the binocular lense, which I thought might be venus I saw a branch slowly come into view in the binocular lense. It came into view much faster than any earth rotation would have on a planet. So it was not venus as I first thought. It was not any type of aircraft known to me.

It was really early so I would have been surprised to see anything but a few sporadic meteors. My real excitement happened around 10:30! There were 3 sets in all and showed up approximately 1-2 minutes apart.  The first set, there were 3 in this first set (if i recall correctly), was travelling from south to north, from approximately the Cetus constellation through perhaps as far as the tail of Draco before fading out as if they had entered the atmosphere.  They did not burn out or burst like a meteor might, the just faded.  I was looking straight up from my location and facing east.  If I had to guess at a speed, they were moving at somewhere over 3 times the speed of sound, but nowhere near the speed of what you&apos;d expect a meteor to travel at, and being a poor judge of speeds that high I could be way off.  They were in formation and did not appear to move apart or together.  I saw 2 more sets that were approximately the same in charateristics.  They were in formation, and they were at the same speed.  The 2nd set contained 4, and the 3rd set contained 2.  There may have been more, but thinking this was part of the meteor shower, and very different than any other I&apos;d ever seen, I ran inside to grab the nearest co-worker to let them know that the meteors were really cool looking!

I had an errand to run, and comming back home from the store there was a traffic accident on the intersection of Rosemead Blvd. and Longden Avenue. A police officer was involved, so all traffic going north was to detour on resdental streets.  I was heading North, and saw a flying saucer right in front of me,above the San Bernadino Mountains.

I pulled over to the curb to view it, but the street was lined with traffic, and I was causing even more traffic to build up.  That night we had a full moon, and the saucer was even bigger than what the moon appeared to be. It was hard to keep a full view of the craft since the street was tree lined.  As I was tring to keep the craft in view, I thought maybe it was a blimp.  It took me around two minutes, if that, to get back onto Rosemead Blvd.,  heading north bound.

I stepped outside my apartment (near intersection of E. Del Mar Blvd. and Hill Ave.) this evening to walk to my car and happened to notice two glowing shapes crossing the sky from the North-West. They were irregularly shaped, lumpy, and fuzzy. The best way I can summarize their appearance is to describe them as glowing jellyfish. They seemed to changed shape as they floated silently together across the sky, finally disappearing into the haze above the South-East horizon. They were probably five to ten diameters apart from each other, and about doubled their distance in the time that I watched them. They were side-by-side, although the West-most object lagged slightly. The really strange thing about them was that they each had several blobs inside them that were glowing brighter than the rest of the object. These blobs moved, sort of tumbling around inside.

At that point it was right behind us and it looked like it was following us so we stopped and looked at it.  It was hovering pretty low.  We didn&apos;t know what it was and we were curious so we turned around to get a better view of it.  Than it looked like it was trying to get away from us because it was moving backwards. We kept driving towards it and it went back further towards the mountains and got smaller and dimmer.  It looked as if it was trying not to be noticed.  We got bored so we turned around again but we didn&apos;t keep our eyes off of it and while we were driving away it started to rise up into the air really quick.

I didn&apos;t witness the crafts myself, I&apos;m just repeating my uncles story.My uncle flies med-vac choppers from Columbia, MO to Springfield, MO and Kansas City, MO.  Two - three weeks (exact date unknown to me- between 11/25-30/01) ago he witnessed two Unidentified Flying Objects en route between Springfield and Columbia.  He said it was pretty close to Fort Smith(?) off of I44 between Rolla and Springfield.  My uncle described these UFO&apos;s as practically undescribable or unviewable rather, other than that there was a fiery aura around the actual ships, or flames (redish orange with a blue mixture as well) unlike any fire that is common on earth and that he&apos;d seen for that matter, blanketing the crafts outward appearance.  The ship itself wasn&apos;t even distinguishable.  He said he was travelling at about 2500ft and they appeared infront of him, like a cars headlights, at a height of nearly or exactly 3000ft, and at around 700 - 800 mph passed directly in front of him, flying exactly parallel to the earths surface, one slightly behind and caddy corner to the other.  He witnessed them go out of sight, as they had come into his view.  He even said they flew directly inbetween his chopper and a cesna flying not to far off beside of him (distance unknown to me), and when he made the call on his transmitter he was told that they were not seen on their radar, yet the cesna and him were obviously there.  He also said that they were not small either.  Very large.  He didn&apos;t go into exact detail on the size of the crafts.  I don&apos;t know where he was speaking to exactly, but he said that he spoke directly to an Air Force (representative) also and was told by him that it was &apos;Space Debris&apos;.  There is no way that this was space debris given it&apos;s path of travel.  If space debris it would have been heading towards the earth!  He said that the Air Force representative was adamant, and he realized that immediatly and complied.  The local Ozark media also ran the story telling of many eye witness accounts of the UFOs, but followed with the Air Forces guise agreeing that it was &apos;Space Debris&apos;.Unfortunatly this is all I gathered from him.  There was a nurse with him who shared the experience as well.(personal note to previewer - omit from description) ((NUFORC Note:  So omitted.

We were all going through school at the time (college) it was two in the morning and it was very clear that evening with i think an almost full moon high in the middle of the sky. We were standind on the North shore of Lake Ontario at bluffers park in scarborough Ont. our attention had been drawn up in the sky when 1 person in the group pointed out that she had seen what looked to me to be a planet had just appeared out of thin air. it was about moon level in the sky and it was a brilliant orange round object slightly larger than the largest visible star but was much brighter than any star i have ever seen. I know there is alot of air traffic in the t.o. area but i was sure no aircraft of earth origen that can zig zag back and forth up and down at the speed It was going it seemed almost to be playing in the entire sky above us. About after 10 min we saw a airplane i know this from wacthing many planes from the exact spot for many years. As the plane approached the vicinity of IT,IT stopped. Then at a very high rate of speed traveled toward the plane. One of my good friends then screamed oh my god it is gonna hit the plane. Just before IT did it proceded to do looping zig zaging motions around the plane then just as it had been playing before ITleft the plane and continued to play some more in the sky leaving the plane alone&gt; at this point my hair was standing on the back of my head.

As I continued to stare at it I noticed it was blinking white with red lights.  I went into the house and told my brother about the star/planet, he looked out the bathroom window with me and at first thought it was a planet also.  After looking at it for a few moments, he said that&apos;s not a planet!  We grabbed my camera and a pair of binoculars and went around to the front of the house.  He looked through the binoculars while I took some pictures.  He asked me to look and see what I saw.  I described to him that I could see and object that had a bright white light in the center with red and blue/green lights on the tips and that the object appeared to be in a plate shape with a peak on the top.  Just at this time my daughter came home and we called her over to see.  Both she and her boyfriend described the same things we had seen.  I just could not believe my eyes.  I asked my daughter to go get my second floor tenant so he could also see what was in the sky.  He had the same observation as the rest of us.  Again looking through the binoculars I saw the object moving around rapidly but staying in the same area, which appears to be hovering in the same location for a long time.I again observed this sighting again the next night, but the object had moved northeast of my house.  My sister and her friend came over to see, they both described the same as all the others.  I went out again at 9:05pm with the dog, looking up in the dark starry sky I noticed several of these lights in different spots in the sky.  There appears to be at least 3 of these lights now hovering in the sky........I would really like to know what is going on.  I have now seen at least (4) objects within the last month.  One during the day as I travelled to work on the highway.  But I dismissed that as just an active imagination.  But now I and really concerned.

We were driving westbound and both saw the light  at exactly the same time.  I commented to her &quot;Look at that&quot; at about the same time she said &quot;I see it&quot;.  We both remarked that it appeared to be a Meteor , but as it crossed in front of us in a decending arc, it didn&apos;t flame out as one might expect, but continued to be very bright until it disappeared below the horizon.It was a very bright circular light, moving very rapidly from south to north as we were traveling west bound in our vehicle.  It moved from about 230 degrees to approximately 290 degress when it disappeared.  We viewed it for approximately 10 seconds.  When it disappeared from our sight, we both remarked that we were waiting for a loud explosion or bright light in the sky, as if it might have crashed to earth.  But, nothing was seen or heard after we lost sight of the object.  The object was approximately 10% of the size of a full moon.I immediately called the local police department from my cellular telephone to report the sighting, and to ask if any other calls had been reported.At the time of my call, the local authorities had not received any other calls.((NUFORC Note:  We were directed to this witness by the Fresno Police Department, for whose assistance we are grateful.

I thought since it was around christmas time it might be some sort of ornament.  As I got closer probably 100 yards out, I slowed my vehicle to a stand still to get a better look.

I figured I would drive out to the main rd, which was higher in elevation to see the thing departing in the distance.

It appeared to hve a mist around it however that may have been the air as it was extremley cold. It made a lowhumming sound when it was close which dissapeared almost instantly when it neared us.

The lights were so bright that we could feel the burning rays. As we stood at the parking lot muted, the three objects flew overhead and dived into the Arkansas river.

This is what we thought it was until we realized that these lights were moving very rapidly behind the clouds in the west and north.These lights, sometimes alone sometimes multiple, seemed to be chasing each other &quot;playing or dancing&quot;, changing colors from white to red, then yellow, then green and blue.  The colors were not bright, but muted or pastel.  My husband had the impression of children playing tag.  They moved fairly fast from south to north, skimming the edges of the clouds at the edge of the storm front, &quot;peeking&quot; through the clouds in the north, but most of the activity was in the western quadrant.  We live in an isolatd forest area 12 miles from town. These lights continued intermittenly for aprox  6 hours.  Myself, my husband and two house guests also observed the lights.  Three of us are of American Indian decent.  My husband and I also observed a similar light object, orange and yellow and red, in Aug 1996, in the west sky at aprox 8 pm EST.  I am having a hard time describing what  we saw,  because the words don&apos;t fit the vision. If you could imagine a flash light being shown through a prism,  so that as the light moved it also changed color, only on a much larger scale.   There was no definate shape, just and eliptical light source.  Since the sun had already set, I ruled out the possibility of sun rays through the clouds producing a sort of rainbow, but rainbows don&apos;t flitter across the sky from south to north.  My husband&apos;s impression was that the movement was not random, but controled.", "Revolving red and green lights around a white light.My mother and I saw a light almost due east.  We watched it thinking it was a plane or something of the sort, but it did not move and it seemed to be flashing intermittent green and red.

I was driving on a two-lane road at about 45 miles an hour, when I saw an object that looked like like a disk with a string of red, green and white lights shining around the rim of the object.  I noticed that it was not moving, but rather it hovered over a thicket of vegetation on the side of a small hill.  I pointed out the object to my friend who was surprised to observe that the object suspended in the air.  We pulled to the side of the road and got out of our rented car, and continued to look at it.  We then realized there were some other people who had gotten out of their cars and were observing the object.  The object seemed to be emitting a blue beam of light from its underside.  We noticed that there was a small object in the beam of light and it looked to us like it was an animal, perhaps a small dog or cat. The animal appeared dead or asleep and slowly disappeared into the object.  After five minutes we noticed some helicopters were moving slowly towards the disk.  The disk then began tto descend and disappeared into the side of the hill.  We could hear a weird sound from the area into which the object seemed to have penetrated. The helicopters disaapeared beyond the hill but could still be heard for a few minutes after we lost sight of them.  Some people began to walk towards us, and my friend was a little fearful and told me to get back into the car, which I did not hesitate to do.  We pulled away, but we had the eerie sensation that we had seen something unusual.  We checked in our small hotel and had an uneventful trip back to San Juan.", "A huge display of lights more in the form of a disc, but  too large and obsured to make that determination.My husband and I were driving on a county farm road in the Southeast Texas countryside between East Bernard and Wallis, Texas around 8:30 pm on a very cloudy night.  An approaching cold front was drawing clouds from the south and the cloud cover was fairly dense and moving rapidly.I looked to the east which was in he direction of Rosenberg, Texas and could see the lights of that small town displayed against the flat horizon.  Above the lit horizon was a very brigt cloud nestled among many others of a normal grey appearance.  When the cloud drifted to the north there was a huge display of lights about 35 degrees above the horizon just behind or maybe inside the low clouds.  The lights appeared to be like those seen from a distance at a football field, but they were lined up right beside each other and there were at least five rows of them.  Each sat next to the other and above and below the rest.  There seemed to be very little space between them in any direction I counted five rows, but the clouds around the light display seemed to be obsurng more rows because the brightness kept showing through even when I could see five rows distinctly.  I don&apos;t believe the set of lights moved, but that the cloud movement kept covering the display and at one point I could count nine lights in the longest (and center) row.  At arm&apos;s length the object was almost three inches in width and about a inch in height.  The lights appeared to descend in number from the middle to the top and in the same manner from the middle to the bottom.  Occasionally, a cloud would totally encase the lights, but the cloud would then be luminescent.We watched the formation for about ten minutes before turning on to another road.  Trees close to us loomed over the part of sky we were watching.  By the time we could see that horizon again we had driven fairly far from Rosenberg and there was nothing but normal cloudcover.((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION))Mr. Davenport, Actually, you&apos;re correct in that the sighting took place on December 1st.  I checked my original report posted to a message board that very night.  My memory can be faulty so I wrote it down as soon as I got home. As far as the timing goes it was definitly 8:30 pm CST so if you are taking about Midwestern time for the reentry the two don&apos;t really match up.  However, if you are talking Pacific time that would be just right.  (Well, I just read a lot of the reports at NUFORC and realize the timing isn&apos;t right for when we saw what we saw.) There were no tails or auras and the lights didn&apos;t seem to move at all, but with the clouds moving so rapidly I might have become confused.  The lights were side by side and extremely bright with perhaps six lights in a row just above the row of nine and perhaps another five or six below that row.  There were even fewer visible in the top and bottom rows and I&apos;m referring to the best view I had with clouds passing.  The lights never varied in size, they were all of equal size, so whatever the object might have been I doubt it was moving.  I neglected to make the report to you at the time because what I saw didn&apos;t look like any know UFO shape other than a disc literally made entirely of white lights.  Really strange and as I said, they seemed to remain stationery for ten minutes or so.  I&apos;ve also been waiting to read reports of something similar before reporting I also forgot to mention that we made the same trip on the night of December 23rd and saw Rosenberg&apos;s lights on the horizon on a clear night, but there were no lights in the sky other than stars.  It might be a good idea if I called Rosenberg&apos;s police department to see if there were any other reports or if there is some explanation I haven&apos;t thought of.  It&apos;s a small town with no reason for a large tower extending into the clouds, but I think it&apos;s worth a phone call or two even if I have to listen to a chuckle or two.  If there were similar reports I&apos;ll let you know. Thanks for letting me know others have made more than one report to you.  If and when you might find the time I&apos;d appreciate knowing what sort of sound you heard a UFO make.  I was sitting in a quiet house alone several weeks ago and heard a very strange, loud sound outside, a buzzing of something electrical, but it seemed to be &quot;skipping out.&quot;  It sounded to me as though it were passing overhead, but I can&apos;t be sure of that.  The sound progressed and then seemed to pass away.  I&apos;m sure there are any number of reasons for such a sound, but I&apos;ve never heard that before.", "a strange object on my photoi have recently returned from a holiday in greece when i was studying my photos on my digital camera when i spotted this strange thing in the distance, i had taken several photos virtually at the same time but only one photo had this object on could you check to see if any other reports was given for this place and at about the same time i am from the united kingdom i hope i have given enough information ive tried sending the photo by email and for some reason it is not going((NUFORC Note:  A very nice photo, but the anomalous is so small and indistinct that it cannot be identified by us.

PD))", "Lights over I-70 in Western KansasWhile driving east on I-70, just east of Goodland, Kansas, Dec. 1st around 9:45 pm, I suddenly noticed a large long light in the sky.  It was south of the freeway, about 30 degrees above the horizon, and about 30 degrees to my right ( 0 degrees being directly ahead of me).   I&apos;d noticed it out of my upper right peripheral vision.  At first, I thought it might be a long strip of moonlight shining from behind clouds.  But as I looked, I could see a line of separate white lights (more distinct towards the front).  Underneath it, towards the front, and perfectly parralel to it, was another line of lights about 1/3 the length of the top line.  And this is what first jarred me out of the thought that it might have been moonlight :  these lines of lights were ruler-straight.  Although I could hardly process it, I realized I was looking at some kind of HUGE mechanical object. It appeared to be VERY long and rather flattish.  I say this because the sky seemed darker above and below the lines of lights  (i.e. it appeared a lot longer than it was high).  I cannot tell you how far away or how high it was, since I do not possess this skill.  However, it was obviously at plane-flying height, so to speak, and not way out &apos;in the atmosphere&apos;.  At any rate, as I watched it, I realized it was moving, apparently north and perpendicular to the the freeway.  It traveled very slowly, parralel to the horizon, and straight across the sky.  As I watched, it came into view directly in front of me, above the freeway.  This thing was truely huge.  I could barely process what I was seeing, and I can only tell you that this thing looked like some kind of giant moving complex.  Although I still hesitate to utter it, the words &apos;space station&apos; did come to mind.  It continued to move north.  At about 30 degrees to my left, north of the freeway,  I noticed it was angling downward.  At this point,  I strained to keep it in view.  It appeared to me that the lights went out, from the back to the front, until all I could see was one peachy-pink colored light, which then dissappeared at about 15 degrees above the horizon. I called 911 and got a Goodland operator.  I told her what I had seen and from where.   She related that 4 other calls had come in.  The next day, I described the event to a couple of people in Kansas City who each told me they&apos;d seen a report on CNN.  One person told me it was being explained as a Russian &apos;spacestation&apos; which had re-entered the atmosphere, broken apart, nothing to worry about, folks.  I myself watched the local Kansas City news at 10 pm that night and heard it explained as a Russian &apos;rocket&apos; re-entering earth&apos;s atmosphere, complete with an image of what appeared to me to be a couple of meteors - &apos;shooting stars&apos;.  This image was NOTHING like what I witnessed.  As I had told the 911 operator when she&apos;d asked me if  perhaps what I&apos;d seen might have been a comet or &apos;space junk&apos;, I&apos;d replied, &apos;definately NOT&apos;  -  not unless objects falling to earth are suddenly defying the laws of gravity, and traveling in slow horizontal trajectories across the sky.  Additionally, since when does a Russian anything fall to earth without further comment or inquiry?  I will add that on my return trip to Colorado through Kansas 4 days later, I called the 911 operator back, as I&apos;d said I would.  She told me that a total of 7 calls had come in to her; one from a sheriff, 2 from deputies,  3 from local rural citizens, and mine.  I also stopped in Goodland to see if any locals were talking about it.  At a convenience store, I asked the cashier (40-ish) if he&apos;d heard anyone talking about the &apos;lights&apos; in the sky the previous Saturday night.  Apparently that night, a man had rushed into his store, sworn he was neither drunk nor taking drugs, and had told the cashier that as he&apos;d been driving to Colorado, west on I-70, he and another driver had both stopped their cars on the freeway owing to what they were seeing in the sky.  The only description this casheir relayed to me was that the man had said there was a large light underneath this thing.  When the cashier had suggested that maybe it could have been a blimp, the man had said &apos;no way&apos;, as this thing was much bigger than that.  Then I told him what I saw.  During my conversation with him, I turned to another man standing behind me in the store who&apos;d been listening in.  Judging from the somewhat frozen look on his face (40&apos;s, clean cut, athletic looking), I ventured to ask him if he&apos;d seen &apos;it&apos;.  He nodded wordlessly, &apos;yes&apos;.  I asked him if he thought it was a meteor or some &apos;space junk&apos;, and he said, absolutely not.  He had been in Goodland at the time and I asked him to describe what he saw.  He said, &apos;It was just like you said.  It was big, moving slowly and horizontally across the sky&apos;.  He left shortly after.  I have subsequently spoken at some length to the sheriff mentioned by the 911 operator.  He had seen &apos;it&apos; from 20 or so miles south of where I had been at around the same time.  He described seeing brightly colored lights traveling parralel to the horizon across the sky, adding it was the most beautiful thing he&apos;d ever seen.

After watching for approximately two minutes, suddenly, a bright silver appearing disc shaped object (the width of the jet stream itself) appeared between the two planes and swooped into the jet stream of the plane coming from the east and traveled the entire length of that plane&apos;s stream in approximately 2-3 seconds and disappeared.  As soon as the object disappeared, both planes verred away from their paths and appeared to go in opposite directions.

As the brilliance intensified it also increased it&apos;s speed significantly to twice the speed it had been originally moving and also changed direction slightly by perhaps one or two degrees.

As we arrived, the sky was a mostly cloudy but we hoped it would clear.  It was very cold (mid 30&apos;s Fareheit) outside.  As we sat in the car, we were facing directly east.  As we were looking for meteors, my wife commented that all she saw was an airplane &quot;or something&quot; just above the horizon, due east of us.  When she mentioned it, we started observing it also.It was too far away from us to make out any details of a craft.  I can only guess, but I&apos;d say it was ~5 miles away from us.  It was a white light, looked about the intensity of landing lights on a commercial airliner.  It was blinking very rapidly with a very consistent strobe-like rhythm.  The strobe frequency seemed almost like an everyday jetliner, however it lacked the tell-tale red nav light on the top. Since we couldn&apos;t see any meteors due to the clouds, we watched it for a bit.  The light moved a bit from the north to the south (approximately 3-4 degrees) and maintained what appeared to be a very low altitude.  I guessed it might be a car driving up a road and the headlights appearing to pulsate due to roadside trees crossing their path.  Just as I said this, the light jumped straight up ~10 degrees above the horizon.  The movement was deliberate and VERY swift. This was certainly not a car and no aircraft that I&apos;ve ever seen could have ascended this quickly.  It moved an apparent 5 degrees in much less than a second.We were somewhat surprised at this movement, but as we are all fairly skeptical and scientific minds, we again guessed this must have been some sort of aircraft.  As we watched it began to move south, but as it moved, it bounced up and down very, very quickly.  Again, I can&apos;t stress enough that common airplanes or helicopters do not move this fast or in this fashion.  As it headed south it slowed dramatically and then headed north again, it appeared not to even stop when changing direction.  It accellerated just as quickly as it decellerated after reversing direction. This change of direction was simply amazing.  It seemed to have the dexterity of a small insect.  It moved up and down and north to south for several minutes as we watched in awe, all the time trying to understand what the heck we were watching.  I suppose the natural thing to do is to try and explain it away, but there was nothing that we could think of that could maneuver like this.After a few minutes of this, it travelled deliberately south/southwest of us and passed behind a hill that obscured our vision.  The other side of the hill that we could see was the town of Parker, which had many lights of its own and made it difficult to track.  We saw many lights that seemed to match this one, but couldn&apos;t be sure as they didn&apos;t appear to move.We stayed for three hours at that location and eventually saw the meteors.  The light we were watching was very clearly *not* a meteor.", "2 Objects seen next to the Moon at approx. 8:30am.Within 12 hrs of my previous sighting, I witnessed 2 objects next to the moon this morning.

I could see them with the naked eye, however, were too far in the sky to see exactly what they looked like (look like 2 dots.)  They weren&apos;t airline aircraft (too high) and possibly aircraft from the local Air Force?  These 2 object were visible for approx. 4 to 6 min.  I checked them out through binoculars and thought I saw a red dot, could have been the sun&apos;s reflection.  I went out to the front, next to the driveway (at my parents home) and the 2 objects were gone.

I was taking a &quot;back road&quot; (i.e. proverbial dirt road, maybe 2 old cowboy jalopies and lots of cattle had used that week) to see my boyfriend; probably not the smartest thing for a young woman to do.  I was traveling north, on my right was a ridge about 100 ft. high that ran parallel to the road for about 1/2 mile, ending just past the road&apos;s sharp left turn to the west. (ridge was 1/4 mile away from road) This corner was known to be dangerous: cattleguard, deep gravel, slightly on sloped angle, and narrow.  As I was slowing down for this corner, the radio started losing the signal (bunch of static) and car started sputtering, trying to die, then did.  (no previous car problems, just serviced, gas tank full)  Momentary panic, put my head down on steering wheel (who&apos;s going to find me &amp; when?); as I looked back up, I saw something coming over ridge.  I just sat there as it slid over the top coming closer to me, confused image of what I thought of as carnival lights - red, gold, white, bluish-green - all along outside edge of what seemed to be a triangle shape, lights running in fast &quot;chaser&quot; pattern (like popular Christmas lights 5-7 yrs. ago).  Also, just long enough for me to realize it was happening (and probably had been for a few seconds) there was a &quot;spotlight&quot; beam of bluish-white light traveling next to the passenger side of the car.  Beam went out; a few more ticks of what seemed suspended, unreal time with edge lights still blinking; shape rotated up about 30 degrees.  (that&apos;s when I realized it was chevron shaped, not triangular - I could see the stars between swept-back &quot;wings&quot;)  It starting drawing away still on an angle until it was about 250 ft. up, then *poof* it was gone.  No sound through *any* of this - and believe me, a d! eserted dirt road at night in winter in western Nebraska is about a quiet as it gets.  I even had window down an inch or so since I was smoking a cigarette.

I know I drove much more slowly than usual, but wasn&apos;t thinking about what happened (how odd!) and didn&apos;t even discuss it with my boyfriend, just said something about being behind a slow truck and what bad shape the road was in, blah blah blah.

Also, I&apos;ve read a great deal on the subject since that time (as you may imagine!) and have probably clouded things to the point it might very well not be successful anyway.I would like to share two further things.  First, I realized I never specified the size of... whatever it was.  It was on the smallish side, not more than 50 yds. across at the widest point (where the &quot;wings&quot; swept back).    That&apos;s probably why I got an impression of Christmas lights.  As it slid over the hill, my mind desperately wanted me to believe it was some kind of decoration turning on from the bottom up.  And it was that time of year, if a little late.Secondly, and probably the real reason I&apos;m resisting hypnosis, is that since I was a very small child my biggest fear has been looking out a dark window and seeing a white face look back in at me.  When the original &quot;Halloween&quot;  movie was released, some friends visiting me drug me with them to see it (talk about unwilling, I must have left heel indentations in the parking lot cement).  I literally did not sleep for a week after that.  The first two nights were the worst even with people sleeping in the same room - I laid there in a cold sweat, paralyzed, thinking every sound and shadow was something evil &amp; bad coming to get me.  (that sounds so babyish, and I was 23 at the time)  I&apos;ve never liked that kind of movie to begin with; I&apos;ve never gone to another even at the risk of offending friends/guests.  I&apos;ve also read that owls are often used as memory &quot;screens.&quot;  From the time I was 6 (my parents moved me to the attic room when my baby brother came along) I&apos;ve been haunted by owls.  I swore for years that an owl on-and-off sat on the peak of the roof on the end where my bed was.  No one believed me.  We moved to a huge new ranch-style house 2 miles away when I was almost 13 - one night later, an owl was now sitting &amp; hooting on the corner of the house where my bedroom was!  Finally about 6 mos. later the teasing quit when my Dad said he&apos;d found bird droppings of some kind on the cement sidewalk under the corner where I&apos;d sworn the owl sat.  That didn&apos;t really change things, but Mr. Owl didn&apos;t seem to visit so often after that.Reading this over, I hope you don&apos;t think I&apos;ve rambled too much (kinda seems that way to me).  But thinking about this has triggered one more memory of something that happened about 5 yrs. ago that I even went to the doctor about.  This happened at the far western edge of Arvada (Denver suburb) about 2 a.m.  I suddenly woke up and heard a kind of &quot;swoosh&quot; sound.  The first thing I thought was that someone was in the bushes below my window (it was 1 1/2 stories up on the back side of a split-level home).  No sooner had I thought that but what seemed to be a bright spotlight shown through the shade at the window.  My next thought was &quot;oh no, the cops are chasing some criminal with a helicopter &amp; spotlight&quot; although I couldn&apos;t hear rotor blades.  I glanced at the clock to see what time it was and that was the last move I was able to make.  The light intensified for a few seconds, I heard a roaring, and I thought I should get out of bed to look out the window, but I *could not move*!  I struggled mightily, but was immobile.  I could feel the sweat break out on my body and heard a roaring in my head and felt it in my body (it was steady, not like a heart beat), and still couldn&apos;t twitch a finger.  I&apos;d estimate this went on for 2-3 minutes.  I thought I was having a heart attach or more likely a stroke.  I cast around my mind for another explanation but always came back to physical problem.  During this time I was aware the light at the window was fading away - I couldn&apos;t look, my eyes weren&apos;t responding to the &quot;move&quot; command either.  The feeling passed all at once; it didn&apos;t &quot;ease up&quot; but was just gone - like when a blood pressure cuff releases.  The next day I tried to explain it to a coworker; she didn&apos;t know what to think but advised me to see the Dr. anyway.  I did at 2 p.m.  They found nothing wrong with me and *strongly* suggested it was a dream.  (Why do male Dr.s seem to assume women are all hypochondriacs or hysterical?  I was truly concerned!)  And I know it wasn&apos;t a dream - I&apos;m neither Dickens nor his pal Scrooge.  I believe in being open-minded, but not so open your brains fall out!Okay, enough.  Again, thank you for both your response and your time.Sincerely,  ((name deleted))", "TeardropI saw a bright orange teardrop which was stationery and it has bright orange sparks one on either side.

They appeared to be moving west toward the direction I was going.I at first thought it was a big commercial jet or military plane headed to the mpls. airport or the U.S.  Airforce reserve base located next to the Mpls. airport.Then while observing these lights I could no longer tell if they were moving or hovering. There also appeared to be a smaller craft to the north of this big craft.I rolled down my drivers side window and guessed it may have been a helicopter but no sound could be heard.When my attention refocused on the other craft it appeared to be hovering over a grove of trees on manning. I could easily distinguish three bright ligets on either side of a chevron or perhaps a triangular shape. I could not tell which as I believe I was looking at it dead on. I than rolled down the passenger side window and slowed downto about 20 miles per hr expecting to hear some sound. I heard nothing.The six bright lights completely lit up the tops of the trees. They became baseball field bright.I stopped at the corner of manning and 10th street (its a four way stop) and noticed that two guys were working on a telephone line. (a Quest truck was parked there) Looking to my right I still could see the tree line lit up. I turned left to head home to Stillwater and looked at my rear view mirrior and coule still see the tree line lit up.I checked with the Washington County police Dept to see if anyone else had reported anything, but was told no. I also called Lake Elmo Airport and no reports were taken either.I&apos;m pretty neutral about the ufo thing as I&apos;m Catholic and pretty  conservative on my view of such matters.

They stayed in perfect formation, and flew really fast from east to west.  They didn&apos;t make a sound, and seemed to be flying at  about 150 ft above.  We were all frozen, staring at them with disbelief until after they passed.  Then, petrified, we all ran inside as fast as we could and told person # 1 and 4 mother about what we saw.

I simply feel the story I have to tell should be discovered by those who study such things (in a scientific way). You see I feel it might be important because &quot;it&apos;s different &quot;.  What I saw and the way I saw it, seems not to bear any similarity to all the other things I&apos;ve ever heard about sightings in the general media.  It&apos;s not a subject I study; moreover, what I know is not material. WHAT HAPPENED WAS REAL!      It happened over twenty years ago in 1977 as my son (then about 10) and I were traveling by car from Alabama to California.  I&apos;m sure I might have been tired, for I had made that 2,000 mile trip many times over the years, but never without getting tired somewhat.  No, I wasn&apos;t &quot; dreaming &quot; or &quot; hallucinating &quot; or anything likes that.  With the experience I had making that trip, I knew when to rest and never to push myself to such a dangerous degree of instability; remember I HAD MY SON WITH ME.        It must have been after midnight, as we were fifteen miles north of Barstow.  I was driving a moderate speed of 50-55.  It was one of those beautiful nights of perfect weather.  The stars were bright without a single visible cloud in the sky, unlike the soon to be Los Angeles.  Being more reminiscent of my birth home in Alabama, I was particularly alert with my surroundings.  Enjoying it all with my driver&apos;s side window down; not knowing if I might ever see such a perfect night again.  The silhouette of the far off mountain range was very visible against the sky.  Even the nearer hillsides were visible with the outlines of trees and shrubbery.  THEN IT HAPPENED!      To my left I noticed the frontal approach light of an airplane.  Advancing from a ninety-degree angle, the light was pretty bright.  I know the distance of approach lights can be very deceiving in the night sky, but this light was near.  I had worked on the flight line and runway while in the Air Force and I had observed this very distinctive look many times at night.  It was much the same kind of light anyone might see around an airport except this one seemed to be heading straight for us.  The stars shone bright under and all around &quot; it &quot; as there wasn&apos;t a single cloud for reflection.  &quot; The light &quot; was definitely airborne.  I could see it was descending, as the space between &ldquo;it&rdquo; and the mountain range grew narrower.  Was it a private plane landing at a private runway? Was it a helicopter? Is there an airport near? Where are the ground approach lights? It seemed to quietly get nearer and nearer as I could detect no sound while it continued to descend.  With the relation of &quot; it&apos;s &quot; speed to mine plus perceived distance, whether illusion or not, &quot; the light &quot; appeared to be on A COLLISION COURSE WITH ME!      Not acting irrational, but with an instinct of self-preservation, I began to rapidly slow down.  Glancing down at the speedometer, it was showing 20- 25 miles per hour.  Looking back to my left, &quot; the light &quot; appeared as though it had slowed down its descent.  My perception was that &ldquo;the light&rdquo; and I were about to reach the same place at the same time!  I shifted and gave it the gas! The fuel-injected sports car I was driving was fast. As I glanced down again, I saw I was doing 80.  When I looked back at &quot; the Light &quot;, I was shocked.  &quot; The Light &quot; had sped up! Definitely on the same collision course as if it was &quot;locked-in&quot; or using me in some way.  In the next moment, &quot;the light&quot; dropped below the outline of the horizon and reached ground zero.  In the rough terrain approximately fifty yards from me, just over the other side of the road, &quot; the Light &quot; made a ninety degree left turn while traveling exactly 80 miles per hour.  It was now moving parallel to me at the exact same speed.  &quot; The light &quot; illuminated forward no more than about twenty feet, while lighting up the closest shrubbery in front of the it.  There was now the outline of an object behind  &quot;the Light &quot;.  The rounded cigar shaped object could have been anywhere from twenty to fifty feet in height, for I could not determine how far the terrain might dip below the adjoining roadside.  There were six to eight small square windows visible down the near side with even spacing.  Each window had an off-white lightning, much the same as you might see from your own house while outside at night.  Toward the front of the craft, there were two obstruction type lights, one red and one blue/green.  I was unable to see any outline of the rear of the craft; but what I could see, covered about fifty linear feet.  The object now made a distinctive sound like I&apos;ve heard before.  It was the sound of a turbine.  A turbine and jet engine may sound similar to some but as I have been around both many times, there is a distinct difference.  After it traveled along side of me about a half mile, it began to slow.  It appeared to be stopping as I KEPT DOING 80!       After traveling another five miles down the road, I felt I must have been nearing the outskirts of Barstow.  I could see an industrial plant or factory up ahead.  The lit blaze of a tower or smokestack was very evident yet over a mile away.  It looked no different than what most people may have seen around such factories.  I believe I&apos;ve heard it referred to as a&quot; Burn-off &quot;.  As I drove nearer, I could see there was more than one stack or tower.  Behind one blaze was another blaze. Closer to the blazes it started to become apparent that something seemed strange.  There were no stacks or towers beneath the blazes. The stars and sky were the only things between the blazes and the hillside.  Even closer now, the blazes began to take on a definite shape.  They were round; they were perfectly round, like &quot; fireballs &quot;.  After arriving parallel to the &quot; fireballs &quot;.  I decided to stop and observe.  There was a convenient clearing to the right of the road.  The clearing was large enough to allow me to back in and observe comfortably. Seemingly five hundred yards or so off the road and perhaps one to two hundred yards above the ground, still shining and flickering above the horizon outline with stars beneath them, were three &quot; fireballs &quot; of the same diameter, at equal spacing from each other, appearing to be of equal distance from the ground.  One would extinguish or go out and then come back on.  Then another would do the same, but with no apparent pattern to length of time for staying off or on; never knowing which one would one would go out next.  Could these be flares of some kind? Was this some kind of military exercise? After all, some kind of craft just landed back up the road.  But what kind of craft could make a ninety-degree turn at 80 miles per hour? Especially not straight at someone like that thing did to me, right? We could have been killed! The strangest thing about these &quot; fireballs &quot; to me was the way they would always be in the same place when they came back on.  Never changing in height above the ground or distance apart, they always maintained the same diameter and perfect round shape.  They certainly couldn&apos;t be swamp gas.  They had to be controlled by an intelligence of some kind.  What kind of technology would it take to control these things the way THEY WERE BEING CONTROLLED?       After observing almost an hour, I believed I wasn&apos;t going to see anything any different.  Leaving the strange lights, I drove on to our destination without further incidents, except for one thought----right before seeing &quot; the light &quot;, I remember seeing the headlights of another automobile in my rearview mirror about three-quarters of a mile behind me.  From then until I stopped to observe the &quot; fireballs &quot;, I saw no turn-off on that road.  You know, that car never did catch up to me. . . . .", "Very bright disc shaped object travelling at intense speedI was driving in my car with my Mum and brother travelling North along the A162 from Brotherton heading towards the roundabout for Selby.  From the corner of my eye to the right, I noticed a very bright light in the sky.  Initially I thought that it was a shooting star but we noticed that it was infact a disc shaped object and that it was travelling at a very high speed.  We only saw the object for a matter of seconds as it was moving very quickly.  The light was heading North and looked as though it was going to crash as it was quite low. I am almost certain that the object was not a plane due to the extreme brightness and intense speed that it was travelling.I am interested if anyone else saw this object as there was another vehicle not too far in front of us.((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.

It was during the day and would have been between 1960 and 1962.  I lean more toward 1962.  We were just sent outside so I think it was summer.  I believe that it was mid morning, say about 10am.  The object flew from south to north.  It was at an angle of about 10 degrees from vertical. We could not see the object, it was shiny.  Like it may have been a mirrored ball with a very bright light shining on it.  It left a vapor or smoke trail.  It took approximately 60 seconds to travel from horizon to horizon.  I do not remember it making any noise.  I did not see the object disappear over the northern horizon as I was yelling for my mother and ran inside to get her. When we came back out it was gone and only the vapor trail remained.  Shortly two delta winged jets appeared chasing the vapor/smoke trail of this object.  You could hear the noise of the jets.  Now I could tell they were delta winged but I could not read the lettering or the symbols on the aircraft.  I would hazard to guess perhaps F106&apos;s.  I am going to guess that they were at about ten thousand feet or higher.  We saw them crisscross the vapor trail.  I feel that they were traveling fast but not as fast as the object.  I could not tell if they were going overtop or under the vapor trail though for some reason I have a feeling that they were flying under it.  The location of this incident was in the Northern Catskills of New York.  The village of Tannersville is approximately 110 miles north of New York City and about 30 miles west of the Hudson River.  I have not talked about this for many years and I am just curious.  I watched the news that night.  At that time we got two channels out of Albany NY, and nothing was mentioned about a meteor or anything such.  I know that there had to be other people that saw this phenomena.  Now I have to say that I do not know what it was.  It could have been some sort of experimental aircraft.  I may have been a meteor though I feel it was flying entirely to ! slow and the jets would not have been chasing it.((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

I know what weather balloons look like. I know what jets look like. I spend a lot of time star gazing. I know altitudes from my weather days estimating cloud height. With all that in mind, I see from north to south at a REALLY high altitude (These are at the level of cirrus clouds, maybe higher) these two faintly glowing orbs side by side cross the sky at incredible speed (no port or starboard lights, just a faint orangy glow, totally different looking from meterorites). I can see them cross from when they enter my view at the peak of my roof to near the horizon in a matter of about five seconds. My eyes are totally accustomed to the dark. I have never seen anything like these before. I would love to know if anyone else saw them. Everyone keeps trying to tell me they were meteorites, and I know they weren&apos;t.

I look through the binoculars at other objects that I know to be stars to see if maybe I am getting the colors through some kind of distortion but the other stars are all white.  One evening, there was 2 of the objects about the same height in the sky and about 30 degrees between them.

I saw it from the ground one evening while I was at home  I later asked quietly if there was someone who took such reports.  I was directed to a Lt. Col. who was quite open about other reports that he had been given but he said he had not heard of one of my description.  He said that none of the reports that he had heard amounted to anything other than unprovable observations and usually just lights.   His role on base was informal apparently.  I asked quietly among the other pilots over coffee etc. whether anyone was seeing anything and most said no.One said that they had been &quot;paced&quot; by a light once and one reported seeing a &quot;sacucer&quot; over a lake at home.  The pilots/aircrew were interested but apparently not seeing anything.I report this now years later as I am surprised that rectangles have been seen by others.  This was large.((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))...On the other hand, the sighting was real and just so odd.  I would have truely rathered to have seen a conventional flying saucer.  What in the world did I see? Why was there not other reports?  This thing has to be big. Had my wife been 30 seconds sooner tothe door she would have seen it too. One would think the shapes would be more consistent.I&apos;ll keep reading your site and wondering&hellip;((name deleted))((END ADDENDUM))", "Rectangle.((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides a minimum amount of information about his sighting.

At the time I said to myself &quot;holy ((deleted))&quot; I&apos;m seeing a ufo.  Then I realized the craft had regular aircraft lighting.  What was weird was the craft was absolutely silent and traveling at about the speed of a car on a residential street 35mph.  I was an air traffic controller for six years both radar and tower, and for some reason I just wrote it off as some new military technology.  It was traveling east to west and I watched it go slowly out of sight.  In this area there is a radar range where aircraft rotinely practice terrain avoidance flights. I had seen quite a few other aircraft practicing this procedure in this area as the B52&apos;s used to do when I was stationed in ME.((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

There was no wind at all, and the sky was completely clear.  The temperature was around 80-82 degrees Fahrenheit.I was east bound and had looked up to enjoy the night sky.  When I scanned northward, (around 45-50 degrees up from the horizon)  I noticed what I originally thought to be three large birds heading towards the south.  I was in motion when I formed this initial impression.As they drew closer to my position, I couldn&apos;t help but notice that something was &quot;wrong with this picture.&quot;  It was then that I decided to stop.  I had been walking that particular route for years, at the same time in the evening and had seen all manner of birds.  This collection of objects was not behaving as birds do.As the objects came closer, it became easier to discern what distinguished these objects from, say, the ducks I was accustomed to seeing.  The formation of the three objects was utterly ridged.  Birds maintain a basic formation, but even in the evening--at such a low altitude--one can see a modicum of relative motion between the individual members.  This formation had no such relative movement.  It was rock solid.I had stopped perhaps a yard west of an intersection that was illuminated by a mercury-vapor sort of light.  The formation, at their closest point, passed directly over this intersection.  I estimate that their height from the ground to have been approximately one and a half telephone poles.  I judged them to be just under a meter in length.At this point the physical details of the objects became most evident.  They had nothing in the way of wings on them.  All three of them were shaped like bowling pins, and they moved with their longest axes parallel to the ground and with their heads defining the forward most point in the &quot;flight path.&quot; When the lead pin passed over the street light, I could tell that the body of the pin was smooth, and it appeared to be pewter in color.  They made no sound at all.  In fact, it seemed that they had suppressed ambient noise in some measure.Once over the lamp, the three pins continued their perfectly straight trajectory to the SSE (passing the local university) until I simply couldn&apos;t discern the bodies from the night sky.((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))Dear Mr. Davenport:I sincerely appreciate your timely and generous response.

The house is approximately 60-70 kilometers  ((NUFORC:  meters??)) from the Cheasapeake bay. I had been watching T.V. and had gone out for a smoke. I was facing east-(the Bay) when out of the corner of my eye,-I saw a quick streak from just slightly front and left to behind me(though it&apos;s entire path was visual perifially). It was in every respect, like a shooting star-(I had seen so many during my time there-and it was EXACTLY like a shooting star in every regaurd-Speed Path and duration. It was only as an-&quot;Aww-too bad...I missed it!&quot; after thought,that I looked up in the direction it had-(or should have) disappeared in that I turned and looked up to that point,- I was instantly perplexed by what appeared to be a jumbling or illuminated disturbance in the clear night sky-and I must admit, that it seemed like an attraction spotlight-(only with no &quot;beam from the ground&quot; attached to it). AND- it had no clear or concentrated form or direction and encompassed a much larger portion of the sky than an attraction spotlight would. As I turned not only my head attenuation,but my body as well to gaze at it, the illuminated disturbance moved from my left(west) to my right(east)in a very quick and abbreviated fashion and then disappeared as a tiny,ghostlike/neon,concentrated shape suddenly appeared in it&apos;s place,-the second the disturbance disappeared-(The approximate shape of a car&apos;s window shield and in comparison to the gigantic &quot;Wafting of air&quot;- MUCH SMALLER!) as it made a B-Line due south on a trajectory which was niether de or a-scendant,but was consistantcy of a jet flying on a straight and ulta-high altitude path. As it was nighttime, the shape was clearly defined-It&apos;s just that my memory fails me as to the exact,precise shape. It was either like a cars window shield, or like a triangle with it&apos;s top corner cut off- I went into town-North Beach the next day to ask if there was any &quot;at! traction or special event which would have fostered the use of a spotlight but after asking several locals,the only (even slightly) related testimony,-was that the vibration from a tremor or explosion had shaken a shopping center the morning of the very next day and had broken the windows of some of the shops therein. The &quot;Rolands&quot; Grocery Store Shopping Center with the McDonalds and (nearby)-the &quot;Rod and Reel&quot; Resturant. I am searching for a satisfactory explanation for what I saw,and it has taken a long time for me(as a devout skeptic) to realize that I have no explanation and that what I saw was defying of all my pre-held beliefs. I remember my first inclined emotion was one of violation-feeling that if what I had just seen was every thing I percieved it to be, then everything was now set on it&apos;s ear. The craft disappeared or &quot;Phased into the southern portion of sky-brightened by the (I guess) the Solomons Island City lights or perhaps Prince Frederick. there was no sound thruout and it happened over a period of about 5-6 seconds.", "1st - Brassy Metalic Hockey Puck Disc with black port holes and honey comb underneath.My cousin and myself were on the way to another friends house get some smokes. We saw this staationary light in the sky that we thought was a helocopter. We picked up some smokes and headed back to my aunts who lived in the core area. When we looked into the air the light was still there. It appeared to come closer and more clear. We coould see a honeycomb under the disc, and it hummed and hissed as it floated in the air. It floated there for a few minutes and gradually all the neighbors were out on the streets looking up at it. Oooo. Ahhh. What is that? A UFO, it&apos;s a UFO.Anyway it hovered for a few minutes and suddenly it flashed a very bright pinkish light from there honeycombs underneath., It shot rings of light from unterneath, one after another, you know like the way the transporter looks in Star Gate. Very quickly and in the blink of an eye it flashed and zoomed up into the evening sky. I always wondered what the heck could build such a craft and I would imagine how it would be to fly one. A memory I will never ever forget, thats for sure... I never had the opportunity to share this with anyone on such a large scale as the net, but that was not the first time I saw one.There was a time even earlier when I was a young lad back at home in a village in central manitoba. A brisk winter night. My brother, his girl friend and myself looking up at the sky saw an amazing light show. This experience too, is etched into my mind. About seven lights flew in formation across the sky from the north east. Suddenly they all shot off in different directions. I believe that it was in  seven different directions and then they all came back together at amazing speed and bounced off each other, as it appeared, and went in all directions again. They did this about four times before flying off for good.Well anyway, thats what I saw and I know that I am not crazy.. If I had a paper I could even draw it for you, I believe!!! There have been numkerous sightings in our region throughout the years and some of these UFOs even come only meters above the houses. I wonder what they want? What ever they are they must be man or flown, or what ever by super intellegent beings from another place or time..((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

On July 4th 2001 a friend of mine, his sister, and I were driving home from a fire works show in Long Beach around 10:30 or 11:00 PM. I was looking up in the sky in the back of the convertable and I saw a light suspended in the air, it looked like it was an airplane, except that it was not moveing as far as I could tell ( I was in a car going about 60mph) the odd part about this light is that it seemed to be dripping an orange-red fire, it would drip a few flames then stop, then it started dripping some more. I dont know how long the object was there for because we where driveing away. When we (my friend and I) looked back it was gone, a dark tree or building might have been obstructing our view, I cant say. I know what you are all thinking: it must have been fire works.

My wife pointed out to me a &quot;moving star&quot;. I noticed it and told her it was a satellite and resumed my star-gazing. In a very short time, 1 or 2 minutes, she said it &quot;changed directions very quickly&quot;. I then started watching the object. The object seemed extremely high in the atmosphere. It would move in one steady direction, then, as if it were tired of doing that, it would take a quick 90 degree turn in another direction. Then one of my friends noticed another object, then another. There were now a total of 3 moving &quot;stars&quot;. They roamed around a bit going one direction then another. They would also be moving east, then immediately go 180 degrees towards the west. They then seemed to group in a very large triangle after about 10 minutes of our observance. When they finally were in the triangle formation, they would move back and forth very rapidly from east to west in the 180 degree fashion. I am not gullable, nor do I jump to conclusions. This was the FIRST ufo sighting I have ever witnessed. It was very odd and I now have chills reporting this. The only theory I have come up with in the past 3 weeks since the incident is that they were some sort of military craft like a star-wars anti-missile(ICBM) craft.

I looked up to the south sky, and I saw what I had believed to be a meteor.  I saw an orange light, but was unable to make out any definite shape.  There was a trail behind it, much like you would see behind a comet.  I knew it was not a meteor, because it was moving slowly from south to north.  After about 5-10 seconds of this &quot;phenomenon&quot; moving slowly across the sky, it shot off in it&apos;s continuing direction towards the north.  There was no sound emitted by the craft, nor any ensuing sonic boom.  I got out of my car to get a better look, but by that time it was gone.  I also noticed two airplanes passing by the area where the event had occurred.  I have no knowledge as to what kind of aircraft they were, or whom they belonged to.  I talked to several other people in the general vicinity whom had viewed the same event.  We speculated what it may have been, and came up with a few things- possibly a fighter jet?  A satellite re-entering the atmosphere? An experimental aircraft?  We had exhausted the possiblilites, and then gave caution to the idea that it may very well have been an UFO.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness is describing the re-entry event that occurred at approximately 2120 hrs.

In the second half of the game I noticed a few individuals seated a couple rows in front of us were looking upward and pointing. When I looked up I saw nothing initially and then spotted a gray boomerang or chevron shaped object high above our heads. The object spun horizontally on the axis of it&apos;s left &quot;wing&quot; for a some seconds and then became stationary. It remained motionless for a time and then slowly turned vertically with it&apos;s edge facing downward, front or back edge I couldn&apos;t discern. The object took the form of a straight line showing a flat profile with no apparent fuselage or cockpit. These maneuvers took place over a three minute period and the motions were very slow but deliberate.I was raised in a neighborhood that is in the flight path of NAS Jax and that has afforded me the opportunity to observe various types of military and civilian aircraft from blimps and balloons to C130 transports and P-3s. Given my familiarity with aircraft this object was utterly foreign to me. The skies were cloudy that day and the color of the object was somewhat darker than the gray clouds. There were no features that could be seen with the naked eye or with binoculars and no external or internal light sources. Since it was overcast it couldn&apos;t be determined if the object had any reflective properties.There was a breeze in the stadium but whether there was any upper level winds I couldn&apos;t say. I couldn&apos;t judge with any accuracy the altitude of the object but the banner planes and the helicopter circling the stadium at approximately 700 feet didn&apos;t seem to notice the object. For some reason I had the impression that the object was slowly rising and thought it may have been debris from the banner planes, perhaps a letter L that had detached and was caught in an updraft. However the seemingly rigid structure it displayed when turning and spinning discounted that idea.I should mention that my brother was also observing the object with the naked eye and with binoculars and he perceived that the object was ribbon-like and pliant.This was completely counter to what I saw and I suspect that he wanted me to dismiss the object just as everyone around us had. Most of the fans in our area had not noticed the object and those who had spotted it initially now ignored it and were caught up in the game. I continued to observe the object for a full fifteen minutes during which time the object resumed a horizontal stationary position over the stadium with the chevron pointed north. After several minutes it slowly began to move in a northerly direction. As it progressed I noticed a commercial jet heading northwest, presumably departing from JIA. I guessed that the jet was still climbing and had not yet reached a cruising altitude of 32,000 feet. I guesstimated that it may have been at perhaps 26,000 to 28,000 feet and tried to determine the altitude of the object in relation to the plane. At one point I lost the object in the gray clouds and I believe it entered the clouds rather than was camouflaged against them.The plane however remained in view and didn&apos;t pass into any cloud cover. If the object did go into a cloud bank that would seem to indicate that it was at a higher altitude than the plane. The two were many miles apart and didn&apos;t pass very close to one another but I could determine that at their respective positions that the object was larger than the commercial plane passing nearby. I can&apos;t begin to imagine the dimensions of the object if my interpretation was correct. The object held it&apos;s course and eventually I lost it in the clouds. There was no mention of it in any evening newscasts.((NUFORC Note:  There must have been many witnesses to this event.  We would welcome reports from any other witnesses to this event.

I will never forget what happened, but as I was the only witness in my vehicle, I tried to dismiss it, but I can&apos;t, I marked down the date and time, so that if anything ever came out in the future, I would know I wasn&apos;t nuts. After watching a UFO show on TV, I decided it was time to do research and see if anyone else reported what I had seen. I know what time it was because I looked at my watch, so I would always know what time it happened. I had 3 sightings or encounters in that month, and nothing ever again. This was the first.I was driving  SE on highway 270 between the former Morse RD and 670 exits, on my way home from my mother&apos;s house, there were several other cars out at the time, as I was driving, something caught my eye up to my right at about 1 o clock.  It was a round cluster of lights, red blue green and white, from what  could see, I couldn&apos;t make out an object clearly just a cluster of lights in a circular pattern, what caught my eye was the movement pattern.  It was hovering in a spot and it would dart to one driection then another, like center, then  down right, then down left then back up to the hover point.  I have never seen any man made machine capable of such quick and precisely executed movements.  It looked like a pinball, being shot back and forth, though it hoved a bit at each ending point. I pulled over immediately to make sure I was seeing what i thought.  I sat there in awe, watching it dart back and forth so fast and in a way that defied normal flight, no helicopter etc could have moved that way, and it covered large distances in a so called flash. I looked at my watch to verify the time. I was terrified.  i saw 2 other vehicles pull over during that time, i assume they had seen what i saw, but i was scared so i pulled back on the freeway and drove on home.  I finally got the nerve to look online and see if anyone else saw this.A the next night , i was spending the night at my mothers in this same area, when something equally odd happened. I was in my little sisters room and we couldn&apos;t sleep, so we were talking.  suddenly the room started to shake as if vibrated by some huge motor and the room started to glow red-orange, brighter and brighter, like the light was coming through the window.  We heard a loud whirring metallic sound, like screeching metal that sounded like it had a pattern, almost like music. we were terriified, and it lasted for several minutes, the light kept changing, like it was in a search pattern, but the noise level remianed the same. my sister and i sat staring at one another, afraid to say anything, finally when the light went down a little i jumped up and looked out the window, i had to know what it was, i knew if i didn&apos;t look, someone could try to discount me. But after what i saw the night before, i had to know.  The glow was coming form directly over our house and also from the woods behind it, there was more than one source, i think the metallic &quot;music&quot; must have come from the one overhead, explaining why the volume never changed, but the light did. I am convined it wasn&apos;t a police helicopter or anytthing, i have seen them before. I have never seen one with orange light.  I never saw any craft of any sort, just the glow from above and the woods, obviously i couldn&apos;t see what was over the roof, i thought about popping the screen and sticking my head out her window but I was too scared.  It wasn&apos;t anyhting like the night before&apos;s sighting.  But my mom lives in the same area where i had seen the lights the night before.  i honestly believe the &quot;glow&quot; the following night came from government craft, possibly tracking or searching for the object from the night before in the woods behind her house.Strange radio frequency&apos;s can be picked up sometimes late at night out there, that have the same sound as i had heard that night, though never on the same channel twice in a row. And no it isn&apos;t static.  My sis and i heard somehting one night that sounded like German and spanish mixed together, being spoken too rapidly for anyone to understand, no music. I really don&apos;t know what else to say. I have no pics or anything, don&apos;t even know if this is usefull. I don&apos;t live there anymore, nor have i ever related this story before, but it feels good to get it out of my system.My sister saw and heard the same thing I did.

The formation seemed to be at the same altitude commercial jets use when they fly.It definitely got my attention, since I didn&apos;t think any pilots (military or civilian) would be flying at night in close formation like the Blue Angels.  The v-formation appeared almost vertical, poised to gain altitude quickly.  Each of the round lights seemed larger than regular aircraft lights, looking more like spotlights instead.  Also, even though the lights were bright, I couldn&apos;t see any outline of a craft.To my complete amazement, the whole v-formation appeared to come to a complete stop, and then all 7 lights started blinking and moving irraticly in and out of formation.  This went on for almost 10 seconds. Amazed by what I was seeing, I jumped up to get a better look, but just as I did so, the lights went back into v-formation and flew over my house, continuing south.I quickly ran to look out a window on the south side of the house to see it emerge, but there was nothing there.

A handful of lights moving across the sky caught the corner of my vision. Over toward the house behind a street light (in view) I seen 5 lights that were the size of stars along with the same brightness. I nudged my friend and just pointed. We started walking back towards the house when the lights were becoming a lot more identifiable. The 5 lights were in a half circle and sitting on the belly side of a huge triangle shaped ufo.  Both of us experienced a tone or ringing in our ears, other than that there was absolutely no sound.  When the vessel came into full view it couldn&apos;t have been no more than 300 to 400 feet off the ground and this thing was creeping. It couldn&apos;t have been going faster than 5 or 10 miles per hour. I knew it was strange because this thing was as long as my neighbor&apos;s yard and our&apos;s put together.  Anything human would have fell out the sky or been loud.  As it was passing we both noticed that the ship had blue wave like sparks coming out the back.  The sparks drifted for about 10 feet or so from the craft and just disappeared. When our view was starting to be compromised by trees we climbed the roof of the house and watched as it went over the 4 lane highway and skimmed across the trees until it was gone.

It did not fade or change shape, but it seemed soft/transparent, not solid.  It did not leave a trail.  Moved slowly and steadily, about the speed of a high-flying jet (as seen from the ground).

The first oval flew slowly towards the sun in the west and the 2nd soon followed.  The third started to follow,then changed direction and went the opposite way.  It turned slightly and I saw a metalic flash.  After about 15 seconds the ovals were gone.  We ran back to my house and got binoculars and a camera.  We returned and watched for the ovals again.

This lasted for about a minute before I was able to get up and look outside. When I did look outside the light was gone. I told my boyfriend about this and he told me a about a time about 20 years ago when his sister lived up in a hollar just above his house.

It is a triangular form, except at the bottom it is wavy with curves. It is in front of us in the sky. It is as close to us that u can actually see the textures and graphical features on this object. I would have to say that comparing the size of this object to the sun, it was smaller because of its actual distance though. My mother then stops the car, but at that very moment the object goes flying in the opposite direction and we lose contact.About a minute later, driving down the same road we tend to spot the same object again. This time the object appears from the right. It makes a semi-circle in counter-clockwise motion. It starts to hover over some trees. When at that moment, it enters the forests and flies between the trees. This is when we lose contact. I&apos;m not sure what this was. I&apos;m also not saying that this has any relation to aliens. All i know is that i know what i saw, and if u call me crazy, go ahead because im not blind when i&apos;m telling you exactly what i saw.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and found her to be convincing.

I watched it for about 5 seconds thinking it was an airplane getting ready to land at the nearby airport. It was moving from east to west at what I would consider normal aircraft speed, and then all of a sudden it snapped like it was connected to a large rubberband and flew back toward the east.

It would blink every two seconds. It was right next to the blinking red light that fades. Then all of a sudden the next time it blinked it blinked at a 45 degree angle. I could not see it move because it was really dark. Then when it blinked it went twice the distance at the same angle. Then when it blinked again it was 5 to 10 times the distance. It accelerated really fast. I was swerving on the road watching in awe. I told other people but they did not believe me. I still remember like it just happened yesterday.

The initial flash turned out to be some form of disk, which wavered on its course, reflecting sunlight as it dipped and wobbled.  At arms length, it was only the size of a small thumb tack, but the wavering motion clearly suggested a disk shape.  It had no lights, tail, wings or contrail.

Triangle shaped craft We have received mail from a young man in Portland, who, while laying outside watching the meteor shower had a very unusual event occur involving a triangular shaped craft which dropped out of the sky to a position directly above him at an estimated distance of 15 to 20 feet. The craft was described as having a &quot;red light like thing all the way around it and a black dome in the middle that turned white.&quot; He says there was no sound coming from the craft at all and, after what appeared to be about 5 minutes, it left as he heard the sound of a car coming in the distance.OUFOR contacted this witness and gathered a few more details from him. These are his words... &quot;During the 5 minutes that I lay there in surprise, I had a strange calmness come over me as well as a tingling feeling. When the black dome became white is when the tingling occurred. It couldn&apos;t have been more than 5 minutes though that&apos;s what it seemed like. I ran into the house afterwards, but I didn&apos;t tell anyone because they would just laugh at me and say I&apos;m full of it. Nobody, including myself, believed in UFO&apos;s until that night. I have had dreams both nights since it has occurred, of the craft, and also I have seen aliens in these dreams, but that is probably my mind seeing pictures of things I&apos;ve seen before and adding them in. The main reason I reported this is because I wanted to know if others saw the same.&quot; This now appears to be the third report of UFO activity in this area, the second of a triangular shaped craft seen during the meteor shower and the third from a sighting that was reported on August 1st which included two videos taken of the same craft on the same day. Analysis of that video have shown that this craft was found to be cruising the same area as this young mans physical address 3 months before his reported encounter which seems to be an abduction situation on the surface.Eric Byler - Oregon UFO Research.((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to Eric Byler, of Oregon UFO Review, for submitting this report.

The object moved very, very quickly, and silently. Upon reaching the southern shore of the lake, the object paused. Using binoculars and a 20X-60X zoom telescope, a circle of perhaps fifteen bluish lights were visibe on the botton side of the object. Altitude is not known. It could have been a couple of tousand feet high, or much higher (though it would have een a massive craft at, say 10,000 feet). All was silent.

One oserver phoed the base, was told no aircraft had landed or taken off from that AFB in three weeks, and, no, they hadn&apos;t seen any bright ight in the sky, but they&apos;d let us know if they did.Observers included about ten students of a new england prep school, aged 14-17, and ton faculty member, a Ph.D. in Classics. Another faculty member and his wife missed the event, having been in their tent for the duration.All observers were surprised, and many thought there must be a rational explanatio - Hollywood or something. all voiced the possibility, at least, that this was indeed an unusual aircraft.I was one of the observers, then aged 17. i have only ever mentioned this event to a handfu of people, and am reporting this on December 18, 2001. I am merely interested in knowing if there were ever any other reports from the vicinity of Lake Okechobee (sorry again about spelling) on March 14 or 15, 1976.

Such launches are not necessarily announced either ahead of time, or even after the fact.  One of the first possibilities that should be ruled out is a test launch of a ballistic missile.  The Poseiden missiles, scheduled for deployment on the Trident submarines, may have been under testing during the mid-&apos;70&apos;s, although this is just a guess.

It was pretty cold outside, so I bundled up in layers and took my 2 dogs out with me. Meteor storm was strong and sighted many right away.  Pretty consistent and most noticeable along the horizon in a 360, so I decided to go to the front of my apartment and face South-Southeast to watch. All meteors had long, distinct tails.  I live under one of the main flight paths for the Syracuse airport and I am used to all the planes. About 20 minutes into my watching I noticed  one plane that was going along at a slightly different speed, a little faster than normal for a plane with a very steady, smooth flight. At first I thought it was a plane, but quickly realized it had no landing lights on, no colored or blinking lights either.  This was a strong white light, about the magnitude of one of the planets, and wasn&apos;t blinking.  The shape was circular and it did not appear to be attached to any larger body, just a light. I have to mention here, that it seemed to blend in very well with the star-filled backdrop. If I hadn&apos;t been looking in that exact location, I would have missed it.  I watched it transverse the skyline for approx. 4-5 seconds traveling west to east, and then simply fade out. It did not burn up like the meteors or have a tail, and it was on a straight horizonital flight path.  Sort of freaked out by it and getting cold, I decided to go into the apartment to warm up.  At about 4:45 am I decided to stay inside and watch the storm from my glass door b/c the meteors were certainly strong enough to watch from inside.  There are two trees in my backyard and I have to look through the branches to see the sky, but it worked fine for viewing. It wasn&apos;t long before I noticed a second light just the same as the first, go from above my apartment and over the trees.  This one was slightly lower in altitude and heading from the South to the North. It didn&apos;t go very far in it&apos;s direction before it did the same thing by fading out.

I could fill out several pages with information from several different cities and in different states.  My most bizarre is a low-flying stingray that looked as if it was cloaked several years ago.

The blue pinpoint then wildly flew around the bigger orange ball that was getting closer to us so that we could see somr kind of structur to it.Then in a big blue orange flash thay joined together into a bright multi colored ball of light that lasted only a few seconds and then thay separated again. At this time this is all happening right above us less than 1500ft. away just below the clouds that would light up with the bigger flashes. Awsum huh?

On one of the pictures, I sight an ball-form object the origin of which I cannot understand. On one side it is rather transparent, on the other side it makes deep shadow. Moreover, the elliptic shape of shadow seems be not in full correspondence with the shape of the object.I took the photo of the object unwittingly; I didn&apos;t mention it that time. Thus, I didn&apos;t observe it directly by my eyes. Therefore, only from the context of the surrounding environment (bushes, hills on the background) I value the dimension of the object as 10 &amp; 20 meters.Of course, I scaned accessible to me video records of other participants of the flight. On one of them, I found the object. It was taken roughly 50 seconds later (the aircraft flight a circle).

I discussed it in detail will my father who urged me to report it.  He gave me this web site to do so.  Why did I wait to report it? I had a friend&apos;s husband who is a retired airforce pilot say that many sightings are reported in this particular area where an airforce base is and fly secret aircrafts that may look unusual to a civilian and I took his word for it.  But after looking this web site up, I saw another individual report a sighting on the same night in the same area and knew I had to submit my story....... I live in Jacksonville Beach and was on a trip to Pensacola to a company to give flu vaccines.  I left the beach at approximatley  2am.  I was traveling west on Interstate 10 in my car.  At 0405 I noticed a low flying aircraft flying toward me, traveling east. It was visible through the left of my windshield and left side window. I thought it might be a radar plane at first but soon realized it was shaped like a stealth/chevron. I wouldn&apos;t say it was larger than an average aircraft.   It had 10 large white circular lights on the bottom of the craft slowly going on simutaneously and then going off to where I could not see it.The lights were triangulary placed.  One at the point, then two, then three, then four.   When the lights came on it was very clear. It was shaped like a boomerang with a jagged edge, like the stealth.   There were NO other colored lights (Green/red)as would be expected in normal aircrafts.  To compare it to a full moon size, I would say it was at least one and a half times the size of the moon.  It made no noise, which scared me because I just went to a sea and air show with the Blue Angels here at the Beach a few weeks ago and witnessed many different looking jets and aircraft that were pretty deafening.  It seemed to travel very quickly for a craft flying that low. (Difficult to say how low, a guess...2-3 miles)  I slowed down to watch it go by, but it was gone in about 30! seconds , the lights went out and never saw them turn back on. I knew it wasn&apos;t anything I had ever seen and thought it may be a UFO.  I quickly noted the time, the exit I was closest to, a tractor trailer a quarter mile in front of me was the only other vehicle around, and I noticed him driving erraticaly as if he was trying to see it go by as well.  Im sure he saw it too.  I even wrote down his licence tag number to see if I could contact him later if I needed to, but I misplaced my notepad.  Im still looking for it.

My father was a Cub Scout den leader and my father, a friend, and me were travelling in the same car in route to a Cub Scout function.  There was another car following us with another Cub Scout and his step father.  We were travelling through the country towards Melvin, Il about eight miles away.  It was dark at this time and a winter snow storm had just hit.  As we were driving we noticed two bright lights at our two o&apos;clock position (NE).  I remember my father commenting, &quot;It must be two helicopters looking for stranded cars.&quot;  At the time my friend and I became excited about two helicopters flying low over the empty fields.  As we watched them we noticed they were on a direct path for us.  Being the young child I was at the time, I rolled down the window to hear the whoomp, whoomp, whoomp, of the approaching helicopters.  Only there was one problem, there was nothing, except the cold winter wind blowing across the empty fields.  As the lights came closer we noticed that the two lights came from the same craft.  Each light was positioned at the end of the craft.  The craft was the normal saucer shape, composed of three layers.  The middle being the longest, the bottom being the second longest, and the top being the shortest.  Keep in mind though that the top was metallic and extremley long (not a glass bubble).  The craft at this time was about 800-600 ft high and about 40 yards in front of us moving at about 20-30 mph.  My father stopped the car as well as the car behind us.  We rolled down the rest of the windows and watched as it floated over our heads.  It was so low that I am still able to remember the sight of portholes or tiny lights on the side of the craft.  Thinking back I am reminded of portholes, but not entirely certain.  The craft slowed as it floated over our car and came to rest in a field about 200 yards from us.  It maintained its altitude (600 ft or so) and just hovered silently.  I do remember looking up as it floated over the top of! us and seeing the bottom layer was donut like, hollow in the center.  The bottom part had a glowing effect to it, anti-gravity???  Anyways by this time my father was standing outside the car looking at this object along with my friends step-father.  By this time both me and my friend were in tears (same car) begging my Dad to leave.  Finally my father got into the car and took off.  The next thing I remember is being about a mile away and looking back at this object.  It had now tilted up at a perfect 45 degree angle and before I could get my father&apos;s attention it dissapeared.  Both my friend and I (occupied the same car) realize what we saw that night, and do not deny it.  My other friend has moved away now and I haven&apos;t talked to him in several years.  But with hard work I could find him to verify my story.  His step-father has passed away now.  My father still to this day thinks of that moment as one of the greatest in his life.  I believe if it wasn&apos;t for us children, he would have walked out to it.  I know it may seem hard for someone to remember these incidents, what with so much time that has passed.

It looked just like a bright star, like Sirrius, except that it was moving in a line from East to West in the sky. I know it was not a aeroplane or helicopter because there were no flashing lights or noise. It moved across the comet&apos;s path, turned in a tight circle and dissappeared.

At this point I asked the two people with me to take a look as well.  With their younger eyes they verified that it couldn&apos;t be a star, insomuch as it was showing two separate colors, green, and, yellow.At this point, we pulled out the binoculars for a closer look, and could just discern an irregular shape, as well as a twinkling, or pulsing of the colors.  Also, we noticed that the object had risen higher above the ridge line, and seemed to be a bit further away.Our total viewing time was approximately 30 minutes before we were forced to leave the mountain due to the cold temperature. As we departed, the object was still in it&apos;s position, ruling out the possibility of an aircraft.

Contact information for OUFOR appears below.  We believe the incident occurred on Monday night/Tuesday morning.  Please see other reports for events over Puget Sound, Washington, for October 15, 2001.  PD))For the sake of anonymity, the witnesses&apos; names will be Jack and Jill.I met Jill in 1990. She was talked into contacting us by her mother over concerns that she may have been the object of abduction over the period of a lifetime...three times throughout her life, including 1990 when we first began keeping a file on her. I was with MUFON at the time.I have become good friends with Jill and her husband Jack over the years and have had no reports of UFO activity involving her since that first meeting 11 years ago...that is until Monday, October 15th.Around 7:30AM, Tuesday morning, I got a call from Jack. &quot;Something happened last night&quot; was what he said as I answered the phone. He handed the phone to Jill and she immediately began crying profusely and out of control as she attempted to tell of what happened. I had to stop her twice to calm her down as I could not understand what she was saying.The night before, Jill and Jack went to bed at 9:30PM. At midnight, Jill was awakened to the dogs in the house &quot;going nuts&quot; and to a noise directly above the bedroom outside that was loud enough to vibrate the walls slightly with each pulse. The noise was described by Jill as being the sound you hear when someone takes a large but thin piece of sheet metal and bows it in and out, making that sort of &quot;whirring&quot; or &quot;whipping&quot; noise that comes from the vibration...only this was higher in pitch, perfectly rythem&apos;d, and many times louder, emanating from directly above the bedroom roof.She described her reaction as nothing less than total uncontrolled fear and panic. The dogs in the house were loud and frantic in their reaction to the noise.During the two minutes that this took place, she was unable to wake Jack as he simply laid asleep, not responding to the deafening noise from above, the panic of the cats and dogs and the screams of Jill to wake up, accompanied by hits to the arm and slaps to the face.Then, the noise disappeared, the cats and dogs were quiet, and within 5 seconds, Jack opened his eyes to see Jill staring at him, holding the cat, with eyes swelled shut and red from crying.&quot;What?&quot; Jack said. Jill reports that she was angry beyond words that Jack would not wake up during this but cannot understand why he didn&apos;t. Jack got out of bed, turned on the light and opened the bedroom window and listened but all was quiet. He then turned off the TV which had been left on earlier. He turned off the light and went back to bed. Shortly after returning to bed, the chimes on the clock rang on the hour but the tones rang with an intermittent rhythm and backwards from what is normal. Jack and Jill looked at one another, and again Jill began crying. Jill was unable to go to sleep for the rest of the evening.The next evening, I talked with them on the phone and had them go across the street to ask the neighbors if they had seen or heard anything but they were not home. Jack and Jill live in a very rural part of the country with very few neighbors and a lot of forest around their home.On Wednesday morning, I called to check on Jill before she went to work as Jack had already left. I asked if they had bothered to look closely outside for any signs of broken trees around the house. They had not. On the phone I had her go to the glass door that leads from the kitchen to the outside and look out and back toward the back of the house and above to see if she noticed anything. As she opened the door she looked out and yelled &quot;Oh my God, Eric!&quot; and began crying again.At the end of the house, just on the other side of the bedroom wall is a deck. Over the rail of the deck by the trees, in view of Jill as she looked down the side of the house, were all five chairs from the deck and the table with all 4 legs broken off, scattered next to the trees. She was unable to get hold of Jack due to where he works.The table and chairs where they lay as found after the incident.Jack called me when he got home that afternoon, before he had talked to Jill, and I guided him on the phone over to the door and had him look out. His reply was, &quot;oh shit!&quot; Jack reports seeing the furniture on the patio on early Monday evening as he went out to the deck to return a ladder which is kept under the deck.Jill has many interests, but talking about or following UFO information is not really one of them. She flatly states that she just knows this was a UFO over the house and has no doubt even though she was too terrified to look out the window during the event. Even during the time she was trying to wake up Jack, she was screaming at him that it was a UFO.On Saturday, October 20th, I went out to Jill and Jack&apos;s home where I took pictures of the back deck area and took samples of soil and vegetation in the areas where the chairs and table lay on the other side of the deck rail. Some of the pieces of the table legs were scattered around the area, one as far as 11 feet away from the table. Other items were noticeably untouched on the deck including the hot tub cover, a small tarp over that cover, several bottles of tub chemicals, two BBQs, a plant pot with only dirt in it, and a garbage can 1/4 full of garbage.It should also be noted that a yellow ash tray which had a permanent home on the deck was missing. Jack and I spent nearly an hour searching the radius of the area...a very thorough search...and the ash tray was no where to be found. Bothered by this disappearance, Jack continued the search after I left and as of this writing, Sunday afternoon the 21st, it still has not been found and Jack feels it&apos;s no longer on the property outside the home.The soil and vegetation samples will be sent to BLT Research for analysis to find out if the area where the chairs lay was exposed to any of the energies described in the research by Levengood, Burke and Talbot. Further findings of this investigation will be found here.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- UPDATE: On Monday the 22nd, I got mail from our Chief of Investigations Mike Downey of Portland. Mike had gotten a call on his message machine from Tom Henderson of the Polk County Observer Newspaper. Tom was unaware of the Jill and Jack case and was calling to ask if Mike knew anything of a report that he (Tom) had got at the paper over a sighting report that took place on Wednesday the 10th, five days before Jill&apos;s encounter. This new report to the paper involved a guy and his wife who saw a reflection of light coming through the window of their mobile home. When they went to investigate, they saw a yellowish, red light shoot away, up into the clouds at a high rate of speed. The couple did not leave their names and was hoping that something might have been mentioned in the paper about it. I contacted Tom at the observer and confirmed the story and that he could not help in locating this couple for questioning. There may be some mention of it in the paper in hopes of bringing these witnesses to OUFOR for a statement. Tom also noted on the phone to me that the paper had in fact gotten &quot;quite a few&quot; phone calls over the last couple of years concerning UFO sightings in Polk County. Those sightings were passed on to MUFON. Tom has agreed to pass on further sightings to OUFOR as well.Eric Byler - Assistant State Director, Oregon UFO Research.Editor - Oregon UFO Review.http://www.oregonuforeview.com", "2 objects in the ski moving from north too south at a very high rate of spped no aircraft marking lights at all but when one object flashed the other did the same number of times as the first did!

There were no apparent lights on it, so at first I figured it must have been a balloon or a plastic bag caught up in a breeze. It flew slowly in a straight line, and slowly disappeared as it flew out over the water.  Plastic bags usually don&apos;t do this and aircraft normally have lights on them (this did not), so I shot at it with a 11.6 milliwatt 632nm (green) DPSS laser while it was moving away from my position, but did not see any light reflected back.Since I can see the beam from this laser slicing through the sky at night, targeting was not an issue; it simply didn&apos;t reflect any of my green light back to me.About a minute later, I saw another, smaller one; going in approximately the same direction at approximately the same speed and in approximately the same flight path as the first.I shot this one with the laser as it was moving off as well, and *did* manage to hit it several times as I saw the green dot light up on what I believe to be its underside.  After I&apos;d hit it four or five times, it slowed down to almost a stop, abruptly turned to the north, and started moving again; only more slowly.  I half expected the thing to start shooting back at me; but instead, it slowed down again and came to a complete stop. By this time I&apos;d thrown the laser to the floor and kicked it under the bed. Then the UFO just hung there stationary like a one of several of the other stars visible near its position.After observing it stationary in the sky for 25-30 seconds, it simply winked out as if somebody kicked the plug out of the wall.There were no visible light sources on them (they appear to have been illuminated solely by reflected light from below), no sound was detectable, and no moving parts were visible.  Their color was sodium yellow; so they may have actually been white or light grey in color; and reflecting light from the sodium vapor lamps illuminating the streets in this area.  And both objects had a slow and rock steady flight; not fluttering, rocking, wavering, rotating, or changing speed/direction except as noted earlier.The size of the first one was approximately that of a small dress shirt button held at arm&apos;s length; the second one appeared to be about half that size.The laser I used has an effective range of only a few thousand feet with this amount of light pollution in the area, so the altitude of the object I actually hit had to be ~3,000 feet or below for me to be able to easily see the spot on it.Both objects traversed about 50&deg; worth of sky (a mile or two if they were at this low an altitude) before disappearing.I attempted to take pictures, but neither object was large or bright enough to show up on my cheap digital camera.  The pictures came out as just digital noise.I watched the meteor storm &amp; the sky intently for approximately another 90 minutes after this sighting, and did not see anything else out of the ordinary.I am a full-time museum curator &amp; product evaluator, I do not use drugs, and I haven&apos;t consumed any alcoholic beverages since mid-September.

When we got closer we saw that it was not attached to anything and was hovering, about a hundred yards up.  It was dark so we couldn&apos;t see the shape, but from behind I could see three large orangish colored lights in the shape of a triangle in the back.  By the time we turned around to go back, not more than 20 seconds, it was gone.

It made no sound and had no lights.  The surface appeared smooth, with no visible engine or tailfin  I couldn&apos;t make out the color but it appeared flat or matte, possibly gray.  The altitude of the object is difficult to gauge but based on the size, speed and  wingspan, from my perspective, it was larger than a 747, traveling 300-600mph at under 10,000 feet.  It looked like a giant boomerang, flat with a narrow fuselage/wings.((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.  PD))", "weird thing in texasI was outside in my front yard stargazing as I often do.

The light also was moving at a speed which seemed out of the norm for local aircraft i.e. jet fighters.

Driving southbound on Harrison Street at 9th Avenue--- STRANGLY ENOUGH where about a year ago I had a dream of seeing a UFO- I spotted a shiny object in my front field of vision. I slowed down, stuck my head out the window, and it just vanished. I thought it might just be a common sun reflection off of a plane. However, it now occurs to me that the sun reflection would have to be on the OTHER side of the plane, as I was north of the object.&lt;P&gt; I kept looking up in the sky casually, though slightly alerted. I then got in the turn lane of Colorado Blvd, waiting for traffic to clear to make a left turn eastbound. I then spotted either another object or the same object high in the eastern part of the sky.It was a VERY bright dot- just hanging in one spot, and rock solid, not moving at all.&lt;P&gt; I made my turn, and immediately parked the car on 6th Ave.&lt;P&gt; I got out of the car, and looked up to see a bright object, again totally immovable in the sky, about 60 degrees up from the horizon. Imagine how bright this object must have been to catch my attention from inside my car, waiting to make a turn, in broad daylight. I had one small Fuji Finepix 2.1 (4 MP extension) megapixel digital camera in the car which I used to take about 10 pictures, the best of which are below. This camera has only a 3X zoom lens-- IT FIGURES! This day I did not have my high power digital zoom video camera with me (never again!!)&lt;P&gt; Never the less, you can clearly see the object between the light and the curve of the lower tree branch.&lt;P&gt; Upon enlarging, the object appears to be a metallic sphere, with light reflecting off of the upper right hand side- facing the position of the sun. &lt;P&gt; I watched the completely stationary object for about 15 minutes, up and down the street, even driving around the block , and confirmed its presence by talking with about six other people waiting for the bus (they had not seen it until I pointed it out, then confirmed it was there).&lt;P&gt; I then decided to quickly drive home and get my telescope and more powerful cameras with stronger lenses. From my home a mile away, the object was not visible. When I returned to the exact same spot about 10-15 minutes later the object could no longer be seen. &lt;P&gt; I returned home and checked my computer sky chart program to see if there were any planets or bright stars in that part of the sky- and there was nothing at all. The brightest star above the horizon was Vega, and at 3 PM, it was completely invisible, as well as not being in the same part of the sky where I had seen this object. &lt;P&gt; I considered that it could be a mylar birthday or maybe another balloon reflecting sunlight, but given the amount of time that I watched it, its&apos; apparent size at a distance and brightness (I could judge it was very high up from my perspective as I moved down the street, and that it did not budge any perceptible amount whatsoever during this time, this seemed pretty much impossible. A balloon in the atmosphere would move up or to the side- and this object was absolutely rigid in one location, as a star would be (and I ruled out any possibility of celestial object with my investigation).&lt;P&gt; I thought that maybe it could be a stationary satellite reflecting the sun, and so I would return on the next day and see if it was again visible. I returned again to the exact same spot at the exact same time the following day with the same weather and carefully scanned the same part of the sky, but absolutely nothing could be seen, ruling out a stationary satellite.

We literally stopped the car in the middle of the road, and got out. This gigantic white sphere hovered at treetop level. It made no sound, and didn&apos;t make a reflection on the water. Then suddenly, the light was gone, and then it almost instantly reappeared much farther away over Gulf Beach (on Long Island Sound) We drove down to that beach parking lot where other people were out of their cars looking at the same thing. It began to slowly move NE along the coast line. Many of us got in our cars and followed it along the beach line to Woodmont. Then all at once, it was gone.

I was driving back to Dallas to attend college after I had a visit with my mother in the small, west Texas town of Knox City, Texas. I was passing thru a small town called Megargel,Texas. As I was leaving the small town, I noticed a red truck pulling into a driveway at the edge of town. A few minutes later, out in the country, a strange haze was seen all around. It left just as quickly as it came.This is where it gets strange, I passed thru the town of Megargel again. When I reached the edge of town, I saw the same red truck pulling into the same driveway. I never turned around at any time. When I arrived at my apartment in Dallas, my watch and car clock were 10 minutes behind all the clocks in the apartment and everywhere for that matter. I lost 10 minutes somewhere.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "I saw a bright, erratically moving light, the movements of which seemed to be beyond the capabilities of any manmade aircraft.I went out onto my front porch at just after 3 a.m. to try to view the meteor shower.  Immediately I noticed a bright light to the south and a little west, about 30 degrees up from the horizon.  This light was continuously moving up, down and sideways in both directions. Since I could not tell how far the object was from me it is hard to say how far it was moving.  It was not darting across the sky, but it was moving in a tightly contained area, like a firefly in a very small jar.  If I had to guess I would say it was at least a half a mile away, possibly even several miles away, depending on it size. Over the course of the time I observed it, its position slowly moved west and possibly farther away from me, as it seemed to become dimmer.  Its shape was hard to determine because I had no binoculars, but I got the impression of a triangle, and I seemed to see colored lights at times, such as red and green.  The light also seemed to increase and decrease in intensity at times, although it was always quite bright.  My attention was also drawn to another light to its right (west) and slightly closer to the horizon. This light did not appear to be moving and was much dimmer.  It may have simply been a star, but I thought it was interesting that its distance from the first light seemed to stay about the same, even as the first light moved slowly west.  I also got the impression of seeing other lights moving around in the vicinity of the first light, but they were very fleeting and faint.  If this was a conventional aircraft, I cannot understand its movements.  I wondered if maybe it was a helicopter or a balloon, but the quickness of its movements would seem to make this impossible.  There was no particular wind that night that I am aware of.  My home is in Lake Forest Park, but the object was probably over the city of Shoreline or possibly even Seattle.", "Huge Black Transparent Silent ChevronAt 00:28 a black chevron was seen west of Lombard, traveling south in a plane-less sky.At 00:20 I looked outside and was surprised to see a clear &amp; star filled sky, as generally the planes keep spraying something which creates perpetually cloudy sky over Chicago. I got out my Russian panoramic viewer, the best night vision available in my opinion, and started scanning the sky. No air planes could be seen or heard, which is unusual because I live under the landing path to ORD. I looked to the West at about 45 degrees above the horizon and almost missed a solid black chevron slowly moving silently across the midnight sky. Absolutely no light was emitted from the craft which was itself darker than the sky behind it. As this wide, chevron shaped wing passed in front of the star studded sky - the stars did not fade behind the wing but appeared to keep shining through an invisible structure. I assume the ship was able to bend the light around it adding to its stealth. The event lasted about 3 minutes and this object moved slowly due south - aprox. over Wheaton, possibly even farther west. No idea how far away or how high it actually was but it did not reflect the laser light that I directed at it. This ship was HUGE (my guess is one mile across) and I feel it is part of a larger geometric structure whereby 6 craft would create an immense, six sided ring with another - solid craft in the center. The wing was the same width from one end the other and each end was straight - like a straight cut on a piece of lumber with two 90 deg. Corners. (I could fax a drawing) This craft had a pointed leading edge and the chevron had about a 120 angle with the wings sweeping toward the rear. No curves could be seen, only sharply defined edges. There were no vapor trails. I could not determine the thickness of this craft, but by its darkness and how I almost missed it with my high power nightvision - nobody would &quot;EVER&quot; see it using binoculars. Video would never have revealed this object in the night sky either.

The color was like a silvery color, but it seemed to change reddish and sort of a bluish color. It slowly glided over some freeways but it was really high up. It was clearly as high as an airplane would be. But there were mountains in the background. I kept my eye on it for sometime. Um, don&apos;t worry, I wasn&apos;t driving and looking at this thing at the same time! But I kept a close on it and in a blink, it vanished. I kept my eye out for it, but it had just vanished and never returned!((NUFORC Note:  Source remains semi-anonymous.  PD))", "There was a roundish object with glowing, shifting lights lining the edges of the craft as it hovered silently above the trees.I had to guess a bit on the exact date and time of the event, as it was several years ago, and it is something I really don&apos;t go around telling alot of people about. I had just left a friend&apos;s home, who lived in the small town of Morris. I always enjoyed riding around and listening to music, and after driving a bit, I headed back towards his home, becuase the road he lived on was, at the time, somewhat secluded, and great for star-gazing(since it was away from city lights).I pulled off the road, rolled down the window, and had the radio softly playing. I was digging around for some cassettes to listen to, and something caught my eye. It was up to the left, just over the treeline. It seemed quite large, and was moving very slowly. The lights on it were glowing softly, and not flashing in quick succession, as aircraft usually have. I am a UFO buff, but didn&apos;t think that was what it was at first; my guess was it was a helicopter. It was way too slow for a plane.I turned down the radio and listened. However, I heard nothing.Now, at the time, I was unaware that some UFO sightings were marked by the lack of noise accompanying the craft, so it was a shock to see this thing hovering so low above the treeline, and not hearing a sound. I was totally scared. It dawned on me that it was not anything recognizable to ordinary citizens. I tried to convince myself that it was a sort of experimental thing maybe, that the military was working on. If so, they were pretty far from any bases.Then as I sat and watched, I noticed the colors around it seemed to melt into each other, much the way the Mars looks on a good night-- it went from orange to green to red, softly and slowly changing as it moved slowly above the trees, as if it were looking for something.I had determined in my mind that if this thing headed my way, I was going to speed up the street to my friends house, who was only about a 1/4 mile away. My heart was pounding. It was hard to really make out the exact shape, but it seemed roundish, with lights all around the base. As I said, time and secrecy has dimmed my memory a bit. Though I know if I saw it again, I would KNOW what it was!(And I have, but that is going ahead of myself.) Then it did what I hoped it wouldn&apos;t-- it stopped in mid-air. I froze. My hand was on the key getting ready to crank the car and take off. I watched it as it began slowly rotating in a circle. Then after a few rotations, it began moving off behind the trees, back towards town.Since it only seemed to be about 2 miles away, I decided to chase it. I was scared, but I hoped to find someone who mihg tbe stopped on the road who also saw it. I sped off in the direction it went, but the whole way back to town, I never passed a single car! Typical.It was a long time before I told anyone, except my friend, and I swore him to secrecy. He said he believed me because he could tell by the sincerity and seriousness in my voice that I was not playing around.As a sidenote: a year or two later, NBC ran a UFO special one night, and they showed a re-enactment of some policemen in a small town who had seen three UFOs. They described what they saw, and in the video re-enactment the UFOs looked exactly like what I saw that night! My mouth hit the floor, and my heart raced as I was suddenly taken back to that night. It was a Wednesday night, and my wife wasn&apos;t home(she had gone to church). So it was frustrating once again not to have something tangible to show someone that would help validate my experience. I keep hoping to see that special again, or that maybe I will find photos resembling what I saw, but I have yet to come even close.((NUFORC Note:  The date is approximate, and we have arbitrarily assigned a date, such that the report will sort to August 1995.

I set my alarm for 4:30 am to observe the meteor shower on 11/18/01.  Went outside, sat down, and watched the sky for about 10 -15 minutes.  I noticed a star-like object that appeared to be moving very slowly (like a slow airplane)to the south west of my home.  At first, I thought it was an airplane but then realized that it was WAY too high to be an airplane so then I thought that it could maybe be a meteor but it was too slow for that - plus didn&apos;t have a tail.  I watched the object move across the sky and curve back to the right and disappear (or fade out) beside a star.  I thought that it was weird, as I have never seen anything like that before.  I waited about 10 more minutes to see if I could see it again but it never came back.  I got the creeps and went inside!

The distance was covered in ten seconds.  Airliners usually take 30 seconds to cover the distance.  Lights were white, not as bright as the stars.  No noise or emmissions observed.  The observers counted 7 to 9 circular lights in a &quot;V&quot; formation.  They maintained a steady course, speed and altitude.  The observers consisted of members of one family.", "Craft UnknownWhile driving on interstate I-75 north bound at approximatly 6:05 pm between exit #33 and exit #34 an object appeared in the north eastearn part of the sky. It looked to be approximatly 500 to 1500 feet up in the sky, and approximatly 1 mile from our current position. At first glance it appeared to be a plane heading in our direction which would be to the southwest. Almost immediatly it was determined by myself and the driver of the car that it was not an ordinary aircraft. At first there were two lights in the front of the craft positioned when an ordinary commercial airliner would have its headlights. The two lights were at least 10-15 feet in diameter and were blinking on and off one at a time. (one off and then one on again). On the top of the craft were a number of small, bright blinking lights maybe 5 or 6. These lights were similar to what you would see on the top of a tower antenna. (a very bright strobe affect). There did not appear to be any determinable shape or angles to the craft. There was no shape of a wing or tail found on either a plane or helicopter. As we got closer we saw that there was another large bright white light turning on and off in a pettern with the first two lights that were seen. As we approached the craft it appeared to be completely stationary just to the side of the interstate. I then stuck my head out the window and observed the same bright lights that wre in the front and side of the craftin what now appeared to be the rear of the craft. We were now going approximatly 60 mph and as soon as I brought my head into the car to get a better view from the rear window it had completely disappeared from the sky. We scoured the sky for maybe two more minutes to find any sign of the craft, which had appeared to have disappeared. It was still very light out at that time of day and the craft appeared to be black or grey in color. There was a group of about five cars driving in the group with us and all of the people in the other cars had appeared to acknowledge the craft and ha! d baffel ed looks on their faces. Myself and the driver of the vehicle could not think of any type of craft that we knew of that this may have been.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found him to be quite lucid and credible  PD))", "I did not see it at the time.

I was looking out my window facing what would be north and suddenly saw moving at an incrediable rate speed about 6 to 8 bright white oval shaped discs low on the horizon (it was dark outside at the time).  It was amazing and at first and did not comprehend what I had just seen.  I actually remembered rubbing my eyes afterwards in disbelief!  The astounding speed and quitness of these ufo&apos;s was just incredible (window was opened).  The distance of these objects appeared to be far off as the shapes were small but very distinct.  I sat there and tried to understand what it might have been in those 5 or so seconds (it felt longer).  It was a steady speed and I had the advantage of a broad playing field in the sky to see the trip.  I tell you, I have never ever seen anything like it.  I recently saw, two summers ago, a small meteorite enter the earth&apos;s atmosphere (orange with lots of afterburn behind it) and it couldn&apos;t compare to the speed of that event burned long ago into my mind!  I have never before made public this event to anyone as I thought it would be shund upon or laughed at.  But now after all these years, I can still paint an exact picture as I think about it everytime I hear or see ufo information.  And, to all of those thinking, it wasn&apos;t a meteor shower, as it was too deliberate of formation and moving parralel to the horizon.((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.

I stopped the driver and we all got out and watched as it approached and then passed by at a fairly slow speed.  As it got closer we could see that it was not a cone but a grouping of lights with one very bright light and several smaller lights with tails streaking behind them.  When I first distinguished the individual lights I thought, could this be a formation of helicopters coming towards us with search lights?  But there was no noise.  As the lights passed we jumped back in the vehicle and turned around thinking maybe we would see it go down.  We were in an area southwest of Ozona and there are a lot of canyons and high hills.  We were able to see it as it went out of sight over one of these hills.  The hills were about five hundred feet above the road we were on and because the lights disappeared over their horizon very quickly, we believe the lights were at a very low altitude.  It did not seem to change elevation.  I don&apos;t know if it is possible but it was like a slow moving group of meteors of various sizes being projected in front of us like a hologram.

The road is hilly and offers a decent view of Tulsa and the surrounding area.  I had noticed a single light (what I casually thought was a low-flying small plane) to the south-southwest.  The light was sustained and did not pulse.  It didn&apos;t occur to me that it should be blinking, because not long after I saw the light, my wife exclaimed that the &quot;object&quot; had just emitted or split into several lights.  At least one central light suddenly became 5.  One in middle and 4 or more around it kind of in a staggered formation.  My first thought was that it was a formation of helecopters or F-16s (Air Guard has a squadron of both within 30 miles of the area).  The lights did not pulse, however.  They were sustained.  There was a main glow to the lights and a slight streaking or trail.  We slowed to observe the object as it passed across or field of view from South to North.  As it passed the lights seemed to glow with different colors (Orange to Red, Green to Blue, and Gold).  It was hard to get a good view of what the exact shape of the object(s) were.  However, we were able to make out what seemed to be an outline of the central object.  It looked tubular (almost like an airliner fuselage or a missle).  The central object&apos;s outline looked much longer than any commercial or military aircraft (I&apos;ve seen C-5s up close and this looked bigger).We slowed enough to role down our windows and listen...no sound from where we were.  The objects seemed kind of &quot;hazy&quot; and yet were pronounced enough to see points in the sky in addition to the presumed outline of the main body.We watched as the objects moved to the North out of our view.  From the backside, it seemed that the lights had more of a green hue than orange or gold.  Although our vantage point may have been poor to determine altitude, it really seemed like not more than 10,000 feet.  It seemed like it was an object that would land (rather than crash) because the nose seemed to be pointed upward from the tail as it traveled from South to North.We went home and immediately tried calling News Stations (all busy).  I reached the Air National Guard after hours Security Office who referred me to the Tulsa International Airport Tower Security.  TUL stated that it was a Satellite that fell out of orbit and crashed in Kansas.  That was mindboggling as we had seen the objects less than 10 minutes before and we are 70 miles south of the Kansas line.  The objects certainly did not seem to be traveling fast enought to descend and crash somewhere in Kansas.  That&apos;s neither here nor there.Nevertheless, KJRH News reported it in the news broadcast as a crashing satellite.KOTV News reported it as &quot;space junk.&quot;  KTUL didn&apos;t report it until Sunday, December 2, 2001 as a Russian SL-12 Rocket re-entering the atmosphere.  KTUL said it probably did not crash to the ground, but burned up before it hit the ground.  KTUL went on to clarify that if the object did hit the ground, it probably crashed somewhere in Kansas.   If so, I want to see pictures of the crash site.

I didn&apos;t expect anything to show up, but I&apos;m glad I went and watched. and had my camera ready.((NUFORC Note:  We have requested of the witness that he forward copies of the photos, but we have not heard back from him, yet.  We note that someone, unknown to NUFORC, had made a public &quot;prediction&quot; that UFO&apos;s would make themselves visible above the Olympic Games in Utah.  So far, this report is the only one NUFORC has received that would provide any credence to the &quot;psychic&apos;s&quot; prognostication.  PD))", "Orange streaks in the sky.  Location:  W. Rutland, VermontDriving North on Rt. 4 in W. Rutland, Vermont on January 3, 2002 I saw an orange streak in the sky.  I thought it may be a reflection on a jet from the sun going down since it was about 4:45 pm.  Then I noticed 3 other streaks.  I slowed my car then noticed the largest streak (the 5th and last streak I saw).  It was much darker orange than the other streaks and much longer and appeared wider.  It seemed to be moving toward a mountain, but because I was still driving, I may have imagined that.  But, I saw 5 orange streaks.  I can&apos;t believe that there were 5 planes or jets in the sky at once since we don&apos;t often see planes in the sky in this area of Vermont.  I am not saying these were UFOs but I don&apos;t have any reasoning of what they were. Also, I do not think they were jet fume trails. But, I don&apos;t know.", "Rumbling UFO spotted over Placentia, CA.Lately, in the evenings I am aware of a very loud plane noise that lasts an inordinately long time. The sound is so deep and rumbling that it does not sound like conventional aircraft. The first time I went outside to try and see where it was coming from,I stared up at the sky for almost 15 minutes - but saw nothing. This evening I was leaving my friend&apos;s house in Placentia around 9:45 pm. I heard that same noise. As I reached the parking lot, I stared up at the sky and observed two white lights. The lights struck me as being MUCH too far aprt to be the lights on a conventional airliner. It was impossible for me to tell how high this thing was. I didn&apos;t see anything in between the two lights. The craft was cruising in a westward direction. When it got about 2 -3 miles away it abruptly switched directions and went south, then it switched again and came back east in my direction. I may have lost sight of it behind some trees, but when I saw it again, it was now two flashing red lights which seemed to continuously change their position in relation to one another. And the lights were not like the type you&apos;d see on a plane, they had kind of a jittery, laser like quality. The two lights became 4 or 5, and were forming various triangular shapes with one another. The way they moved was erratic, not at all in a linear fashion. They seemed to join back together to create one light and headed off in a northeasterly direction. My friend remarked that he had never seen any plane move that fast. I feel that I was lucky to have seen a craft at all, because as I mentioned usually when you hear that loud rumbling noise, you do not see anything that could be creating it. As a matter of fact, my friend&apos;s husband was leaving for work one morning recently and heard that same noise, and despite standing there for 10 minutes and staring at the sky,he saw nothing. Sure would like to know what it was.", "3 teardrop grey shapes, seen by boarding house, no noiceThree teardrop objects were seen by all occupants of a boarding house, they were grey with a tinge of pink, they had two sets of lights, one set brighter than the other. They were travelling NNW, at around 20km/hr, and were at about 500 feet. They was no noise, just an eeire silence, then the house dog started to bark and howl. We have 61 witnesses that all give similar accounts.", "There were 2 sets of 4 all in a straight line.  Slowly one by one the bright light started to disappear (as if the light was being turned off by a dimmer switch) in the first set of 4.  The second set of 4 - the second light from the left slowly went downward toward the earth. and then slowly disappeared. Then the first light, fourth light and third light (in that order) slowly disappeared.", "A flash was seen inthe sky, it did not move in  a steady direction, but up and down and back and forth left and rightAt approximately 19:38 a flahing light was noticed approx.355 degrees west.it was a flashing light that hovered in the same spot for approx one and a half minutes.  There was a little up and down movement then it dissappeared.  It reappeared approximately 5 degrees east for about one minute, same flash, no movement except for a little up and down and this time a little left and right.  Then, it dissappeared again.  At approx 19:50, three different flashes were seen and dissappeared.  The first of the flashes were approx 340 degrees west. The next was approx 83 degrees east. then the final was back to the 355 degrees west.  All of the flashes held there position and remained for about a minute.", "intelligens elsewereI was driving in a stolen car a light apperd and, i was taken from the car to the spacecraft, the aliens showed my the future, and today i have special powers,  suddenly i was back in the car and drowe in to a tree, a policeman saved my  when i woke up i was on the hospital, I went from being a careless human to a new kind of human today i dont now who I am !!???I had to be told my name, introduced to my brother and mom and dad, grandparents,uncle and other reletives, today I&apos;m living alone with my labrador dog, I only talk with my brother, mom and dad, sadly my grandfather, died last year, i miss him, but now that when human&apos;s die there is no new life only this one life, so i look out for my self, I have never seen anything (u.f.o) since 1992, but this story is 100% true, I now it becauce, It was ment to be!!!!

Ellington Air Force Base is about 5 to 6 miles south of my house. and the lights were about 25 to 35 degrees from the ground. at first i thought it was just aircra! ft and d idn&apos;t think to get the camera and by the time that i realized something was going on i didn&apos;t want to leave the scene, and soon after it was all over with.", "A tight formation of three crafts that zipped across the sky but stoped for a minute and then flew off again.The dog was barking loud on the front porch at some wild coyotes howling off in the background, so I steaped outside to listen to them crying in the backwoods. I lit up a cig and looked up and noticed off towards the north-western sky there was three something zippin across the sky in a tight pattern, then as I cleared my eyes by blinking afew times I noticed it stoped and seemed to pulse with lights acouple blinks and zip gone.and thats it, it reminded me of a tringle formation but seem to rotate.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
