I was just about to Potosi, MO when I spotted something heading toward earth with a huge orage streak behind it.  At first I thought it was a jet,  but it was too large to be a jet.  It seemed to be a black object  with a huge amount of flames trailing behind it.   It was heading South.  I watched it for a good 4 minutes before I lost sight of it behind a very big group of clouds.  I was looking for it again and I caught sight of it as I passed by where I thought I might see it.

Out first thought was that we were seeing Mars, although  it appeared to be too bright to be Mars. The object then appeared to be moving closer from a westerly direction. As it slowly approached it changed directions to a northeasterly direction. It had one very bright central light and two red blinking lights. The object then moved almost directly overhead at an altitude of roughly 1000 feet. This particular night was perfectly clear with no wind at all. As it approached we waited for some type of engine noise, but as went overhead it was absolutely silent. It then proceded to the east and out of our sight. The three lights on the object outlined a triangular shape.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We were walking down a boardwalk right after work.  The airport was to the right, to the east - about five miles away.  I saw a light hovering in that direction.  At first it looked to be a helo or close plane.  Then, as quickly as I spotted it, it started moving sporadically; first to the left, then to the right, then back, then back, then up, then down, then 20,000 mph to the right and gone.  Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;m fully convinced that it was a gov&apos;t craft - or worry.  The only thing I have trouble with is that about four years before, I witnessed a craft do the same type of motion, exactly.  And not only that; we were talking about that previous experience when this one occurred.  However, my previous observation was of a craft that was so far away it was equal to a satelite in distance.  I grew up watching stars and planets and I do know what I am talking about.  Currently, I own a four and a half inch reflector telescope which I can see the rings on Saturn and the moons of Jupiter.  Well, four of them.  Back to the original story; This craft was so close it could have been a local craft before it started to move in a manner consistent with a non-earth-craft type of motion.  I hear the Discovery channel skeptics who relate observations like this one to energy and motion hallucinations.  These people are on the pay-roll, don&apos;t listen to them.

We were located on Crescent Beach. We were all out on the beach at approx. 1:00 p.m. Facing away from the ocean were myself, my husband, and my father, chatting with my mother who was tanning on her beach towel.  I happened to look up into the sky above us and noticed a round, grey object moving at a steady, fairly rapid rate of speed. This object was absolutely not an airplane of any kind and appeared to be very far away, far enough away in fact that when it reached clouds it appeared to move either behind or through them, appearing on the other side. I got the attention of my father and husband in time to point and ask, &quot;What is that?!&quot; The three of us watched as this object moved across the sky (right to left) and disappeared behind a cloud, not exiting on the other side as it had before, just disappearing into &quot;thin air&quot; I suppose. The same or following day (I can&apos;t remember which), I took a photo of the ocean and skyline. I don&apos;t recall the time the photo was taken, but there was no sound of any kind of aircraft at all.  I noticed nothing in the photo until I loaded it onto my computer from my digital camera and saw a round grey object hovering above the ocean in the right side of the photo.  There is nothing in the sky at all (even clouds) except this strange object. This is not any type of aircraft that myself or any member of my family could identify, therefore I can only imagine it may be a UFO. It is rather creepy.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting event is approximate.

As we were talking, I saw a glowing green substance or object coming horizontally in the air, just in my view over the main office building across the street.Upon seeing, I asked my friend to take notice.  We just set there and watched it go through the air until it disappeared.  After discussing what in the world it could have been. The prospects for explaining it as a shooting star or falling space debree were impossible.  I promptly told my friend I was going inside and calling our local radio station to see if they were getting any calls about this sighting.....they were.(about 4-5 calls the DJ said) The DJ is calling around different places trying to find an explanation, however he is not finding one. I have looked through some reports of UFO sightings on reporting sights and found one explanation of a sighting that sounds like a possible match since we only had a side view.  It was a sighting on August 8, 2002, in North Royalton, Ohio. Anyway, watch the skies. There are unexplained objects flying.Whatever they are God knows!", "We watched the object hovering for about 12 minutes when it streaked out of sight, it was alarmingApproximately 3:15PM while at my friends home, I was directed by her to an object in the sky. Clear blue skies with no visible clouds was the background to the object we became curious about. It was too far up or away to make out a shape but, I went to get her binoculars &amp; through them was able to distinguish it as Silver object with a bright Turf Green &amp; red-orange light.  It&apos;s location was North-East of the home &amp; we looked up at it at an approximate 45-50* angle. We thought it was a hot air balloon but thought it was odd for it to be so high.  It seemed to just hover at the same altitude &amp; location for 8-10 minutes from when we spotted it then it began to get smaller or further away for a couple minutes becoming harder to find when we looked away but, still visible without the binoculars.  A small jet passed flying Northwest almost intersecting our view of the object &amp; then shortly after that a commercial jet flying higher &amp; a similar direction passed both giving us the impression that the object was both further away &amp; at a higher altitude. About 12-13 minutes into the sighting the object streaked out of my sight (One thousand Two) &amp; it was gone. T his really startled me since I had resolved myself to this object being a balloon. Its direction of exit was downward to my right at approximately 15-20 degrees which might have been South to South Easterly.  We watched the two Jets fly by earlier from a closer distance &amp; they were slow compared to the speed at which this object Zoomed out of sight.

I,only me, then heard a voice say &apos; your friend makes us uneasy&apos;&apos;. I asked him if he heard it , he said no, then i heard rustling in the field. the voice repeated. then i became sick and threw up instantly. after releiving my stomach of its contents, i turned around and realized i was about 100 yards from his car. from what i remember i only took at the most 5 steps from the car. How did i get so far away from the car? i cant even comprehend how i got that far away. At this point i knew any further contact was not going to happen because of the presence of my friend. i went home and tried to draw the object, it took several tries, until one made me sick to my stomach and throw up again. i still cannot look at the drawing or anything similiar without getting sick. since electronic devices i have seem to be malfunctioning all the time, one in mind, thats very annoying , my smoke detector, yes i checked the battery, replaced, checked again, but still it goes off with sets of beeps primarily 3 sets of 3 beeps , then 2 sets of 3 and 1 of 2. My tv changes channel by itself ,volume as well. i have talked to a neighbor i hadnt met and he said his tv was actually moving physically, by itself. he said he had marked it and tested it several times,and it still moves. his smoke alarm goes off now too.

I looked at it closely and thought, &quot;Oh, it&rsquo;s just a plane; maybe a shooting star?&quot; Then I took a closer look, and there were green and yellow flashing lights on it.  It was moving at an incredible speed, I&rsquo;d say around 1,500-2,000mph (literally).  The object appeared to be going in circles and blinking its lights rapidly.

I ran into my parents room, woke them up and had my mom run out to see it; by the time we both got out there, it was gone.  She went right back to bed, and about five minutes later I saw another one (possibly the same one coming from a different direction).  I didn&rsquo;t know what to think this time. I ran inside again, except this time to get my camera. When I came back out with it, it was gone. So... I was hanging out in my backyard after that trying to spot another one (I had my camera at that time). I spotted another for the third time!  I saw this one about 1:45a.m. It looked just the same. I got a picture of it this time. The picture is kind of hard to see, but if you zoom in, it&rsquo;s a little easier to see. It didn&rsquo;t look like the typical circular UFO shape, it looks to me like it&rsquo;s more rectangular or &quot;platform-shaped.&quot; The next day the news came to interview me;  It was shown on the news that day (August 1st, 2005). That night, the newscaster called me up and said there were 30 other people that also saw it last night, they called the police and the police came!

It was against a black night sky and dark trees because it was night time.  It looked like it came out of a treed aread overhead, passed between another tree and near the roof of the house.  It was maybe no more than 20-30 feet overhead.  There was no sound.  It passed by within a second or two.  There was no sign of it after I went and looked around the corner of the house.

The flight took off around 5pm EST from Raleigh Durham on America West.  I think the flight number was 844.  About 3 hours into the trip (I assume maybe somewhere around Texas area but I really dont know for sure) I saw an object out the window.  The sun was still up and there were scattered clouds.  My plane was flying arounnd 33,000 feet.  This object was above a section of clouds (not in the clouds but a cloud bank formed a backgroud).  So the object was definately not on the ground and if I had to guess I would say it was maybe 1/3rd the distance to the ground from us so it was flying at about 20,000 feet. The object appeared as a cylinder shape, its surface was slighlty reflective it sort of appeared metallic but it was at an extreme range to me so I dont know for sure.  The objects color was sort of a light/pale orange color or possibly light biege.  The color was uniform across the object.  I saw it for around 10-20 secs.  The object appeared to be static.  It did not move and seemed to be fixed in the sky appearing to move at exactly the same speed as all of the surrounding clouds.  The other thing that was very odd was that unlike a plane that would fly in a horizontal positon the cylinder was vertical.  If it was a plane it should have been moving downward at a rapid speed, if it was climbing Im not sure it could have kept that up for 10-20 secs and in either case it didnt appear to be moving at all.  The distance was too great for me to descern any details like wings, designs, etc.  It just looked like a very small cylinder or possibly a cigar shaped object.  There were no visable ballons or anything like that above it. Most everyone else was watching a movie on the plane with the windows closed so I doubt anyone else saw it.  The pilots probably saw it.  I was sitting on the left side of the plane (if one is sitting down facing foward towards the front of the plane I was on the left side). I am a systems engineer for a major semi-conductor company and I was flying on a business trip that day.  I am also an amatuer astronmer and I have spent a lot of time looking at the sky.  I dont know what this thing was but I am pretty confident it was not a standard plane.

Maybe 100 feet above the tree tops in the back yard a deep black chevron shape was very slowly moving from W to ENE. Everything around was very still and quiet and the shape made no sound that I could here. It was a cool clear night and there were stars in the sky. As the shape moved (very slowly) it blocked the light from the stars that were directly behind it. I looked back and forth at the washing and then back at the shape several times thinking this was a odd experience more so because I remember thinking that I wasn&apos;t scared at all just curious. After about 3 minutes, it moved out of my view behind the trees. I note that we own a dog as do the neighbours behind and to either side of our house.

Bridge over the Hudson River.A friend and I were &quot;power walking&quot; around the park opposite Med North in Fort Lee, NJ.  As soon as we made the turn heading East - facing the G. W. Bridge - I saw a bullet shaped (I only saw one end of it) object right next to the South side of the bridge.  Which meant that it would have been hovering over the Hudson River.  It would have been invisible to us except that there was some low lighting or shimmering effect outling the object from our vantage point.  It seemed huge.  I was still trying to figure out what it was that I was looking at, and hadn&apos;t yet mentioned it to my friend when she shreiked &quot;what is it?&quot;. (We were still walking the whole time.) She was an hysterical person by nature and was getting a little frantic (still walking). It looked so much like the Goodyear Blimp that I assumed that is what it had to be.  It had to be right? If that is what the Blimp looked like with no lights except for the outline.  I assured my friend it was just the blimp and we made the turn and walked to the car and left the area.  I figured that if it was anything else, there were enough people with terraces in the many high rise apartment buildings overlooking the bridge and the river - someone else would have seen it.  There was no report of anything strange that I heard or read about so I assumed it was the blimp after all on a joy ride.  I did think it was pretty dangerous and I&apos;m not sure if the blimp could hover in one place and not move. I put it out of my mind and some time later had the occassion to actually see the Goodyear blimp near the G. W. Bridge.  The size was all wrong.  It was tiny compared to what we saw that night.  I only wish we would have continued to walk towards the bridge and not left the area.  I do feel a little silly reporting this.

You could see it had a metallic glint and at the same time it was sort of transparent, so that as it moved you could see the stars above it, but as though they were being sort of reflected from the bottom (even though the stars were above it). It was sort of like a when you put a magnifying lens close to you at a distance to something.

PD))UFO sighting in Exeter - again  By Adam Dolge adolge@seacoastonline.com   EXETER - There was something odd in the sky last week, something that caused a Navy veteran with 10,000 hours of flight experience to have his own close encounter.The former flight engineer, who wished to be identified only as &quot;David,&quot; said of the experience, &quot;this was like nothing I&rsquo;ve ever seen before.&quot;  What the retired Navy chief petty officer said he saw last Wednesday could only be classified as a UFO, an unidentified flying object. It was a bright and sunny afternoon, about 3:15 p.m., and David was outside preparing his lawnmower. He had filled the mower with gas, checked the oil, and took a sip from a glass of water he had poured. When he tilted his head back to get the final sip, through the bottom of the glass he saw a large cigar-shaped object hovering in the sky. David said windows were equally spaced around the object, however he didn&rsquo;t see anyone or anything inside. The size of the object was enormous. By comparison, he said, consider what an ultralight plane would look like next to a Boeing 747. He said it was about the size of two USS Nimitz aircraft carriers. At first glance, through his empty glass of water he thought it could have been the Hood blimp. &quot;But, the instant I put my glass down, I said, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s not a blimp.&rsquo;&quot;  The object moved from west to east, very slowly for something that size, he said. His initial instinct was that the object was moving at about 100 knots, but something that big shouldn&rsquo;t be able to stay in the air if it&rsquo;s going that slow, he said. The object began changing colors from a bright silver to an orange-ish red. A strange cloud of red and orange flames began surrounding the object, and before he knew it the object stretched out like a rubber band. It grew to about twice its original size, and then it was gone. The entire incident lasted about 10 minutes, he recalled Monday morning, but he is unaware of the specific time because, &quot;it felt like time stopped.&quot;  He went into his house and first thought to call the police. He decided not to because he didn&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d take him seriously. So he went on the Internet and searched for &quot;report UFO,&quot; and found the Web site for the Seattle-based National UFO Reporting Center. Peter Davenport, director of the UFO reporting center, said David&rsquo;s report was astonishing because of his history with flight. &quot;I have no question on his reliability.&quot;  He said he gets several accounts each year, but this one stood out. The report was well written and scientific, Davenport said. &quot;In my view, that&rsquo;s one of the cardinal rules of an account,&quot; he said. The center was founded in 1974 by UFO investigator Robert Gribble. The center&rsquo;s Web site, www.nuforc.org, has a large list of UFO sightings. According to the site, the center&rsquo;s primary function is to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have witnessed possible UFOs. David&rsquo;s report, which will soon be on the Web site, will be among dozens of documented sightings to be formally reported to the center. Not the first time  The Exeter area is no stranger to UFO sightings. In 1965, two Exeter police officers and hitchhiker Norman Muscarello, who was with them, gained national attention after seeing a UFO hovering over Route 101 in Kensington. The sighting was documented in a book called &quot;The Incident at Exeter.&quot;  And then there was the incident involving Barney and Betty Hill, a husband and wife from Portsmouth who claimed to have been abducted by aliens. The couple was driving from a vacation in Canada in 1961 when they saw a UFO. The object moved directly over their car, and before they knew it they grew drowsy. They later claimed to have been abducted by aliens and gave identical accounts while they were hypnotized. But for this recent sighting, David said he believes that there is life beyond Earth. He said the galaxy is so enormous, it&rsquo;s hard to believe humans are the only intelligent life. &quot;To the point of not being obnoxious, it&rsquo;d be egocentric to think there is no other life out there.&quot;  Print this Story      Email this Article  Back to the Exeter News-Letter  Exeter News-Letter Home Delivery Best Offer    Seacoast Online is owned and operated by Seacoast Media Group.Copyright &copy; 2005 Seacoast Online.

We got out of our vehicle and could not hear them making any sound. Randomly scattered, say 500 metres apart. It was night time. A white aura appeared as the objects moved through ( random ) clouds", "Weak light constantly with the observer movesA weak circular light slowly in the circle moves. The form is with difficulty to describes it there was evenly very weak and with the night sky flowed.  However it was however visible without trouble nevertheless  I ran a piece the road up and it followed me with a small distance.  Likewise as I again ran back and to it into the meadow ran to the left.  My mother saw the same as I. I do not believe it only a Skylight or a weather phenomenon was even, because it me constantly followed. I had already times experienced somewhat something similar, however is the long ago((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Someone said look at that and I did,I saw a HUGE circular ship that had different colors revolving around the ship.red, blue, green etc.it made it look sort of like one of those lighted tops, because the colors were changing it looked like the thing was hovering but spinning around and around.We all just stood there looking at this thing until it sorta went below the tree level and we couldnt see it anymore.  It stayed with me all these years, I never told people what we saw, but I always knew it was not of this world.  I dont know if the others ever told,this is the first time I&apos;ve told about that in all these years.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

At 7:58PM according to my pictures, I saw something very bright due southwest of me and pretty high in the sky.  The sun was going down in the west, and I&apos;m not sure if the brightness of the object was a reflection from the sun or not.  I began taking pictures of the object and I believed at the time that it was heading directly northeast toward me.  It seemed to be moving slower than a passenger jet.  Rather than getting larger like it would have had it come closer to me it seemed to be getting smaller or dimmer, and then it disappeared altogether from my sight, but not before I got six pictures of it.  It was in view for approximately 30 seconds.  In retrospect I believe that rather than moving northeast toward me it was moving possibly straight up in altitude.  It made no sound that I could hear (even though the wind was up a bit I had no trouble hearing a couple of jets earlier).  From what I saw with my eyes it looked to be only a single object, but after reviewing the pictures there seems to be some sort of vapor emitted from the left side of the object.  My camera is a Fujifilm Finepix 2800 and it was zoomed in at 6X optically.  The six photographs will follow via email.", "driving back from work saw very bright light in sky as got closer light seperated into 2 circular bright lights too bright to be a stars and definately not airplane.

It looked like a circle of green light.  Much like a star would but with a more green hue.  It was much much larger then a star, and apeared to be an extremely high altitude plane height or higher (I would say on the higher side).  I saw it, and I had a split second to notice that it was weird, then it shot off.  It went from left to right.  I only had a split second to see it before it flew off.  It covered 25-35 degrees it about 3/4 to 1/2 a second.  For comparision, it would take a plane about minute or more to just get to where I lost sight of it.  There may have been a small redish orangish center to the light, but I saw it only briefly, and the green stood out far more.  I flew off not as fast as a meteor or comet, but so much faster then any plane I have ever seen.  It flew behind a tree.  I had been walking my dog, right outside my large apartment complex, so it took me a second to think, then I knew that was pretty weird, so I went to see, around the tree that it had shot around (the tree blocked my vision as to where it went, but this object was very high, not near the tree at all, we are talking plane height or far above.)  And it was gone. This was in nearly due west.  Past a freeway in california called 280.  The SF airport is due east.  But this was miles away from that.  I saw it at 10:38 (I check the time) give or take a minute, or less. I have never seen anything like it.  I grew up in the country, in a spot off the coast of california where planes fly all the time.  So I have seen allot of planes night and day.  I now live near the SF airport, so I know of course what flying planes look like.  This was nothing a plane could have done.  It could have been a meteor or something like that.  Or a space shuttle.  But that would not explain why it moved so fast.  It is a UFO to me, but there deffinately could be a logical explination (that is really what I am looking for)  I have never seen anything I would call a UFO before.  I am pretty skeptical about anything like this.  I really just want to know what it was, or if someone else saw it (the bay area has allot of people, and anyone looking into the western sky would have seen this.)  I never would file a report like this, but I am really curious, as to what it was.", "Spring 2004  My husband and I are both night owls and enjoy walking our German Shepard around the block late at night when its nice and cool out.  We&apos;ve been in our home since Feb. 2003 and live in a small rural neighborhood on the outskirts of town.  On the Night in question we had just returned to our yard after a leisurely walk around the block with our dog Trina.  The sky was basically clear with only a few small clouds scattered here and there.  We decided to play fetch with Trina in the field behind our house,(5 acres of flat treeless land).  I&apos;m a stargazer and am constantly looking for shooting stars when the heavens permit.  Looking into the northeastern sky, I saw 3 points of light, in triangle form, moving at a steady pace high in the atmosphere traveling southeast. (I am not  too sure on the direction of travel) I pointed the lights out to my husband, he suggested it was a plane.  It may well have been but the lights were not blinking and there was no sound. Like I stated earlier, we live in a rural  area and it is very quiet and dark, with the exception of the occasional car passing.  We both watched the light formation for around 10 minutes. Without warning the lights vanished.  I would like to say that it went behind a unseen cloud but the exact area it vanished at was spotted with stars and there were no clouds anywhere near.  We continued to watch, thinking that if it indeed went behind a unseen cloud that surely it would reappear.  15 minutes later there was still no sign of the object.  The object moved steadily and made no stops or turns.  We were sober, as we both niether drink alcohol or use drugs. Although I have been a believer for many years my husband became one on that night.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

The shape was an upside down &quot;L&quot; traveling left to right across the field of my vision at an estimated 1 mile distance and 1000 ft. altitude. Now the part that is so incredible: The speed was so tremendous that even what I believe to be somewhat distant moved 120 degrees or more across my field of vision in literally a blink of the eye. It was so fast that my eyes could hardly track it. If I had blinked, I probably would have missed it. It was faster than any plane or rocket I have ever witnessed. It must have been making many thousands of miles per hour! Until I saw your website, I was not aware that other people had seen similar colored light arrays. My memory is now uncertain as to date and time but the object remains in my mind. I probably can&apos;t add much more to this report if contacted but hope it has some value.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

The Sighting was in the field directly behind the John Deere,tractor company.  The field is North West of the Hiway 359, and Hiway 44 intersection,on the East side of town. The craft was cylindrical. appeared to be sky blue. Poor lighting, sky blue as best as we could see. It came about 200 feet from impacting the field, and made adjustments.  And began to head west at about 60 MPH I repeat it made adjustments, not unlike a cruise missle. Spycraft? For a craft to withstand re-entry, and make adjustments, and continue on a path horizontal to the ground, It is obviously man-made technology. We were 9 motorcycle riders heading south on 359 from Mathis Texas. Russel at the Alice Newspaper, one of the riders, also witnessed this sighting, and was a topic of our discussion shortly after.I do not believe any reports were made.We were approaching our turn west on hiway 44, at 9:25pmwhen we witnessed this sighting.Just F.Y.I..", "Four unidentified lights in the sky.I was driving down the road when I noticed 4 lights parallel to each other in the sky the three other passengers in my vehicle all saw it too.  I dropped two of the passengers off.  Me and the other passenger then proceded down the road and tried to get a better look at what it was.  The lights seemed to be getting closer and I was really freaked out.  They then started moving away from us we traveled farther and sat on the side of the road and just watched the lights.  We sat there for about 5 minutes or so and the lights started to go out one at a time and when there were only two lights left they went out at the same time.  The next night or so it was reported on our local television station as a UFO sighting.  The local airports and airforce bases were checked and had nothing in the sky at the time of the incident.

They went from one side of the sky to another side. Then they would go away and then come back.  From where I was they was many miles away because I just barly seen them.  I brought out a camrea and they did not even pick up on it.  They went from the southwest to south to southeast.

Why I say this is there is no aircraft then or now that could duplicate what unfolded next.The two brillantly red circlular objects appeared to start to vibrate then its hard to explain they started jumping all over the sky back and forth up and down around each other in circles at incredible speeds then as fast as it started they stopped in a blink of an eye side by side just as they had when they rose up from behind the trees.Again I must say there was absolutely no sound while this is going on.As I said earlier no manmade object could duplicate what I witnessed.Then the object on the left started to vibrate again and went from a brillant red to a shimmering orange. I would say the change from red to orange took about 10 seconds and then the object shot straight up into the sky and was gone in one second.Then the 2nd object repeated the same process but didnt go to a brillant orange just a dull orange then it went back to a brillant red and shot at incredible speed climbing into the southeastern sky then stop on a dime. I would have to say at this point it was over 10,000 ft in the air.It then dropped back down a little bit and shot down towards South Meridens markham airport below.I must say I am almost 40 yrs old and I can still see the event as it happened yesterday.The only thing I`m a little fuzzing on is the exact day on which it took place.I do recall that we ran down to my house at the bottom of Sidehill road  all excited telling my parents and their friends what had just happened so they let us call the police station and the local news station to report it.As you can imagine the people on the other end of the phoneline just laughed at me.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

It was a nice night, mild clouds, lots of air traffic up here.. commercial flights, small craft....  I was seeing a number of the typical very brief shooting stars.  A friend of mine had called me on my cell phone, and I was talking with him... at this time, all of a sudden, my friend Kyle yells out excitedly.. &quot;did you see that &quot; ?  I can&apos;t remember exactly what he said following that, but I remember assuming that he had just seen a shooting star... It turns out that ((name deleted)) adamantly states that he was sure he had seen something shoot downward from one of two small planes that were in close proximity of each other, flying in opposite directions. I saw the planes a couple seconds after he saw this discharged object.  My best guess is that these planes were possibly flying 3 to 7 miles directly due west of where we were, which is very close in line with N.E. 75th St.  I Couldn&apos;t really estimate the altitude.. average for small craft I suppose. I learned from Kyle that this object he states was shot downward from the plane, was unmistakenly glowing red/orange in color. Within 15 seconds, in that direction, there was a huge bright white flash, which seem to be more from the ground, than in the sky. It lit up the sky to a higher degree than lightning often would... just as a instant flash.  I thought the flash was quite strange, but was not yet alarmed.  Within another 15 seconds (and this is where it gets scary for me ) I saw a huge ominous dark cloud coming upward from the horizon.  ((name deleted)) unmistakenly saw this too !!  I am quite concerned about this ! I am sure many people must have atleast seen the strange and huge flash of light... We were in a unique place ( large unlit park ) to see the cloud ( which was slightly, but unmistakenly a darker shade than the sky surrounding it ) We heard no sounds, not even the engines of the planes in question. No sirens followed !", "It was the summer of 1991. My older brother and I were going to walk to the end of our street to meet some friends. It was late and a clear night full of stars. We lived on the outskirts of Victoria, BC. I had grown up on this road and new every corner, tree and even where the deer would cross the road.We were about one kilometer into our walk, starting up a hill after walking the only straight stretch of road. Suddenly the hair on my face and neck stood on end till it hurt. Out of the corner of my eye I thought I saw a flash of light pass. We walked on. Then I defiantly saw a melon sized ball of white light pass us traveling faster than I thought possible. I asked my brother &ldquo;Did you see that?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I thought it was just me.&rdquo; Then there was another and another until they were about six or ten (It is hard to say with the speed they were traveling.). They seemed to be in a range of sizes from a large grape fruit to a honeydew melon. They did not light up their surroundings but seemed to contain their light. They were moving it would seem with purpose weaving away from us and then stopping and launching into our close vicinity again. I asked my brother if he thought we should run but as soon as the words left my mouth I knew the futility of my thoughts. My brother said we should turn for home but just walk calmly and not run. I was glad he was with me for he was a few years older and I had not yet graduated and was still unsure of myself. We descended the hill and rounded the corner leading back to the straight stretch of road. One of the lights sped ahead of us two hundred meters or so in the blink of an eye and stopped instantly under one of the few streetlights on the road. It hesitated there for perhaps a half of a second and the came directly at us. It wizzed past me head silently less than an arms length away. I was terrified, sure neither of us would be seen again and pitying my mother who would never know the fate of her sons. Then a car came around the corner ahead of us and I realized the lights were nowhere to be seen. We flagged down the car and begged them to take us with them. I am sure that our pleading to save us from the UFO lights convinced them that we were crazy. They sped off and once again I was sure we were doomed; but after a few minutes with no return my fears started to subside. I began to build up enough courage to lookup and into the starry sky. Behind us in the distance was a field and far above it I noticed a triangle of lights, just sitting in the sky motionless. I asked my brother if he could see it also and what he thought it was. He said, &ldquo; It&rsquo;s probably a radio tower or something, lets just go!&rdquo; It wasn&rsquo;t a tower though, no stars shone through the center of the triangle, and as I confirmed later in the week during the daytime there was nothing that could have confused with what we saw. I don&rsquo;t recall how our when we arrived home.The next morning I awoke seemingly oblivious to the night&rsquo;s events. I went to the bathroom to shave and shower. While shaving I saw in the mirror falling from the ceiling next to me, bright shiny sparks falling to invisibility before hitting the floor. Immediately all the night&rsquo;s events came rushing back to me. I ran to my brother&rsquo;s room and found him awake in bed with the most astonished look on his face. When I asked him what he said he awoke to find his bed covers covered in sparks. We spoke of this to our parents and friends but few believe us. For months after this event when I would drive home from work, occasionally when I approached, or passed through the area of the incident I would hear from behind my heard a loud clap. It was like two hands coming together.This event has defiantly had an effect on my life and my beliefs. I look for answers and get more questions. I search for truth and find mystery. And sometimes it still terrifies me.", "Streaks of light moving quickly and erratically around an open field.I was taking pictures of the double rainbow in front of our home, when I saw several white circles of light out of the corner of my eye. The odd part was that I could not see them when I looked directly toward them. They appeared to be moving very quickly and changed directions often, staying in the area directly in front of our home. It was not raining where the objects were spotted, as the rain was still over the mountains at the back of the photos. I was able to record them on several photographs. I&apos;ve ruled out any lens flares, as there was no direct light hitting the camera, and there was no water on the lens. I&apos;ve taken several thousand photos with this camera and have never seen any thing like this before. At a friend&rsquo;s suggestion, I&apos;m reporting them to see if anyone can explain what the objects might be. My background is in computer science from University of Baltimore, I&apos;ve worked in research and development and academic computing most of my life. I&apos;m currently consulting for several companies here on St. Croix and I&apos;ll be teaching a computer class at the University of the Virgin Islands in the fall. Basically, I am pretty much a skeptic of anything that can&apos;t be explained by science and I&rsquo;ve done my best to explain what these lights could be.

As I was sitting in my seat and looking out at Dallas-Ft. Worth International Airport in Texas, I saw a light in the sky, it just appeared nearly suddenly, and within 4 seconds it was gone. You could say I saw it, blinked, and it was gone.  It looked like it was at a high altitude. We were on board American Airlines flight #2262 (a Boeing 757), enroute DFW-STL, at gate C11 awaiting gate departure. It was about 11:30, probably a little before that. I knew what I saw was too fast for any plane, even a military jet. I could only see a white light, no other color lights. I know it couldn&apos;t of been a shuttle because those have been grounded since early 2003. Whatever it was, it looked like it was going to escape the atmosphere very shortly. There were no stars that were visible, since there were many lights at the airport, so I know I didn&apos;t mistake it with a satellite. It was too low to be in space yet, but getting close to escaping the atmosphere. The light was easily about 35,000 feet, I would have to say anywhere from 50,000 to 150,000 feet. I&apos;m sorry I cannot be specific on the altitude of the aircraft, or whatever it was. If I had to take a guess, I would have to say it was around 80,000 feet. Again, the date was July 7, 2005, and the time was probably about 11:25 P.M.

It would stop completely at times.My cousin and I were sitting out in the front yard of my mother&apos;s residence when he suddenly asked to look to the south and up into the sky.When I did, I saw what appeared to be a black, chevron shaped object slowly moving in a north easterly direction.  It was just below the cloud cover so I estimated that it was approximately around 20,000 feet and about 5-10 miles from us.  I retrieved a pair of binoculors from my truck and focused in on the object.  It was still moving in the same direction and I noted that it was occasionally stopping and turning from side to side.  It was a solid object, no portals could be seen and it was a dark grayish black.  It&apos;s body was solid and it was completely flat surfaced.  It continued in a N/E direction and was almost upon us, still about 20-25 thousand feet and suddenly it disappeared into the clouds.

Most recently was the evening of Aug. 3 the day after many con trails were laid down. He saw many lights and huge dark shapes in between.  The reason he is so frightened is that his property is very remote and last September, in the very early morning hours, he saw more lights on his property for many minutes a couple of nights in a row. He laid in the grass for a half an hour with binoculars and looked at a round craft with many light on top and around it. He gave me a photo he took with a cheap camera and it shows the bottom outline near the rear where the lights appear to be propelling the vehicle away into the night sky.  He drew me a picture of the craft.  As I watched him draw it, I could tell he had studied it very carefully. He said after it went up from behind the trees he studied it at abou 800 to 900 yards up.The top was covered with round lights of a light bulb color and around the perifery were blue flames or jets going down and a red flameing jet in the center. He tried to think to them that he would not shoot at them if they did not harm or bother him.He wishes he could find someone to talk to that lives near by that saw it too. He came to one meeting with me to share with my friends about it, but refuses to talk about it with them again.

The next thing I was aware of was that I was back in my bedroom and the sun was coming up and I sensed it leave because the trees started whipping around and then stopped abruptly and I heard the sound of helicopters coming from the East.  They flew right over my house and had search lights combing the woods. They kept flying loudly to the West.The next day I called my friend and before I could tell her anything she said that she was woken up by her dog barking at sunrise and looked out her back door and saw a brightly lit object above the trees to the north and heard helicopters coming from the East and then the object took off sudenly to the West and three helicopters followed it but were much too slow to keep up.We did not know who to report it to so did not.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

It was moving due east directly over Sheppard AFB.  I live six blocks from the Sheppard Missle Road North entrance gate. There was no noise, no trail, or other characteristics.

It was a bright white light, it was going in a straight line and then it jagged over to the left and went straight again then you can tell it was headed out into outerspace because the light faded and then dissappeared all the while it stayed straight.

I was taking a few of a passenger jet flying from west to east and I heard what I thought was another flying off to my east.  As soon as the passenger jet disappeared from my view into the treeline I turned around and spotted the source of the sound to my east, and I don&apos;t believe it was a jet because it had no wings, though it sounded like one.  I am certain it&apos;s the same object I photographed on 6/23/05  ( http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44577.html ) as it is the same color, has what looks to be an indention or band in the center, and the rear seems to have a bit of a hump.  The object was flying roughly from south to north again and was to my east northeast by the time I took these photographs of it.  It was low again (maybe 10,000 feet) and moving fairly slowly (I would guess 200-250 MPH) and seemed to fly in a straight path.  I didn&apos;t notice any lights or any other strange behavior.

The surounding area was not built up yet, so most of it was field.  By the field there was this huge object.  My mom said it was one shape than it transformed into another, almost like a crown.  She said that they lights were moving down the side of it were brilliant and colorful and we still don&apos;t have any technology like htis.  She said that all three had gotten out of the car to look at this object.  She said it was huge. The lights were very phospherious and then it was just gone.

Their were 3 of us kids (15 yrs old at the time) outside, and two adults when suddenly I noticed that there were strange blue lights that sort of looked like shooting stars in the sky.  I told the rest of the people to look up and we were all amazed. One of the adults told us that it was probably just something from Offut Air Force Base, and to just forget about it, but it was to amazing for us to quit looking at. The lights were running into eachother breaking off into many other lights and created large circular shapes in the sky. After about 10 minutes of this occuring, I over heard the adults talking to eachother saying that the lights were starting to creep them out. Me and one of my friends rushed inside because we had a weird feeling that this would be on the news or something talking about an alien invasion, so we skipped through all of the channels and were suprised to see that it was not on t.v. We rushed back out there and suddenly the lights stopped.  Everyone who was ouside decided to come inside as it was starting to get a little chilly.  Every few minutes we would look outside to see if the lights came back, and around 5 minutes after the lights disappeard, strange beam like lights flashed from the ground up to the sky every few seconds. This stopped after 2-3 minutes and that was the last of the lights that we saw.

It wasn&apos;t a twinkle, but it looked more like light flashing off a diamond very quickly, showing off its rainbow of colours.  Anyways, I looked at it through binoculars, and I could see at least five lights in a circle, with one light in the middle, all changing colours.  I went and got my dad to get up and look at the &quot;star.&quot;  He grabbed the binoculars, looked in the same area, and couldn&apos;t see anything.  I looked in that area and it was gone.

I though it was just another cruise ship since we were in the cruise ship lanes down there but I continued to watch for acouple minutes when it shot up at a 45 degree into the sky faster then any jet or rocket could touch and then it just stopped. It continued to stay at this high altitude for a couple minutes,(by now a pretty large group of people have gathered all pointing and trying to offer explanations) After a few moments it crossed back 90 degrees and shot back across the sky, stopped for literally afew seconds and then shot straight up and out of sight.

The second was roughly the date i gave above the first time i saw this was about 2 months before that. The first time - Me and my boyfriend were by the beach where I live. We had been out with some friends but they had gone home and we were just chilling out laying one of the benches near the beach so just looking up at the sky talking.It was a really clear night so lot of visible stars. It was him that first noticed it and he pointed it out to me. It looked exactly like a star..just a ball of light travelling pretty fast and very high as it was about the size of the north star so just a little bit bigger than the others. It wasnt a plane or helicopter we realised because it made no sound..was way to high up and was travelling way to fast. Also they have flashing lights on the wings etc. This did not flash. My first thought was shooting star/comet but we followed this thing across the sky watching it then we noticed another (previously stationary star) move and follow the same flight path. Then another 4 did the same they were still..and then they moved. We eventually stopped looking as i had to go home and we werent exactly liek &apos;wow&apos; we were just like hey thats weird etc. Second time - The second time was early july. I had been at my boyfriends house  that night and he was walking me home. We were on my street about 100 yards from my house and I saw this thing again..looked like a star again but this time it seemed closer as it was bigger. It was definatly the same thing as before..no noise no flashing etc. It moved pretty fast and then it stopped it then moved again and then it changed direction and seemed to go back like it was getting further away.

As i was driving, I noticed an object traveling across the road at a very low and smooth pace.  My first thought was that it was a helicopter, but as i approached the object, it became very clear to me that it was not. With the object not more than 200ft from me and my windows down, you would think, had it been a helicopter, the sound of rotating blades would be more than enough to assure me it was in fact a helicopter.  The bright object which consisted of very familiar colors (red, green, and white) where blinking in a consecutive pattern which in someways was reasurring me it must be something of human construction. But as the object continued to move and i traveled closer, the shape appeared to be disc-like. I know this sounds very typical and familiar, but this is what i saw. The object continued to move in a northeast direction and as it slowly disappeared over the tree line, i made a quick right turn onto Lemay Ferry Rd. which put me in the perfect line of sight to see an object that had just flew over the tree line and all i saw was an empty sky.

Looking at the object, it was pointing in a southwest by northwest direction and remaining still as we watched it from the north.

The sky had a violet hue to it.  That is how, despite the night fall, I was able to discern the shape of the craft in question.  My mother, my grandmother, younger brother and I were parked in our Dodge Ram Charger waiting for my father to get out of Foodland.  My father had been working a number of years as a butcher in their meat department.  Our station wagon was in the shop at the time so, we used the Ram Charger to run errands during the day and were forced to pick my father up from work each night until our car was repaired.  The Foodland was located on Campbell Rd. where it intersects with 14 mile rd.  The Foodland no longer exists.  There is a large grocery store in it&apos;s place now, and an Outback Steakhouse restaraunt in the parking lot where we witnessed the bizarre aircraft.  We were parked facing the west side of Campbell Rd, waiting patiently for my father to get out of work.  He was scheduled to work until 8 pm that night and that&apos;s exactly when we saw it.  Some bright lights began shining through the treeline above the residences along Campbell Rd.  The lights were very low and they were intensely bright.  Although none of us said a word, I later found out that my grandmother and mother had both assumed, as I had, that the lights belonged to a low flying passenger jet.  Eventually the ascending object came into view above the treeline.  All of us were silent for a moment.  At first, we stared at the object in silence, each one of us trying to determine WHAT it was we were all looking at.  When no conclusion could be reached, my mother exclaimed &quot;Oh my God!&quot; and we all got out of the Ram Charger for a clearer view of the strange craft.  By the time I had gotten out of the Ramcharger, the aircraft was no longer ascending.  It remained completely still for about 45 seconds and then slowly, very slowly began hovering southbound along the west side of Campbell Rd.  The object appeared to be about 4 to 5 homeyard lengths, though it is impossible for me to judge exactly what our distance was.  From my perspective, it spanned the distance of about 5 of the front lawns of the residential homes it seemed to be hovering above.  The object was shaped like a relatively thin cylinder.  The perimeter of the craft was lined with rectangular lights of extraordinary brightness.  There were very thin slits dividing the lights that were the same shade as the rest of the exterior of the craft: black(or at least how it appeared as a silouhette against the violet sky).  The lights did not move along the perimeter of the vehicle.  They did however look like they were bound by a textured or coagulated transparent surface.  Those lights were the most incredible display of illumination I have ever witnessed.  I could not see any specific details along the exterior of the craft.  Under the lighting conditions, it appeared to be a flat black or at least a very dark brown.  Although I must admit, there was the hum of Campbell rd. and 14 mile rd. traffic from our position, the hovering object made no sound that could be distinguished from the passing cars.  It left no kind of trail in it&apos;s wake either.  After about 4 minutes watching the aircraft hover slowly and silently south along Campbell rd, my mother became frightened and began yelling for me to get back in the Ram Charger.  She later told me that she had begun thinking of all of those horrible U.F.O abduction stories she&apos;d heard about and seen on various t.v shows.  At that point, I could only see about one third of the craft anyways.  It had hovered nearly out of sight behind some of the much taller trees.  I obeyed my mother and got back in the truck.  We all waited with inpatience for my father to exit Foodland.  When he got to the vehicle about 5 minutes later, we were all frantically telling him to get in the car and try to spot once more what we had already seen.  My father laughed at first.  He didn&apos;t seem to believe our story at all but after a few moments of him observing our enthusiasm over what we had witnessed, he hopped in the truck and started off down Campbell.  The flying vehicle had not been lost from our sight for more than 6 minutes and yet, as we drove further and further south down Campbell, we found that it was no longer visible in any direction.  Even at major intersections such as 13 and 12 mile, where we looked back to see if the object was flying too close to the trees to be seen from the road itself, we ended up seeing nothing.  It was gone that quick.  As far as I know, no one ever reported sighting the object to the police or any other agencies in that area.  I checked several newspapers the following morning to see if anyone else had shared our bizarre experience.  Given the size, illumination and altitude of the hovering vehicle, it seems completely impossible to me that we were the only people to have witnessed this.  Even as I was glaring at the airborn object, I found it hard to believe that traffic along 14 mile and Campbell didn&apos;t come to a complete standstill when this thing came into view.  Save for the indifference of surrounding citizens, it looked like an incredible effects shot of an extra terrestrial visitor in a blockbuster film like &quot;Independance Day&quot;.  I have never seen this craft again and I also have never seen it photographed or even sketched once during all the time I&apos;ve spent reviewing popular U.F.O sighting since.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

About 30 minutes into our stargazing, I noticed what I thought to be a satellite heading due east.  I then noticed a second point of light, traveling in unison with the first point of light.  As I began to think this was unusual, I noticed the third point of light, forming a triangle.  They were all moving perfectly in unison together.  The area between the points of light was black, but it was definitely a solid mass of some sort as it was covering up clusters of stars.  I saw it turn--it appeared to be entering our galaxy from another dimension given how it turned.  As it banked to head SE, the perception of the triangle shaped craft changed.  We watched it as it headed over our house, disappearing behind a large tree.  We ran out into the street but due to the street lights (or perhaps it just disappeared), we lost it.  According to my husband, the back end appeared to be square.  An amazing AWESOME experience!  It was obviously very large given how far up it was.  It was absolutely silent.  If you were to measure it holding your hand up against the sky, using your fingers, it was a good 6 inches by 3.5&quot;.  What is even more amazing is that we saw the very same shaped craft at the Oregon Coast (Yachats) in the early spring of 2001 (approximation), only this time the craft was much lower and we could see a flash of light in the center of it as a red ball of light flew out.   And as it flew overhead, the streetlights flickered and briefly went out until the craft literally just vanished as it headed due east over the coast range.  You could feel a strange sensation as it went overhead--it was like massive amounts of electricity crawling over your skin--like we were in a giant electrical field.  So to be blessed not just once but twice is totally cool!  With this last visit, we were standing outside, calling for it to land and pop in, have a visit......share a coke or something.  :)((NUFORC Note:  At first, we wondered whether the witnesses might have observed the three satellites that are seen, from time to time, to fly in formation, thought to be part of the U. S. Navy &quot;NOSS&quot; satellite system.  However, if the triangle of lights indeed blocked out the stars inside its periphery, then the formation could not have been caused by three orbiting satellites.

The sky was clear, great visibility, hot (about 80), almost no wind, no moon. All of a sudden, we both saw a brightly lit object consisiting of two parts: one being a perfectly shaped cylinder oriented vertically, silver white in color, the other part was resembling a yellow disk emitting much brighter light like a large star (my wife describes this as a flat lantern). The object was hovering at about 1000 feet above us for 5-6 seconds without a sound, then started to move slowly and then faster and faster to the left and ascending at the same time. We heard no sound. Finally the objet became resembling a yellow star and disapperead from view completely.  Unfortunately, we were at the street alone, nobody else was out at that time.  We are both professionals, highly educated and never believed in these phenoms described in the UFO books and elsewhere.

When I was approaching Fresno, CA I noticed an object with about 6 light about 200 feet up in the air.  The object was moving vigorously in a wave like manner.  The object was hovered over farm crops.  I instantly noticed how peculiar the object was as I moved closer.  I drove side by side with the flying object for about 15-30 seconds and observed it moving in the motion of a sting ray.  The object was very large and had bright white and blue lights on it.  As I traveled north I noticed it did the same, but weaved backwards and proceeded forward.  I continued to watch the object through my rearview mirror and I noticed that it was moving as if it were sowing something.  I immediately thought of crop circles.  The object was making a wave-like motion and traveling back and forth, it was a huge dark triangle with lights on it and not too far off the ground but high enough to be flying (like I said about 150-200 ft).  Being approximately 50 ft away from the object I could not hear the object making any noise, such as aircrafts do.  But it was moving at about 20-25 miles per hour.", "Mirror ball sphere rotating in Dunwoody, Georgia for 1 hr.On 7/9/2005, I had to let my dogs outside for a few minutes.  It was very late on a Saturday night about 2:00am. I live in Dunwoody, Georgia.  It was a dark night with a lot of clouds, and very damp.  It had been rainning alot, due to the hurricane named Dennis, off the Gulf. A bright white light got my attention, above my house.  It was about the same height as a plane would be.  It made no sound.  I looked up at the entire sky, and I noticed this object was brighter than the other stars.  There were only 3 stars in the very dark sky.  But this particular one was over my house, and it was the biggest and the brightest one. I went inside and grabbed my telescope.  I actually compared it with the other stars and it was nothing like them. When I came outside, it seemed to be jumping around in a irratic movement.  Through the telescope, I could see it better, and it looked like a sphere, that was like a mirror ball, but shaped oval.  The object seemed to be revolving counter clockwise, as a mirror ball would do, shinning in different areas, at the same time. After observing it through the scope for a few minutes, it would hide.  It seemed like everytime I really locked onto it through the scope, it would hide behind the nearby clouds. I noticed it would even go backwards.  I guess I witness my first UFO.  Within 2 to 3 minutes of hiding, it would return to the same location.  I would grab the scope and witnessed the sphere revolving as if it had little mirror squares on it.  It continued irraticly jumping around, up &amp; down,  and especially back and forth.  I payed particular attention to it when it would go backwards.  I watched it go backwards for quite a distance, noting that our planes do not have this capability!  But it still managed to return within seconds, pretty close to the same area. I watched it appear and dissapear, in the same area, for a full hour.  The entire time, it rotated and shinned like a mirror ball, bouncing around.  Then I realized it was extremly late, and I had to go to bed.  The mirror ball looking sphere was still there went I left it about 3:00am.", "We saw in the sky, an object with an array of white lights on it it flying west to east at about 50 miles an hour.

Silver.I was returning home from a visit with my mother in Jacksonville, North Carolina.  It was approximately 4:00 p.m. in the afternoon (clear/sunny).  I was traveling North on Rt. 258, headed to Kinston, N.C. from Richlands, N.C. I was a few miles outside Richlands in the country.  The road was two lanes asphalt.  I was driving at about 55 mph,looking straight ahead down the road.  Both sides of the roadway was lined with large tree&apos;s.  Every now and then I would pass a house, farm, or open field, but ahead of me there were just tree&apos;s.  Suddenly, I observed a cigar-shaped object pass over the road ahead, from my right to the left.  It was flying level, approximately several hundred feet above the roadway.  It wa silver-colored, no markings, no wings, no cockpit or windows, and no exhaust.  On the read top third of the craft, it had what at first appeared to be a 30 degree angled verticle tailfin.  As I looked at the &quot;tailfin,&quot; it appeared to be, not a funtional tailfin (no visible rudder), but instead a part of the craft.  I couldn&apos;t see any shadow to indicate the vertical fin was narrower than the cigar-shaped craft.  It was unlike anything I have ever seen.  I have seen virtually every type of manned and unmanned aircraft, rocket, and futuristic type craft in or under development (both military and civilian).  I simply could not explain what I was seeing.  I heard no sounds.  I sped up my vehicle to see if I might come to a field on the left side of the roadway, so I might get a look at the craft going away from me.  I did not find any field ahead on the left side of the road.  This sighting was very disturbing to me.  I want to know what is going on???

I can&apos;t quite recall the color of the lights, but I remember lights flashing. It was just hovering there for what seemed about 5-7 seconds. I froze, almost like I couldn&apos;t move even if I wanted to! Walking behind me, was a man in a 3 piece suit with a briefcase.

Like when you think you&apos;ve seen a ghost. When I walked in the door, my cousin said I was very pale. The 1st thing she and her husband said was &quot;you look like you&apos;ve seen a ghost!&quot; I don&apos;t drink or do drugs! So I know that I saw something that day!

(Ravinia Festival in Highland Park, IL.)  As I was looking up at the stars, I saw a red hazy sphere of light travel across the sky, from the NE to the SW.  This object travelled at a speed approximately twice that of an airplane, but about half the speed of a satellite.  I use these two as a judge, because I had also observed a passenger jet fly over (the place was on a flight plan for O&apos;Hare airport) and a satellite pass over (polar orbit) earlier that evening.  I was watching objects across the sky, such as balloons, planes, and satellites, and it matched none of these objects, because a balloon travelled much much slower, a plane had flashing lights in addition to the red and green wing lights, and a satellite would appear as a point of light travelling faster than this object across the night sky.  In addition, this object was clearly not an asteroid, as an asteroid would appear as a bright green flash.  I watched this object cross the sky - when it had gone behind trees, I checked my watch and it read as a minute or two before 9:00 PM.The object travelled across my field of view (about 140 degrees, I was laying flat on the ground, with my head looking straight up) in about 5 minutes.  Again, the object in my estimation went twice as fast as a passenger jet at cruising altitude, and about half as fast as a satellite.

My husband, brother and buddy went to the drive in over in Marysville to see Dukes of Hazard and Stealth. Both *OK* movies, fyi.  First of all, I know that we were damn near facing Beale so, so much is possible right there. But any how, during stealth, I see above and just to the left of center of the screen a big almost see-through like grayish oval/roundish deal.  kind of looked mechanical (remember the Borg ship on star trek TNG??...sort of like that).  It wasn&apos;t a whole object...i mean, it looked like there parts you could just see right through.  It only appeared in my direct line of vision for as long as you can take a deep breath.  it seemed to fade quickly toward the right.  I was shocked as hell and yelped *did you guys see that??*  a bunch of *huhs??* was the response so I shut up because it was an important part of the movie.  Maybe my mind is screwing with me, i thought and kind of let it go. Well, after the movie i brought it up and before i could say *grey* *see-through*  or  *oval shapped*  my brother pipes up with  &quot;yeah, i saw something too.  Kind of yada yada yada. &quot;  I about crapped myself because I wasn&apos;t alone on this one!!!  woo-hoo, one for the home team! but he said that he saw it in the corner of his eye off to the right of the screen.  i know that the &quot;corner of the eye&quot; descriptions prompt a lot of skepticism, but I saw that same damn thing.  There has got to be something to it, don&apos;t you think?  I had never seen anything like this in real life - unfortunately the only thing I can relate it to is a tv show alien craft.  lol.  go figure.

I driving across Mercer Island.   I noticed several were slowing or pulled off to the side of the road.  I thought there was an accident ahead on the freeway.  I slowed too. While, I waited I glanced up at the clear colbalt blue night sky. Just above the tree line was this gigantic brightly lite floating ship sitting stationary E to W.   Underneath the hovering silent ship were 25  (cubes or rectangle shaped) smaller craft being off loaded or launched.They seemed to all have bright headlights.  Wow.  The smaller crafts were all flying in different directions N to S, SW, SE, NE, NW.  I decided it was time to continue on to work. When I arrived the  supervisor asked me if I had seen anything unusual in the night sky. Yes. Then he told me we were going to have a crew meeting. After the crew meeting he sd you can go home early. He said we were slow this evening.   I thought thats unusual because we were usually busy after lunch.   As I was driving home I noticed that all the planes were flying very low. There are several airports near by. I thought perhaps the space craft had done something to the flight path. I arrived home. Everything was prefectly normal. I was watching late night TV.  Suddenly my dog started acting strangely. Her hair was all ruffled up on the back of her neck and she was whining. From the couch I looked out the window and standing on the deck  were 4 or 5 red or orange miltary insigna uniformed males with primate features.Their foreheads were slanted, copper color, they had bushy eye brows, dark eyes,short necks. Their bodies were covered in military uniform. I didn&apos;t see their shoes.  I couldn&apos;t figure out how they had gotten there on to the deck.   They were tall around 5ft 8. They had a fierce presence. My friend was sitting at my feet growling and whining.Then all was quiet. Next I was closing the window facing East looking out on the deck, the sun was coming up. My face felt hot, my hair was dirty, my tongue hurt,I had an odd metalic taste in my mouth.I felt fatigued. I was very angry.My dog was laying at an odd angle on the couch. She perked up when I closed the window. Like it was a signal. She wagged her tail and I comforted her.I looked up at the clock and it was very late. I could not figure out why we were still on the couch. Afterwards, I had difficulty eatting anything from a tin can.   I had to use plastic utensiles instead of metal. I couldn&apos;t see shadows when we went walking in the dark. I had to keep the lights on when we were sleeping. I was told not to talk about our adventure.  I wasn&apos;t threatened. They definitely told me they were coming back. That they were going to be around. I finally went to a doctor who practices alternative medicine and he told me that I was not alone. I am surviving.

At first I thought they were birds until we noticed that they were emitting light and not reflecting it. No running lights, no sound, moving at an incredible speed. They were pin-points of light, no way of knowing their altitude but I&apos;m sure it was over 150,000 feet. I would approximate their speed at near 24,000 mph. They described perfect distance between each other, flying in a straight path then once they passed right above us seemed to converge into just one light. I realize now that they did not converge but that the craft were leaving the area and moving straight out toward the northern pole-star area.As if they moved away in perspective. It was an awesome sight indeed. Birds usually don&apos;t converge on each other like that, satellites are not visible by reflected light at that hour either. Were were in awe by what we saw. And kept looking for other phenomenon. After about 45 minutes we spotted another group of 5 (possibly 6) lights, also in line formation. these were moving North by North-West.

I made this decision as there was a level of movement on the light both up and down and side to side but only slightly so we thought it may have been heading straight at us.

(The vent hole is a square hole with an opening of approx 32x32 inches) The nearly full moon caught my eye, and as I glanced at it I saw a small box like object falling towards the ground. The object seemed to be falling at a slower rate than you would expect an object to be falling at.Another worker and I went  outside of the trailer to get a better look at the object, which was up in the air about 1000 feet or so and was East by south East of us. While trying to figure out what it was and how it got there. I noticed that it was falling with a precise pattern.The box was a rectangle, which had on one side a reflecting smooth light brown surface, and on the other side was a real dark brown matt or black color. I believe the other four sides were a light brown color.As it was falling it would turn on its axis. If I remember right it was in a clockwise rotation. That is while looking up towards the bottom of it. It would turn three times and then flip end over end, and continue in the same pattern over and over again. You could see the sun reflecting off of the light brown shiny side as it turned.When it got about 500 feet or so from us it leveled off and went into a glide like state, which brought over and passed where we were standing. By now it was about 200 feet up in the air and 150 feet in front of us. It went another 50 feet or so and then made a fairly sharp left turn and headed south across the road and towards the river and high power lines. It passed almost directly over the top of a small C model trailer which was parked next to the road. The trailer was approximately 18 or 20 feet long by 8 feet wide. And the object was pretty close to being the same width and length as the trailer, and looked to be about 3 or 4 feet thick, as I remember.The object passed just above the wires which went over the river. When the object got approximately over the center of the river, it made an abrupt sharp left turn and started up the river. It went for about a hundred feet or so and then stopped. Not wavering up or down or left or right. Then it started to go into a rippling effect, which reminded me of looking at  a stingray from its side. It stayed there for about 10 seconds or so doing it&rsquo;s rippling and then went solid again (or ridged) and then it stood on end and slowly rose up into the air and turned on its axis again. But this time it did not flip over as it did before when it was coming down. It slowly rose up into the air and slightly drifted south. As it rose up while turning you could see the light reflecting off of the shiny side till it went out of site. It looked like it was heading in the same direction from whence it came.Later while talking about the object with some material handlers, who were on the other side of the building at that time and which did not see the object, were discussing about a weird noise that they heard at the same time as our sighting, which sounded to them like a siren trying to start up over and over again.(I did not hear any sound, because of the dust collector, which was on my side of the building was running and making to much noise to hear anything.) My memory is not to good, but I sat and thought about this for some time, and put down things as I remember them. I have only talked to a few people about it.

I did think it was strange that jets were out flying at that time of night. Then I saw further in the sky, towards the west something floating down like the way a feather would float down and it was in the shape of an oval or a pringles potato chip ( i know that sounds strange, but thats what it looked like to me) and it was coming down really slowly, going back and forth as it came down and as I tried to study it more closely and focus on it, it appeared to have some kind of a pattern on it, to me it looked like some kind of flower and it was white background and the flower looking thing was either lights  or some other kind of shiny material, I couldn&apos;t tell.  Then it went too low and I lost sight of it because it went below the trees.  It must have came down somewhere out over the ocean is all I could of where it went.  When I got past the trees finally and could see the ocean I didnt see anything out there, besides it was dark outside, too, and I didnt see any kind of lights out on the ocean in the direction I thought the object must have gone down.  Then as I was standing there at the end of the park looking out at the ocean a object about the size of a helicopter, maybe bigger I couldnt tell cause the object was so well blended into the night sky, this object flew right over the tree tops in the park, and I mean right above them, it made no sound at all, the only reason why I noticed it was the fact that I had been looking up at the sky to see if there was anything else.   This object had a couple of little red lights on the bottom of it which also caught my eye.  It was flying over the park heading out over the ocean in the direction that I thought the other object must have gone down.  No one else, as far as I could tell had seen anything that I had just seen.  I couldn&apos;t believe other people could be so blind and just so oblivious as to all the stuff I had just seen.

It was too far away to make out any shape, but after looking at my star software, I ruled out any planet, star or other celestial object.  It had caught my attention because it was so bright, like a bright Mars in the sky, or a tad brighter and larger.  But it was white, like a star and it was flashing red.  I needed to know what it was, but after viewing my sky astronomy software and finding nothing even closely matching, I realized it must be something else.  The object could be seen looking into the western sky at about 11:30pm, and finally going out of vision (very small spec by this time but the flashing red still visable) at about 2:00am, traveling very slowly in a west-ward direction.

Strange. White object not unlike a roll of paper falling. It was headed downward at a 30 degree angle against a horizon line. It was not easy to see. I had to stare at the same area to actually see the object because it would seem to not be there if just glanced at. This thing wasn&apos;t falling. There was no tumbling like one would expect from something that had no wings. It had a long tapering tail and was moving in an eel like motion as if it was swimming in the air. It was difficult to track visually . If you looked away it would be difficult to locate again. There were a few more of these objects appearing centrally from great altitude. This was not a saucer of plane or helicopter. My brother said a jet from Moffett flew through the general area where these objects were appearing. The jet slightly lost control, regained control then flew off. It may have sucked one into the engine intake. Oh, these things weren&apos;t small. Couldn&apos;t determine the size as there was no reference object to gauge the size. Weird. I can still envision these things. I have yet to see anything like it. It is possible that there are other life forms out there. They may not need space craft and these may not actually be visiting.

I walked to the back of the property I was watching, a residential street, and I did not see any cars or people.  There may have been a stray cat around, but I didn&apos;t see anything.  I glanced up at the sky, which was still dark except on the eastern ridge of Manoa valley, when I saw a bright light with what appeared to be a lit cone area in front of it, like how a car with headlights on at night would appear from high up.  There were no clouds in the sky.  I assumed it was a helicopter overhead to survey traffic, but there wasn&apos;t any sound at all.  I couldn&apos;t tell at what height or distance it was at since it was dark, but it was overhead and to the west, and I was facing west.   As I looked at the object, the &quot;spotlight&quot; in front of it dimmed, and the light faded to the size of a large star.  I was about to dismiss it as an airplane, but the light suddenly stopped in midair, where before it had been moving towards me.  As it stayed there suddenly a faint light colored haze burst around it from all side, like smoke from a candle when its blown out, or the aura of the sun, only larger and more faint. It disappeared just as suddenly, making me second guess even myself.  Sorry if my description was vague.  As I watched the light, it seemed to separate into two smaller, dimmer lights, and then into three. The lights were the color of the stars and I would not have noticed them if I hadn&apos;t seen the larger light earlier. The lights then moved to the northwest and stayed equidistant from each other, and although it was hard to tell in the dim light, I believe the spaces in between the light was a paler color then the surrounding sky.  The lights continued moving lower and lower on the northwestern horizon of the western ridge of Manoa valley.   The lights moved at a somewhat fast speed, but were observable for about four or five minutes since they stopped intermittently.  Just before they disappeared from view, I believe i saw the lights separate, veer away in arcs and then join together.  The time when I lost sight of them was 0542 HST. I should note that I was not up all night.  I had just woken up for work 2 hours before and had gotten 6 hours of sleep the night before.  I am not superstitious, religous, and do not believe in ghosts or UFOs, or at least I didn&apos;t.   I have never hallucinated or fainted, and am not on any drugs, medications, or other physiologically or psychologically altering substances.

The young man is from Seattle.  He provided a really good drawing of what he observed with a &quot;halo&quot; around the object.  Incredibally, this object is very similar to the object I reported seeing on your web site from Bowling Green, Kentucky back on July 24, 2001.  Shockingly, the drawing is what took me back to remember that strange night.  Yes, this object he saw is very much like the object we saw that dark night through a pair of binoculars.  Our object too had a &quot;halo&quot; around it, and it was somewhat diamond/kite shaped.  This object we saw had a purple color to it, and it also glowed really bright in the sky.  It did appear as a really bright fireball until we used the binoculars to get a closer look.  All three of us witnesses saw the same thing.  What these things are I don&apos;t know.  But I do know that they are REAL, and still being observed in the skies of Warren/Simpson Counties here in Kentucky even today.  Friends of mine have seen them.  They look like large fireballs which move around at times.  Smaller bright objects also have been observed flying close to these larger fireball ones too.  This story is no lie.  It is the truth, and I propose that the Seattle man is telling us the truth about his sighting too. Thank You!

The recent controversy over whether night terrors cause people to continue dreaming  after awakening from a night terror needs to be restudied. On March 14, 2003 I began to have what is known as a night terror (These started after a head injury in 1994). I have never been able to fully awake during a night terror except for 03-14-03. Sometime in the early morning I started having a night terror as I partial awoke I saw two small black figures enter my bedroom at that point I started to freak out and was yelling at myself to wake up, wake up, wake up and then I awoke. The two small black objects were two small grey aliens, once awoke I no longer was freaking out. I looked directly at these two aliens they observed me for about three seconds and then went running down my hallway at what appeared to be around 50 or 60 mph, their was an amber light being emitted down my hallway and the aliens ran into the light and disappeared.  I jumped out of bed ran down the hallway unlocked the door that was 4 feet from the end of the hallway and ran outside, there was nothing but dead calm.  There was an highly unusual calmness in the air and physiologically.  I was the calmest and most relaxed that I have ever experienced in my life (No pain killer or muscle relaxent has ever put me in this state).  To this day I look at this experience as the coolest dream that I&apos;ve ever had. I don&apos;t feel crazy because i know the truth and we are not alone and this was not like the other night terrors that I have had where I wake up with a racing heart rate. I went back to sleep after this occured which is highly unusual.

At the time I noticed this object it became quiet any eerie.  All I heard was the wind.  The object never made a noise.  It flew on for about 2 minutes almost seeming to go up, not out in distance.

I lived on the 3rd floor of a building that was situated on a hill, so I estimate I was about 50 feet above the ground, with the treetops just below my balcony, facing due east. I know because the sun would rise directly in front of me. Off my balcony is an empty field and next to that is a local private school and a residential area. I owned a telescope, so I often would be on my balcony at night looking at stars, and I was familiar with the positions of constellations and planets, knowing their relative positions at any given time at night, or season. This one night I was on the balcony, and decided to train my telescope on a portion of the sky that I often did. As I looked for a bright object to observe, I noticed a perfectly circular cluster of &quot;stars&quot; that I hadn&apos;t noticed before. I knew it wasn&apos;t Plaiedes... though they were roughly as bright as the stars in that constellation. It was circular, and after realizing I hadn&apos;t seen it before, I continued to look at it, and realized the points of light were following each other in a pattern. It was rotating. After about 30 seconds of watching it, one of the points of light circled the others, then exited the cluster from the center, and accelerated away from the others. Soon after, they all seemed to diminish in brightness until they were all gone. I was certain they were moving, and it wasn&apos;t the illusion of movement that one gets when they stare at an object in the sky for a long time. I have noticed this phenomenon before, and I was careful to make absolutely certain I was not seeing things. I have seen simple satellites or space debris streaking across the sky before, and this behavior was not reminiscent of that.

Anyway, I was going to the supermarket with my girlfriend in Shanghai, China, near Jing An Temple area. All of a sudden, I noticed something like a fireball in the sky. At first I thought it might be a meteor or something like that but as I have seen a meteor/comet previously in my life, I quickly felt it probably wasn&apos;t, mostly because of the extremely slow speed this object was moving at.  After looking more carefully, I noticed it looked more like a huge, red glowing object with 3 visible glowing parts and a long red/fire-looking trail.  It was moving very slowly towards west. Suddenly, I noticed that there were other gray objects moving very fast around it!  Perhaps 2 or 4 of them, I am not sure as many were visible at the same time.  Once again, at first I thought it was something normal, just like jet fighters.  But that&apos;s when it got very interesting!  These smaller, gray, oval shaped objects were actually traveling at speeds and in a way that I&apos;ve never, ever seen in my life.  I think its worthy of mention that I grew up near an airport in Canada and every other year we have this huge air show I always attended.  I&apos;ve seen a huge variety of army aircrafts in action, including F-15s, F-18s, Vertical take off planes, F-117 (stealth airplanes) and so on so I can safely affirm that in my opinion, there is no way these could have been any aircrafts that the world knows of.  These objects could stop all of a sudden, disappear, show up again, go up, down, in a way that is not possible by any know aircrafts. Anyways, these objects seemed to move around and follow the bigger, fire-orange, glowing object with a big trail behind it. I could observe this for about 5 minutes before the big object disappeared behind tall residential towers with the smaller objects seeming to fade away as well. This happened almost a year ago but immediately after the event I went home and tried to somehow put into images what I&apos;ve seen while it was fresh in my mind.  As I&apos;m a web designer and being very familiar with the Flash software, I decided that the best way to make this look as close to reality as possible was to reproduce the objects in photoshop and animate them with Flash.  So I took a picture from the same place I observed this and put that picture as the background.  I then added the big glowing object and tried to make it move at about the same speed as It was moving.  Lastly, I&apos;ve added the smaller, oval shaped crafts and tried to animate them as close to the way they moved as possible.  I think the result is very very close to the reality of what I saw that day and I hope I could share this with the rest of the world as well. The only thing that might be slightly different from the reality is the fog, which is difficult to reproduce properly. During the actual sighting these objects were very slightly less visible than that because of the fog. But this is nonetheless a very good representation of what they looked like.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "The object made erratic movements.I got up before daylight to watch for the Space Shuttle Discovery and the Space Station that were to be possibly visable in the NW sky at 05:50.  There were no clouds in the sky and the stars and what I assumed to be Mars were quite visable as I live way out in the country with no city lights.  I never saw the Space Shuttle but continued to look and look.  Then I saw a very small &quot;star-looking&quot; object that stayed basically in the same location way overhead, almost straight overhead, but slightly west.  It moved in an isolated area making circles and less that 45 degree turns and weaved back and forth.  It could not have been a helicopter because they are unable to move like that.  This object appeared as a faint star with no flashing lights.  There was what appeared to be a regular airplane closer and to the NW that seemed oblivious to the object I saw.  The airplane seemed close, the &quot;object&quot; seemed like a far away star by comparison. I was reminded, by it&apos;s movements, of a paramecium under a microscope, the way one would randomly move about making strange, almost frantic movements.  I would step away and change my angle of veiw to see if it were something close, a moth perhaps, or a bat or bird, but no, it was way up there.  It never left it&apos;s limited area of movement. I watched it until daylight and I could no longer see it.", "Gigantic CigarMy name is David Anthony Woody and I use the nickname Tony. I live in Exeter, New Hampshire. I am a retired Navy Chief with twenty-two years of service. My job in the Navy was a lot of fun because I was an Instructor Flight Engineer on the P3 Orion  and EP-3 Reconnaissance aircraft. I also gave in flight check-rides to fellow pilots and flight engineers. I have twenty-one years of flying experience and I have logged over 10,000 hours of flight time. I also worked for Boeing in Everett Washington north of Seattle for two years as a Quality Assurance Manager leading a team of 65 people in the Systems Installation Division on the Boeing 777 Production Line. I&rsquo;ve flown over the entire globe and never have I ever seen anything like I saw on the afternoon of July 20, 2005 at approximately 3:15 PM. I was outside preparing my lawnmower getting ready to mow my yard. I had just fueled it and finished checking the oil and had finished installing the grass catcher when I took a drink from a glass of water and was looking up into the sky as I tilted the glass of water back to finish it off. That&rsquo;s when I noticed this enormous silver cigar shaped object in the sky at about a 40 to 45 degree angle above the horizon. There were very few clouds in the sky and it was about 90% clear blue sky that day with excellent visibility. Below you can see the information taken from the local Seacoast Online News Weather section for July 20, 2005 during that timeframe. Time   Condition    Temp  DewPoint Humid. Visib.      Press. Wind  2:55PM Partly Cloudy 90&deg;F  59&deg;F   36%  Unlimited   29.89  From WNW7mph  3:55PM Partly Cloudy 90&deg;F  59&deg;F    36%  Unlimited   29.88  From W9mph  To put the scale of the size of this object into perspective think about this, take a Cessna airplane and park it next to a Boeing 747. Then take the 747 and place it next to this object and the 747 would look like the Cessna does beside a 747 in relation to the size of the object. Another example would be that this object was about twice the size of a modern day US Navy Nimitz Class Aircraft Carrier. On first glance my initial thought was that it was the Hood blimp, which has been flying around in the area recently but I quickly dismissed that idea. While watching this object for about ten minutes I realized that it wasn&rsquo;t making any sound at all and although I can&rsquo;t be exact, I thought it was between 2500 and 3500 feet in the air. With something that large it&rsquo;s hard to really tell but I remember thinking that was about right because the clouds were around 5000 feet that day and it seemed to be below the clouds. There was also a row of large windows evenly spaced around the entire perimeter of the object a little bit higher than center on the object. I did not see anything or anyone in the windows. The object was moving from the West directly toward me heading in an Easterly direction and moving very slowly. Again with something that large it&rsquo;s hard to estimate speed with something that large but my educated guess is it was moving much slower than 100 knots. I looked around to see if any of my neighbors were outside but no one else was outside at the time but me. I also thought about running into the house to get my digital camera, but I didn&rsquo;t know how long the object would be there so I was afraid I would miss seeing it the entire time it was in view and I didn&rsquo;t want to risk that. I&rsquo;m glad I decided to stay because not long after I made that decision the object changed from a bright shiny silver color and started to glow a red/orange color. Then there was this strange looking cloud of orange/red flames that started growing and billowing underneath the entire bottom of the object. The billowing fiery clouds reminded me of the way napalm rolls along on the vintage war film footage of Viet Nam I&rsquo;ve seen on television except that there was no smoke associated with it. At that point I had a shot of adrenalin due to extreme fear because I thought it was going to attack me in some way. It looked as if the air itself had been suddenly ignited in a large billowing cloud of flames. Just as I was about to turn and run into the house due to fear the fiery cloud grew larger and it seemed to be pushing back toward the western end of the object and once it reached its peak (probably about half the diameter of the object) the object seemed to stretch out about twice its original size toward the eastern end of the object thus filling the entire sky in front of me and then in the wink of an eye the western end of the object caught up with the eastern end and it simply disappeared right in front of me. This entire process only took about four or five seconds and the instant the object disappeared so did the billowing fireball cloud. There was no apparent residual evidence that the object was ever there once it disappeared. I was stunned and stood there for several minutes wondering what to do and what had I just seen. I thought about calling the police but because no one else was there to see it with me I didn&rsquo;t think they would believe me so I didn&rsquo;t call. I knew I had to report it to somebody so I Googled the words report UFO and that&rsquo;s how I found the web site for the National UFO Reporting Center. I didn&rsquo;t notice any bright lights on the object although that doesn&rsquo;t mean it didn&rsquo;t have any because it was a bright sunny clear day and any lights would have been washed out by the bright sunlight and the reflected sunlight off of it&rsquo;s surface. Also the sun was high in the sky and in no way did it obscure my visibility of the object nor did any reflected sunlight from the object obscure my vision of it in any way. There were no trees or man-made structures obstructing my view. The object made no noise at all during the entire event. This was absolutely one of the most amazing things I have ever seen in my life and I&rsquo;ve seen a lot. In my opinion this was not something man made and it was far too big to be a blimp or an airplane. I believe it was not of this Earth. Other than that I have no idea what it was, where it came from or where it went. It absolutely appeared to be under intelligent control and exhibited use of technology far beyond anything known to mankind today unless this is some kind of new top-secret government craft previously unheard of. I seriously doubt that though because it would be almost impossible to hide something from the public of this gigantic physical size if it were a secret government project.

The former flight engineer, who wished to be identified only as &quot;David,&quot; said of the experience, &quot;this was like nothing I&apos;ve ever seen before.&quot; What the retired Navy chief petty officer said he saw last Wednesday could only be classified as a UFO, an unidentified flying object. It was a bright and sunny afternoon, about 3:15 p.m., and David was outside preparing his lawnmower. He had filled the mower with gas, checked the oil, and took a sip from a glass of water he had poured.When he tilted his head back to get the final sip, through the bottom of the glass he saw a large cigar-shaped object hovering in the sky. David said windows were equally spaced around the object, however he didn&apos;t see anyone or anything inside. The size of the object was enormous. By comparison, he said, consider what an ultralight planewould look like next to a Boeing 747. He said it was about the size of two USS Nimitz aircraft carriers. At first glance, through his empty glass of water he thought it could have been the Hood blimp. &quot;But, the instant I put my glass down, I said, &apos;that&apos;s not a blimp.&apos;&quot; The object moved from west to east, very slowly for something that size, he said. His initial instinct was that the object was moving at about 100 knots, but something that big shouldn&apos;t be able to stay in the air if it&apos;s going that slow, he said. The object began changing colors from a bright silver to an orange-ish red. A strange cloud of red and orange flames began surrounding the object, and before he knew it the object stretched out like a rubber band. It grew to about twice its original size, and then it was gone. The entire incident lasted about 10 minutes, he recalled Monday morning, but he is unaware of the specific time because, &quot;it felt like time stopped.&quot; He went into his house and first thought to call the police. He decided not to because he didn&apos;t think they&apos;d take him seriously. So he went on the Internet and searched for &quot;report UFO,&quot; and found the Web site for the Seattle-based National UFO Reporting Center. Peter Davenport, director of the UFO reporting center, said David&apos;s report was astonishing because of his history with flight. &quot;I have no question on his reliability.&quot; He said he gets several accounts each year, but this one stood out. The report was well written and scientific, Davenport said. &quot;In my view, that&apos;s one of the cardinal rules of an account,&quot; he said. The center was founded in 1974 by UFO investigator Robert Gribble. The center&apos;s Web site, www.nuforc.org, has a large list of UFO sightings.  According to the site, the center&apos;s primary function is to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have witnessed possible UFOs. David&apos;s report, which will soon be on the Web site, will be among dozens of documented sightings to be formally reported to the center. Not the first time The Exeter area is no stranger to UFO sightings. In 1965, two Exeter police officers and hitchhiker Norman Muscarello, who was with them, gained national attention after seeing a UFO hovering over Route 101 in Kensington. The sighting was documented in a book called &quot;The Incident at Exeter.&quot; And then there was the incident involving Barney and Betty Hill, a husband and wife from Portsmouth who claimed to have been abducted by aliens. The couple was driving from a vacation in Canada in 1961 when they saw a UFO. The object moved directly over their car, and before they knew it they grew drowsy. They later claimed to have been abducted by aliens and gave identical accounts while they were hypnotized. But for this recent sighting, David said he believes that there is life beyond Earth. He said the galaxy is so enormous, it&apos;s hard to believe humans are the only intelligent life. &quot;To the point of not being obnoxious, it&apos;d be egocentric to think there is no other life out there.&quot;  This page has been printed from the following URL:  http://www.seacoastonline.com/news/exeter/07262005/news/54621.htm Copyright 1999 - 2004 Seacoast Newspapers, a division of OttawayNewspapers Inc., all rights reserved.((END COPIED ARTICLE))((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness shortly after his alleged sighting, and we found him to be quite eloquent, objective, and credible.

My husband was out of town and I was alone in the house. At first I thought the cats were in the house and were playing and running around.  But then I looked outside and they were on the porch sleeping.  Then I heard loud thumping sounds coming from my bedroom overhead, like someone was walking in heavy boots and making noise on purpose.  A few seconds later, I heard the side patio door open and close twice. I turned off the T.V. and went to investigate and when I did I noticed a low-level mechanical humming sound that seemed to have no source. The side door was locked from the inside, so no one could have opened it, yet I clearly heard the door open. I decided to double check the doors and go to bed and listen to Coast to Coast AM to hear Peter Davenport.  While lying in bed I looked up at the skylight and noticed that it was completely black outside.  There was no rain that night, and even with clouds you can always see some light from the street light across the street.  I remember thinking that was odd.  I was listening intently as Peter came on and was talking about the recent sighting in Idaho on July 8.  I remember looking at the clock at approximately 12:45 AM. I don&apos;t remember going to sleep, but the next thing I knew the radio was on very loud and the clock said 1:30 PM, and I had missed hearing the witnesses talk about their experience. I don&apos;t have an explanation as to how the radio got so loud. I turned the radio off, then looked up and saw that the skylight was not black anymore, and had the familiar bluish glow from the streetlight again. The low humming sound was also gone. I have no idea what happened.  I believe that I had a missing time experience, and that something or someone did not want me to hear the radio, but also wanted to get my attention. They did. Was this an abduction or a visitation? I may need to be hypnotized to find out.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Bright lights were seen on the bottom of the craft illuminating the land around us as it banked to the east over Lake Ontario.  It was travelling at a high speed and appeared to be headed towards Toronto.  Craft appeared to have about 12 lights illuminating from the bottom.  Craft banked to the east then disappeared over towards Toronto direction not far from Pearson Airport.  No noise was heard.  Several other area witnesses came around asking if we saw the UFO. Similar craft was seen in an old UFO magazine my parents picked up for me in the USA during the summer.  Craft in photo was not as clear as the one I saw with witnesses and lights on bottom were not seen, however colours were exact. Local radio station reported it as a meteorite, not possible, but info was obtained from radio station from the Canadian Military. Pearson Airport formerly called Malton was the former home of AVRO, which developed a flying saucer for the USAF back in the early 1960&apos;s, paid for by US military.  This project did not get off the ground but it became the forerunner of the hovercraft.  Also the CF 105 AVRO Arrow a nuclear aged supersonic bomber  was developed earlier at this location but was destroyed on orders of the Conservative Government.  AVRO later closed with many of their employees heading to NASA and had a hand in the development of the Space Shuttle. Sighting could have been an experimental aircraft for the US military having to have a forced landing at Pearson or Downsview Military Airport in North York.  Lights on bottom may have been landing lights.  Craft did not appear to rotate, but as in the Stealth Fighter flew like a military jet - without the noise.  There was no evicence of a sonic boom but craft did not appear to be travelling in excess of speed of sound. Lots of projects were ongoing in plain sight of the public many of whom  did not report sightings for fear ridicule.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I was apparently awakened by the noise too, but did not fully gain full consciousness until it ceased and so I did not know what it was that had woke me. My wife walked into my daughters room and they both listened to it together. The sound seemed to move from above the house from the east and moved slowly over the house and then more quickly away from the house toward the west. I did not post this account in 1997 because I had already posted another account about a UFO and felt that it would sound unbelievable that so many events were happening to us. But I recently noted another person&rsquo;s account on this site about a like event at 3:50 AM on 11/7/04 in Ashburn, VA. Our account was much like that one except we saw no special light.However on 11/9/97 (a few days after the first event) my wife was woke out of sleep by a light shining in her face &ndash; but this time with no noise. Also, later on, a small lamp in our room came on by itself and caused her to wake up again. What I found interesting is that from 11/2/97 till 11/7/2004 is 7 X 366 days.

At first we thought it was an airplane on fire about to crash. After crossing over I5, object hovered over the fields next to Southbound I5. At closer observation object had two round bright white lights. Object separated into 3 objects, each with two bright round white lights. 1 object changed color to yellow lights. One object changed color to red lights. Yellow lights flew back over I5 to fly over the fields next to Northbound I5. Objects were flying over the fields to either side of I5. Observers in car kept driving and eventually lost sight of objects behind them. Detailed Version: What driver saw: Driving north on I5, having passed the stockyards on the right side of North I5 and maybe 5 minutes further (doing 70-80 mph). Near Exit 33 (Coalinga). Driver saw a very bright white object flying very fast from the right side of the sky. She said she knew it wasn&rsquo;t natural, because it was a clear dark starry night, and it was too low for an airplane. She said it was a very bright white light. She said as it crossed over all lanes of I5 (from right to left) a half mile in front of the car, she could see in profile that it was a thin wedge shaped object that was so bright she thought it was an airplane on fire, about to crash. But it crossed over all lanes of I5 and hovered over the empty fields to the left of us, next to Southbound I5. Her impression was that it was about the size of a jet. What I saw (Passenger): The driver had just seen a bright white object fly low across all lanes of I5 and then stabilize, hovering above the fields to the left of us. I missed this because I had my eyes closed, resting.She said, &ldquo;What was that !&rdquo; and I opened my eyes to look.I looked across the highway ahead and to our left. What I saw looked like two round bright white lights (bright like halogen lights) at about the height of a medium sized radio tower (Note &ndash; I did not see any tower). My friend, on the drivers side, had a better view, and she described it as super bright and was illuminating the field below it - bright and white as a search-light. She said she could see the leaves of the vegetation in the brightness of the light.She asked me again what I thought it was in the field on our left. The shape of the object appeared to me like two horizontally aligned round lights close together, as if connected or mounted near each other but not touching. I saw the bright lights but did not see that they were attached to anything (I have poor night vision and was wearing old eyeglasses). It was too dark for me to see anything in profile, all I saw was lights. I said, &ldquo;Its just a radio tower&quot; (I had NOT been looking ahead and had not seen the object flying across I5 in front of us). She insisted I was wrong, that it had flown there and was hovering, and asked me to look again. So I twisted in my seat to watch it as we passed. At first as I stared at the bright horizontal dual-lights they were stationary in the air. Then suddenly, they tilted in the air to slant downwards at an angle (30 degrees). As I watched, a second dual-light object slid out from behind the first one (at the same angle), so that now there were two, and then a third slid into view so now there were 3 distinctly separate dual-light objects. They paused, then object3  oriented back to horizontal and flew to the right and up, away from the other two. At the same time, Objects 1 and 2 separated further from each other. It was VERY Dark, I5 has no lights. I kept my eyes on object3 so as not to lose sight of it. Suddenly, with a bright Flash, object3&rsquo;s lights changed from Bright white to Bright yellow. In the peripheral of my vision I could see that another of the objects changed from white to Red at the same time. I believe the original object 1 stayed white. I confirmed this later with my friend who was driving &ndash; she had taken a glance at the object(s) as it separated and changed colors.This all happened very quickly (maybe 10 seconds from separation to color change).Objects moved smoothly (not in jerks) and flew smoothly while I observerd, clearly fast but did not move at jet speeds, more like fast helicopter speeds. The driver said she thought they where a little higher than an overpass, which is consistent with my observation that they were about the height of a medium sized radio tower. The Yellow object now started to fly across I5 again, passing overhead. I looked up through the glass sunroof as object3 (the Yellow lights) passed overhead. I did not see any &ldquo;shape&rdquo; of an aircraft &ndash; just the yellow lights (but I was wearing my old eyeglasses). I also did not hear any aircraft engines or noise &ndash; and even though the car windows were closed, I think I would have heard jet engines or helicopter blades at the height it passed over us, if it was that sort of craft. The yellow lights (object3) hovered over the empty fields to our right, as our car drew further ahead of it. Object3 must have been also flying parallel to our direction, because it maintained its distance behind us, moving around a bit over the fields, and we were not leaving it behind as quickly as if it had been stationary. This spooked both of us, and we drove faster. It was perhaps a minute before we finally lost sight of it behind us (which is a long time when you&rsquo;re doing 70-80 mph). I finally lost sight of it when it started to cross over I5 again. I twisted around in my seat to look across I5 to the fields on the left of us, looking for the other objects. I briefly saw a bright white lighted object on the side of I5 south, then lost sight of it in the dark behind us. I looked at the time, it was 9:18 pm (pst). I estimate the duration of our sighting was from 3 to 5 minutes. There were no headlights of traffic behind us (there had been at the start).I am assuming other drivers slowed down or stopped to watch.We were too spooked to stop. Traffic on Southbound lanes of I5 was becoming heavy and slowing down &ndash; I suspect due to people slowing down as well, to watch this phenomena.", "screaming whistle with bright light hit windshield with a shocking vibrating noise and disappeared.Sitting at a stop light I heard a loud whistle, like something I&apos;ve heard in a fireworks display, at the same time a round light hit my windshield and fluttered really loud like a shock sound.

Luckily it came back Saturday night September 11th, 2004 and there was about 40 of people standing on rooftops of their homes to see it over the downtown LA skyline. Everyone was pretty freaked out and we have very detailed footage of the entire incident. We even saw what appeared to be U.S. Military jets surrounding the craft. When they got there, the UFO turned off its bright orange glow and it seemed to have turned into some type of triangle or it just appeared that way because of the various blinking lights. As it was traveling east we could tell the smaller crafts were possibly jets because of the enormous speed they used to catch up to the craft.The jets seemed to be traveling so quick but not the UFO, it kind of took its time going east. Everything we could possibly catch and see with the camera is recorded from the top of a neighbor&rsquo;s roof. This all happened over the downtown  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We were both 11 yrs old.  We looked up in the sky and both observed a pulsing light that was moving south across the desert sky. It was totally silent.  It would cross from left to right, then make a perfect right angle turn, go a short distance away from us and make another 90 degree turn to go across the sky to the left. Then it would make another right angled turn away from us, go a short distance and turn again to the right and go across the sky. This pattern, as if the light was plowing the sky, the way a tractor would plow a field, continued for several minutes until it disappeared in the distance. The next morning I went back to that ball field just to look around and found some pieces of official looking paper, like government letterhead, on the infield dirt.  I could see where it said US Air Force at the top in a blue ink. There were burn marks on the paper. That&apos;s all.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I looked at a light moving over a mountain in front of the house and noticed no noise as well as very angular movements.  The light was steady and not blinking, it moved rather slowly but very erratic.  I watched for about five minutes and ran into the house.  I was with a friend and told him to go home - I don&apos;t really remember telling him to go, but I dont remember him being there when I ran into the house.

I was standing in the doorway of the business I work at catching some fresh air and watching people.About 5 blocks further North of us is a condo.  As I looked in this direction I viewed what I thought at first to be a plane emerging from approximately 1/2 to 1 mile from behind the building.  As I watched this &quot;plane&quot; I thought it to be moving too slow to be acting like an average small plane like a cesna type.  I kept watching this object as its flight path took it due South over N.W. 4th Ave over Downtown Portland Oregon.  My store is located on the corner of 4th Ave. and West Burnside Street and it took this object approximately 6 minutes to travel 1/2 to 1 mile behind the originating building which is located at N.W. 4th Ave. and Flanders Street (which is about 5 blocks North of my store) to being above my store. The object was circular in shape.  Silver in color with a darker underside possibly black in color.  The top half appeared to be dome shaped and the underside was tubed shaped.  At the point when it was above my store it appeared to extend the &quot;tubing&quot; that protruded from the underside and then retract it.  The object emitted no sound or lights of any kind.  It was approximately 1000 feet in the sky and smaller than the size of a dime.  When viewing it from the street it was about 2 inches above my store which is a 2 story building.  The object was viewed by five other people including one co-worker of mine.  Several pictures were taken of the object as it approached my store and I am waiting for the film to be developed.", "I was talking with an acquaintance outside a house on a cold clear night. As we talked, my attention was distracted by an airborn vehicle with a row of white lights across the front. There was no sound at all. It was not a plane, I did not know what I was looking at. I had to stop my conversation and ask what it was. The other person said he saw things like that frequently and that the locals referred to them as space ships. It came in very close and I had the distincet impression that it was aware of us and was beningn. It then zipped away up into the stars at a very fast rate toward a the middle of a triangluar constellation.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Saw the same distinct objects as in the last report. Instead of seeing six tonight like last time, I saw 2. I instantly recognized them from last time, this is the third overall sighting. Same blink pattern as before. White white red. white white red.  Seemed to be just slightly larger than last time and it looked like a triangle wedge shape, but it would be impossible to know for sure without binoculars. No sounds, smooth and silent and slow (It seemed they would cross the width of a full moon in about 7 seconds). Crafts were heading Northeast on the same course it appeared.  The 2nd object was about 2 minutes behind the 1st object (2 min to get to same place in sky). The 2nd craft crossed opposite paths with what looked to be a satellite or the ISS heading in the opposite direction, but then that object got dimmer. Again I find myself wishing I had a telescope.

And after explosion a grey light disappeared at drivier&apos;s side(left hand site of car) and height was 300-400 ft away from ground.

It looked like Venus would look - the size and brightness - but in the daytime - and moving - parallel to the street I was on; not too fast/not too slow, until it was almost directly overhead.  Then it stopped.  It stayed there for about 3-4 seconds, then in a flash, it made a right angle turn and sped away.

I am not sure what the date was other than the Year and Month. It was April of 1996. This is a real true encounter and I do not wish to be known. It has been actually a hard thing for me to deal with in my life.I was actually going to go home to grab my guitar. I was a 25 year old guitar virtuoso. My indian friend from the Hopi tribe in town was waiting for me to come back. I was a kid, just trying to have some fun on a Friday night. So now I am going to put into perspective the events that happened, true and factual. I will have you know straight forward that this story is complete and true. I will send drawn pictures soon.So I was driving in my Dodge Rampage on Hwy. 50 East in Moundhouse Nevada. My window was down. The air was blowing on my face. I had my radio tuned in and up fairly loud. My speakers sucked with some distortion, but it was cool with me. I was on my way home to grab my guitar at 11:00 at night. I was intending to get there as fast as possible cause I wanted to create some music with my friend Chris, the Indian.So it was already late and I knew I had to hurry. I had nothing else to do.I passed the Virginia City turn off on the left. As I passed it I noticed some light on the hills at the mouth of the Canyon there. There were 4 lights. They were a whitish blue and very very bright. They were lighting up the sagebrush actually on the hillside on the west side of the VC Highway. They were about 50 to 100 feet off the ground. I was driving so, I saw the lights but I looked away as I was driving. I was thinking to myself thats a low jet. I thought it was a jet plane coming from Reno. I looked back at them. They were still in the same spot some 30 seconds later. Then I began to wonder. What the heck is that. Must be a helecopter I thought. Then I really began to stare. No it&apos;s not a helecopter. I knew it was no helecopter or plane. Yet, I could see no object, only lights. They were not moving. I could see the brush on the hill bright as day. I saw some things moving in the brush. Little objects scurrying about very quick like that of coyote&apos;s or something. My heart began to thump. The adrenaline kicked in as I realized this was something different than that I&apos;d ever seen.I was driving still and slowed down so I could see more of it. I was very realized and already had a hunch it was a UFO. I said out loud, &quot;Haha yeah you know I can see you.&quot; As soon as I said this, the lights began to turn. They were no longer shining on the brush. They span approximately 100 yards apart with 2 on top about 30 yards apart and the lower ones at the sides about 100 yards apart. They looked like the lights in a stadium kind of. They were very big and bright. There were no other cars behind me I could see lights from nor in front of me.My heart was racing fast. I was frightened. I no longer was really watching the road. The lights had my total attention. They turned around and began slowly hovering down the Canyon towards the Highway I was driving on. There were then smaller lights below the larger ones that were blinking in succesion around and repeated. Thats when I realized it was a round object. I was freaking out. My eyes were huge I&apos;m sure and I was awake and ready to notice every detail. The lights came closer down the canyon as if to head me off at the pass. Like direct coordinates at my speed to meet me at a certain point ahead. I knew I was heading straight towards them at the same time. I was afraid, yet I was curious.So I kept driving and looking as they became larger and closer. I was amazed. Entranced by the realization and curiousity I barely even looked at the road ahead. I was just staring out my downed window. My radio became all fuzzy and then was silent.My car was driving fine.Soon there became an embankment on the side of the Highway that separated the lights from my vision. I knew from driving the Highway many times that the embankment recedes as you approach Dayton hill where the Canyon is. I also knew the thing was moving down the canyon at the same speed I was. The suspense was incredible.I came to the hill and as soon as the Embankment receded, there I saw something that I will never forget for the rest of my life. I was at top the hill and the Canyon beside me on the left. Right there as the ground cleared way, I was gazing into the middle of a set of windows! Yes, this was real. I was not even watching the road. I was mezmerized by the depth. I was staring straight into a spacecraft from another world. It was indeed a saucer. Yes, there were long windows draping all the way across and around. I saw the tiers or stories, the floors. I saw the walls. Everything inside was white.This was incredibly astounding. I had no clue what to think or anything. All I could do was stare and observe.It was like I was above it and as I went down the hill I became level with it.On the left bottom story in the windows were aliens that I first saw. There was a female. They all were wearing white robes. She had a bracelet and a necklace on, that of gold or silver and makeup like blush on her cheeks. Her arm was on the shoulder of a younger one, a boy and they were looking right at me. Right into my eyes they were. She nudged herself to him and spoke to the other younger children along the window maybe 10 or so more. They were all smaller like a 5 year old. She was talking to the older boy and them without speaking! And me! I felt a joyful feeling inside as they gazed into my eyes and she then smiled and pointed at me as to show them that I understood her and them. Her long finger, their faces grey. She had 3 fingers and a thumb.I then had a terrible feeling. I looked up to the second story. There was 2 beings there in the middle of the room. I was about level with them I think. The being I first saw had a long draped back skull like that of the movie alien kinda but the face andeyes of E.T. His skin was chocolate brown and he too was wearing a white robe. His skull was maybe 2 feet long behind his head draping down. His face looked a lot like E.T. The kids faces below looked like the alien pictures you often see yet their eyes weren&apos;t black. Their eyes were shaped like the pictures but they were white with irises. Blue eyes, the girl had green eyes.The one with the draped skull on the second story was standing and holding a clipboard against himself in his white robe. I noticed all that stuff as he noticed me. His mouth dropped! His eyes bulged! As he realized I was looking at him and them and He was staring straight into my eyes! He was frightened that I saw him. It was deffinately not part of his plan. His eyes were white with huge blue irises and pupils. I&apos;d estimate I was 20 feet from his face.I made contact alright. He immediately turned to the other one in the room in front of him. The one in front of him was sitting. I saw the side view of him but only his head at the time. He had a human like head. Not a draped skull. I could see wrinkles all over his head. It made him look very old. No hair on any of them whatsoever.He was not in white. He was wearing a black suit from what I could see. He turned his face toward me! Right after the one with the clipboard looked at him after seeing me! He turned his face toward me. Ohhhh Myyyy Goddd was I scared!!!! He was so so so so so old looking it sent shivers all over me. His face was all wrinkled and old and his eyes all beady! They were pure black. As he and I stared eachother in the eyes I realized he was a man. He was a human. He must&apos;ve been thousands of years old and very wicked. I was petrified. I was scared shitless. He gave me this snarling look yet at the same time I could see his smarts. There was some kind of bigscreen in front of him blinking at the outer rim of the windows edge at the end of the ship windows on his floor. He then looking at me directly, raised his hand up with a very long finger and smiled or smirked as he hit a button on some kind of panel in front of him.Instantly! The windows covered themselves with a fanlike shell that was that like of ripples like of a Chinese fan decending from the top. Corrogated riffles about 1 foot high each decending from the top to the middle. They were breathing like and sparkling with colors. I noticed that they were very sharp looking like razor blades all on the top along the riffles.They could cut through anything! The bottom sealed up and began blinking lights around in succession. That must be how they do their airports. That must be their laws or regulations I thought.Then it began to spin. My window was still down and I was close to the bottom of the hill as I heard the riffles begin to hummmm! They sounded like they were some kind of giant fan blades. The object tilted at about a 45 degree angle. As it spun faster and faster I could only see the outline of it. Like it was suddenly cloaked. Kinda like a rim on a car as it spins. It spun so fast it began to become invisible. It then shot up into the sky leaving a small white trail behind for a split second.I was petrified. I had reached the bottom of the hill and pulled over. I had to look through my rear view mirror to switch lanes from traffic. I pulled over and got out of my car. I looked up. I wanted to see it more. It was sunny outside. There were cars going by. It only takes 3 minutes to get down the hill. I was at the top at 11:00 P.M. and the bottom around 8:30 or something. Yet, I didn&apos;t even realize this. Not at all. I had no conception of time. I was tired. I went home and crashed out. I woke up and remembered the hill. I don&apos;t know how it was daylight when I got to the bottom of a 3 minute hill at 11:00. I don&apos;t remember anything between that time accept for driving down the hill. I have only told a handfull of people this story.There&apos;s more to it as well in the day and the months that followed. I will tell more if I get a chance. I think they were mining gold or silver. I bet if someone pulled a map of resouces and compared it to sightings they might realize some things.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I just had finished going to a Sunday school bus meeting.  As I was driving towards town I noticed off to my right a really shiny object,(like a top) hovering around the Family Life Radio Station tower. It was hovering just about 50-75 feet off the ground.  It was a bright sunny day, and I was first thinking, why would anyone have a weather balloon here. I  thought, why isn&apos;t it moving, because balloons move. This was not moving when I first saw it. As I approached Tomlinson Road, (the radio station tower was located on that road, maybe about half a mile straight down from Eden Road), I kept watching the object. It was a very bright silver, glistening in the sun.  It had no windows, no lights, nothing except that it was really a bright silver.  It wasn&apos;t moving, just staying still. I was listening to that radio station, (WUNN), and I came to the intersection of Eden and Tomlinson. When I got to the intersection, the radio station went completely static so I couldn&apos;t hear it at all.  Then the object started to move and I decided to try to follow it.  It really started to speed up and I know I was doing 60 mph and it just flew off and I couldn&apos;t keep up.  I saw no engine or anything to make it move that fast.  I went home and called the Capital City airport and asked them if they had any reports of an object shaped like a top reported to them. They acted like I was a little nuts, but they said they had nothing reported to them.

However, they were jostling around and did not remain in a tight formation.  We watched them for about 10-15 seconds.  Then when they were at about 80-85 degrees from vertical, the lights simply vanished.  I cannot explain why the lights went out if they were standard airplane lights.

Also, the witness count of seventy plus represents toses imediatly around me, but does not reflect the thousands of host nationals who witnessed the spheres as it flew form Clark Air Base to Cubi point Naval Air station.  Or the Two F-4 Phanthom aircrews or the two A-4 Skyhawk pilots that were circling the object.  It took the aircraft between six to eight second to traverse from one side of the sphere to its other before dissappearing behind it.

Between the bus load of people getting off and those waiting to board and the people waiting for cabs as well as the people coming out of the chow hall across the street, I estimate that there were atleast seventy plus people around us. I grew up in the air force and my rate in the Navy was that of an airdale.  I flew mainly aboard SH-46 Sea Knight choppers. I am very verse in both military, commercial and general aviation aircraft.  I am sure that this vehicle was not of any technologies that I am aware of in either construction or aerodynamic properties. I was also assigned several years later to the Naval Air Test Center at Patuxent River, in Maryland.  There I came into contact with some of the advance airframes or technology could produced in the eighties.  I&apos;ve discussed what I saw that night in the Philippines with some of the best minds in the disciplines of aeronautic design and theory.  None of them have ever been able to tell me what I saw that night. Of note, that I have always found interresting, is that the day after the sighting, my former wife, whom as I said was my finance at the time of the sighting, was a live in maid who worked in base housing. That evening when I met her at the bus stop in front of the chow hall, she was very hesitant to talk about what we had seen the night before.  She said that the enlisted service man whose family she worked for.  Upon returing home after work that day, asked her if she had seen anything unusual the night before.  She told him of the sighting.  He told her that he had been in a meeting with other servicemen who had famlies on the base that day.  They had been told to inform their domestics that it could cost them their jobs if they discussed with anyone what they had seen the night before.  Also as in her case, my permismion to request to mary her could be denide, even though it had been approved.  Or she may find it impossible to pass the American bried course which was mandatory befor we could get married. Cubi Point Nas was located atop the hill range abouve Subic Bay Naval Operations Base.  From the vantage point which we were at,  We could see the object approacing from the north.  The only sound associated with it were the turbines of the fighters that Clark air base and Cubi Point NAS had launched.  It turned and proceed to slowly fly over Cubi and off towards the Marine Ordance Magazine depot. I estimated from the the two different types of interceptors, of which I was toatll;y familiar with, that they and this object were approximately eight to nine hundred feet in the air.

I was looking out my upstairs bedroom window and over the tree top, which was about a half a city block away, and about 60 feet high, appeared a large cigar shaped object.  It made no noise, but changed colors from red to white. Not blinking, but blending. It stayed for about 3 to 5 min. then shot straight up and was gone.

My husband was reclined down looking out the sun roof.  He jumps and says &quot;what was that?&quot; I did not see it yet.  My husband discribed it as a gray, huge watermellon shaped object.  We were getting off the by-pass and I was looking for a place to park to look.  A few minutes later, I parked in the Meijers Parking lot.  By this time it was a mile away.  Large like the size of the Sun at sunset.  My husband said it looked like a triangle from off in the distance.  It did not move like a plane.  Back and force like a sea-saw.   It went in and out of the clouds a few time, then disappeared.  To me it looked totally round, like a dark circle, balloon, without a basket.  We are 49 years old.  Of course when we share this with family, they just smile and listen.  End of story  My son had a &quot;UFO&quot; experience too about seven years back.  He was in his car with cousin, maybe a friend too, and something small like his car, came real close to them and took off super fast.  It tagged along with them at the night time and zoomed with percular patterns, unlike airplanes.  My son is now a pilot.  He was only 18 or so back at the time this happen, late in the evening with his cousin, who also saw the unknown aircraft around Warsaw, IN.

Opon closer evaluation while standing outside, I noticed the object would slowly drift to the side and downward,and then upward again.  The object did not necessarily return to its original position or appear to be moving away.  I would have to say the object was several miles away, but I really could not determine it&apos;s actual distance.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

My sister and I who were six or seven years old at the time (twins) were playing in the barnyard away from the adults.  She and I were sitting on the barn gate when I noticed in the distance over the corn fields a bright light that was coming our way.  It wasn&apos;t in a hurry and I was anxious to see what it was.  I continued playing and kind of kept an eye on it&apos;s movements.  The closer it got the more I could make it out and it had the most beautiful flowing &quot;gown&quot; that looked luminescent and changed colors as if it were shading.  It was just to the left of me about 30 feet off the ground when I thought that it was an angel but got the feeling that it wasn&apos;t exactly friendly.  As it came directly in front of me I held my breath so as not to be noticed hoping that it would just go away! It continued passing by me, and then it stopped, turned it&apos;s head sharply and looked directly at me!  It did that for what seemed like an eternity but was only a few seconds.  I saw its eyes, the color of its hair, its face and there was no smile.  It felt sinister.  After it was done sternly looking at me it continued on its way passing over several farm houses until I could no longer see its glowing dress.  My sister and I ran to the porch where everyone was sitting and they also noticed the bright light but thought nothing of it.  Did anyone else see that being on that warm summer night in Illinois?  I really need an answer.", "Intensely illuminated, sphereoid object moving far too quickly at a 70-75 degree angle into the sky.The object was observed in the night sky at the foot of Brindlee Mtn. roughly above southbound Hwy 231.  At first site, the object was located above the trees about half a mile east of the road (estimated perhaps 300 ft. above ground level on the slope of the mountain).  The object appeared to be roughly round, very slightly elongated, and from my vantage point seemed to be composed of bright blue-white light.  The intensity and color of the light was inconsistant with all fireworks, street lamps, yard lights, and other such sources of illumination that I am aware of.  Within the 2-3 seconds I had a good view of the craft, I observed it to hover above the tree line for an estimated 1/10th of a second and then rapidly moved upwards and westwards, crossing the sky in front of my vehical in approximately 1 second.  From my vantage point, it is my opinion that the object moved in three dimensional space in the same way that an aircraft takes off a runway, only much more rapidly and at a much sharper angle (I estimate the angle would have been roughly 70-75 degrees and the trajectory did not change as it moved).  As the object moved, it also changed color.  The blue-white quality of the light changed to a greenish color and then to a reddish orange color as it gained altitude, and decreased slightly in size proportionally to it&apos;s altitude.  The object seemed to vanish completely at the end of it&apos;s approx. 1 second trajectory, and the final location of the object I estimate to be at a substantial altitude (at least 5,000 ft, though that is a very conservative estimate) and probably at least 1 mile west of southbound Hwy 231 (also a conservative estimate).A slightly audible sound followed about one second behind the object, and I can only describe it as a Doppler Effect-type sound, though very faint and high pitched (I would compare it to the scream of a fighter-jet engine, only much higher pitched with a very unique undertone). It is my opinion that this object could not possibly be an airplane or other man-made craft, as it began too close to the ground and progressed at an extreme angle and speed that I have never seen or heard of in a human aircraft.  The only object I know of that could travel from close to the ground to that alititude at anything nearly approaching that speed would be a rocket of some sort, and the intensity of illumination and the speed of the object is not consistant with any amature rocket.  So far as I know, there are no housing or human habitation sites in the area that the object was hovering over.  The local area is nearly completely covered in hardwood forest.  My geological survey map of the area shows no unusual geological phenomenon.  There were no powerlines or cell phone/radio towers located in the area where the object originated.  The atmospheric conditions were humid, but clear.  There is no chance that the object was a star or planet, as it appeared closer than the horizon and was too close to the ground, and from my moving vehical, the object changed perspective in the way that a three dimensional object would be expected to.  The object could not have been a meteor because it ascended into the sky, while a meteor would have descended. As for my background, I am a native to this area and I am an archaeologist, currently investigating an excavation site on the Flint River flood plain.  When I saw the object I was returning home from visiting friends in Huntsville.  I had not imbibed any alcohol, nicotine, narcotic, or any other mind affecting substance.  I was not affected by fatigue and I have no history of mental illness, nor any physical or psychological cause for hallucination.  I am reporting this because I can think of no other logical conclusion for what I saw than to label it a UFO.", "3 bright hovering lights seen in the sky for 45mins moving around before vanishing21:15hrs Sighted from my back garden we spotted a bright glowing light in the distance. It was hovering alone for about 5 mins when another less bright light appeared slightly lower and to the right of the original light. The second light to the right then began to glow far brighter and then changed to a pale orange colour, whilst the 1st light remaind white. Then a 3rd light appeared on the horizon vey small and only giving off a faint glow. It was in between the 2 existing lights it rapidly grew larger and became brighter as it approached. They all 3 hovered in a line for approximately 5 mins before the light to the far right very slowly started to fade until it was undetectable to the naked eye. Then the light to the far left slowly started to move across the sky to the right then just appeared to vanish. The final remainding light then started to fade until it too finally vaished from sight. 21:45 A lone light suddenly appearred in the same place as the previous ones for about 2 mins when a 2nd brighter light joined it. They both remained stationary for about 3 mins until the one one on the left again began to fade until it disappeared. The last remaining one then moved off slowly to the right before vanishing completely.

As i said what the hell is that we all at the same time looked in astonishment, it was moving very slow and i ran in to get my video camara it shot off we then saw it tonight again 8/8/05 same thing again but it dissapeared as it got close to a plane as we have an airport just behind our houses . it was very weird and maybe nothing but we rang the local ufo people and i thought id let you lot know, Not sure if you deal with places in englan If not no worries.", "Flashing light with no running lights inbetween flashes over NE ColoradoWhile stargazing last night (8/6/05) approximately 10:55 MT, a lady friend with me pointed out a white flashing light in the NE sky travelling to the north.  The light flashed once like a bright aircraft light but after the initial flash there were no visible running lights like a conventional aircraft.  About 10 seconds later the light flashed again in an apparent northward movement, and repeated once more about 10 seconds later further north again.  There were no lights or shapes visible inbetween flashes. It was then obstructed from view in the distance by trees and buildings. The light appeared bright and close enough that normal aircraft running lights would have been easily visible inbetween the long delay between flashes.  Also the light first appeared in the NE section of the sky, it was not visible coming from the south. We had been skygazing continuously for approximately the past 20-30 minutes prior to the sighting, were actually looking up when the first flash occurred, and would have seen the light if it had been approaching from the south. The only other events of note were that we did notice 3 or 4 meteor streaks spaced out over the time we were gazing, and the only possible way for me to explain the light conventionally might be a small meteor travelling too slow to create a visible streak but fast enough for some material to have heated during reentry and ignited intermittently. (Note to NUFORC personnel: I&apos;ve submitted a number of reports over the past few years and mentioned this to the NUFORC hotline, which I called just before entering this report.  I realize one can go for years or never at all without seeing a ufo, and receiving yet another report from me might create suspicion, but for the record I maintain that all I do is look up, and that these are all legitimate reports that describe events that are just not conventional enough for me to dismiss as such.)", "orange globe dims and out runs F 4I was driving home with my son who was 16 around 10 at night.

I pulled over and backed up to where we were directly facing it and turned off my engine.  The object remain inplace about 150 feet infront and about 30 feet off the ground.  It  glowed but didnt illuminate the area around it.We sat their looking at it and I flashed my headed lights at it a few times untill my son ask me to stop.  Where we lived was around 25 miles from bergstrom AFB and i heard a jet coming real fast towards us.  I looked to see if I could spot it but couldnt.  When i looked back the globe was not visible.  I thought it was gone when I noticed their was three faint red lights in the shape of a triangle Two on the bottom and one on top.  The jet was really moving on us when the lights just took off at a unbelievable rate of speed.  Like nothing I have seen before.

My husband is a general contractor/mostly new homes. I currently work at home doing his bookkeeping etc. We are both 40 years old. I went out to my deck shortly afer midnight to watch a meteor-shower which had been predicted by our local news weather man. I was interested because he said as many 60 per hr. could be viewed. As I watched I would also see an occasional plane go by, at usual speed,with flashing lights, etc. But then,around 1:00 a white light came flying by which I noticed was going much faster than a plane.  I thought it must be a faster military craft or something that I&apos;m not familiar with.  It continued to fly up into the sky and I noticed it seemed to slow down,and hover, but I thought, &quot;No, that would be weired&quot;.  It then stopped and looked like it blended into the sky as one of the stars.  I continued to watch it since I had just seen it fly by, I knew it wasn&apos;t a star. For the next 3 hours I watched it as the bright,white, light would move in random directions.  It was similar to a search light, but it would move suddently to the left, or right, or up or down, diagnal, and even zig-zag at times. It also seemed to bounce around. I was very intrigued at first but became frightened. My husband was asleep on the couch and I was reluctant to tell him, thinking he would not believe me if he did not see it move,(since it looked like a star). I woke him after watching it about an hour and being certain that this was nothing I could identify.  He came to the window and watched it until he too saw it moving in random directions. We agreed that we didn&apos;t know what it was, &amp; that I would look into it in the morning to see if there was some explanation. I continued to watch it through my window until a little after 4:00 a.m. I was afraid to go back outside.  It continued to do the same things but it came in closer at one point, as I focused on the movement of the light I could then see that it was not just &quot;a light&quot;, it was attached to something much larger. It was shaped like a tubular light bulb and the light was on the end of it. There was a dim light on the other end. What was happening, was that the bright light part would scope out from the larger part and sort of look around in all directions as though it was searching or surveying. Then it would scope back in. (coming out to the left and back in, to the right).  The light would become brighter as it moved around then dimmer when it was stationary. I could clearly see that the &quot;bouncing&quot; would happen when it moved a certains ways, then stopped. It reminded me of the way a turtle&apos;s head moves around. I don&apos;t know what it was, or what it was doing, but I&apos;ll never forget it, and would love to know.

Satellites in low earth orbit are visible from the surface on clear nights with the right lighting conditions. I pointed the object out to my wife fully under the assumption that the object was a satellite, and moments later it made a 90 degree turn heading almost due west.  The turn was not a sharp right angle turn, but a tight arc with a radius of approximately 8 - 10 inches, at arms length. I have a degree in electronics, have worked for defense contractors and have studied air craft and space craft extensively, and to my knowledge, this type of a maneuver in orbit is currently beyond our capability. The craft did not slow down while making the turn, and the amount of rocket fuel required to make such a turn at 17,500 mph and maintain a stable orbit, would be beyond the ammount carried by current satellites. Currently, we move satellites over the course of several orbits. The space shuttle is not even capable of such a maneuver.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

There was a light haze around the craft probably caused by the lights refracting in the air around the craft. At times the circular motion changed to an elliptical one as though the craft had changed its angle of attack but it was definitely moving at a unifrom crusing speed with no erratic motion and a continous heading.Skeptical as I am, after it passed over my buliding and out of view I looked down and a second later saw the second one following just like a replay.

There are usually planes flying in and out of my area going to Dulles, BWI, etc., so seeing air traffic is usual.  However, I saw a bright light illuminate as high as the planes were.  First suspicion was that it was a satellite, or a helicopter.  It was neither unfortunately.  The starshaped light (had vertexes like a star) starting moving to the left very slowly, and then blue and red lights started blinking that were much smaller than the yellowish light, not in unison.  Then the light moved up, and fast to the left and stopped, then went up a little, and then the light transformed into a small ball of light that was not as bright, the blue and red lights stopped, and then it disapeared.  Immediatly following this another starshaped light moved into the scene, and did almost the same movements, but then we saw two objects that looked like planes (because of the lights planes give off) move EXTREMELY fast parallel under the starshaped light and keep on flying past. Possibly fighter jets sent out to investigate or scare off the crafts?  As this was happening we saw no commercial planes, just the lights, and the fighter jets which only went by the scene once.  Then, the startshaped light number 2 disapeared, and for another minute nothing was going on;  then to the far right of the sky another light started, moved to the left, and then went into a ball of light, but not as small as the previous two, and emited a blue misty/cloudy/lightning type string in the sky. The final light went left like the others, stopped, and then vanished but without turning into a ball of light.

But it didn&apos;t conform to anything I could recognize. It had no windows, stripes or any features on the body except for the shadow shape. I realized it didn&apos;t taper at the tail as jetliners do. The long shape was perfectly even, and it seemed to be stationary in the sky. A few buildings blocked my view for a moment, and when I looked for it again it was gone. I looked very carefully but it just wasn&apos;t there. It was too high to have gone behind anything on the horizon. A mile or two later, still traveling east I saw it again, at the same altitude but a half mile or so south. It appeared to be stationary , as before. I see blimps flying around here and this was definitely not a blimp. Again my view was blocked by some trees and buildings, and a moment later when I got a clear view of the sky it was gone.

(Iacutally telpahically twenty minutes prior to the sitings called them to me that I wanted to have an encounter that night) I did not feel compelled to stop and continue to watch what this craft continue to do, which is very unusal for me as I have been waiting a long time for this.

She yelled for me to come quick.  As I got there, I saw her looking out of the window and she said that there was a ufo in the sky.  I thought she was mistaken, that perhaps it was a kite or she was kidding around until I reached the window which is on the 6th story bldg and saw a brass colored V shaped object floating in the southeastern sky.  The thing was slowing rotating around w/o a sound.  I was shocked, not scared but intrigued.  I ran to get a small telescope to see it closer.  The object had a circle-like large porthole in the end part of the V.  It did not look like a window and it was the same color as the brass metal.  The UFO turned and rotated over and over.  As it did, the V would become an L and then cigar and back again to an L and a V over and over.  It was a clear sky with a few clouds and the object was just around cloud level or roughly 2,000 ft.My mum said that they were communicating to her, saying that they were friendly.  I just looked at her and disbelieved her.  She said that she asked when are they coming and that they replied soon, very soon.  She also said that it had a haze around it which I didnt see.  My mum actually liked the episode, I felt a little creepy but not frightened.  My dad arrived and we told him to go look.  He did and was fascinated also, almost amused.  He kind of looked happy and he was not the type of person to smile easily.  This UFO was affecting my parents moods into being jovial I thought.  We all looked silently until the craft flew out of our line of sight towards the Northeast which I didnt want it leave.  I told my parents that I was 100% sure they knew we spotted them and they may have trained their visual aids on us, maybe even photographed us.

Around 11:00 pm (23:00 hours) we noticed lights over the lake. At first we though it was barge traffic. We noted that the lights were moving towards the near shore and not up lake as barges usually do. We knew that something was very different when the lights came ashore. The craft was approxamately 600 yards from our position and slightly below us, we were atop a ridge looking down. The object was triangular in shape, black with lights on each corner that changed through the entire spectuum every 3 to 5 seconds. The top of the object was very slighthly pyramidal in shape. The object was roughly 200 feet on a side, with the top raising about 10 feet in the center. There were several &quot;ports&quot; on the top of the craft through which we could see movement backlit by blue lights. Occasionaly a beam of light would be emitted from under the craft and illuminate the ground under the ship. The object hovered in palce over the clearing for almost 40 minutes. It was almost in a &quot;station keeping&quot; mode and drifted no more than 20 feet from it&apos;s original position. It was silent for the most part, we occasionally heard a low humming sound. After about 45 minutes we noted it rising vertically. It rose very slowly at first, at an altitude of roughhly 500 feet it began to accelerate, still verticaly. Over the next minute it shot straight skyward, dissaperaing from sight directly overhead. It never made a sound. We observed the craft with naked eyes, binoculars, and attempted photography with a 400 mm lens. We could observe the craft with through the camera, but all photos were badly &quot;overexposed&quot;, the entire roll of film was a loss.

They would wink on like someone powering up a 12 volt bulb with a 6 volt battery (kind of slow to intensity).  At first we thought we were seeing the blinking of a tower through the trees so we didn&apos;t pay them too much attention.  But then we saw them again, after our line of sight cleared the trees, we realized the lights were not from a tower. Our next thought was landing lights from several planes because we noticed there was an abnormal amount of planes flying in the area. That struck us as odd if it were true because why would aircraft fly so close to one another and why would they flash the landing lights (not the green and red clearance lights on the wings).  Plus, they would have to all be facing us pretty much exactly the same direction for them to all be the same intensity, there were about 7- or 8 of them in a somewhat straight line four or so on top and perhaps three or four below spaced perhaps a finger width apart from one another (it was hard to tell if there was a pattern because we were in the car going 65- 70 mph).  As we drove on for about 6 to 8 miles we saw them again in approximately the same position as before which told us one of two things, either the lights were moving our same direction, or they were much higher up then they appeared. We saw them several times again sometimes by themselves sometimes in a group, so we thought we could possibly photograph them with our digital camera (they were occurring very often).  We pulled off the Hwy in a rest stop and got out of the car and counted about 5 airplanes circling in the area.  We then realized the planes were not civilian, they were way too fast and flying very tight maneuvers, plus they would all come very close to one another at all different directions and when they converged that&apos;s when we would see the lights flash, we then realized the lights were not the planes, but the planes (we now could hear them) were converging on whatever was making the lights. We tried to get a picture of the lights but with the almost full moon and the streetlights in the wayside we couldn&apos;t.

My friend and I pulled up into her driveway and the rest of our friends parked on the street.  As we were walking up to enter her house, our one friends who had parked on the street called for us to come over by him.  The rest of our friends were looking up to the sky and when we finally made it over by them, we saw what they saw.  3 pulsing red lights that were in a triangular shape in the western sky.  They were not moving fast and almost seemed to be hovering, while staying in that exact formation.  It was something you would see out of a movie.  At first I thought they were lights on towers or something, but they obviously were not.  My friend instantly called our one friend who had gone home instead and he went out into his yard and saw the same thing as we did.  He also called his brother who went out right away and saw the triangular formation of red lights as well.  I watched them for a little bit and ran inside with my friend.  We looked out her back bedroom window and we could still see them in the sky.  I went to the bathroom and then called my parents while I was still inside the house.  I described to them what I saw and I told them to go outside.  They were looking in the west, but said that they found them to be in the east sky.  And that there were only two pulsing red lights now.  I thought that was odd, because I saw three, so I went outside and looked to the western sky where I originally had seen the triangular formation.  They were not there.  I looked over at my friends and they were all looking straight above into the sky.  In the time that I was in the house they had moved to directly above where we were standing.  I asked my friends what happened to the third light and they said that it had gone out!!  About this time one of our friends called the Midlothian Police non-emergency number.  He said he had to report something he saw, and before finishing the statement, the dispatcher asked if it was the three red lights in the sky.  They said that it has been reported already and that they were looking into it.  We also contacted the Posen Police non-emergency number who only offered to send out an officer.  So I stayed on the phone with my parents while we were watching the red lights.  They moved further east and the second light flickered slowly and then burnt out.  A little further east and the first light did the same, so there were no more lights in the sky.  It was like we knew when the lights were going to go out.  They went out in order from the far left light, then the far right light, and then finally the point on the triangle went out.  When they were directly above us the two lights seemed to have moved closer together, with the tip of the triangle only a little bit ahead of the other light. Another odd (maybe) thing was that there were many shooting stars in the sky (according to my friends who saw them when I was inside for the short time).   These pulsing red lights did not seem to be attached to any sort of aircraft that we could see.  They were extremely high in the sky compared to the plane that had passed below them when we first sighted it.  My father also looked at them with binoculars and said that it looked the same as with the naked eye, and he could not see an aircraft either.  The next day my brother&apos;s friend at work told him that he saw two red pulsing lights in the sky while he was at the K-Mart in Tinley Park, IL around 1 am.  Three member&apos;s of our friend&apos;s family also saw the three red lights.  Also, our neighbors in Midlothian, IL told us that they saw white lights flashing across the eastern sky around 10:45 pm of Sept. 30th, only hours before we saw the red lights.

North Carolina. I was a military policeman and was working the graveyard shift with my partner. As we turned down this certain street I noticed a silvery light about 100 yards away on the left side of the road.I told my partner to check it out and to keep his eyes on it since I was driving.  As we got within 50 yards or so I could not figured out what the light was. I thought that maybe, since the light was near a trash dumpster, that an scavanging animal had maybe pulled out a plastic bag and it was reflecting back our headlight beams. This part of the base is near a wooded area right next to a large inlet of water, so I thought that my animal theory was probably correct. When we got to about 25 yards away from the light to my surprise it was not an animal with plastic trash bag but a silvery color sphere about approximately 48 to 60 inches wide.  It hovered off the ground approximately 2 ft.  It made no noise and just kinda floated just a bit to and fro.By this time I had slowed my patrol vehicle to less than 5 miles per hour and was slowly inching our way towards the sphere.  At about 10 yards away from the object, I got a good look at it.  It didnot have a smooth surface but rather a surfaced made of crumpled tin foil and every time it shifted positions it would reflect our headlight beams.By this time my partner was mesmerized he seem to be in a trance and would not answer my questions.  At this time I grabbed hold of my spotlight control and aimed at the object. The object began to move to the edge of the road. I then shot it with the spotlight beam and the object stopped and rotated on its axis several times and than shot across the road at a tremendous rate of speed.It was so fast that one second it was right in front of us then it was gone leaving like a trail of light behind it. &apos;&apos;It dissappeared into a patch of trees. I had been in radio communications with my Desk Sargeant who had dispatched some backup patrols to my location but they got there to late.After searching the area for more than an hour we finally call it quits and I went back to the station to submit my report.  All this time my partner never spoke a word he was in some kind of shock.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The light which had a strobe or red light on it quickly disappeared to the south.  The cloud grew into a perfect sphere like the blisters around the crafts in WAR OF THE WORLDS. Then the cloud disipated. We immediately called 911 and within minutes they reported that the FAA said it was a missile fired from Vandenberg.However, I have seen missiles launched and this did not fit the pattern.  We could see the object and the cloud, no contrail, just this wierd cloud that looked nuclear.I was afraid that it might have been just that. But it wasn&apos;t.

We lived west of Odessa, TX at the time.  My husband&apos;s grandmother (now deceased) called and asked to speak to Stanley. She said she wanted him to go outside and look at the UFO she had been watching that looked like it was close to our area. After talking to her we went outside and looked to our west. There was a huge, building size, silver, saucer shaped object with what looked like an upside down cereal bowl on top of it hovering in the sky about a mile from our house.  We had been outside just a few minutes when my brother-in-law, Jim (now deceased)and my sister-in-law, Georgia, screeched their car into our driveway to ask us if we had seen &quot;it&quot;.  We all looked at it for a few minutes and then Stanley and Jim decided to ride down the road and see if they could get close enough to tell anything about it. Georgia and I just sat there and watched it. It didn&apos;t move at all. it just appeared to be sitting over a radio tower. When Stanley and Jim came back to the house about 30 minutes later they told us that they stopped at the entrance to the dirt road leading to the radio tower because they were afraid if they went closer they might get picked up and taken on a ride they didn&apos;t want to take. We got the radio and tried to listen to the news and see if anyone else was reporting this or watching it. We finally found an announcer on KBZB radio station that was talking about all the static they were having on their radio transmission and how they were sending a trechnician out to the tower that was having trouble to see what as wrong. Stanley called the station and was asking where their tower was. The disc jockey was talking to him on the air and we could hear the whole conversation on the air while we were outside still watching the saucer. The disc jockey confirmed it was their tower where the saucer was. Stanley hung up and came back outside to watch. Almost an hour after we started watching it the saucer began to move toward the North. It made a turn that was a 90 degree angle and slowly moved off until it was gone. No flashing speed, just slowly drifting away.  The radio station had stopped broadcasting anything about it so Stanley called the disc jockey back and asked him why did they stop telling about it, what happened? The disc jockey told him that their  technician got to the tower and when he saw the size of the saucer over the tower he went into shock and left. He said they had to take him to the emergency room and get him medicated to calm him down. The disc jockey also told Stanley that he had been contacted by someone claiming to be with the federal government who told him if he didn&apos;t want the radio station to lose it&apos;s license and be shut down he better quit talking about what happened. He said he was told &quot;Just be Quiet about it&quot;.  But we were all there, and saw it happen before sundown on a bright, summer night. I had never seen anything like it, and don&apos;t know what it was for sure, but I know it was really there.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting event is approximate.

I was stoking a small fire when I heard a sound like air rushing.  I did&apos;t think much of this initially because I was about a mile and a-half from the power plant and they release steam from time to time and it sounded like that.But, unusually, this time it was getting louder then louder until I realized something was very wrong, it seemed to be coming from all around me out of the darkness.I looked all around me but could only see a few trees dimly lit by the small fire, then I looked up.All the leaves were off of the trees and I could clearly see a circular craft drifting right above me over the tree tops in a Northerly direction.It appeared to be about a hundred feet above the tree tops.It had a dome structure on the bottom with a  cross structure as if for support with four green lights around the dome&apos;s edge.  There were alternating white and red lights around the outer edge of the craft.It may have had a slight glow to it. The tree tops did&apos;nt move and it glided along then started to curve around to the West and went over a nearby gravel pit.I ran through the woods trying not to run into trees or trip in the dark.  I crossed a couple fields and fence lines until I came to the edge of the gravel pit where I could look down over it.I did&apos;nt see the craft and don&apos;t know where it went.I have read that UFO activity increases during years of close passes of Earth and Mars and this was one of those years.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I thought it was an advertising gimmick of some sort.  I wanted to drive over to where the light was comming from to see what was causing it.  The others who saw it, (my wife &amp; 2 kids, and 2 of their cousins, decided to go inside instead.  I stood outside watching it and the lights were red and they slowly faded away twards the objects center.  Then the object slowly flew off to the South.  It blinked red and green as it flew.   At that time I noticed another object further East and North that seemed to be the same kind of craft.  It was blinking red and green also, but did not shoot lights out from it&apos;s  center. I got my wife to come out and see the 2nd similar object.  I wouldn&apos;t have thought anything of them had the first one not shot out those lights.   Here&apos;s the strange part.  We were having a weenie roast outside, and to impress the kids I shot off 4 fireworks. We were heading inside right after the last firework when we first noticed the first object.  I called the Washington County Sheriffs office an hour later to see if anyone else had reprted seeing these objects and was told no.  When I described the shooting lights The lady on the phone asked me if I was sure they were not fireworks.

I see lots of planes and shooting starz. but on three seperate occasions over a one month period. I saw somthing I cannot explain. The first one was like a flash of light out of the corner of my eye to the south west muontains like someone took a picture in the sky. like a bright strobe light flash. I looked in the direction of the flash and did not see any thing again so I did not think too much about it. The following week in the same general area I saw a bright flash again. This time I staired in the loction for about 45sec and it flashed agian. I watched this for about 15min. about every 45sec to aminute or more it would flash this vary bright strobe. it was in the same location each time I lined up the flash area with the corner roof of my house and this object was in the same spot each time. The flashes were inconsistant and vary far apart not like an airplain flashes its light when flying over. I went in and told my wife to come and take a look at this. when she came out I told her to look in the area I was seeing this light at and about 1min later it flashed again. THEN IT GOT BETTER! The next time it flashed it was like the light stretched like someone took a rubber band and stretched it and then let go of one end. It was like it move so fast then stoped and the tail of the light cought up to it. This happened in in the blink of an eye. It did this one more time a few seconds later  leaving a green, blue and yellowish haze in the sky. after that i never saw anything agian. afew days later I saw and wathed the same flash in the sky a little more to the south the the fist two lights. Agian it would flash in an incosistant time interval. This time the last flash was very bright had the shape of a cresant moon. Then nothing. Has anyone els in the SF Bay area seen anything like this?", "Light in the sky, followed by three, different crafts.My friend and I were sitting around a campfire in his backyard. This is a rural, wooded area. It ws nearly 3am when off in the woods beyond the yard, I noticed the sky was starting to brighten. I thought this odd, and questioned my friend that it seemed awfully early to be getting light. It started off dimly, but slowly began to brighten, only in this one area. The sky was clear, with many stars visible. After 20 min- 1/2 hour, my friend and I noticed that apparent beams of light were now pointing skyward from this one location. (Think, Hollywood, movie/searching lights, the kind that point straight up). I questioned him again, to be sure that he was seeing the same thing I was. After a few minutes these beams started to fade, and for the remainder of an hour the lights slowly faded altogether, the sky then becoming dark like the rest of the night sky. We thought this odd, but didn&apos;t know what to make of it, and went back to our campfire. A few minutes later, we noticed an object in the sky, I made a point of saying, that it seemed to be moving awfully quickly. As it approached it became apparent it was diamond shaped, made up of four, large, bright, unblinking beams. As it sped across the sky over our heads, my friend mentioned how an object moving as fast as this should break the sound barrier making a sonic boom, or some sort of noise, yet none could be heard. Right behind this object was another, following on the exact same course, moving just as quickly. Only, this craft had two large red lights, and two large green lights. While they were travelling above us, other regular aircraft were visible, and there was no comparison between the size, speed, etc. These were no regular crafts. They were big, silent, low flying and extremely fast. As we watched, I held my friend&apos;s arm awestruck, not able to say anything. After they disappeared we sat questioning, trying to rationalize what we had seen. We were nearly ready to go to bed, when 15 minutes later a third object, flying so quickly, that I got out of my chair, and followed it on foot across the lawn, and had a hard time keeping sight of it, flew overhead. This one was the most shocking of all, it had rotating, pulsing, multi-colored lights. The lights followed no pattern, and the craft seemed to rotate. As I said it was overhead and gone so quickly, I had to run across the lawn to keep sight of it. After this third craft, we were quite shaken, and retreated to the house. We have discussed what we saw numerous times since then, and still it is shocking. That night I had made a simple diagram of the first, diamond shaped craft, and had noted the approx. times that we saw them.", "We watched 4 lights expand and contract at astonishing speeds in the night sky, then vanish.It was the 1st really cool evening of the season and my husband and I were admiring how clear and crisp the sky was.  We have always enjoyed star gazing together and the sky always seems to be clearer when it&apos;s cool.  We had been sitting out there for a couple of hours when my husband said, &quot;What is that?!&quot;  He pointed directly overhead.  When I looked up, It was obviously a plane.   At that very second we simultaneously said, &quot;it&apos;s a plane.&quot;  There were 4 lights in a very tight diamond formation traveling north.  Then, almost immediately after we spoke, the lights started to separate from each other at an unbelievable speed.  The top light of the diamond shot straight out while the 2 outter lights expanded outward and forward until they were in line with the 1st.  Now, the 1st light and outter 2 are in a perfect row across the sky with the 4th tailing right behind the 1st.  The distance between the 3 lights in front was enormous.  They traveled at ungodly speed in this manner for about 5 seconds.  After about 5 seconds they shot back together again into the same tight diamond formation.  This also happened in a matter of seconds.  Then, out of no where, it vanished!  It vanished like someone unplugged the lights.  We were stunned.  We lived within 8 miles of Lambert Airport for 9 yrs, including through 9/11, and have, many times, seen aircrafts that we hadn&apos;t seen anything like before.  However, we have never seen anything even remotely close to this.  My husband said that when he 1st looked up, it looked like a misty cloud.  He said there was something very strange about it.  The sky was very clear and there wasn&apos;t another cloud in the sky.  No sooner than he had drawn my attention to the thing it had changed and appeared to be a plane.  He assumed the plane was momentarily hidden behind the &quot;cloud&quot; although the cloud was not there at all once the lights became visible.  We observed that the lights seemed to expand and contract.  When they were together they didn&apos;t seem odd.  When expanding the speed was astounding and they must have separated at least a mile apart in a matter of seconds.", "Oval object with a white and blue florescent glow in Los Angeles, Northridge close to van nays airportIt was a big oval shape object with round lights around, it looked like it doesn&rsquo;t have any weight, moving with little angle maybe 30 degrees to left for 30 second first then immediately to right again to left then to right all of the movement with angel, and with blue fluorescent light the round lights around had a yellow florescent color more like the ones they say it has sun color, for maybe 60 second and it was pretty big like big as the small airlines planes for travel, it was pretty clear not very far.", "Satellite pulsing with color?The object looked an appeared to be at a similar distance as a star.  However, it pulsed with light and color (white, red, and blue).  It looked similar to the running lights of a plane but it was too far away and it was hovering. After hours of observation, we realized it was moving very slowly, as if orbiting the Earth.  When a friend arrived with binoculars, in spite of shakiness, we learned it was geometric in design.  One description was of four triangles pointed outward with different pulses of light.  Another description compared it to a Rubic&apos;s cubic rotating back and forth, the different squares puling with light.((NUFORC Note:  Probably a twinkling star.  PD))", "Symmetric geometric shape, black with blinking long red lights.My childhood friend and I were playing a game of catch with a baseball in our neighborhood.  The ball went over our heads and up the street.  We both ran after it to see who could get it first.  We got to the ball at the same time.  Neither one of us touched the ball, we were both distracted by what we saw ahead of us in the sky.  We were looking south and there was a Catholic church across the road from our neighborhood.  What we saw looked like it was perched on top of the tall pointed steeple.  I quickly realized that what I was seeing was actually miles away from us, and it had to be very large.  It was a very unique geometric shape, unlike anything else I have ever seen.  It was taller than it was wide.  It was very symmetric in shape.  It looked like a tall triangle was sitting on a mirror and the top point had been cut off about 3/4 of the way up, so it had a flat top and bottom.  It also looked like two more shorter stubbed triangles had been placed on either side of the object directly in the middle tapering out.  It appeared that the object was black and it had what looked like red flourescent light bulbs on it that followed the same pattern as the outer edges of the shape.  The lights were blinking on and off in a random but slow pattern.  The sky in the background was pure blue without a cloud in the sky, so the object was very distinct in the sky.  It seemed to hover in place for about thirty seconds and then started to slowly rise and move away.  Then it suddenly bolted faster than my eyes could keep up, I just remember knowing that it had traveled faster than anything on this planet could ever go, except maybe a bullet.My friend and I just stood there with our mouths hanging open in awe at what we had just seen.  We looked at each other for a few seconds without saying anything and then I said &quot;Did you just see that?&quot;.  He said yes.  I told him not to say anything to me about what he saw, just to go home and write it all down and draw the object.  I then told him that we would compare our notes the next morning when we were on the bus for school.  Just for the record, I only new to do all of this because the TV show &apos;Project Blue Book&apos; was a series on TV at the time and I had seen the Air Force investigators on the show tell people to do that, so they could buid a more credible case.  Anyway, we both went home and wrote and drew what we had seen.  I told my parents about it, but of course they were not going to believe a little boy telling such wild tales.  The next day my friend and I compared our notes and drawings and they were identical.  I have never forgotten that event nor have I ever seen any other drawings or pictures that looked like the object we saw.  I have always wondered if anyone else saw that object that night.  I also want it to be known that I am not sure of the exact date that this took place, but I believe that I am fairly close to it.

Recently my brother and his wife visited us and we took them for a day trip to the Great Wall of China. It was a clear sunny day, and we found a great place for a photo opportunity.  We asked a passer by to take a snap shot using my 5.2 Meg Pixel Sony digital camera and my brother also asked the person to take a snap shot with his camera.  Firstly a picture was taken using my camera and approx. 10 seconds later the same snap shot using my brothers camera. It was a lovely day and nothing unusual was seen by any of us during the walk of the wall. When we got home, we were keen to look at all the pictures we had taken. It was then, that I spotted an object over the mountains taken on my camera by the passer by.  The object is clearly visible and in the distance over the mountains. I have showed a number of people, and they are mystified what it could be.  I had no intentions of reporting it, until a work colleague told me their had been a number of witnesses who had spotted an object which was reported in the local press. I have attached the picture for reference. The object is in the far top right hand side of the photo.  You can zoom in, and it is clearly disc shaped (although a little blurred).

The owner of the farm contacted the local police who arrived at about 10h30 on the scene.  The UFO was sighted whilst hovering at tree top level in a dense forest.  According to witnesses the UFO kept on changing colours. The police officers who visited the scene, saw the UFO.  One officer fired several shots at the object. The farm owner also fired shots.  Whilst being shot at the UFO stopped changing colours and remained a darkish gun-metal colour.  It kept on disappearing behind the tree tops and reappeared.  The colour changed to greyish white before it dissappeared.  All together fifteen shots were fired at the object.

My parents had decided on going on a drive as they use to quite regularly. The sun was sinking in the western sky as they drove south from the city of Van Wert,Ohio. They usually had no agenda when they went on one of their drives. As I recall they drove south on Route 127 for a few miles and turned right on a road into  what was left of the sunset. Now they were driving on a gravel road when they came upon a T road that went to the right so they turned on it. They were not driving back towards the city of Van Wert where they lived when they seen a jack-o-lantern type of light in a woods to their left that was probably a couple of hundred feet from where they were. The light was in or or on the side where they could see it OK. It was about six feet above the ground and it raise to the top of the trees and then went back down again. It done this several times as mom and dad sat there and watch it. Suddenly their engine stopped and dad could not restart it. He open the door and got out to raise the hood when, I think, they heard a strange &quot;wrirring&apos; sound over head. Dad looked up and there was a flying saucer flying over them. You could see the &quot;saucer&quot; shape easily in the twilight. Thirty years or so has taken its toll on my memory so I have lost some of the details over the years, also consider that they had seen something back then, at least, you could be considered a crack po. I imagine that countless sighting are lost because of our govenments effort to deny and also ridicule someone for sauing what they seen. They told me that they seen window like lights around the top of the craft. Also I think that they mentioned green and red sparks eminating from the craft. I would estimate that the craft was 50 to 75 feet above them. The UFO stopped for a breif period of time over the woods and then it resumed its course of I would estimate at about 280 to 290 fegrees true that would take it just north of Ohio City and somewhere around Fort Wayne. My family and I had came from South Bend to visit relatives around Van Wert and we were visiting my parents. Dad and I were talking about science and he started to tell me about something and then paused. He said that they had an encounter a few months ago and were afrai to tell anybody.I said, &quot;dad you know me better than that, you apparently had just seen what I have been looking for&quot;. Within a few minutes I had mom and dad in my car as we heard to the site. They told me about the whole incident as we drove to the location. They should me exactly where they stopped, where the craft went over head and the direction in which it continued on. Now dad and mom are both church going Christians and I can vouch for their honesty, dad only &quot;sipped&quot; but he did get high on his home brew sauercraut, Ha! They both are not with us now and I was glad that I was able to learn about their encounter. If all the trousands that had seen UFO before them fully convinced me then I am sure that their encounter did. And the look of fear and concern as they relayed their story left no doubt to me of its autherticity. I have nevere seen a bonafide UFO, I have seen lights that I diid not know what they were but I had enough objectivity to not think that they were extraterrestrial. But my parents did see something that was not of this earth, or at our concept of this earth. I believe that the apparition that they seen was some kind of a remote drone and that the flying saucer retrieved the drone. Perhaps they witnessed a terrestrial biological android or drone after it collected specimen from the woods.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

I don&apos;t always report them to your center but today I will as this one was not a quick 30 second thing - blink of the eye and then it&apos;s gone. I went for a jog in the Point Grey area here in Vancouver, very close the beach, when on my return towards my home, I saw what I thought was a plane, I&apos;m quite observant of the sky.  Then I realized that it wasn&apos;t a plane.  Then I thought it looked like a blimp.  A telephone company here in Canada uses one quite frequently here in the Lower Mainland for advertising purposes, but quickly I realized that it was simply too high up in the air for anyone to see it with the writing and logos on it.  Then I thought, oh no, here we go again.  I watched the object for about 3 minutes maybe a bit longer.  It was located in the south sky and the visibility is excellent.  Object appeared to be heading towards to USA and climbing higher upwards.  Colour white.  Solid Object.  Moved slowly.  Not planes in the sky from where I&apos;m stood. I obviously stopped jogging to gain a beter look at this object and I was simply courious if this passing stranger could see this object as well.  I asked a stranger &quot;Do you have good eye sight&quot;? and asked her if she could see &quot;that object in the sky&quot;.  She said yes. PS.  Last night Sept. 6th 2005, as I was walking home from a video store with my boyfriend, we happened to see a bright light in the north sky get bright and then retract very quickly. We couldn&apos;t see any traces or trail of anything like a plane in the general vicinity in the sky such as when a plane may be glarring it&apos;s front headlights and then turn, this wasn&apos;t quite the same. He was about as puzzled as I was.  Just thought I&apos;d mention last nights oddity in case anyone else in Vancouver, B.C, or North Vancouver saw this bright light.

Now I know I have never before seen something like this.While driving, I looked up and a bright light was in the sky. The sky was perfectly clear. The light was very bright and appeared to be stationary. It was about the apparent size of Venus, which I thought odd since it was 8:30 in the morning and definitely not a star or planet.  When the light faded I observed a shape that looked like a pill capsule and silver-grey in color with no lights that I could detect on the object. It started moving to the South East. It moved in &quot;spurts&quot; moving a bit and then not moving, and then moving and then not moving, etc. in a straight line. There seemed to be a very light trail, like an exhaust, left behind it when it moved, but this did not linger.

I thought it was a shooting star but then as I focused my sight I seen 5 huge spheres which were not lite up, but they were reflecting light from the ground, As I kept looking at the spheres I ruled out birds as the source. I then began to scan for structure as the craf went directly over my head. I seen a brown hull with beams to which the spheres were attached. As it went over head I grabbed my brothers arm and told him to look, he also seen it and ruled out birds or plane. I got a intense feeling that we were not supposed to witness what we saw. As the craft traveled approx 100 yards past my house it just vanished? The whole time this craft was observed it was not lite up with any lights, It may have been a government project but it is hard to say how large it was and how high? It also had a large non lite sphere trailing it. The craft was moving to fast to be birds in formation, and there was no sound. At first I thought it could have been a b2 bomber? But it was way to big and the attached spheres and trailing sphere didn&apos;t make sense. My brother said he thought it was about 3 football fields long.

We had an outside cabin and were on the XXth deck of the ship room # xxx to be exact.  My sister had gotten up to use the restroom and then went to the window to look out.  She immediately woke me up and told me to hurry and come to the window to see what she was seeing.  There were 5 to 6 balls of light maybe 10 to 15 feet from our window that were just hovering and following the ship.  It was very dark out that night and these balls of light were very brigt, gold in color, and had a haze or aura around them.  We stood there for 15 minutes or so just mesmerized by what we were seeing.  They were in groups of 5 or 6 and we saw one shoot straight up and over the ship, it was faster than anything I had ever seen.  They just seemed to hover and then would disperse rapidly, then would reappear again.  We could see smaller ones further out just above the water.  On one of the balls of light we saw a triangular tail appear, it looked transparent, but you could see the outline of it, and then it just shot off and left a vapor like trail.  We called the front desk after that and reported what we had seen, but they had no answer of what it might have been.  The next day the Naturalist on the ship called us and we explained to him what we had seen, but he had no explanation.  I was looking at the other reports, and low and behold there was another reporting from someone in Aug. 2004 that was on the Regal Princess cruise ship that had reported seeing glowing objects from there balcony.  They were lucky enought to be able to take a couple of pictures of the objects because they were outside, unfortunately we were not lucky enough to get any pictures of what we saw.  But because these were sighted by another person in 2004 aboard the same cruise ship and in the same area as where we were at, I am convinced that what we saw was not from this earth.  We looked out on 2 other nights at around the same time and we never saw them again.  So maybe these are seen out at sea between the route from Juneau to Tracy Arm Alaska.

All of the sudden, I&apos;m laying down looking at the sky and I see what I originally thought was a shooting star.  So, getting my attention, I followed it with my eyes.  I noticed that it was not illuminated and not traveling as fast as I have seen shooting stars travel in the past.  What REALLY shocked me was when it seemed to slow down at about 120 degrees from my point of view (I was laying down flat and it came from the North West, moving in a south eastern).  It was low enough that I could see features and at this point knew it was not a shooting a star.  It was brown in shape, ovular/circular, seemed to have a &quot;flower-petal&quot; equal outer indentation taking up it&apos;s entire base.  It seemed like it was spinning but I&rsquo;m not positive it was.  But at one point it seemed to come to a stop then all of the sudden it shot out in a more prominent south eastern direction.  So, I hang up the phone with my friend and call my mom and grandma to see what I should do.  Ok, so I&apos;m on the phone with my mom and grandma absolutely panicked and all of the suddenly, at a much lower altitude, what seemed to be the EXACT same object jet from the East back to a little North of where it came from before (directly above me at approx. 90 degrees) and almost came to a stop AGAIN.  Then it jetted directly West after about 30 seconds of slow movement.  The thing that freaked me out the most was about a minute or two after that, I got a bloody nose.  I don&apos;t know if there has ever been any connection between nosebleeds and confirmed sightings, but it freaked me out.  I called the Searcy Police Department to report it and I never heard anything back from them.  That&apos;s pretty much the story.  I know it sounds crazy, but I&apos;m not a loon.

When forst observed, they were approximately 175-180&apos; away and approximately 75-100&apos; in the air and descending rapidly in what appeared to be an undulating movement.  While most of them appeared to be about 9-12&quot; wide and maybe 14-18&quot; long, there were 3-4 which were larger; possibly 14-18&quot; wide and maybe 24-36&quot; in length. After descending, they appeared to go into/behind a large pine tree.  At that point, we were only able to observe a greenish glow which lasted for approximately 60-70 seconds.  All of a sudden, they began ascending at a high rate of speed (faster than they had descended) and when they reached a height of approximately 200&apos; above the tree (which is about 60-65&apos; high), they suddenly disappeared from view.  While my wife thought she heard a faint &quot;whooshing&quot; sound, I didn&apos;t.   It is also interesting to note that there&apos;s a large Doberman who resides at the residence next door to where the pine tree is.  Although we have both heard this animal barking numerous times, on this night, the barking was totally different in its tonal quality.  Rather than the usual barks of a large animal, at the time this was happening, it issued only 3-4 barks and they sounded fearful...almost as if the animal was shocked. Although we usually go out for air several times/week at around the same time and have done so for almost 10 months, this was the first time we&apos;ve ever seen anything. The following evening, we looked all around the neighborhood for anyone who might be displaying green garden lights; however, there were none observed.  We were unable to locate anyone else who may have witnessed this event.

The phone rang-- it was my wife, calling from work. As I often do while on the phone, I stepped outside as we talked. There was still a good amount of light from the sun, which had set behind Glassford Hill (my back yard faces west, directly toward the hill). I immediately saw the orange ball and knew what it was. I have seen perhaps 10 of these in the 3.5 years I&rsquo;ve lived at this house. With most of my sightings, the objects have been moving in a roughly south to north path, but a few &ndash;including one dramatic sighting- have moved in a north-south direction. This time it was moving south to north. This time the object was quite close, and very distinct, directly in front of me and clear. It was, again, a very bright orange glowing ball. There appeared to be something above it that the glow was reflecting on. As with another close sighting, when my wife and I both had a good amount of time to view one of these objects, I had the impression that the glow was on the underside of a larger object. This time, perhaps because there was more ambient light in the sky, this thing above the glow was more apparent. I almost got the impression that it might be a balloon with some sort of flare burning under it. (Is there any known weather balloon or anything that fits that description?) It appeared to be quite close (although it is admittedly difficult to judge distances on lights in the dark sky) it was completely silent. I was quite excited and told my wife what was happening. When she put me on hold (oddly, to tell a customer at her work that I was watching a UFO), I started yelling out loudly that there was a UFO in the sky, hoping that one of the neighbors would look up. I&rsquo;m sure I sounded like a nut, but I was hoping that some other people would see what I was seeing (I don&rsquo;t know if anyone heard or looked up and saw it). It was moving fairly quickly, and since the air was very still, it seems unlikely that this was a balloon or anything else floating in the wind. I ran inside and grabbed my camera. The object was still quite close but I was having a hard time getting the camera to focus on it in the dim light. I watched it for a little while longer and decided to try to take a picture again. This time it focused and I got the attached snapshot (see email). It was quite far away by now and appeared as just a small dot in the sky. In the picture the object looks blurred because, presumably, the shudder speed was long. The combination of the movement of the object and my hand shaking is what caused the object the be shaped that way (I am assuming this because it was round to my eye). Also attached to the email is a PhotoShop sketch of what I saw, as the photo is so poor and doesn&rsquo;t really illustrate my sighting. I have another report from 12-28-2004 that I can send you, along with a similar photo, if you would like. Let me know. I hope you can look into this sighting tonight and let me know if there is any explanation for what I saw (and have seen many times here in Prescott Valley).((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

As soon as we met at the airport at 2pm, she excitedly told me, she saw something very dodgy from the plane as her flight was coming into the north eastern coastline of the UK at approx 1pm (she landed at the airport at 13:41). Just out at sea she spotted between 5 to 7 orange round objects...I have below the story in her own words... When she told me, I checked on the Net to see if there were any other similar reports in the same region and around the same time...Needless to say, I was excited to read of the reports also coming from the east of England of multiple orange discs on the 17th, the previous day to my girlfriend&apos;s sighting. Do you know if anyone else also witnessed her sighting on the 18th September?  My Girlfriend&apos;s report......&quot;On 18th September I was flying from Prague to Edinburgh. The sky got cloudy somewhere over the Netherlands. Over the Channel the clouds were a bit torn. I felt sleepy as I had to get up at 4am that morning and didn&apos;t get to sleep too well at night. And seeing just clouds became a bit boring after a while. Also my seat was at the window but near the wing, so the wing and the engine took a lot of my view. If I wanted to see something, I had to lean forward and look out of the farther window. So only occasionaly I looked out to see if we are still over the continent or over the sea or approaching Britain. Then around 1pm (GST) I looked out again and saw we were still over the sea. There was a gap between clouds so I could see the sea. Down, deep under me I could see some round orange things. They looked like round rubber life boats on the sea. There were 7 of them. They seemed to be floating on the sea surface. They were moving slowly and then when the left most circle got into its position, I noticed that they created a perfect boomerang shaped formation. That attracted my attention. Creating the formation, they were moving quite fast for something that big on the sea. I could swear that at the beginning they were a bit scattered but now they were very much giving an impression of a single body. That perfect the formation was. I started thinking of an invisible delta aircraft and really, apart from the orange spots I couldn&apos;t see anything between them. Was it a military training? I tried to have a better look to identify what it was but suddenly there were two white clouds bursting out of two of the circles like an explosion and all the formation, like one body, moved forward with great acceleration leaving just two short white double lines behind. The lines were short, just about double the height of the triangle. As a space craft getting enough speed just from a short fire. At high speed all the formation disappeared under the cloud and I had the feeling that it wanted to hide, not to be seen. I hoped that it would come out on the other side of the large cloud before the engine and the wing cover my view, but it didn&apos;t. After the cloud I saw a ship, looked big, at least like a ferry, maybe bigger. And still the length of the ship would make only about two thirds of the side of the boomerang. And the circles were slightly bigger in diameter than the width of the ship. So the object must have been huge.

The home was located in a large clearing on top of a countryside hill &amp; we were enjoying the stars and trying to see our Milky-way in space. While viewing the night time sky &amp; spotting the Big &amp; Little Dippers, Orion and other mythical shapes, I noticed a few satellites crossing below the stars which is not unusual in the summer months on a clear night. But while one satellite slowly passed overhead, something unfamiliar was occuring even higher in the stary heavens. As I focused toward space to what &quot;I THOUGHT&quot; was another glistening man made space craft certainly was not! Maybe it was a falling star or a blinking light of an aircraft, but the spot of light (the size of a star) began to move faster than the satellite in the foreground. The semi-circular shape was traveling in a South bound direction &amp; it then slowed down and instantly changed directions &amp; was now traveling North bound without a single stop in action. No human device, rocket, plane or Stealth bomber can do that manuvuer in a split second, I exclaimed!! I asked my friend to watch the dancing light in the sky and she witnessed the same occurance as I. I believe this was a massive object because of its particular size to the stars up in the darkness of space. The distance was far more farther away than the satellites that traveled across the sky. This was not a shooting star with a tail for there was no tail or icy trail behind the object. As we watched the sparkling object continue its dance, yet ANOTHER orb exactly like this one joined with the first to play a game of tag. As the first orb continued to move North to South and then East to West in a triangular pathway, the second circular object followed the same direct path as the first orb. It was a game of chase for the two objects and they were not harming each other but only staying as close as they could travel behind one another without hitting themselves. The two orbs traveled with no sound and reacted as a rubber ball would bounce off of the surfaces that it touched. But in space, as we know it, does not have &quot;A surface&quot; to bounce off of. Which made me more curious about this event. I blinked my eyes to be sure I was truly seeing this event unfold probably a 1000 miles away, or so it seemed, in the night sky. I asked my friend if she was the second orb in the same pathway as the first and she agreed that there was now two bright objects in the sky that were playing a game of tag. Then as fast as the objects came into sight, they swirled away together as though they were sucked into a vortex and diminished into space &amp; gone from our sight.

I followed it for about 49 sec.s, then lost sight of it. Kept videoing out that way when i saw with my eyes a spiraling object. It was white and looked like a sparkerler on a wheel. Focused in on that sighting and followed it for about 50 sec.

We wern&apos;t looking up but we noticed something.  We got really quiet.  There was literally no sound what-so-ever.  The dogs, horses, and  all other stuff was utterly quiet.  What we saw were three lights.  (JUST LIKE THE ONE ON THE IMAGE YOU HAVE FLYING OVER THE OUTLINE OF MISSOURI) It came in from the north and made no sound at all.  it flew directly south... STRAIGHT SOUTH!!!  It moved extremely slow.  It made a hard right turn and it was at this time that it broke the speed it had moved at the whole time. It moved faster, but not real fast.  We watched it go toward the horzion  until we couln&apos;t tell the difference between it and the stars.  When it passed overhead, it was low enough that the lights from the garage seemed to reflect off of it.  Literally, it seemed to be only a few hundred feet off the ground.  I have to say, it made NO SOUND AT ALL.  Until it turned, it never broke speed.  In turning,  it didn&apos;t actually turn.  but just changed directions.  It was unmistakably a triangle.  CLEARLY TRIANGULAR.  See, in wichita there is an Air Force Base (McConnell AFB)  Nick and I both talked about it for a while.  We both  thought when it flew overhead that it was a B2 Bomber, but IT MADE NO SOUND and when it turned, we knew it wasn&apos;t a bomber. I figure it was roughly the size of a 747.  It was pretty big.  That was what was so impressive about it. We know what we saw.  I haven&apos;t talked to Nick in a year, but i&apos;m sure i could get a hold of him.

I was pointing it out to a friend I was giving a ride.  He followed the light and pointed at its direction.  While stopped at a traffic light I looked over and a small orb of light raced from about the top of the tree line across the sky parallel to the ground.  Its speed was far greater than a plane or helicopter and it&apos;s size was quite small.  It moved faster than even a firework and left no trail.  The ball of light looked similar to video of ball lightning that I have seen but no clouds were present and it was really right at the top of the tree line.  It&apos;s movement was similar to that of a shooting star but it was so close to the ground and it&apos;s trajectory was completely unlike any of the many meteors i have observed.  The main light I had been watching continued to change colors around a main white but UNUSUALLY bright light.  I have observed in my area and around in other research I have attempted that these unusual lights appear in alignment with existing heveanly bodies, but they look quite different than the bodies they are alligned with.  Meaning that you notice a light that does not look like a star and displays properties that are quite different than a star, Venus or Mars but occur in identical places.  The regular bodies can be seen later in the position of the unusual object, light, or occurance, but appear to have little in common with the occurance.

I went outside to have a cigarette in the wee hours, was listening to flamenco and working on a science project, I sat down and looked to the east at the constellation Orion and I thought, are those three stars the belt or the sword? They were in the configuration of the sword, but much brighter so I thought the belt? Then I realized they were too bright for the belt too. They infact did not blink as stars do, and I thought they looked like planets. They were somewhere between the brighteness of Venus and Jupiter at their brightest. But planets aren&apos;t typically that close together, and are usually more to the south. It was then that they started to move like a swarm of bees that have been aroused, slower than a bee though, faster than an airplane, in crazy paterns like circles, about the apparent circumference of the moon, allot tighter even. I thought nothing man made can move like that, so I thought is what I am seeing here is out of the noramal, could I be seeing a UFO. Before I could decide they stopped moving in circles and ellipses, or something like a path traced out by scribble, moved toward the horizon in a straight line and vanished beneath it. Orion was about a good three or four visual feet above the horizon. I used to work at an observatory, hence the accurate description.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The light was brighter than any other star or planet in the sky.  G. then got my attention and told me to look up.  I looked up to the west and noticed the same bright light without him pointing it out.  It looked like it was far away, but still was enough brighter than the stars/planets to know it was not either of those.  The bright light then dimmed a bit and then proceeded to move.  It made a backwards S curve slowly, yet not as slow as a satellite(which also cannot make S curves).  It then stopped at the bottom of the S curve.

The fireball was moving approximately North to South.  Behind the globe of expanding gasses, there was a contrail? twisting off to the west/north-west.  The westernmost end of the twisty trail was red with the fading sunlight.  The trail became a very bright white as it got more twisty and blended into the expanding pear of gasses. After about two mintes, the point of light disappeared, no new gasses were added to the pear, though it continued to expand in size and fade in intensity.  The twisty trail stayed bright for several more minutes, the colors shifting as the sun set.  After twienty mintes, nothing remain visible of the twisty trail. Attempting to follow the point of light to the south, about three minutes after it disappeared, it appeared again, continueing in a straight line.  The new pear of gasses forming behind it glowed reddish (like the sunset). My guess would be a meteor skipping across the top of the atmosphere.  The initial outgassing causing it to spin, spewing its gasses into the twisty trail.  Finally just melting away on each skip into the atmosphere. On the other hand, it may have been something totally else.  If you know, I&apos;d like to hear back what it really is. It occurs to me that the oldest part of the trail was the red of sunset, suggesting that it may have been low in the atmosphere.  From mid trail on, including hte initial pear of gasses, it was bright white, suggesting it was in full sunlight, not scattered throught he atmosphere.

It was a halogen-white object that seemed to be wobbling and moving around in a circle. At first I thought it was odd but knew that I easily could be looking at a planet, satellite, or star, but after I got my binoculars to observe the object, I realized it absolutely could not be any of those things. There was a chevron-shaped metallic object surrounded by a glow, and I witnessed it dart across the sky at ridiculous speeds several times, always returning to it&apos;s port of origin.  As I further observed the event, I saw what I can only describe as disk-shaped crafts which were considerably smaller entering the chevron-shaped object. It was then when I really knew something strange was going on, so I woke up my friend to have him as another witness and to get his opinion on what was going on.  At first glance, he told me he thought it was a helicopter, but it emitted absolutely no sound.  Almost instantly after he came to look, we both witnessed an orange orb &quot;floating&quot; from the ground north to the object, slowly at first, but then speeding up until it entered the craft.  At that point, my friend decided that it was definitely something that he could not explain. We continued to observe the activity for a total of at least 45 minutes, as it hovered and several other crafts darted and manuevered across the sky.  I also observed a purple colored beam emitting from the craft at random intervals, though it didn&apos;t project far.  It was like a short purple strobe. I wanted to wait to see if the thing would shoot into space, but my friend and I got so tired we just went to bed.  I reported my sighting via telephone but forgot to include the fact that as we were in bed about to fall asleep, we heard several very loud helicopters fly over or at least near the house.  I regret that I am not more knowledgable about the technicalities of the night sky, though I observe it almost nightly and have NEVER seen anything remotely close to that. The only other incident I ever have had regarding UFOs was that a beam once entered my room, but I did NOT witness a craft at that time and have no evidence that it was from any otherworldly craft, although it was a frightening event at the time. This incident however, with the orange orb rising into a &quot;ship&quot;,  I KNOW was something strange, be it government or something else that I can&apos;t explain.

I would be extremely interested to hear if anyone else saw a similar event occur.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and she seemed to us to be quite rational and eloquent about her sighting.  When we explored the possibility that the two witnesses might have been observing a celestial body, she pointed out that the object of interest, at one point during their sighting, suddenly moved a large (angular) distance across the sky.

Nearing 107th Ave. when I noticed three lights moving slowly in formation a mile or two south of I-10. I was talking with my son on the cell phone and told him I could see three aircraft in a very tight formation. The lights were very close together at exactly the same altitude and moving in a precise formation. After a minute or two I thought I was mistaken that they must be lights on a tall building or facility in the distance as they were not moving as fast as an aircraft would move. After a few minutes I could see they were moving WSW slightly faster than the 70MPH I was driving. The aspect angle between the lights was changing and I was certain they were moving. All the lights were at exactly the same altitude. The appearance of the lights was different from aircraft lights. They were larger and not as intense as an aircraft light. They had a different color than aircraft lights, they were not white, but had a tawny tint similar to the old incandescent sealed beam headlights on cars. These lights were diffused rather than focused. There were no red or green lights that an aircraft would have, nor any strobes near these lights at any time, they had no similarity to conventional aircraft lights. They were definitely not bright Venus in the evening sky. I have been watching Venus &amp; Jupiter the past weeks and they were larger, brighter, lower, further south and moving in formation, I have no doubt. I got off I-10 at Litchfield Rd and then continued south on McDowell Rd about 1/4 mile north of and parallel to I-10. While driving on McDowell at 45MPH and in a dark area with no street lights I could clearly see the aspect angle changing and the lights were moving WSW and now drawing away from me. They were about 300 to 600 feet above the ground at the same altitude and moving together. I thought it possible they were three lights on a very large aircraft. I drove south on McDowell to Sarival and decided to pursue them, turning South on Sarival. It was very dark and a fourth light appeared behind and slightly below the other three. I did not see where it came from, it appeared suddenly. It never reached the same altitude as the other three lights and disappeared as suddenly as it appeared. I drove 2 miles south of I-10 trying to reach some open country roads where I could drive fast and get closer to the lights. When I reached Yuma Rd. I turned west but they were getting further away, they may have been speeding up, but not moving as fast as even a slow single engine Piper or Cessna. They turned to the SW approximate compass heading 235degrees. Another of the lights disappeared suddenly leaving only two. After a another minute the remaining two lights disappeared. They did not appear to land or fly away, they were just gone. This entire episode covered 10 or 12 miles of driving and lasted 15 to 20 minutes. I was on the phone with my son describing my observations and chase to him while it was going on. I am a 54 year old, stable &amp; successful business man. I was driving home my usual route, as I do at this time several times a week. I fly often and live near an Air Force base and can recognize and easily identify many types of aircraft.

While serving in the US Air Force, Operation Desert Shield during October 1990, I observed a dark triangular shaped object moving across the sky at approximately 22:30 hrs.  It made no sound.  It had 3 white lights, 1 at each corner of the triangle. My location was a remote desert airstrip having little interference from ground lighting.  There were many stars visible, but none were visible within the triangle itself.  The moon was approximately full.  The object moved across my field of vision in approximately 15 -20 seconds.  It was much larger in size than the moon; like comparing the size of a quarter dollar to the size of my hand held at arms length.  Its altitude was unknown.  I remember bringing this incident to the attention of several others at the time it occurred.  &#x5C;&#x5C;During my 22 years of AF service, I witnessed many types of aircraft in flight.

However, I do remember the time of night because I was on my way home from work (I worked at a restaurant and always got off at the same time every night). I turned left on Vollmer Rd from Shoup, and saw what appeared to me to be a plane crossing from East to West above Swan Hill.  No big deal; I see low flying planes all the time.  The area is close to 3 different airports (1 USAF).  I kept watching it as I got closer to the object, and it looked to me (from that distance) like it had turned, because it was no longer moving across the sky.  The closer I got the stranger it looked to me.  Finally, as I was driving up Swan hill, I knew it wasn&apos;t a plane or helicopter.  I slowed my car down to about 30 MPH (I remember glancing at the speedometer; limit is 45), and I turned off the stereo.  The object could not have been more than 100 feet off of the ground, and probably about 100 feet off to my left side, just sitting there above the trees on top of the hill.  At this point I could see at least the lights clearly, though I do not remember seeing any outline around the lights.  There were three white lights, in the shape of an iscoceles triangle, and it was pointed to the South.  30 MPH is pretty slow, and I&apos;m fairly certain that it wasn&apos;t moving at all.  I do not remember hearing any noises, even with the stereo turned off. I was quite young at the time (I&apos;m only 22 now), so I didn&apos;t even know where I could try to report something like that.  I&apos;m only reporting it now because I came across this website while searching on google trying to find a list of rankings for various cities for reported UFO sightings.  I&apos;m writing a fiction novel, and the information would be useful. Anyway, I see a checkbox for this below, but I don&apos;t &quot;want&quot; someone to contact me about this.

I thought it might have been a planet, possibly Venus, but it was glittering a variety of colors ranging from bright red to green to blue to yellow.  It was obviously not an airplane because it didn&apos;t appear to be moving.  As I watched it, I noticed it would occasionally move up and down or left and right or in small ovals, very rapidly and sporratically but not in any intelligble direction, it seemed very erratic.  I woke my sister and she watched it with me.  It was to the East just right of the little dipper.  We watched it for an hour and I took photos and some video.  It was still visible and was still moving as it became light out, and I took a video showing the only two objects still visible in the sky were this object and Mars.  While it was still dark out we noticed a number of shooting stars. The next day, at the same time, I noticed three of the same objects making the same motions, not close to each other, about 20 degrees left or right of each other.

About the time of new term starting at schools daughters said. it was a moonlit night and the clouds were boyant bt plenty of clear sky between them- as if it was fairly windy high up.WE had to take a country road for about 11 or 12 miles through some small hamlets and one or two small villages but very quiet. The raod was welllit by the mon depsite the fast moving clouds which did not except sporadically obscure any significant part of the sky. WE had I think it was when we had the Audi with a sun roof but it might have been a Renault car I am not much good about cars. The point is we had a tinted glass sunroof. My daighter and I had been comenting on the lively night and sky when something caught my attention. WE must have travelled perhaps three miles out of the town. First behind a cloud then unshielded were three green or gey green faded but clearly there, green spheres. They would have been pretty big, I suppose if we estimated them to be er!!! flying below the clouds sometimes I dont really know what height the clouds are at!!! But at that hieght they would seem to measure about I would guess half the size of football pitch!! maybe a third.If I measured them as an artist using my thumb down a pencil- the tip of the pencil being put at the visual edge of one of the spheres and my thumb moving down until my eys sees it as recording the oposite edge and my arm straight ( if you know this methods used to measure distant objects bye artists!!!I would say they would be about three to four inches across at that distance.At first we thought there were some  kind of laser show, (we had seen one which had given us a scare when the images appeared  over our fields,)  But these  interchanged positions altering height slighty as the way a car does on and unneven road. Also of the road tured they altered thier path to follow us blatantly drawing close to one another to take the turn. At first watching them partly throught the sunroof and partly by craning our necks was just interesting then we becaem disconcerted when we saw they were following us and it becamwe more urgent to get home fast. In fact they trailed us for all  but th last mile home when we reached a village and took the sharp turn left they swung around and went into the distance growing smaller as they went. we didnt know what to think we were sure they were some kind of spacecraft. There  were no seperate lights as I have heard described though, just a continuous ring (pale green) each of them had and the middle was obscured somehow. we are used to seeing helicopetors as we lived on thier flight path from a military base some 12 miles in another direction, and also planes and airballoon but none like this and theses were moving fact and had great propulsion faster than a jet plane when they went off but not a sound.  My husband met a neighbour( about a mile away) a week later and when he went to mention it the neighbour said&apos; that is odd we were also followed by those &apos;exactly the same&apos;. Then in the local paper for Cornwall (and I have a picture someone took) was a report (up near bodmin I think it was) of this Ufo &apos;one only&apos; but very like the ones we had been followed by, but this was taken in the day at sun set!!!! Around the same time  ( and this may be accountable any other way, I do not know, may be unconnected but those were very real no question) I was awakened in the night by a very bright white light blue white. The road ran next to the house, so I thought at first and so did hubby it must be a car!! I actually had made little shutter fo this side window but they didnt fit very well so they let light in along the edges and it shone straight on my face. I opened up the shutter to see and there was no car and the moon was not visable or at least I could not find it and also the light was much much brighter and very white with a bue eliment to it. I could not see its course, it lasted a while um! maybe twenty minutes half an hour and went.I had often told people about these sightings and they came back with amazing stories but I never found anywhere to report it and find out whatit was, then I was reading the uninvited lately having got it in a pile of books i got at charity shop[ before we left england two years ago. and when I mentioned the light it reminded me and fankly gave me the w*llies.

The sky was clear. We observed an orange flare in the horizon above a mountain ridge to the northwest. It was very far in the distance, the orange hue presumably due to the sun reflection. We took a closer look with binoculars and a telescope. The best way to describe it was that it looked like a candle flame - one that you would see in a drawing or cartoon. It had the same teardrop shape and through the telescope you could see that there was a central ridge of blank dividing the two orange flares. This object moved slowly vertically into the sky, and disappeared. It was immediately followed by a second object of the same description, which appeared over the mountain ridge and then slowly ascended and disappeared. About 5 minutes later, a third object repeated this same pattern. The entire incident took about 15-20 minutes. The objects were very far in the distance. The objects moved almost directly perpendicular to the horizon, indicating that they were ascending. My best guess is that they disappeared when they reached the end point of the setting sun where the sun was no longer reflecting.", "Sixties mass sighiting in Fort Smith recounted by military pilot witness.This refers to the sighting mentioned earlier in this site over Fort Smith, AR in the Summer of 1966 or 1967. I believe the date to be August rather than July, but otherwise the same event.I was 11 or 12 years old at the time.  I am a retired USAF fighter pilot, so this event has always been a memorable event. I remember the accounts at the time of the three lights, although that is not what I and my parents saw that evening. A relative called about 2100 all excited about the UFOs that were &quot;about to land out near the airport&quot; (where else?).  What the previous writer failed to mention was the significance of the Coca-Cola bottling plant locaton.  The Coke plant was within a half mile of the Fort Smith Municiple Airport.  Fort Smith is quite hilly with tall trees.  The area around the airport provides the largest view of the sky, Therefore was the area where people congregated to see the sights that evening.  Local AM radio station KFSA (there were&apos;nt any FM stations in town yet) had set up a mobile broadcast near the airport to provide a live account of the sightings.  As I remember, the first name of the on-air personality was Bill.  The station normally ended its daily broadcast at midnight, but stayed on well past midnight for this event.  A sizeable crowd gathered there and could be heard in the background on the radio. My parents and I stepped out into our back yard to take a look at about 2100.  We saw only a yellow/orange/white single light moving slowly along the southern sky on a westerly heading.  It was moving slowly; about normal final approach speed for aircraft of the day.  There was no sound.  The radio reporter and people near him were watching the same object.  Surprisingly, the object began to accelerate until it was going so fast, I lost it in the trees.  This would certainly have been impressive accerlation for any aircraft of the day, or today.  Yet I heard nothing like afterburners or any jet noise. My dad went to bed, but my mom and I stayed up to watch and listen to the radio. It was an extremely clear moonless night.  For quite a while nothing happened.  The radio reporter was running out of much to say when suddenly at about 0100 the crowd that could be heard on the radio became excited.  The reporter stopped mid-sentence to look then said, &quot;Yes, out of the northwest...&quot; We looked and there was the most fascinating sighting.  An object of very distinct shape was traversing the sky on a southeasterly heading at what, even today after all my military flying, I would say was very high altitude and very fast.  The shape was razor sharp and clear; a V or boomerang shape. There was no sound and no visible contrail. As an 11-year old, I had chills.  It was a little scary at that age. Interestingly, the object slowed as it neared the southeastern horizon (the direction of the airport from our house), turned west and appeared as the earlier orange slow moving light.  Nothing more was seen by us that night or following nights.  Local newspaper articles recounted the event the next day.  They reported contacting Little Rock AFB about the sighting.  They reported no activity in the area. So, what was it?  In all my military flying from 1977 until 1997, I never saw anything like this; nothing not easily explained.  So, the memory of this childhood sighting, witnessed by hundreds, has been a mystery. I have three theories.  At the time, Little Rock AFB had a wing of B-58 Hustler strategic bombers.  The B-58 was a supersonic delta wing bomber that was one of the first to be built with new structural technologies and materials.  The skin of the aircraft when supersonic (certainly the leading edge of the wing) would become extremely hot.  I suspect that the 1am object might have been a B-58 on a high altitude night supersonic dash over the city.  What we saw was the glowing hot leading edge of the wing.  Another possiblity with regards to military aircraft of the day that this might have been is the XB-70 high altitude experimental supersonic bomber.  Only two were built and tested.  One was certainly still flying at the time, although one crashed near this time.  The XB-70 was also a delta wing, but much bigger and faster than the B-58.  Certainly, it could have been this aircraft in a high altitude dash which heated the leading edge of the wing creating the very visible V shape.  Finally, the SR-71 Blackbird (or early variant) was flying by this time and could have done this. Where was the sound?  Too high to be heard.  Sonic booms and jet noise dissapate from high altitude (over FL350) before reaching the ground...or so I have theorized.  I suspect that there are USAF records (flight logs, training records, maintenance records, etc) available to the public regarding these three aircraft that could be researched to see if my theory is correct that this sighting was one of these  historic aircraft...stirring up a lot of Arkansans...and one boy&apos;s dream of flight.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting event is approximate.  PD))((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS, DATED OCTOBER 21, 2005 @ 12:31 HRS.))Results of research on Ft. Smith chevron sighting.This is a follow-up to my recent post here regarding the specific chevron-shaped object.  I have since done some research that would dispel two of my theories.  I contacted a retired B-58 crew member who confirmed that the leading edge of the wing did not glow when supersonic. I have also researched the possiblity of the XB-70.  The Final Report on the the XB-70 program published in 1972 lists every flight of each of the giant delta wing aircraft.  A/V-2 had already crashed by the time of this sighting. A/V-1 was flying. I have been unable to determine if the XB-70 did any night flying, or flying significantly away from Edwards AFB, CA.  From reading the chief test pilot&apos;s summary, I would highly doubt that this aircraft did either.  It was a very complex aircraft, often having malfunctions requiring unique support.  To intentionally stray from its support base would be doubtful. Also, it was a very crudely equipped and instrumented aircraft in its experimental form.  Its single TACAN worked poorly, requiring the crew to rely heavily on FAA ATC for help with navigation. There is one long-shot date of possibility. The aircraft flew on 8/24/67 for over two hours, reached over Mach 2, and an altitude of 58,000 feet.  If the actual sighting that I witnessed occured on this date, it would be an interesting coincidence.So, I believe that leaves this sighting on mysterious footing.  Other possible aircraft of the day are the CIA A-12 Blackbird and its followers, the YF-12 and SR-71. That will take more research and will probably be more difficult to find records in the public domain.((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the source of this report for his having done such nice investigative work regarding his sighting.

I see what I think is the B1 Stealth Bomber heading south at 11pm as I stand in my driveway.  I feel pumped up and want to see it.  I&apos;ve only seen the B1 a few times and never at night. It approaches close and low to the ground.  I see a white light glare coming over the trees.  I estimate the craft at 1000 feet above as I stand in a fairly small, hilltop clearing of an oak forrest. As it gets closer, I notice a pointed front end.   White lights point directly down, like spot lights.  I now know it cannot be the Stealth Bomber.  Wow, I&apos;ve never seen a Stealth Fighter.  As it reaches almost overhead, Im struck by the shape of the craft.  I see a perfect isosceles triangle.  The bottom of the craft shows shiney metalic.  I see 3 bright white lights running down each side of the triangle.  I try to see a cockpit that I can recognize.  I can&apos;t see it.  I see no cockpit.  Im stunned again by the perfection of the triange, the bright lights and now by the fact the craft moves surprising slow. It passes overhead.

About 5 minutes before I reached the Ridgeland exit I looked over and saw what appeared to be a white plane, but I did not see wings. I am slightly near-sighted so I passed it off as vision problems, but then when I got a full view of the object I discovered it was not moving. It was hovering there, not going forward, and it was too low to the ground to be a plane. There was a building several yards away and it was higher than the building, but it was still very low. After studying the object for a minute it slowly rose a few feet into the air but continued to hover. It was then that I took the Ridgeland Exit and went to my class. I don&apos;t know what it was. It was not a plane or a blimp although it resembled more of a blimp like object. It was not particularly big or small, it was probably a little bit smaller than a commercial plane, but bigger than a small plane. It was white. It had no lights and no markings.

So I am interested in knowing if anyone else reported seeing anything at the same time/night or if you know of any monitoring equipment that was flying around over NH that night. I took my dog outside at around 1:30 am and was sitting on my porch and noticed a relatively large, bright light in the sky. I started staring at it and then noticed that it was moving around randomly in the sky almost like it was being blown by a light wind or something. It was visable above the treeline and looked like an extremely large/bright star, but then I noticed the strange movement. I used binoculars and did not see it much more clearly so I imagine it was quite high in the sky, but realized it definitely had lights on it of some sort - and they were bright enough that it was throwing light around it like a halo. From MY PERSPECTIVE, way away from it, when moving it was only covering a patch of sky about 3 inches X 2 inches. It kept moving around in that general area. I also noticed a few times that a short distance from it there were flashing lights, coming off from about 2:00 and 9:00 and 5:00 if the object was in the middle of a clock-face. I then noticed a second one to the right but farther away as the light was much smaller and dimmer, but I could still see it was moving around also. I thought maybe it was a satellite, but then realized that the movement was not right and it was not tracking across the sky on any sort of trajectory. I also thought maybe it was a weather monitoring device, but didnt understand why it was covered in lights... I studied it with binoculars for about 1/2 hr and couldnt get any clearer picture of it. I looked for it in the morning but could not see anything in the sky so imagine it was either gone or far enough up to not be visible by day.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The first spotted ship was what seemed to be a bright star, when it started to sparkle I got my binoculars and saw much to my amazement a space ship!!

Suddenly two rows of lights the colors were red, blue, green,yellow,white,orange,purple and a florescent pink, the two rows of lights were going oposite directions on the bottom of the ship at a rapid pace.  The ship stopped its lights moving and remained in the same spot for over 10 minutes.   The lights stayed off, but the ship appered to be lighting up the sky above it.  This went on for quite awhile.  Then the ship started doing tricks.  It turned side ways and spinned at a rapid pace, I could not see the colorful lights but noticed all white lights and then it stopped abruptly.  Then it shot out backwards and started spinning at an angel doing the same thing.  He shot forward and back several times while still turning.  It was shotting out very bright lights in front of it.  (like headlights or it appeared like it was taking photos or warding something off)?  After several minutes I saw another ship that was very far away and harder to see. This ship was doing the same thing in the direction of the bigger ship.  They were both lighting up the sky when they shot this light at eachother.  I watched this until I could no longer see the smaller ship.  The larger ship was slowly getting harder to see through my binoculars as he was moving out of range.  I watched this phenominal show for one hour.  I kept my eye on the large ship until he finally disapeared.", "I acrobatic, 3 in formation, bright light coming from ground near ranchesThe UFO was a bright light in the western sky, at first I mistook if for an aircraft, until it changed direction and started doing maneuvers that standard aircraft can&apos;t accomplish.  It was obviously not a star, as it had the same type of reflection that satellites, the ISS, aircraft, etc have from the moon and sun.  It changed directions randomly and suddenly, and sometimes sat still. To the north of the UFO doing accrobatics was a triangular formation of 3 other lights, that I first thought was the tail of the little dipper, but realized it wasn&apos;t the dipper since the &quot;dipper&quot; portion was missing.  Looked like the formation might be moving very slowly but couldn&apos;t tell.  Kept my attention mostly on the acrobatic, looking at the formation every 10 minutes or so. After an hour, went inside to take a shower (aprox 15 minutes), came back out and the formation had moved higher in the sky and closed into a perfect triangle.  The moving light was still present and in the same area, and started to see random flashing lights coming from the ground, what seemed to be maybe 20 miles northwest of town, out near ranches and farms.

The photos were taken in an Easterly direction using an &quot;Olympus D-460 ZOOM&quot; digital camera. The photos were taken two or three minutes apart. I did not see the ufos until after I had downloaded the pictures into my computer.  The reason I got my camera and took the photos of the plane leaving the chemtrail is because of previous pictures I have taken of chemtrails and discovering the ufos in the photo.((NUFORC Note:  We have viewed the photographs that the witness forwarded to our Center, and we do not know what the anomalous object is.

The balls were moving very slowly in an UPWARD direction.  My mother lives about a mile south of Cactus Rd so I phoned her and asked her to go outside. Within 20 seconds, the lights went out of sight and by the time she ran to the front yard, she saw two fighter jets and one of the balls bounced up and down, and shot straight upwards towards the sky and disappeared. We drove around for a few more minutes but could not find them again.  Within three minutes I called 1411 (information) for channel 3 news (KTVK) and reported the incident. The investigator there at channel 3 told me that there have been numerous reports of these lights all over the Phoenix valley tonight.  The news reporter told me they were spotted near Scottsdale, Apache Junction, and Peoria. The news reporter also told me that they were catching footage of the lights and that the 10 o&apos;clock news would cover this. At 10:20 PM I decided to call the news station because the lights were not being mentioned. I spoke with the same news reporter again, and this time he told me that they did not get footage and there would be no news story.  He added that some reports noted fighter jets dropping flares, and after dropping the flares, the lights would shoot off in various directions or straight up towards the sky.  The news reported added that they get many reports of these lights, as many as two each and every day. There&apos;s just something strange about this! These were NOT flares, NOT helicopters, NOT jet airplanes, NOT lightening balls, or anything else that would be easy to explain.

It was moving in some zig-zag motion.  This caught my attention so I watched further.  The light seemed to move in a straight horizontal motion till it dropped almost completely straight down with a slight angle.  The light moved fast.  As the light dropped it disappeared.  It vanished basically out of thin air. That was the last of it I saw. The whole incident lasted about 2 seconds.  It moved to fast for a helicopter or airplane of any I know of.

As I was scanning the sky a very bright star-like and star sized object caught my eye from the Southeast.  When I turned to look at it I initially thought it was Venus or some other very high altitude plane. However, the light was very bright and after watching it for only a few seconds, its luminosity changed and went back to just an ordinary star brightness. I noticed that it was also moving in the Northwest direction so I continued to monitor its path. As I watched it move to the NW it looked like one of the numerous satellites I see all the time so I was about to turn away and find something else to look at it when I began noticing that this light was not moving in a straight line.  It was meandering right and left in a slow s-styled motion.  From my ground vantage point it looked like it was maneuvering through an obstacle course.  The speed of the object remained constant and it was still heading in the overall NW direction but it would jog right and left about 8-10 degrees every 15 seconds or so. I have never seen a satellite or plane change directions before like this at such a high altitude.  The change in direction seemed purposeful.  I had been watching this first object for about 3-4 minutes when I noticed a faster moving companion object 10 degrees below it and gaining on the first.  Both objects were coming out of the Southeast and headed to the Northwest.  This second star-like object had the normal star luminosity and was travelling 3-4 times as fast as the first object. This second object was not moving in any sort of irregular pattern.  It seemed like it was traveling on a very straight line.  I could see both objects in my field of view and as I watching both, the first object flared up again.  Extreme luminosity.  It was intensely bright. The luminosity coincided with second object  below overtaking the first object above. This time the intense brightness lasted only a second before returning back to normal star-like brightness. Then a couple of seconds later the first object went dark. It completely vanished. I could still see the second object continuing to the NW but my first object just turned off or disappeared.  About a minute later the second object left my field of vision and I could no longer track it.((NUFORC Note:  Description seems consistent with the flare from an Iridium satellite, but neither Iridium satellites, nor the ISS, was visible from Bothell on the date, and at the time, indicated by the witness.

The sky in that area is dark and has the advantage of having no city lights to &quot;throw&quot; a viewer.  The night was extremely clear with no smoke or haze or moonlight. The Bright Object was steady and appeared to be an orange colored Star.  Larger than other stars in the sky. First we saw what appeared to be a shooting star drop down, right next to the Bright Object. The shooting star did not come from the object but was near it. Suddenly the Bright Object dropped what appeared to be a bright plasma ball similar from our vantage point to what one would normally term a shooting star.  At that moment the Bright Object  suddenly began to move from East to West and had the shape of a diamond, but it appeared as if the entire Object was on fire.  Like a space shuttle on fire.  As it moved, it dropped two more &quot;Plasma balls&quot; or &quot;Shooting stars&quot; and simultaneously, it left a large &quot;Smoke trail&quot;, which did not have the consistancy of smoke, but more like the trail of a comet.  Then, in a flash it seemed to accelerate out of our atmosphere and disappeared, leaving the &quot;Smoke trail&quot; which lasted for another 20 minutes in the star filled sky.

I was driving back to my parents house with my girlfriend at the time. We had just been out on a date, and it was a warm evening outsude. I was driving my mother&apos;s minivan, and we had the windows down because it was nice out.  The road my parent&apos;s house in on was, at the time, in a semi-rural suburban area.  It was a very clear night with lots of stars, no moon from what i recall. When we were about 2 miles away, I saw a dark shape above the treeline in the direction we were headed. Even though it was very dark, there was still some ambient light from philadelphia on the horizon below the treeline. Because of that, I could define space that was much darker then the surrounding sky. I pointed the shape out to my girlfriend, and we both thought it had to be a cloud. Then we realized that it seemed to be moving. Then we thought it must be some sort of flat looking blimp. We could see no lights on it whatsoever, which we thought was very odd for an aircraft at night. When we were approximately 1/2 mile from home, we saw that the object was much larger and closer then we thought, and then it was moving over us. I slowed the car down to almost a stop and stuck my head out the window to see what it was. It made no noise at all, and blocked out a very large portion of the stars. i was able to see that it was roughly triangular in shape- though i can&apos;t be certain of that fact because it all happened so fast and unexpectedly. I didn&apos;t see any visible markings or lights, and it wasn&apos;t moving at a high rate of speed.We both sort of laughed the whole thing off and never talked about it again. I have been at a loss ever since to explain what it was, since aircraft flying at night have some sort of lights.

They passed directly overhead, then a second disappeared at roughly 70 degrees above the East horizon.  The final one disappeared about about 45 degrees above the East horizon.

It changed directions a few times then seemed to be accelerating towards earth, because the tiny faint star increased it&apos;s level of brightness probably 25 to 50 times in brightness.  It then turned and seemed to be gowing away and at an angle to what seemed like the east, then accelerated quickly and suddenly vanished within a short distance in the sky, like a shooting star, but simply could not have been, due to all of the directional changes and starting out so faint and slow.  A very similar event again happened to me in Washington State in the late winter of about 1999.

As I looked closer I reallized that they made A triangle patten.  One in front, one to right side, one to left side and one at back that was in line with the front light.  There was no red or green lights flashing on the craft and it was not moving but was standing still in the air with no noise heard.  It was not very high in the sky the reason I say that is because the highest building here in Paducah Ky is the Jackson house 20 stories high It could have been more then that maybe slightly less.  It was not A helicopter as there was no loud pop or click of the main rotor and no green or red warning lights seen. As I am futher down the street I could begen to See The Shape Around The Lights.  The Craft was Flat black in color as in the latest stealth aircraft.  Yet it was not in the arrowhead shape of A F-117 nighthawk or the long triangle shape of the B-2 Spirit.  It`s dimensions I give as A rough guess were about 70 to 80 feet across in wing span and about 40 to 55 feet in length from the angle I got of the shape it seemed slihtly thick.  Yet it was arounded off at the three edges of the triangle shape.  At first I heard no noise but when I got to within one block I heard A very low rumble that seem to be behind and up futher then the craft itself was.

I got out of my car and watched it.  It was only about 90 yards above the ground.  It had two flashing lights on the side.  A bright light on the front.  On the back was a red glowing panel.

Very hard to focus on it because of &quot;shimmering surface&quot; and low light conditions.

It resembeled a bright star, at about the same altitude a star would be (or so it seemed), which moved at various speeds and directions for 20-30 minutes.  The light would start in one place, then would zip across the sky to another place.  It continued to do this in different directions, at different speeds, and in different formations.  It zipped back and forth, and would stop sometimes, only to start its erratic movement again.  Sometimes it would even seem to disappear, only for a moment, before reappearing somewhere else in the sky.  It was still light outside, although it took place years ago, so the time of day listed is only an estimate. I have only talked to people of this, and have never reported it, as I only today found out about this organization. Coincidentally, my sister (who I had spoken to about the incident years ago), while attending a similar festival in Manchester, Tennessee a year or so ago, witnessed a strikingly similar unidentified flying object in the sky.  It had the same flying patterns as I mentioned above.  My sister was amazed, since she had been skeptical of my sighting years earlier, and since it was so similar, but in a different state and years later in a similar situation. This object was unlike any aircraft I&apos;ve ever witnessed in terms of altitude, speed, and the way it could so abruptly stop and change directions.  Also, it remained in the same general area for a long period, which I have never witnessed in a plane before. Since many people attended both of these events, I can&apos;t help but think others witnessed these events, or if any explanations can or have been offered, and I am very curious to know.

Sunset Blvd., which is a major thoroughfare here, I happened to look skyward and my eyes got focused on  something unusual. I indicated the direction of what I am seeing to the man I was talking to to find out if he can also see it. He tried a couple but could not perhaps due to some eye problem, he did not. I somewhat ran to a parked care quite nearby to assertain if they can see what I am seeing. Again I indicated the located and sure enough, they can see them. At first, I saw simultaneously a solitary whitish disk and a couple, and later a 4th one. They are at an altitude that makes them look like US quarter coins. They are in a formation like a big letter T on its sides. They are slightly changing formation with the middle craft slightly moving to the solitary craft and then forming a big arrow. As soon as the couple say them, they were trying to capture it with their camera phone. (I did not know if they were able to photo it). The couple were also commenting that the crafts seem to be moving when they are in formation--like they are rotating or vibrating. Laster on, the arrowhead formed into an equilateral triangle that slowly rotated and at one time stopped as an arrowhead. And then it formed a W on its side with the angles maintaning a 60 degree angle. Later on they disappeared and later on a couple reappeared at a higher altitude until I could not see them again anymore.

The woman was born in Mexico but grew up in So. Cal. and interestingly enough, she told me of a close encounter when she was 12 together with her Mom, sister and their neighbors. She described of quite huge crafts emitting different lights that hovered low above their houses.The male of the couple, at the moment this was happening, phoned to inform his mother.

As we sat, the sky beyond the wooded treeline starten to lighten in that one area only. While we questioned what we were seeing, we also questioned each other, isn&apos;t it awfully early for the sun to be coming up? Once we realized it was much too early, we sat and watched for nearly an hour as that portion of the sky got brighter and brighter, at one point I questioned my friend as to what I was seeing, and if he saw it the same way. Apparent beams of light were now stretching to the sky in that one area of the sky only. Slowly, towards the latter part of the hour, the light faded away, until once again the night sky was completely black. At this point, I went into the house to check the time again, It was now nearly 4am. I returned to the fire, and as we sat there discussing what we had seen, I saw an object in the sky, we believe coming from the south, I questioned my friend, &quot;Isn&apos;t that object moving awfully fast?&quot; Other aircraft (planes) could be seen in the sky, the standard, slow moving, plae blinking light. This first craft had four, large, unblinking, white beams, in a diamond shape. It was moving so fast over and above our heads we were having a hard time keeping track of it.  Followed very close behind this object and moving just as quickly was another craft with what appeared to be two solid green, and 2 solid red lights, these did not blink either.They followed very close together on the same course, and were out of sight in a matter of minutes. My friend and I sat awestruck, and debated what we were seeing, the objects were soundless, but very large, and were travelling so quickly that ordinarily you would hear a sonic boom- but nothing. We figured that about 15 minutes passed and were still discussing the nights events, and how eerie this all seemed, saying &quot;No one will ever beleive this, I&apos;m glad to that you are here to see this!&quot; Just as we were going to get up to go to bed,a third, fastmoving object came flying from the same direction as the previous two.The big difference was that this one appeard to be disc shaped.lights,all different colours, flashing it seemed to be a completely random order. This ship flew as quickly, and fllowed the same course, and we actually got up out our chairs, clinging to each other, walking beneath the object, up the yard, we had a hard time keping them in sight even as we got up and walked across the lawn following them. Even after it had passed the blinking band of mulicoloured lights could been seen clearly until it passed over another wooded area. This whole event from start to finish may have lasted as long as 2 hours. When we finally went to bed it was nearly 5am. I just want to add, that the night sky was clear that night, numerous stars and constellations were presnt, and whether tht two events, the light in the sky, the crafts, etc we part of the same occurance, I&apos;m not sure, but both my friend and I can honestly admit, that we&apos;ve nevr seen anylike that before, and it sure gave us an eerie feeling.", "Another sighting from KalamazooI was camping in the woods between Galesburg and Kalamazoo sitting by a small fire when I suddenly heard a very loud sound coming from the direction of the gravel pit which was approx. 300 yards from my camp.  It sounded like a Kawasaki motor cycle reved to about 15,000+ RPM&apos;s!  I jumped up to see if I could spot it but saw nothing.The sound lasted only about 15 sec then was gone.The next day one of the farm hands came by and told me some local kids were riding their dirt bikes in the gravel pit when they saw a craft take off out of there.I asked him if it was at about 8:30 last night and he said yes it was.  I told him I heard the thing take off. He asked me if it would be alright if the kids came back there to talk to me about it because they thought they were nuts.  I told him it was.The kids stopped by and told me what it looked like.  They said it looked like a barbell or two vertically positioned disks with a tube between connecting the disks.  I guess it looked like Darth Vader&apos;s fighter craft (!) which seems very odd indeed.The next day I took a walk down to the gravel pit to see if there were any marks on he ground.  I found an odd looking depression in the gravel.  It was conical like you would expect as if someone had removed some ground in gravel and the sides caved in to form a cone shape but, there was no sign of the removed dirt nearby!  It was as if something was extracted from underneath and the gravel settled back down into to the space below.There are some strange goings ons at this gravel pit during years of near Earth/Mars approaches as during my report of 1977.I would like to note that this year 2003 was a near pass year between Earth and Mars.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It came from behind my house and passed directly overhead going towards the southeast. It was extremely large and appeared to be at a low altitude. I didn&apos;t hear any sound. It was black with dim round lights on the underside that were in triangle arrangement. The leading edges of the craft appeared to be a lighter shade than the rest of the body and I don&apos;t remember seeing the back side. We have regular air traffic flying over the nieghborhood on approach to the airport so I am used to seeing low planes.

It had the brightest lights I have ever seen across the craft.  It couldn&apos;t have been an airplane because it hovered for quite a long time and then dipped below the tree line.  We jumped into the car and went to Tennent Cemetary and it reappeared above the trees again.  It again seemed to hover and not move for some time.  The lights were all the way across the craft.  There was no sound coming from the craft.  It again dipped below the trees.  We then jumped into the car and drove to Wemrock rd. to see if it would reappear there.  It did not but what was really amazing, a shooting star shot across the sky around the vicinity where we saw it last.

We were on highway 113 out of Vacaville when  I saw lights off to the right.  We are close to Travis Air Force Base and we always have planes around the area so I didn&apos;t think too much about the lights I was seeing.  There was what looked light a plane off to our right coming toward us but seemed  very low.  I said to the twins, look at that plane.  When it started to pass over us we looked for the wings and the normal shape of a plane.  It flew over us, that was when we saw that there where no wings, it was round but a octagon shape with lights on each corner and as it passed over us it had a blue light in the middle of the craft.  It made no sound. My granddaughter said was that a ufo?  We watched it keep going lower and it looked like it was going to land in a grove of trees.  I was driving but my grandson said that it looked like it just took off out of the trees.  The twins where very scared and did not want to talk about it untill we got to their Dads home.  We then compared what we had seen and we all saw the same shape and lights.  I have never seen anything like this before, the reason I am writing this is to see if anyone else on the road that night saw anything like we saw.", "A silent, blue oval appeared, flew east at high speed, then vanished.My friend and I were outside walking through the neighborhood one night, and we came to the back of the local elementary school where we sat down for a while. When we got up, we began to walk across the large field in back of the school. When we got to the middle, I felt something strange and I looked up in the sky and as soon as I looked, a bright blue oval appeared from nowhere exactly where I looked. I told my friend to look and we stood there and watched the object fly across the sky. It was going very fast, probably several thousand kilometers an hour and it made absolutely no sound. Overall, the object appeared, flew east and disapeared. We decided to stay there to see if it would return. A few minutes passed, and we observed a helicopter from the airbase fly halfway to our location and then return. Someone else must have seen this.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))", "Georgia UFO Group/MUFON of Georgia- Fort Mountain Teardrop CraftBeginning in 1998, and for several years thereafter, this writer, as State Director for MUFON of Georgia, visited the Fort Mountain community numerous times. (These visits continue today on behalf of the Georgia UFO Group).  Each visit was in response to members of that community who were reporting multiple observations of unknown aerial activity.  Ths first visit was made on 15March98, taking along a team of MUFON personnel, including Field Investigator Jack Dowless who lives in that region of Georgia.  The witness was found to be a mature successful businessman who has for 12 years lived on the highway along which this upscale mountain community is located. The witness was found to be an intelligent and well read person, an active church member and an obvious PILLAR of the Murray County area.His home was located at 2600 feet of altitude on the side of Fort Mountain overlooking a large valley toward Grassy Mountain to the north.  His north wall lets out onto a full patio, the exit being a huge glass wall/sliding door.  This area is within the Chattahoochee National Forest, abutting the remote Cohutta Wilderness. Location being about 70 miles north of Atlanta.  The witness was cooperative and requested to remain anonymous due to his church work and business ventures in both Georgia and Tennessee.  FI Jack Dowless conducted the interview with occasional questions from this writer.  The witness stated that on an unrecalled date in September of 1995 at about 5:00PM EDT, the weather was clear and sunny. To the NW, he observed an object out over the valley and it appeared to be teardrop in shape.  He estimated that it was about 300 yards from his home, essentially stationary, but with a tilting motion that also revealed the top. He got his nearby binoculars and about half of the 1 - 1 1/2 minute observation was made with magnification. He further described the object as seeming to be SOLID, and of a dull aluminum-type metal, about the color of galvanized pipe.  Addtionally he estimated that it was about 30-40 feet in length, 12-18 feet in width, thickness of 8-10 feet, tapering to 3-5 feet, with a canopy or cockpit-type of protuberance on top.  The witness also described a black &quot;hole&quot; that opened in the top center/side of the craft.  Clear but bright icicle-like rays were projected from the circumference of the hole out to a distance of some 50-100 feet.  After about 20 or so seconds, the hole closed and the craft resumed it&apos;s original appearance.  (Witness later told this writer the &quot;rays&quot; might be compared to the shiny tinsel icicle-like decorations put on Christmas trees.....they blow in a stiff breeze).  The object then suddenly vanished.  No unusual odors, sounds or other effects were noticed.The witness had sketched in detail what he observed.  Much later, the witness and his brother was watching a documentary on the Fox Network and got the &quot;UFO Hotline&quot; number.  His brother talked him into reporting the incident (brother lives elsewhere in Georgia).  This was corroborated when the writer later interviewed the brother on several occasions. During later discussions with the witness and his brother over the next few years, ALL DETAILS REMAINED THE SAME.  Due to the witness&apos; unobstructed view of the valley, mountains and sky, he stated he was in fact a regular skywatcher and  had some small interest in UFOs since they were always in the media.  He went on to describe some other events he had witnessed, as well as those of his neighbors.  Subsequent visits to this community to speak with other witnesses found his information to be absolutely correct.  This writer and other MUFON of Georgia personnel in fact personally witnessed a minor event from this location at a later date and subsequent to that, WITNESSED WHAT WE FEEL WAS A SURPRISING (!) UNEXPLAINED EVENT very near this witness&apos; home. (As one member described it.....&quot;That&apos;ll wake you up in the morning boys&quot;!......this particular episode will be described in a future posting to NUFORC).  Overall, subsequent interaction with this witness during later visits to Fort Mountain further established his credibility to this writer.  FI Jack Dowless indicated he felt that no conventional aircraft could be mistaken in this case due to the close observation, lack of sound and vanishing of the object.  He did speculate a bit about some advanced experimental aircraft due to the close proximity (about 55 miles) of the Lockheed facility located within Dobbins AFB north of Atlanta.  The above described craft remains UNIDENTIFIED to this day.  On 20Sept05, during routine review of the various reports at NUFORC, this writer noticed the witness illustration from the 2June05 St. Louis, Mo. report.The similarity of that sketch to the Fort Mountain sketch is extraordinary.  This writer is currently forwarding a copy of said Fort Mountain sketch to NUFORC for further scrutiny.  Additional reports from the Chatsworth/Fort Mountain area can be found in the NUFORC&apos;s Georgia database after 15March98. As indicated, another is due to be posted in coming weeks.

As I was getting out of the car, I noticed what appeared to be a bright shooting star object fly overhead heading north toward Long Island Sound.  My friend and I both saw the object move very quickly and then it seemed to loop down and head straight as if it was crashing toward the ground.  We both thought it may have been an aircraft that went down to the north of where we live, perhaps on the northern part of Long Island or in the Long Island Sound.  We checked the local news and heard nothing about an airplane or helicopter mishap.

This evening I was again walking with my dog but this time my little sister was also with me.  Planet Mars was very visible well above the eastern horizon. At about 21:25 me and my sister observed an extremely bright Iridium satellite flash above the constellation of Ursa Major.  Five minutes after that I noticed a bright satellite moving just outside the left side of what the astronomers of the Northern hemisphere would call the Pegasi Square and told also my sister to take a look at it. At the time of noticing it was almost straight above my head and was heading SE. What made this satellite peculiar was that it was closely (&lt; 2 degrees) followed by a less visible satellite just as when I observed it about a week earlier (I have no doubt that the objects I saw tonight were the very same ones witnessed in earlier report).  The satellites continued into same direction maintaining their less-than-2-degree distance and slowly fainted away about 90 seconds later well below the Pegasi Square. Also my little sister saw 2 satellites.   We both paid attention to the slow visible speed od these satellites.  The facts that these satellites behaved normally, that I observed this phenomenon twice within a short time, almost exactly in the same direction and almost on the same hour both evenings made clear to me that this phenomenon has little to do with UFOs, Aliens or Extraterrestial life. What I&acute;ve most probably been witnessing on both evenings is a formation of NOSS satellites. No investigation is needed. Thank you.", "Bue lights in Manchester Ct.

We first thought it may have been a blimp but the more we watched this object move we knew it was not. This object moved slow at times then fast with sudden stops and would hover for a few seconds then move out of sight then back again. The object was for the most part dark but it was a clear night and we could see the object clearly against the night sky. I would say that it was no more than 500 yards away during the time we saw it. It most surely had a metalic look to it but not very shiney. We watched this for a good two minutes or so and as fast as it came it was gone. The object to me looked to be more of a tube shape like a paper towel roll. This left both of us speachless for several minutes. We live in a small city but at that time of night there were few people out. We were in a well lit parking area and our front yard at the time of the sighting. My friend who was visiting from out of state also witnessed this but for only a few seconds as he arrived at our apartment after we did. He was awstruck with the object and had many questions but we were just as puzzled.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was siluated against the evening sky. My estimate of its size may seem funny but, if you  could see a passenger jet low enough in the sky to have a look of being about 3 inches across its wing tip to wing tip, would be close. It made no sound and had no lights and moved very slow from southeast to northwest. It seamed to have heat wave around it like something being hot.

When I was 5 years old, I lived with my dad in a two story house up on the hill above Vernon Valley.  I believe it was on Oak Ridge Rd.  My nearest neighbors were a distance away, maybe 100 yards, and wooded areas seperated the houses on my street.  It was late fall and getting dark early.  I was sitting in my bedroom, playing with lego blocks, and had my back to the window.  I remember that the window had a broken &apos;pull down&apos; shade that would not stay down.  As I sat there, I felt a sudden electrical charge all over my body, and found that I could not move.  I had no idea what was going on, and became afraid.  I do not know how much time passed while I was unable to move, but when I could move again, I became aware of the feeling that I was being watched.  I got up, turned around and came face to face with a thing looking in my bedroom window, less than 4 feet away.  It had a large head, was whitish, and had piercing black eyes.  I do not really remeber if it had nostrils or a mouth, but I suppose it did.  It stared at me for a few moments, studying me.  I let out a scream and ran as fast as I could, looking for my father.  I found him in the basement, doing laundry.  I was crying, and babbling that I had seen a &quot;skeleton head&quot; in my window.  Of course, he didn&apos;t believe me, telling me that I had a nightmare.  As he held me, though, the thing in my window reappeared in the basement window, looking in upside down.  I screamed again, and pointed at the window.  My dad turned around to look, but the creature moved out of view very quickly.  He says to this day that he did not get a good look at it, and could not describe what I saw.  There were no trees near my bedroom window, and no way of setting up a ladder without me hearing.  It was too real to be a dream, and too solid to be a reflection.  Plus, many other people describe seeing the same thing when they are young.  Since then, I have had 2 ufo experiences, one nighttime, and one daytime, as recently as last year, and witnessed my more than two other people.  Also, I have been plagued by intense nightmares recently, where I wake up and am unable to move, and unable to wake my girlfriend, and feel hands on my back.  I get rolled over by these hands, and find myself staring up at one or more of these things.

No less than 14 videos have been reviewed in great detail in addition to numerous photos.As one can imagine, this has resulted in a tremendous volume of information, and the number of witnesses is still growing.  New footage is also being recieved.  In addition,there is a chance that some of these events may be contaminated with some hoaxes.Therefore, we can only conclude the following for the moment: Genuine unusual craft (UFO) have been seen and recorded in the Tinley Park area and others on one or more of the above dates.

At 12:45 PM I was outside and I looked almost straight up and saw a white oval shaped unidentified craft moving from northeast to southwest. I saw it expand and contract slightly a few times. It was moving about as fast as a commercial airliner as far as I could tell, maybe a little faster. I could tell it was about as high as the clouds because it seemed to pass through a couple. There was no contrail, and no sound. Also from the istance that i estimated it to be from me, it must have been about the same length as a commercial airliner, maybe more, and also it looked maybe 30% to 50% wider.

As it moved across the sky, it moved so rapidly, it could not have been man made.I was walking south on Sharonwood Ave NW at Noon on a clear, sunny day, and the sky had a few white fluffy clouds against a bright blue sky. In front of me approx. 20 degrees above the horizon and slightly to the left of center was a stationary silver object, cigar shaped (if cigar is fatter at the center). I studied it carefully for some time, but in retrospect my guess is for about 2 or 3 minutes, though it seemed longer than that. An airport was about 8 miles north, so at first I assumed it might be a plane flying directly at me, making it appear stationary, or away from me, but it didn&apos;t move at all, and it didn&apos;t get larger or smaller. It was very smooth looking with no markings, windows, or protrusions such as a wing or a tail.  I was only 12 or 13 years old at the time, but I didn&apos;t really think I was seeing a flying saucer, nor had I seen or read anything prior that would make me think along those lines. The stillness of the object is what puzzled me, so I concentrated carefully thinking the stillness had to be an illusion, and it would soon give itself away, and I&apos;d be able to tell what it really was. Then suddenly it began to move to my right and slightly upward.  I didn&apos;t know how far away it was, but I was guessing a mile or less. It was at this moment I was convinced immediately I had seen something outside of man&apos;s technology. The speed at which it moved convinced me.  It moved so quickly and without noise or any appearance of accelerating.  It just moved quickly.  I only got to see its movement for maybe 20 or 25 degrees horizontally and slightly upwards because it went behind a white fluffy cloud. I expected to see it come out on the other side of the cloud, but it did not. It was gone.Another peculiar thing about this story is how vividly I remember it.  I&apos;m 61 years old now, and have never seen anything remotely like what I saw that day, and I can still remember it all very much like remembering what I was doing the moment I learned of Kennedy being shot. I told my mother what I saw, but there was something about her response (though she was very supportive) that made me not tell anyone else for many years.  I just couldn&apos;t expect anyone to believe me, yet I know I saw what I&apos;ve described here. My reason for reporting it now is that TV shows on the subject have shown people describing what I described, so perhaps the center will have other people reporting they saw it too.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

I watched them for ten to fifteen minutes. Thirty to sixty minutes later I saw another craft much closer, approximately two miles in front and staying seventy to one hundred feet off the ground based upon trees I&apos;m very familiar with, which the craft was very close to.  The craft moved toward me and the red color deepened.  At this point it appeared as a disc with the center being a darker shade.  Then it shot to the left then right- this repeating three times.  My guess is that each movement was a couple hundred feet from center. The object then increased its elevation and continued slowly into the distance.

It was an almost straight line (it curved in the middle like there was a hole in it) with red on the outside and yellow on the inside.  It happened again in the exact same area about 5 seconds later, except at this time something seemed to be sucking the light up. I know of people who live in this area, who claim they have seen aurora borealis.  This does not seem to be related, as it was very early in the year plus did not exibit any of the signs of the aurora lights.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The leading object had lights and the two behind it didn&apos;t.

I noticed a Florissant police officer had a motorist pulled over to the right of the road and was walking back towards his cruiser.  He was looking up towards the sky near a grocery store with his mouth wide open. I started to look towards the direction he was gazing and that is when I saw the object.  It appeared to me to be a two story rectangle with very large windows on the side of the object.  It appeared to be very dark or black in color.  I did notice some lights but cant tell you the exact place they were situated on the craft as it was night and very hard to tell where the edges began and ended.  The exterior lights were bright and seemed to have a bluish hue to them like you see on some of the newer BMW or Mercedes cars.  The object was flying nearly directly over the Schnucks market at approximately 100-200 feet(very low like a police helicopter height ). The object was almost silent, maybe a slight hum as it flew in front of my car. What caught my attention in the short time I saw the object was that the interior of the object was dimly lit up enough that I could see inside the windows I described above.  I couldnt tell much detail other than the interior was massive.  I would estimate the total size of the object to be the size of a football field.  I make this assumption because it nearly spanned the entire roadway (4 lanes plus a turn lane ) as it crossed my path.  The strangest thing about my encounter was that as it floated by I noticed movement in one of the rear windows.  I cant say how many total windows there were on the craft.  In the one I saw into, it looked as if a person was moving from the inside towards the window to look out in the general direction of me and the police officers car with its flashing lights. I didnt report this story initially to anyone except I did tell my friends and my now wife the next day after my sighting.  About 3 years later I happened to be watching the Discovery channel and saw a documentary that had several police officers from Ill. Talking about witnessing the same object on the same day a few hours after my encounter.  I have since given my statement to a local videographer  (WWW.DBARKERTV.com) who did some interviews with Melvin Knoll, and the P.O. in Illinois.  Mr. Barker has recently done a video interview with me as well about the incident. I contacted Ill P.D. and they told me the officer who saw the object was now dead I&apos;ve never seen my account published except on D.Barkers site.((Report received by Missouri Investigators Group.

I made my morning coffee and went to let my dog outside. I am a smoker, so I was sitting at my patio table having a cigatette. The day was clear. The sun was shining. There were a few clouds in the sky, but most of the sky was blue. It was like any other morning. I heard the bus pick up students for school and leave, after that, it was pretty quiet, just a few crickets. I don&apos;t think I would have ever noticed the UFO, if it had not been for the jumbo jet I heard coming from somewhere in the sky. I automatically looked up to see it. The jumbo jet came from the front of my house, which is the East. My patio set is in the backyard, so i couldn&apos;t see the jet at first. What caught my eye was a very large rectangular shape. It was perfectly rectangular, had no wings on it at all and there were also no lights on it as well. What I thought was so strange was that it had absolutely no sound. Its color stood out because it looked very shiny against the sky. Almost a whiteish greyish color. I could still see it completely as it passed the few clouds in the sky. It was moving very slowly in a very straight path from South to North. I could still hear the jumbo jet getting closer and I wondered if the pilot of the jet would see it as well. As the jet approached it looked as though the 2 would collide. The jet was coming from the Southeast to the Northwest. I thought to myself, &quot;Some air controller is going to get his warning for the year.&quot; I waited to see what happened. It looked to me like the jumbo jet just made it under the rectangle. The rectangle never swayed, it kept its same path and speed, as did the jet. I watched the UFO keep its path South to North. The jet, I think, would have probably landed at the Atlanta Airport. As the object got closer to the North, I could barely see that it had a very small bubble on the East side of the craft. It was just enough for me to know that it, on the other side, was not perfectly rectangular. I smoked my whole cigarette, watching it the entire time. I lit another cigarette and kept watching it. I noticed that the jumbo jet was so far away that I could no longer hear the noise from it and it was quiet again and I still heard no noise from the rectangualar object. There was no trail behind it. As I looked at it in the sky, I figured that it was about 1 inch long and somewhere between 1/4 inch in height, maybe alittle less. My dog had no reaction to it at all. I watched it until I could no longer see it. The only time it was not above the tree line and in clear view was when it was going to the North  and getting farther away. It was still visable enough to see the small bubble on the East side of the craft. I never thought to go inside and get my camera, although I had PLENTY of time to have gotten it. I am so sorry that I didn&apos;t snap a picture of it, but the thought never came to my mind until my boyfriend asked why I hadn&apos;t. I could have had 100 pictures of it because it was moving so slowly.As for my background, I am a homemaker at the moment. Engaged to be married and have been in Acworth, Ga. for almost 2 months now. We moved from Clarksville, TN. due to my boyfriends job transfer. I am a woman, 35 years old and have a 13 year old son.

I had beem working steady with very  long hours, six day a week for over six years-, in a large lumber mill as a computer tech and electrician., previous employment as a Electronic Designer and Engineer. Now I&apos;m a rare divorced dad, with  full custody of three children.  So I asked them where they would like to go, &quot;lets get Grandma and go to Salt Lake City as she always wanted to see it&quot; was the unanimous desician , my Olds Cutlass Supreme was a great road car and in perfect condition so it was loaded with camping gear and ready to go!  Sunday morning after Church off we went, up to Hat Creek for the night and in the morning down to Reno, after seeing the town then drove out to Winnimmucca, Nevada for  a late lunch, continued driving to Salt Lake City where we stayed for the night.. We saw the Mormon Temple and Temple Square and all had a good time. After sightseeing I remembered a lake campground east of Salt Lake City so we went there, a lot of fun!  That evening there was a bad storm warning  for late the next day,on the radio. We left early. We decided to drive to Pendleton Or,  and while there stocked up on some really neat clothing!  How about Portland, down the Columbia river, we went to Meryhill, WA., where the stonehenge replica stands--We were having a great time,  and all the above detail is to show our frame of mind. While driving from Maryhill on the freeway {84), I was thinking about the Hanford Atomic facility somewhere to the north, as we were headed west.  Grandma said &quot;Look at those three funny airplanes&quot; , looking north,  I saw three, black, triangular objects, above the other side of the river gorge, headed our way, and grandma and kids were talking with great excitement!  Suddenly, as my eyes were on the road,  everything quit working, engine, dash lights, radio, CB, so I  coasted over to the side of the road--wondering what&apos;s going on ?  Next thing I knew, I was standing in front of the car, wondering what I&apos;m doing out here, Gradma and the kids, in the car &quot;were looking at me like what are you doing out there&quot;? I got in the car, started up fine, everything working,  except the dashboard clock--we all acted dazed and dis orented--we decided to stop in the next town and get something to eat--and then continue on and see the dinosaurs at Fossil Or, that excited  everyone, so we stopped at a drive in at The Dalles,The Man In Black!  While munching our burgers and fries, the hair on the back of my neck stood up as if some one was behind me, I turned around and this Man was sitting two tables away, not eating but just staring at us, nothing was on his table and I sensed danger!  I stood up and walked over to him, he was thin (like a person that had rickets), olive-brown skin, coal black hair and beady eyes framed by bushy-black eyebrows and pointed chin!  Black shoes and suit, white shirt--feeling this was unreal asked &quot;May I help you with something?&quot;   He shot back crisply, &quot;Where are You Going&quot;? Feeling very uneasy I stated &quot;going to take the family down to Fossil, and see the sights&quot;!   He replied, in a low but distinct  voice, &apos;DO NOT GO DOWN THERE, THINGS BIGGER THAN HOUSES, COMES  IN OVER  TOPS  OF THE TREES, !&quot; With that he stood up and went out the door,  stunned, I went back to our table and discussed the events of the day and it dawned on us that some how we were unable to account for three hours  of time, and then this weird guy,  Then we all saw him drive very slowly by the side glass door of the diner, in a very black- highly polished utility truck.

And was quickly out of sight.  Everyone was quite upset again!  I  mashed the gas  pedal  up to 80 and let it roll, quicker out of there the better!  Again that black car, with that stern face passed us again,  Panic now, find a place with people, Grandma found Dechutes State Campground on the map just ahead., quick right turn, and there standing by the side of the road,  was that strange man.! This Is Nuts!! Shaking, I quickly found a camp site near the bathroom, removed my 30-30 from the trunk, and stood guard the rest of the night!!!

It was quite shiny but I felt that to be reflection from the sun as it was a nice clear afternoon. After watching it for about 30 secs, I was distracted by my dog for a couple seconds and when I looked back, it was gone. It was flying a very straight and rather slow path going E, NE  out over Lake Michigan. First thing that struck me as odd was that it disapeared before it should have judging by the speed. I should have been able to see it still, I only turned away for a matter of a couple seconds. Then I realized that I heard absolutely no engine sound. As I was looking up yet hoping to spot it, a plane did come my way. I heard the engine sound before I ever saw it. And I felt the plane was way higher than the craft I just saw, judging by size anyway. We also have alot of seagulls in our area, but as I watched a few of them fly around, it was obvious there was no wing activity from the craft I saw. It happened very quickly, and I&apos;m not at all sure what I saw, but I figured if someone else saw this then maybe they would post it here.", "Bright starlike object slowly fades at initial viewingWhile walking the dog early A.M. on Friday 9/16/05, I periodically looked up at the sky, as it was still dark with stars out and the barest tinge of purple on the eastern horizon. The sky was totally clear, no clouds. I was walking west on a rural road so viewing conditions were unobstructed. After one of many glances upwards, I looked back down and out of my peripheral vision noticed a light on my shoulder as if from a light source similar in intensity to a full moon. Knowing the full moon wasn&apos;t visible at that time I looked up again and in the same spot I had just observed I noticed a bright starlike object, roughly halfway between Mars and Orion (locations of both later confirmed with Sky and Telescope interactive starchart for date and that time of morning). It was white, unmoving, silent, brighter than Venus, and as soon as I looked at it, the object began to fade from view.  The light I noticed on my shoulder makes me think it was even brighter before I looked up. It seemed there was a slight haze around the object as it faded and it was completely gone within 10 seconds.  I watched for at least another minute and saw no other lights or objects in that spot. I kept looking up to that area every few seconds while I continued walking but saw no further objects. If not an unknown, then conventional explanations might be a glint of light off a coincidentally perfectly positioned satellite, an orbital SDI test, or a supernova from light years away that I just happened to glance up at the perfect time for - there go my lotto odds.  Any explanation for this?", "Bright white light emitting circular beam fills horizon over Mingus mountains5 degrees above skyline over Mingus mountains looking west from HWY 89A 5 miles from Cottonwood coming from Sedona and almost in line with Jerome night lights a white silver beam of light appeared that first seemed like the searchlight of a helicopter except the light was more dense and powerful. The ray that span northwards soon had a very clear and distinct edge to it as if the light had an edge. That edge was defined and perfectly circular. I stopped the car to see if the object in the sky was moving. The light source seemed to be gradually and slowly shifting to the south about horizontally, ie. away from the beam that was emitted. Over the next couple of minutes the beam kept on growing  until it encompassed the whole horizon to the west, forming a perfect half circle in the sky. The source of light then suddenly vanished, as if it extinguished itself rather than disappeared, leaving a clearly defined wake or line in the sky where it had traveled. The half circle filled with light kept on expanding and loosing its intensity over the next few minutes. Over the horizon above Jerome the same glow of silvery light could be seen for a while longer with streaks or strands of cloud like substance. In the Verde valley over Cottonwood an unusually bright and white light also shone, filling part of the valley. These last 2 observations did not have the outer light definition described in the first occurrence. I went back to the same spot where I had observed this phenomenon the following night to confirm the 2 sources of light, one over the horizon above Jerome in the direction of Prescott valley and above Cottonwood could not have beeen attributed to light pollution from these cities.The most remarkable aspect of these observations were the intensity of the light(s), the clearly defined circular edge of the beam and its expansion into a full half circle across the horizon. I had a male passenger in the car who witnessed the same as I did and several vehicles stopped along the highway to observe this ocurence. The planet Mars was also above the horizon that night and the source of light moved just below it before disappearing. The whole phenomenon lasted about 15 minutes. No photos were taken but I will email a sketch of what I witnessed.", "((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the possibility that the witnesses may have been looking at celestial bodies, and probably twinkling stars, would have to be ruled out, before we could conclude that they were looking at genuine UFO&apos;s.  PD))Four objects with red/orange &amp; green flashing lights sighted near Florence/Killeen area in Texas.My husband observed two sets of red/orange &amp; green lights in the western sky.  He became very curious and watched them very closely, when suddenly they started zig-zagging each other.  He ran into the house and yelled for the rest of us to come out, and by the time we got outside the one object that had been zig-zagging around the object farthest west, had moved due north and was stationary there over the next hour and a half to two hours, while the object in the west stayed there during the same time period.  We live out in the country, and it is very dark.   The sky was very clear, and these objects in no way resembled stars or any other aircraft.  The orange and green lights moved constantly and in varying directions.  At times, it appeared that there were &quot;bolts of light&quot; being shot between the orange and green lights.   This was visible to the naked eye, but even more so through binoculars.   This object moved very little, but over the course of the two hours, it eventually became lower in the sky and appeared to be &quot;landing&quot; somehwere, for lack of a better word.  We jokingly mused amongst ourselves that they were landing at Fort Hood, which lies in that direction.   About an hour into our observations, our daughter shreiked &quot;there&apos;s another one!&quot;   We turned around and saw an object identical to the others, but this one was in the eastern sky.  At that, my son thought it might be a good idea to check the skies all around, and we heard him shout from the back of the property that he saw another one.   This one was in the southwestern sky, was much closer, and much brighter than the others.  Neither of these objects appeared to be moving at all, but they had the same orange and green lights that appeared to shoot bolts.   We went back to focusing our attention on the first western object because it appeared to be the most &quot;active&quot; one.  It was then that we all noticed that it appeared to be &quot;shooting&quot; other smaller objects from it, all just appearing to us as bright lights.  These went straight down.   As an aside, I must mention that my husband is a very skeptical man, but he was made a believer last night.", "More &quot;Phoenix Lights&quot;My wife and I saw and filmed 4 very bright amber/yellow lights that were moving very slow to the south of our location. We are investigators for I.C.A.R.(International Community for Alien Research) and we were doing a follow-up on a sighting report that someone else had made when we saw these lights. The objects we saw were under 1500 feet in altitude. They did not change altitude or move side-to-side. There was no sound that we could perceive from the objects and there were no blinking or flashing lights that you would associate with any conventional aircraft. The lights moved slowly to the south and then went out one at a time. There was a family of 5 who had pulled over along the road near us and they spoke with us after these lights went out, asking us if we had seen the lights too.

Were they were man-made or terrestrial?There were 3 circular objects high in the sky on Sept. 24th 2005. The objects gave the appearance of planets far away, not stars.  They were too close and not as brilliant white or aqua color as stars.  In fact they were light yellow to my eyes while to my wife&apos;s eyes they were red. When I first noticed them I was sitting at my computer working on some music.  My computer desk faces a window out the back of my home.  All of a sudden out the corner of my eye (left) I noticed this bright light.  It just appeared out of nowhere!?  So I looked at it for a few seconds trying to make out what it was....actually, waiting for it to move.  Nothing!   So I ignored it a few more seconds then took another peek. THENNNNN, I called to my wife to come take a look at this and to bring me my field glasses.  My curiosity and imagination got the best of me at that point.  I wanted my field glasses because have good magnification.  I can actually see the surface of the Moon pretty good on a clear night with these field glasses (binoculars :-&gt;).  Oddly, these objects weren&apos;t THAT far away where I shouldn&apos;t be able to get a clear image come in but my field glasses could NOT focus clearly????  To me that&apos;s TOOOOO strange?   Why?   All I could focus enough to see was that the objects were circular; there were 3 of them all-together, and each had a very light-yellowish appearance to it.  I could also see clearly how they were positioned in the sky. They were positioned about southwest of my eyesight while I was facing west.  The larger circle was centered between two smaller ones both about 1/2 its size.  What was more interesting was that the larger object seem to emit a very, very faint white (or yellowish) beam of light that stretch upwards and downwards while the two smaller objects emitted lights pointing at 45 degree angles up and down from their left and right sides.  Meaning, the beams of light formed a V on its side (&quot;&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;&quot;). I wasn&apos;t going to spend my whole evening watching this thing but I have to admit my curiosity got the best of me.  I kept peering out the window every 5 mins or so.  At points I would actually watch for almost 5 mins straight! It was compelling!  There seemed to be no explaination of what it was or why it was suddenly there.  I was actually waiting for some government surveillance planes to surround it. There&apos;s my answer! LOL!  What I did see were at least 2 planes (ours, doubtlessly) pass by in the same &apos;spectrum grid&apos; (if I may).  I say &apos;spectrum grid&apos; because the sky is HUGE and we all know how the eyes can play tricks on you while trying to tell how far apart 2 objects are.  What might look like a few feet away could actually be miles!   Anyhow, the lights weren&apos;t stabalized.  It took them about an hour to move out of my sight, northwest.  Watching it move across the sky was no different than watching the moon or sun rise and fall.  If these objects were UFO&apos;s then my suspicions is that they weren&apos;t in our atmosphere at all!  In fact, I&apos;m thinking the &apos;controller&apos; of these lights were probably in outer space using some laser beam, or something.  That&apos;s not fiction!  It could actually be true.  I say that because I&apos;ve read so many stories where people have referred to UFO&apos;s as &apos;dancing lights&apos; in the sky.  Well, I can make that happen too!  Give me a LASER BEAM! LOL!  Seriously, If we can do that &apos;dance&apos; here on Earth with laser beams and project them FARRRRR AWAY then why wouldn&apos;t an extraterestrial!  Well, enough on opinions.  Fact is, the lights didn&apos;t dance but did raise a curiosity in me because they weren&apos;t normal to the eye. I hope that wasn&apos;t too detailed. :)  Thx!

The sky was clear and stars were clearly visible.  I noticed a bright, golden light in the sky.  The light did not blink.  It appeared at first to be a quickly moving satellite or other object moving in a linear fashion from the East Northeast to the South Southwest.  It was travelling at a relatively high rate of speed for its apparent height and traveled across approximately 66% across the sky when it stopped.  The light remained stationary for a period of a few minutes when another light, smaller and bright white appeared to make a short hook out of the golden light and streak off at an extremely high rate of speed to the Southwest. After a short time, the golden light appeared to travel in a dithering mode which appeared to vary the location of the light in both altitude and orientation.  Following about five minutes, the smaller bright light, or another which resembled it, sped apparently close to the golden light.  The golden light gave short quick chase and the smaller bright light disappeared.  I kept expecting that the golden light would leave the area, as the dawn began to brighten the sky considerably.  However, the golden light persisted until approximately 6:50 a.m. MDT, when clouds advanced and obscured view of the golden light.", "Bright object in sky changes direction in a split secondWhile outside in the backyard with my dog, I had noticed that the planes were flying pretty low as they were heading into Philly. I watched them for a bit as they slowly made their way to a westerly direction and the airport. I happened to look to the south and saw a bright object, that I thought was a high flying plane, moving at what I thought was pretty fast for a plane. I moved a bit to the grass taking my eyes off of it only until I moved and the object that was once moving in an easterly direction was now moving in exactly the opposite direction. This was my first experience with something like this and almost doubted what I was seeing until I thought it through and realized what it was that I saw. After the object had changed direction from E to W it continued in the westerly direction until it was obscured by the trees in the neighborhood and I could no longer follow it.", "Blue Star object seen hovering above auburn then dissapears.We were driving down the road as I looked out into the sky and saw a huge shining blue object.  When we arrived and got out of the car and noticed that the clouds were moving behind it and that it appeared to be moving slightly (hovering)- yet it still looked like a huge star.  After standing there for and hour we went inside.  I came back outside about 10 minutes later and the &quot;star&quot; or &quot;ufo&quot; was gone.  I saw some kind of dark plane with only white light fly by very low and fast to where the ufo was.  It cirled the location for about a minute.  Then all the planes lights went off and within seconds I saw the plane again at the altitude of a commercial plane flying east towards Georgia.", "pyramid-like/triangle un-identified object - colorful lights, only three - seems to be moving - Hayward, CaliforniaThis was taken a while ago, I was interested in getting some pictures of the moon itself.  When I uploaded the pictures onto my computer, and looked over them, it was then that I realized what was so unique about two of them.  A friend of mine claims they  might possibly be helicopters... but I don&apos;t know, I immediatley thought UFOs, basically, because I -want- to believe it is one. From what I see, it looks like a pyramid almost; with lights on every corner.  It was about a few months later that I came upon a television program on the Discover Channel (?) about a similarly described UFO in (Bermuda?) I can&apos;t remember.  but it did creep me out a little..  In one photo, it looks as I first described it; in the second, it looks as if I caught it while it was moving, and three little beams of color or almost.. shooting? out of it.

My girlfriend was driving, and I was slouched in the front passanger seat, looking out the windshield.  I saw a large, intensely white (at least it appeared white compared to the dark surroundings) ball of light fly through the sky, parallel to the road, traveling in the same direction as the car.  The light was travelling incredibly fast and appeared to be rather low to the ground, as it was out of sight within one second (however, my range of vision was limited, as I could only see it once it became visible through the windshield, rather than directly overhead). By the time I could react it had vanished into the trees. My immediate thought was that it was some very large comet that had passed through the earth&apos;s atmosphere and was waiting to hear some deafening boom.  But I never heard a thing over the car radio. My girlfriend claims that she did not notice it, which does not surprise me, as she was a bit tired and concentrating on driving, as well as the fact that the light disappeared almost instantly from view.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

About a minute after observing it my wife said,&quot;look a shooting star.&quot;  We watched an object fall roughly under the moon in the horizon.  It was a ball with a tail that did not taper off like a typical shooting star.  It was like a flare that is used for broken down cars.  It continued to descend,and I said, &quot;oh it looks like it is going to fizzle out&quot;, when it stopped and there were four orangish lights shaped like a crescent moon but were sitting like a frown.  We watch as the four objects shimmered (moving not the light) in a diamond. They were in a diamond shape but it would be like if took a football and sat it on the ground and went from end to end and top and bottom. They moved in unision keeping the same spacing between each other the whole time. They moved side to side and up and down.We watch but trees repeatedly blocked our view.

While friends and family members have had very vivid UFO sightings, this is only one of two sightings for me, but this was the most vivid experience that I have ever had.  I have never heard of anyone seeing an object like this until I read about something eerily similar tonight on your web page (sighting dated March 23, 2004), so I thought that I should maybe share this. I can not remember the exact date, but I clearly remember that it was between 13:30 and 14:00 hours. I was traveling down a long, straight road that usually has frequent activity, like plenty of birds, squirrels, cars, deer, wind, etc.  It was a lovely, crystal clear afternoon and my windows were down. Halfway along, I realized that there was total stillness - no breeze, animals, cars, nothing. I slowed the car from around 55 mph to about 20 mph and began actively looking for signs of life.  There was NO movement except an airplane very high in the sky until I noticed, in a separate part of the sky, an absolutely perfect, shiny, smooth, seamless, metalic silver sphere at an undiscernable altitude. I slowed down even more and tried very hard to evaluate what as going on here.  My mind kept trying to make it something, like how the mind will fill in the gaps for a cartoon strip without conscious effort. I calmed myself and tried to just take pure data.  I couldn&apos;t pull over because there were no shoulders, but I used the tree horizons to establish a spacial context for myself and the flying object. That was when I began to see the true peculiarity of this object. Fundamentally, it was flying in a straight line, maybe a very slight curve, from west to east. But what I saw was a display of confounding physics - the object appeared to be going very, very slowly but it was gaining sky-ground quickly. I tried hard to determine if it was jumping, coming in and out, but no - it practically looked stationary, but it would have suddenly moved a good sized distance. I feel almost unable to describe how strange this was, how clear but confusing. This unnatural physics disturbed me more than it&apos;s unfamiliar and very captivating shine and shape.  I kept my eye on it. When I arrived at a spot where I could pull over, I stopped the car, still watching it, slowly opened my door, kept watching, got out slowly (still no birds, cars, or even a breeze), had it with my naked eye for about 3 seconds and then it vanished. Just there then gone. I continued to watch the sky for about 1 minute and then there were two cars, birds started flying, and then I realized I could hear all the usual, daytime sounds where before there only had been that very still, stifled silence.  Life came back into action.  Everything went normal. The stillness and silence lifted like a frickin&apos; blanket pulled off.  I felt worried that I had lost time, so I checked when I arrived at the library. I don&apos;t think I lost any time, but if I did, it was 15-20 minutes at most.For me, what was most striking was the crystal clear day, the seeming simplicity of the shape, and the bizaare accompanying stillness and silence, like time had stopped.   What confounded me and convinced me that the entire event was a UFO sighting was the peculiar and unexplainable physics of the object&apos;s non-motion/motion across the sky. I felt remarkably clear-headed and calm for the remainder of the day, which I also found a bit bizaare. Why I&apos;m reporting it now is because I just read, for the first time, that someone else saw perfect, shiny spheres on a crystal clear (exact words!) afternoon.  This struck me.  Same shape, same conditions.  So I wanted to add my experience.  Thank you for collecting the data.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "Cigar shaped oject over Crystal Lake, IL with one red and several white lights hovering slowly then faded into space leaving a trailI can&apos;t remember the exact time (about 10:30), but I looked up in the sky because I thought I had seen a shooting star in the corner of my eye.  I saw what looked like a star moving across the sky about as fast as you&apos;d see an airplane moving.  I kept staring at it because I did feel a bit odd about the situation.  Something was telling me that it wasn&apos;t an airplane.  As it moved slowly, it looked as though it was coming closer, or becoming larger.  I knew this because at first I could not tell what shape it was, but as it was getting closer/getting larger, I saw that it was a cigar shape.  I couldn&apos;t tell if it had a top.  It also had red and white lights.  Here I saw the sequence of lights like this:  1   2   3   4   5  5 was a red light.  It was flash, then 4,3,2,1 would flash one after the other.  Not at the same time, but in order from 5 to 1.  Left to right, then start over from left to right again.  I couldn&apos;t tell exactly how many lights it had, this is just a description.  It only had one red light though. The UFO never got any closer than how high a normal airplane would get.  After about 3-4 mintues--just enough time for me to process what I was looking at, it just flew off and left a tail like a shooting star would.  It looked at though the craft went up and out, not across when it took off.  It tail of light had a sense of depth, not just a flat line across the sky.  It faded into space is how I can describe it.", "Our nieghbor was sitting outside his house talking to his sister when the sky (North East) became white, then there was a circle white/rainbow/red squiggle in the sky that seem to be moving across the sky.

I live in a nearby area of Pasco County and this recent report may have been most likely a military aircraft.  I say this with a fair amount of confidence because, two years ago, I was commuting home from work at about 18:00 hrs in the summer on Interstate-75 heading northbound to Pasco County, FL. I was caught in a traffic jam and remained stationary for a good 20-30 minutes. Out of nowhere, I saw a black sliver of something floating over the interchange where 1-75 merges onto I-4 East to Orlando.  I then stared at it for a few seconds more and I struggled to make out what it was.  As it got closer, I then realized that this is a B-2 Stealth Bomber gliding over the interstate to my right hand side at about an altitude of perhaps 100 feet! It was a startling sight. I had my car in neutral and i bolted out of my seat in excitement and stuck my head out of my sunroof. I saw it make a graceful arc and bank in a westerly vector towards Tampa Bay. I believe it was on final approach to land at nearby MacDill AFB. This aircraft glided by and made no noise (over my engine noise), i was able to get a dead-on side view of it and I could even make out the pilots helmet as the sun glared through the cockpit glass. Thats how Low and slow this thing was. If I had not been looking out to my right as I was sitting in traffic with nothing to do, I would have missed it completely.

I wasn&apos;t playing well, and looked up and asked for help from the heavens, and noticed a star that was moving.  It looked like a regular star and it was directly above us.  We ar right under the flight path for Hartsfield-Jackson airport, so I KNOW it was not a plane, it wasn&apos;t even taking the flight path.  It moved east, made a slow turn to the north, back to the east, blinked three times, shot a little red light to it&apos;s right side, and blinked off.  In this time, we ran from the back yard, to the front yard, because of trees blocking the line of sight.   As we were returning to our game, I saw a bright light in the sky through the trees to the west, we saw a large orange/red light.  That changed from orange to red to orange.  it was moving slowly to the west, and at first, it was really bright, and then it blinked off and on, but when it turned on again, it was dimmer than when it had started, it kept getting dimmer and dimmer, and before we lost sight of it, it turned red.  it was too bug to be a star or plane, in fact, we saw several planes pass in front of it which were higher than it seemed to be, but looked much smaller than the light.

In our search for adventure, we cruised through a grave yard on the edge of the city limits and near the local airport.  I was the driver, and as we explored the maze of graveyard lanes, my friends began seeing glowing white and red lights.  One of the girls in the back seat was nearly hysterical in directing me which way to drive so as to avoid the lights they were seeing.  I believed their sightings to be the late-night imaginations of ditsy teen-agers. I never saw what they were describing until, as I exited the cemetary, I stopped the car to &quot;call them on their bluff&quot; of seeing strange lights.  I parked along the road&apos;s edge after turning out of the cemetary driveway.  It was then that I saw, through my open drivers&apos; side window, a red, soupcan shaped, glowing object - the color of a reflector for driveway entrances. It was positioned about three feet above the ground, over the grassy ditch portion of the corner area where the cemetary driveway met he road. It didn&apos;t register for me that it was glowing of it&apos;s own power - not reflecting light from my car&apos;s lights. I thought that a reflector was exactly what it was and opened my door to prove it.  As soon as my leg moved to step out, the objct took off.  It moved quick and silent. The cylinder shape was traveling so that the cylinder was verticle in relation to the ground (like a bar glass slides accross the bar to the customer - not horizontal like a thrown spear).  It moved parallel to the groud and to the road. It glided at a steady and fast speed remaing about three feet above the ground. I was so startled and frightened, I slammed my car door closed and drove away as fast as I could.  Even though I drove in the same direction as the object traveled I did not see it again. I wasn&apos;t looking for it. I was watching my gas gage at nearly empty and was trying to drive to get away from it.  I have wished ever since that I had not been so hasty in my get-away.  I wish I had taken more time to watch it and find more clues about what it was.

I do not know how long previous to that they had been visible.  I was advised of the lights by a family member who had just arrived home by automobile.  The lights had been visible to the family member while driving east on 151st St. between Route 45 and 94th Ave. (approximately 5/8th mile north and &frac14; mile west of and 5 minutes from home). From that location lights were in southeast sky  Following are my observations:  The three lights were approximately 40 degrees above the eastern horizon.  For comparison they were about the same distance above the horizon as the star Belelgeuse was at that time. I am 6&rsquo; tall.  With my left hand and arm fully outstretched, when the south (or right) light was lined up along the right edge of my pointer finger, the north (or left) light was lined up with the left edge of my middle finger. The southernmost of the three lights was due east.  The northernmost light was about the same distance north  of due east as Betelgeuse was south of due east. The lights were of a brightness similar to that of the anti-collision lights seen on commercial broadcast antennas. The color was similar to that of the red LED on the tape recorder I was later making notes into. The planet Mars was much higher in the sky, almost due south and almost overhead.  The lights were much brighter and much, much redder than Mars. The lights pulsated, meaning the brightness varied, but did not disappear.   Pulsation was independent of other lights. The lights were equidistant from one another. From a drawing I made during the sighting, the lights were at an angle of about 45 degrees from the horizontal with the south light being the &ldquo;high&rdquo; light. When I first sighted the lights, the middle light was slightly out of line with the other two lights, being slightly above an imaginary line drawn between the two outer lights.  The middle light slowly drifted closer to being in line with the other. As a whole, the group of lights was almost stationary, with just the slightest drift to the north. A commercial type airplane flew from north to south during the sighting, and appeared to be between me and the lights.  I am very familiar with the commercial air traffic in this area due to our being under one of the approach paths to Chicago Midway airport.  What was unusual was the altitude of the aircraft.   The aircraft was at the low altitude that I normally see inbound craft at while in the approach pattern to Midway.   The aircraft was heading south, away from Midway.   Southbound craft are normally much higher in the sky and under full power.   Perhaps he had been asked to take a look. The sky was exceptionally clear.  In the Chicago area you do not get nights this clear very often, usually only in the dead of winter.  The weather at Midway Airport at 0053 Oct. 1, was 58 degrees, clear, SW 9. Although I assume totally unconnected with sighting, family member did see white meteorite trail in sky almost overhead going south to north during sighting. During the sighting, I observed a neighbor looking out his second storey window.  I verified that he also had lights in sight.  He also confirmed this later in the day. Family member and I agreed that we would maneuver by automobile to get a better fix on location of lights.  We went inside to collect cell phone, police/air scanner, tape recorder, etc.  Another family member stayed outside to observe.  By the time I came back outside lights were gone.  Family member who had stayed outside had seen lights disappear.   We did drive around the area for a while but were unable to reacquire lights.  Did not hear anything on scanner concerning lights.(NUFORC Note:  All reports of the two sightings (23:15 hrs., 30SE05, and 01:10 hrs., 01OC05) from Illinois will be passed along to Dr. Mark Rodighier, Director of the CENTER FOR UFO STUDIES, Chicago, as well as to Mr. Dave Marler, State Director of the MUTUAL UFO NETWORK for the State of Illinois, who will pass them along to his Field Investigators in the Chicago area.

What initially appeared to be a bright star, quickly turned out to be something quite different.  Although a considerable distance from my point of observation, I could still make out a bright, pulsating white light, accompanied by distinct red and blue. While, at first it seemed to hover in the same spot, it suddenly began moving in short, erratic bursts of speed in all directions. I first noticed around 2:25 A.M., and it&apos;s still there at 2:50. I&apos;m not aware of any terrestrial aircraft capable of such maneuvering; and while I&apos;m sure that it can be &quot;explained&quot; by some logical means, those of us who witnessed the object had never seen anything like it before.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that a celestial body would have to be ruled out, before we could conclude that the witness was observing a genuine UFO.

While driving I just happened to notice that there were no other cars on the highway going north or south except me. There were no lights on the road nor any house lights on either side of 167 because it was mostly farmland and pastures. Then all of a sudden I saw this bright green sphere shoot down in my vision.  It was right in front of my truck. I could not tell how far away it was but in my view it seemed to be about the size of a quarter.  It was really bright green, almost fluorescent colored.  Its shape had a band that wrapped around it like a tootsie roll lolly pop. It stayed the same shape as I continued to drive. I was going about 60 mph. I quickly looked around to see if there were any type of vehicles or lights coming from the side or anything that could explain this.  But there was nothing remotely similar to this object.  Then as fast as I saw this object it took off into the sky almost straight up in a split second.  I tried to track it but it was too fast. After that I started to see vehicles on the highway going north as though there was a break in the regular traffic.  Then vehicles  heading south appeared in my rear view mirror.  It was almost like I was the only one who was allowed to witness this object. I never told anybody about this until a few months later. After that I started having dreams of something chasing me. The dreams lasted for several weeks then stopped.  I haven&apos;t seen anything like that again or have had dreams of being chased.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was rejected because I could not give an exact date or even the year. I knew that it was in the winter and I knew the time because of a meeting I was going to that meets at 8pm. regularly. However I was unsure of an axact month or even the year.  I knew it was between 2001 and 2002 and it was in either January or February. Upon speaking with a friend about UFO&apos;s and about my experience,I have re-thought the date of my siting.  I believe that it was in January of 2001, to the best of my recollection.  Anyway, that is my best guess. That is all this reporting site has asked me for, so if this report is not accepted then I will not try again. I was surprised when the report was rejected because I could not give an exact date, especially when I seen a report from a man who claimed to see UFO&apos;s in the 1970&apos;s  with no specific dates of the sitings. I found the reply to be insulting, particularly when this site is supposed to be looking for reports from people.  I am not looking for any special recognition or for anything for that matter, accept to be believed, however, if I am not, than so be it.  With all this said I will report what I seen one last time. I was traveling down Main Street in Salisbury, heading to an AA meeting, of which I had been a sober member for many years at the time and still am.  It was just before 8pm and I was just going to make it on time because I was running late.  I noticed that the street became suddenly and very strangely deserted, even for a street Salisbury, which is not a large city.  I felt a very errie presence that I find hard to describe. I did not know where it was coming from. Somehow I felt that this presence was around my car and felt that I could not shake it even though I was driving and was in motion.  I looked around in all directions but saw nothing.  I knew there was a definate presence though.  Finally I looked up to see, directly above me, a saucer. I stopped the car immediately and it stopped as well.  It then took off in a slight foward motion from my car and angled upward where it dissapeared into the sky at lightening speed.  I remember seeing it become smaller and smaller until it dissapeared into the sky.  It was a metallic blue/silver color and had an aura about it.  The lighting about it appeared to fluctuate, although there were no actual lights on it or that were coming from it.I could not tell how large or small it was or how close or far above me it was, only that it was above me.  My guess is that it was closer rather than further away and that it was not particularly large. Well, that is my siting report and that is what I had seen.I have never before or since seen anything like that.

While looking for the aircraft by sound I saw two bright lights that did not fricker or change.  They were around 1000 feet altitude and had no sound.  The lights had no sound of helicopter rotors or other identifying sound.  I watched them move from west to east.  The lights were constant and not flashing.  They were not in a flight pattern or holding pattern. They were about 5 miles distance from my place.  There was one that was going straight and then made a 90 degree drop of about 200 feet.  The other was ahead of it.  The dropping light then tappered off at around 800 feet and then the other did the same thing.  Both were in a circular pattern of west to east to north.  I then saw them both rise at the same time to about 1000 feet.  I continued to hear the jets sound of AB&apos;s but the sound was coming and going in a direction opisite of the lights.  The lights were bright glows that stayed constant.  I lost sight of the lights in my tree line in a east, north east direction.  I have been around aircraft using full abs before and these lights were not helicopters nor the jets using ab&apos;s.

I first saw the object out of the corner of my eye.  At first, I thought it was a star.  But, I noticed it was moving very slowly.  Thinking it was an airplane, I watched it.  But, it was moving too slowly for an airplane.  And, it did not have any of the warning lights common to an airplane.  The object moved very slowly from north to south.  It was moving in a straight and level manner.  It did not twist and turn at all.  As I watched, the object slowed down to almost a stop.  At that point, I was convinced it was not an airplane.  After about 10 or 15 seconds, the object sped up to its original speed.  It continued to travel south for about another 20 seconds.

My Cousin and I were fishing on the Huron river and I was admiring the evening sky. I saw what I thought to be a satelite, very dim,red-orange, moving slowly at high altitude, almost exactly from west to east. Aprox. two seconds after I first noticed &quot;the satelite&quot;, another appeared next to the first. The second one was the same color as the first, only slightly dimmer. Almost as soon as the second object appeared, it encircled the first, one time in a counter-clockwise direction,  and then the two objects split up. The first, having changed it&apos;s course only slightly, continued in an easterly direction. The second bolted south and disappeared. The two objects seemed to be at their brightest when they first appeared toghether, then got dimmer from then. I watched the first object moving east, until it was too dim to see.  This whole event took less than five or six seconds, so my Cousin didn&apos;t get a chance to look up in time. However, we both noticed five aircraft, also at pretty high altitude,(too high up to hear), flying fairly close together, following the same flight path the first object took. When I say fairly close, I don&apos;t mean in formation, but they were too close to be commercial aircraft. The aircraft flew by about one minute after i lost sight of the first object.(following perhaps?)", "Low flying, silent, muted white lights on a chevron shaped glider2 adults and 1 8 year old girl were walking on a bikepath in Boulder, CO, coming home from dinner.  I spotted a swift, silent, glider-ike object flowing through the air at a very low altitude (less than 2000 feet).  It had 5 &apos;lights&apos; on it, in a zig-zag shape arrangment.  The lights were not spotlights, typical airplane lights, nor were they flashing.  They had a muted glowing quality, almost like a white/yellow glow in the dark look.  The 5 lights, I assumed at first were all on the same craft, but the far two lights wavered and moved closer together and then assumed the original shape again as it glided out of our sight.  It was very low and very large, a fist across when held at arms length.  We walked on, in amazement talking to each other and a voice on the path said, &quot;Did you guys see that?&quot;--our neighbor Alec had seen it too and he had planted his self down in the middle of the bike path.  He had noticed it when he said the 5 or 6 lights were seperate and only after they had moved apart and then converged did they take on the glider like/chevron shape when we had spotted it.The reason I am reporting this is not only my interest and excitment for UFO&apos;s but also that I saw the same thing less than a year ago, I was also in Boulder.I called the Boulder Municipal Airport the following morning askng if their were gliders up in Boulder County that previous nights, the man informed me that all gliders are grounded prior to sunset.

I am an electronic (Retired) technician and know what I am talking about.In the evening of April 25, 1966 (I am getting a lot older and want to leave this information with someone), at 8:25 pm over the city of Reading, PA, I witnessed the most beautiful sight I have ever seen.The weather was beautiful, a cloudless sky with the sun just having set in the west.  We were on daylight saving time.  The temperature was about 74 degrees with no wind and 100% visibility. The sighting lasted from 3 to 4 minutes.I don&apos;t know what made me look up into the sky in the east at the right time but the object was at about an 80 degree angle and was a green fuzzy ball.  It descended in an arc, much like that of a rainbow. First seen it was at an altitude of about 5000 feet.  It stopped at an altitude of approximately 1000 feet at a distance of about 10 miles.  Its decent took only about five seconds.  When it stopped at 1000 feet about ten miles away it started towards me at a very slow speed.  It took about 4 or 5 minutes until the object appeared over my head at about 100 feet at 85 degrees. I had a fantastic view from beginning to end and did not take my eyes off of this object until it was out of sight.I sent a report to MUFON and never really heard anything from them.To make a long story short I will now tell you what it was that I saw without going into any more detail. It would take me too long to put all the information here.This object was clearly a vehicle that emitted electro-magnetic beams of energy which could be seen quite clearly in the form of lines of maxwell, which are magnetic lines of force.  Completely silent, the object was &lt; &gt; as you see here.  It was 10 to 12 feet high and 30 to 36 feet long. It moved from southwest to northeast at approximately 15 to 20 miles per hour.One might ask how anyone can see a magnetic field!!  Simply, the spinning of the object was the key to the force of the field which made it visible to the naked eye.  I could go on and say much more but I will not.I believe the government is misleading and knows and if they don&apos;t they better soon know the truth about this beautiful and wonderful invention.I have several theories which I will not divulge at this time.It was real, I am real, and I hope people will come to realize the truth", "strange light seen in christchurch skies possible a UFOwell on 09/21/05 in Christchurch, New Zealand in the north in the sky, what i saw was a light, i was looking up at the sky and it was the only thing i had noticed. i thought it was a star and i had then carried on txting someone on my phone, i then looked back up at it and had realised it had moved quite far away, i started closely looking at it and realised it had a orb like glow around it and was moving! i couldnt keep my eyes of it so i jst kept staring, the movement of it was up and down and side to side, and as i was looking at it i noticed it was too low to be a star but then noticed it was too high to be a plane but i knew it was in the atmosphere, the light also on the object runed around every once in a while aswell which i thought quite strange as if it were spinning in the sky. later on i went to look at it again as i went inside to contact people about it and such, i then returned out later and it had disappeared keeping in mind that there were no clouds in the sky. exactly a week from that time i saw the same thing in the sky, but i then noticed there were 2 other lights in the sky but one happend to be a helicopter and one was a small aeroplane, they were both circling the area where the light was but after i had seen the helicopter lights and aeroplane lights the the &apos;ufo&apos; had gone.it has not been a week since the last sighting but im hoping it will return again on the 10/05/05.", "A 100 foot diameter,disk shape, dome top.

I have no way of knowing what they are doing here and hope they are not like us who needs to kill others to sustain and grow by nature.", "light dancing over holliday flordaat about midnight last night i went out side and saw what appeard to be a bright star but as i watched it i noticed it moving not like a satalite of earth but independently, doing what we could only discribe as &quot;manuvers&quot; such as 90 degree turns acellerating the goin the opisit direction with out slowing or turning, getting brighter and dimer to the point of dissapering one time&lt;not behind clouds&gt;and i must note it moved across other stars and then back and i used multipiul points of refrance to make certin i wasent my self goin crazy.i then got my neighbor and my girlfriend to come watch it with me and assure me i wasent crazy.  we watched it for about an ohr or so before giving up on getting out the teliscope wich was packed in a closet to tightly to get out.", "I have utmost respect for Peter Davenport and his attempts to categorize and document UFO anomalies.

We both looked up to see a very bright white light moving quickly from the south to north directly overhead. The light was steady, with no flashing or other colors.  After about 3 seconds the light suddenly dimmed to the brightness of a semi-bright star, then after about 2 more seconds went out completely.  We continued to watch that portion of sky for the next couple of minutes, but no other lights appeared.  There were no aircraft in that area, and this object made no sound.  There were no trails behind the object, and it moved much faster than typical aircraft we are used to seeing, but not nearly as fast as a shooting star.", "Mysterious Lights that seemed to have landed and taken off againI was lying in bed watching the 11:00 clock news, when I saw some bright white flashing out of my double window which faces the south. At first I thought it was the tv glaring off the window because it isn&apos;t covered with drapery or blinds, I watched for about 10 seconds, then I got up and went to the window. It was very cloudy and dark so I could not see an object, just the lights. It appeared to be 3 or 4 bright large white lights that were flashin with a small red one. Since I had on no clothes I went to my closet which is next to the window grabbed my robe and went on the back porch which is only about 15 feet from my window(faces the southern sky). I turned on the poch light and saw that the wind had began to blow and at the same time the lights faded as if the object was lowering. I didn&apos;t see anything else so Iwent back to bed. I was so startled by what I had seen I kept an eye out the window. At 11:21 pm I saw the same lights in the same spot as if they were rising. I ran to window so fast that it woke my husband and he came to the window also, although still half asleep he saw them also. They stayed very low near the tree tops for about 20 more seconds then ascended to far up for me to see. By this time I was too scared to look from outside on the porch, so I cannot tell which direction they went. I know that this was not a plane because it was too low and stayed in the same position for too long, it was too close to have been a helicopter or I would have heard it.", "Triangular  low-altitude, slowly gliding, lighted object came over our home outside of Marana, AZI wish I had reported this when it happened, the time and date would be accurate....didn&apos;t think to report it til I saw a program on Discovery.  The night this happened, and I&apos;m thinking it was mid to late August, 2004, I was sleeping in our rv because of remodeling our home and I woke to use the bathroom.  I noticed out the bedroom window a light not normally seen and kept watching it.  The light was yellowish almost like a street light.  It was coming from the n/nw at a very low altitude and a very slow rate of speed....gliding regally, would describe it. I watched as it came towards our rv; this vehicle had to have been black as it did not reveal its triangular shape clearly til it was nearer the rv I was in. The light was round, flat, and, as I saw,  set into the bottom of the vehicle.  This light was steady, never moving or changing...quite big and seemed to be in the center of the vehicle&apos;s bottom.  The odd thing about this light is that you would have thought it would light up the ground, but it didn&apos;t.  I opened the window to listen, but there was no noise.  The vehicle came on and as it approached our rv to go over it, I could actually see the bottom of the vehicle, that&apos;s how low it was.  The bottom had the round light pretty much in the middle and molding around it but the molding was shaped in triangle form.  Sort of like if you drew a star and then drew a circle in the middle...I saw no other lights.  It kept going at that same regal pace over our rv and on into the night in a s/southwesterly dirction as far as I know.  I have a physical disability that prevents me from walking so I couldn&apos;t get to the other side of the room or go out to photograph this.  I wish I could have as I could have at least got a shot of the bottom of it. I probably wouldn&apos;t have bothered to report this, except I have seen two other unusual things in the sky lately, so mate said I might want to keep track.  There was also a program early in Sept of this year on the History Channel showing a sighting in Belgium that had been reported at some time, and I thought it was similar to what I&apos;d seen.

I was  walking with ny nephew when we saw a bright light in the sky near our home.  It was following the hill that was located behind our house,then stopped and began to hover over a field on the hill.  We walked to the area carrying flashlights to find our way through the woods.  When we got to the field, we saw tht the light was above the treeline on the other side, and was fairly large.  We signalled the light with our flashlights and to our amazement, the light reacted by flashing, then changing shapes (pyramid,star,square-as if it was some kind of laser-light show). Then it returned to its circular shape and began to glow in a purple light, until the whole field was glowing purple also. We noticed what appeared to be some kind of entities coming out of the top of the globe, and they were gesturing at us with their arms. Then one came out of the globe completly and floated down until it stood in front of us.  It was shaped like a human, but was made completely of the purple light-like a hologram-and had no facial features, fingers on its hands, and wore a long robe. We tried to communicate with it to no avail, so I reached out my hand in a friendly gesture, and the being reached its hand out and put it on mine.  I felt no pressure on my hand, no feeling of a presence at all. We then noticed these four red blinking lights appear around the field, surrounding the field on each side.  One moved to the large  glowing purple globe then back to its position.  I had glanced up to see these lights and when I looked back at the being in front of me it was gone.  Apparently I had a lapse of memory once I touched the creatures hand, because I learned later from my nephew that the entity had floated back to the globe once the red light moved out of its position. I do not remember this happening. Once the being of purple light was gone we began to get very cold, and got a strange feeling of paranoia, like there was something else in the filed with us that we could not see.  So we went home rather quickly at this point. We found our dog hiding in the woods, it had ran off when the being floated down from the globe. I reported this  incident to MUFON, who sent mr hartinger from RUFOS and two other guys, to interview us. This incident was also published in the MUFON journal. Has anyone else ever had contact with this type of entity? Ive heard of the greys,blues,greens, but purple light???", "Bright Lights Above Port Richey.The object remained in same position in SW! At about 50 degrees in the sky.  It appeared as solid white light and then appeared as three white lights. I am an amature astronomer so I know it was not a planet or star.  Mars is the brightest planet visable now and it is in East and is not bright white.  It also doesn&apos;t change to a different configuration.  I am a member of the Slooh astonomy group and also have taken several pictures of the moon so I have a good understanding of what is in the night sky.  This was not anything normally seen in the sky. This is te second time I have seen the object.  The first was two days ago (Tuesday) in the same position about at the same time.  There were other small aircraft in the sky but much lower than the unidentified craft. At times the lights (Very biright) were white at times yellow.  Please visit my astonomy website to see some of my pictures.((e-address deleted))", "6 disks  look like white lines  in skyI looked out over Lake Winnisquam at 6:30 PM and saw a white line against the blue of the afternoon sky. It held its straight-line features and didn&apos;t disolve like a cloud or chem trail would. It hovered at an angle then slowly went down below the trees in Sanbornton. We were able to count 4 more appear and slowly go down the same way. A 6th white line came UP from the trees in a different area and slowly took off going up. Through binoculars we could see soft blinking white lights on the tops and underneath these crafts.  I think the reason we could see them was the setting sun causing light to reflect on them, when normally they can&apos;t be seen during the day.", "we just saw a big flash in the sky on the eastern horizon , when we looked up the only thing there was a  line of smoke like if a airplane had gone by , the only thing is that  there were no airplanes , the smoke line stayed there for about 10 minutes , the flash od light was very intense , so we though maybe other people saw it too.", "Huge formation of blinking lights over lakeAt 9:15 PM I spotted 2-3 blinking lights slowly fly over Lake Winnisquam, from Belmont, about 1,000 ft. up, headed north. As they came towards me, the crafts picked up speed and more lights were visible, it was hard to count them because they flashed quickly, not in unison, 8 or 10 lights, they made no noise. I called my husband and 2 friends that were out night fishing.  The 3 were in an area where they were better able to see the lights and get good descriptions of the crafts. One witness described, &quot;I saw 5 moving simultaneously objects that all maintained perfect formation.  They moved so quickly I knew they weren&apos;t aircraft.  The V formation had 8 or 9 lights and used up a huge area of the sky.  Each ship had an intense orange light shooting up into the sky. When the orange light was on, there was no blinking white light. The flight pattern would change, like geese flying in formation, when the first in line backs off to let another move up to the front.  We could see the lights for at least 5 minutes.&quot;  The 2nd witness stated, &quot;There were lines in the light when it flashed, directed up, I could see the outlines of many ships and counted 8, but couldn&apos;t keep track of them.  Two would flash, then more would come, they would turn their orange lights on. I saw them from one side of the lake to the other.&quot;  He was able to see underneath the craft and made a sketch of it.  A view of the bottom shows a square craft with one large light off-set to one corner.  The 3rd witness said, &quot;I saw beams of light shine up, down, at each other.  There were quite a few.  I&apos;ve seen UFO&apos;s from a distance and was still skeptical, but this, there&apos;s no doubt.&quot; The 3 fishermen were quite spooked, packed up quickly, started the boat, and got back to the dock right away.  The lights were last seen going out of view towards Meredith.Note:  The 3 had seen many &quot;shooting stars&quot;, probably a dozen, earlier in the evening.  They had marveled at seeing so many.  This observation goes along with a theory of how the UFO&apos;s zip through the atmosphere so fast, entering and leaving, they look like shooting stars. They are usually seen around the big dipper.", "2 &quot;cotton balls&quot; of light on same course moving quickly East to WestI observed 2 balls of light, like a lightly illuminated cotton ball, moving very rapidly east to west in a mostly straight line with a slight course change, it was remarkable how the objects imitated one another during the course change as it did seem through paralax that the objects were indeed separate and not a reflection or refraction of one another.  I was looking South/Southwest when I observed the objects moving from the East passing just under the main body of the constellation &quot;Aquila&quot; and passing through the constellations tail section. No noise was heard.  No paranormal or abnormal phenomenom was/were associatated with the event. The light emitted was nothing spectacular, no colors, no dimming, a very pale white light.  Apparently, the objects were about the size of a dime at arms length(1/2-1 degree). Distance and actual size of the object is very difficult to determine as object had no discernable features, however my best guess as to distance would be from 500&apos; to maybe 2 miles tops.  This event was immediately recorded with time, date, direction, and location being absolute.

I was intranced by what I saw and in my mind it could have only been a jet plane.  It was down so close to the trees that I could make out what I thought was bolts or rivets in the outer metal of the plane. Not until later did it occur to me that planes were all grounded and that as I stood watching it I heard no sound at all! Then I realized that I could not say for certain that what I saw was actually a plane.  It was very large but I saw no windows of any kind and no wings.  Just a lot of metal and bolts or rivets and it was moving slower than I would have thought a jet could move and it did not disturb the trees or have any kind of tail that I could see. It has taken me this long to report it because I didn&apos;t want to appear crazy or labeled a crank or something.", "Bright and huge star-like object in the sky during mid-day hours. On May 23, 2005 beginning at 12:00 PM, 5 people including myself observed an unusual daytime object (almost star-like yet comparable in size to an enormous planet near earth at its closest point) emitting radiant light (correlative to reflection of sunlight shining off a mirror) in the daytime sky.  Our location when we saw the light in the sky was at Orange Beach, Alabama on a condominium midway through construction.  The condominium is located nearly directly in front of the Alabama Point bridge which I estimated the distance between the bridge and the condo to be approximately a mile in distance.The whole observation began when three people and I took our lunch break at exactly 12:00 PM on the condominium&apos;s balcony that was facing southeast on the first floor.  I tended to my lunch,  devouring the tuna-fish sandwich that I had made in the early morning, while the other three people began consuming their meal just a few yards away from me.  While attending to my lunch, I was wearing my polarize sunglasses and glancing towards the Gulf admiring the scenery of the barrier island&apos;s surroundings.  It was extremely hot and humid that day which also set a new temperature record for that day.  I believe the actual temperature was 98 degree F, and with the humidity factored in, the temperature actually felt like 115 degree F.  Because it was so hot and humid that day, the surrounding area had a slight haze in the air which is typical for hot, humid climate.   The sunlight seem to be especially intense that day for it was extremely bright and challenging when seeing without the aid of sunglasses.  Thankfully, there was a slight and gentle breeze from the Gulf  to briefly cool us off just a tad now and then.  While glancing around at the surrounding area, a brilliant light in the sky captivated my attention.  I said nothing to the others just yet, but I just dwelled there in awe scrutinizing the light to see if it would change direction if it was traversing the sky.   I didn&apos;t want the other people to think I was seeing a UFO until I rule out all possibilities of what the light may be.  There was some clouds in the sky, and few times, the clouds would pass in front of the light in the sky, yet the light still shined through the clouds seemly almost unhindered.  The light was just barely off the left side of one of the three, huge condo that was on the barrier island.  In the line of sight of the light is a small island that has some pine trees on it.  That was one of the reasons why I didn&apos;t spot the light in the sky at my first glance of the surroundings.  The light seem to just suspend over the Gulf just between East and South East direction near the area where the torturous sun rise slowly each morning.  If you were to draw a line between the light and the condo, it did not cross the Alabama-Florida boundary line, but it was just between the two, tall pine trees on the island.  Between the two pine tree was a stubby tree possibly an oak tree.  I used those trees as a guide for any lateral movement in the light.  The light elevation may had been between 30 to 45 degrees off the horizon, but almost level with the condo&apos;s roof on the barrier island which was also leveled with the pine trees.  Thinking it may be a jet heading directly towards my direction with its lights on, I waited five minutes for any changes in direction, elevation, or intensity of the light, and I also listen for any sounds of a jet flying.  Since none of those factors changed and no jet sound could be heard, I disclosed to the other people of what I saw.  I guided them in direction using the pine trees as landmarks for the viewing of the light.  At first, both witness had some trouble spotting the light until their eyes adjusted and was able to see clearly the light.  I let one of the witness use my sunglasses, and he was able to see the light with no problems.  I asked the two witness, &quot;What is it?&quot;  Neither of them had any clear answers, but only possibilities of what the light may be.  There was another person on the balcony, but that person refused to glance in the direction that the light was being observed.  Both witness and I watched for another 10 minutes when three more people showed up on the balcony.  They were able to view the light and again I asked, &quot;What is it?&quot;  No one had any definite answers.  One person said, &quot;It could be a balloon.&quot;  Another person said, &quot;It could be a parachute ride.&quot;  Another person said, &quot;It could be a plane.&quot;  Another person said, &quot;It could be a planet or star.&quot;  Another person said, &quot;It could be kite.&quot;  &quot;It could be an UFO!&quot; I said because nobody could identify it.All the witness watch the light and discussing what it could be until our lunch break was over.  Occasionally, I would glance towards the light while we were working until around 1:00 PM, I could no longer see the light where it once was positioned exactly each time in the same area in the sky motionlessly shining like a bright, huge star.  My final thoughts, &quot;What was it I saw that day?&quot;", "A round overing craft over neighbors roof, emitting a roaring sound , observed fire like a jet engine beneathAt approximately 0200 my mother woke the family up and told us to look out her bedroom window.   All our bedrooms were on the second story of our house. My sister and I and my Father and Mother saw a large circular craft hovering over the house across the street.  The craft was about 25 feet above the roof of the neighbors house.  It was about the width of the house approximately 30 foot across the base.  I could look up into the craft and it was like the fire of a jet engine, roaring red and blue flame.  It emitted a sound like a jet engine as it hovered.  I watched it hover for about two minutes.  It then rose vertically for about 40 feet and then moved horizontally  to the left and slowly gained speed travelling horizontally for about 1000 feet.  After about 1000 feet on the horizontal it gained speed and altitude and was just a fast moving speck disappearing into the night in a matter of a few seconds.  I cannot figure out to this day what it was.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

It was cigar shaped, reddish brown in color and had no windows or lights that I could see.  There were round rivets on the sides and writing that looked similar to Egyptian hieroglyphics.  I looked in awe for about 20 seconds. I ran inside to tell my mother.  She was standing at the sink washing dishes.  I told her to hurry with me outside, that there was a strange thing in the sky I wanted to show her.  She took her time and finished the dish she was washing, dried her hands and came outside with me.  It was gone...

As children we have always had the unexplainable feeling of being watched and have always looked at the stars and watched crazy things in the sky but as children we thought that was normal.  As we got older everyone said we were crazy and left at that.  But on this night I have been convinced that they are the crazy ones.  We were sitting outside late at night smoking a cigg and we noticed an object getting extremely bright and close and at first we thought it was a plane but as it got closer we could hear no sound of an engine.  Suddenly it stopped approximitly two football feilds away directly above our heads.  All we could hear was the sound of a low humming and I got the strangest feeling I have ever had in my life.  My head began to feel very light and my vision began to blur and the only thing i could focus in on was the light above our heads.  I can only explain this by saying it felt like I was on some sort of crazy drug. I was both scared and excited from what I was seeing.  then just like that it was gone, in a blink of an eye just dissapeared. I just cant get over it.  I could see how it would scare some people because it is something that hasn&apos;t been taught to us, but I just like say if they wanted to harm us I&apos;m sure they could have done it a long time ago, but like any smart person knows violence in never an answer and I have the feeling that they are very intellegent. I always have dreams about them and I&apos;m sure some of you others do to, but in my dreams they communicate with my without speaking and inform me that the eld of our world as we know it now is coming to an end and we need to prepare for it and they say they have been here on earth for a very long time and do care about it greatly.  I get the feeling they care more about this planet then we do and that is very unfortunate.  well thanks for those who listen to my experience and share theirs as well.

For roughly 10 minutes it did not change position then it moved at a medium pace (under 400mph) what appeared to be several miles to the east never changing altitude.  The visual size of the object indicated it was much to high to be a helicopter and since it was hovering for several minutes it was not a plane, my mother in law thought it was a kite, but the distance it covered was much further than would have been possible with a kite even at high altitude.

As i came close to where i was going i seen some weird blinking lights in the sky, 2 would blink blue and the middle one was blinking red. I stoped an started looking at it closer, what i thought was the front but turned out to be the back looked like 3 oval shaped things starting small from the left getting bigger as it goes right. It was a blueish colour, at first that was all i could see untill everything started to blink. At first i thought maybe its a aircraft, but there was no sound and it was kind of slow moving. When it passed over top of me i could make out a triangle shape when it blinked. The blinking would start from the left on I guess a wing or a side of it, it was a blue blink, then it would go to the other side of it with another blue blink, then in the front with a red blink. Would go fast an slow ect, it got out of my sight so i kept walking, when i as walking down my friends street the last thing i saw of it was behind the houses an it looked like it was getting lower.

The first observation was from a location of Southern Avenue and Miller Road.  The lights were directly south and at my 3 o&apos;clock as I was travelling east.  The lights appeared to fade and intensify slowly.  The lights remained stationary in an inverted &quot;check mark&quot; position for about 5 minutes and then faded one by one.  At about 1910 hours the 4 lights re-appeared in a straight line, again about 10 degrees and at about 200 degrees from a location at 231st Ave and Watkins Street near Buckeye.  About 1 - 2 minutes later, 4 additional yellow-orange lights appeared at about 170 degrees (just east of south) and about 15 - 20 degrees above the horizon as viewed from the 231st Ave and Watkins location.  These lights were configured in a triangle (3 of them) and the fourth was directly above the peak of the triangle.  These appeared to be very much like the grouping west of there in that thy also were very bright, yellow-orange with very slight &quot;twinkling&quot; (probably due to atmospheric conditions that low in the sky).  About 2 minutes after the sighting of the traingular-pattern lights, the lights to the west that were in a straight-line configuration began to fade one at a time.  At about 1915, the traingular-pattern lights faded, one-by-one.  Approximately 5 minutes later, the 3 lights appeared in the same location as the traingular pattern lights.  The 3 lights were in an inverted &quot;L&quot; configuration.  After about a minute, the lower light slowly moved to the west until it was in an inverted triangle position. Then the right-most light moved left (east) and appeared to converge with the remaining light whose position remained unchanged.  This configuration remained about 5 minutes.  Another potential sighting was made about 5 minutes later, but after a minute or so did not seem to be the same as the previous sightings (i.e., not as bright, did not fade in and out, and was almost white)....also one of the suspected lights we believed to be an airplane.", "Slowly rotating car tire shaped object (no hole) rotated slowly 100 feet off the golf course surface, had port holes.It was summer around 1972 or 1973 and my father who was an ex-NASA employee from the late 1960&rsquo;s (satellite designer) called the whole family outside to see something. My dad, mom, brother, sister and myself all went outside.  Hovering above the golf course 200-250 feet west of our house was a HUGE disk shaped object.  It was actually shaped exactly like a car tire with no center hole. Since it was dusk what we were watching was actually the black silhouette outlined in the brighter evening sky, rather than seeing the clear surface of the object.  The object spun slowly and moved back and forth in a straight line while traversing in a searching manner away from us.  It had already passed over our house and was moving away westward.  As we watched it became apparent there were round port holes all around it every 4-5 feet or so.  They appeared to be about 12-14 inches in diameter.  It seemed like every other one was red or yellowish-white. The object was about 60 feet in diameter and about 6 feet thick and rotating slowly as it slowly came back east toward our back yard. Its height was no more than 120-140 feet off the ground (perhaps as low as 100 feet).  I remember thinking I could hit it with a rock. It did not wobble on its axis as a balloon might but was perfectly controlled like a wheel spinning on an axle.  It moved very slowly (perhaps 5 mph) and came right up to the SW corner of our yard where it paused (about 60 feet away and 100 feet high) before it slowly started reversing direction to head back across the golf course toward the south side of Green Acres Terrace Circle which was directly west across the golf course from our house.  When it got over to the circle on Green Acres Terrace it reversed again and came back toward us but only came back until it was about 100 yards away this time.  When it reversed this time it went farther away and then came back toward us again but did not get as close as the previous time. I asked my father, &quot;Dad, what is that?&quot; He said, &quot;I don&apos;t know.&quot; I knew what it was; a UFO.  I told my brother to go inside and get my Polaroid camera. He said, &quot;YOU go get it!&quot;  The object seemed to be almost swinging back and forth as it moved in a kind of searching pattern back and forth across the golf course moving further away with each pass until it was gone within 15-20 minutes.  It was rotating slowly the whole time.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Methodist mountain separates us from the San Luis Valley which is famous for its many sightings. Its possible the crafts could be above the San Luis Valley, but it was hard to judge distance.  The 3 crafts zoomed all around the sky like nothing I&apos;ve ever seen.  I have been somewhat of a skeptic until that evening. What I saw was absolutely amazing and I could not take my eyes off the crafts.  I continued to watch the entire duration of their presence which was approx. 3 hours.  They seemed to be boomerang shaped or triangular. There are no aircrafts on this planet that could move like that that I&apos;m aware of. After they &quot;cruised&quot; around for a while, they all 3 took off high up into the heavens headed west and up, up, up until they were no longer visible.

Realative diameter would be the same as a dime held at arms length. the dark circle was motionless and appeared very suddenly in an area i had already been looking and did not see how it apeared it was suddenly just there. it was so dark and round with no light reflection that it looked like a literal hole in the sky. after about 20 or 30 seconds I witnessed a much smaller object move from the dark circle and move at high speed directly to the south. the smaller object was bright white or silver in color with a high ammount of reflection from the sun which was behind me. the smaller object moved to the south east untill it was out of site, i turned my attention back to the larger dark circle and it was still there motionless for several seconds longer, i took my eyes off of it for just about 3 to 5 seconds to attempt to use my video camera which I forgot i had next to me on the bench.  when I could not see the dark circle through the viewfinder I looked with my naked eye to make sure i had the camera at the right angle, but when I looked up it was gone.The dark circle stuck out very well against the blue sky which I had a good area of view of but could not see it anywhere, it was gone as suddenly as it came. and i regret I did not see how it functioned to come and go. was it a hole that closed up? or a craft that accelerated quickly or turned on some kind of optical stealth? who knows.the difference in size between the large dark circle and the small shiney object was equivalent to a boweling ball and a small marble", "2 bright lights over Brook Park OH  during home coming days  before fireworksWitnessed sighting during Brook Park Home Days before fireworks .We were sitting in front of Brook Park&apos;s fire station waiting for the show to begin. During this time I noticed a bright light coming toward us from the south and mentioned it to my wife saying to her boy that would be a neat sight to see fireworks from an airplane on this clear night. As it approached closer I noticed that it was much higher than I thought and thought this was a little strange, since we are close to airport you would see many planes run parallel to airport in the approach or  pattern for landing .But this was much higher and since I have no reference to size I am unsure of height a guess would be 30,000 -40,000 if it was airplane size.

Suddenly, another &quot;star&quot; popped into view and flew around the first &quot;star&quot;.  I completely ignored the Blue Angels and watched these lights.  About 10 minutes later, a red light came into view.  It was as if it just appeared out of thin air.  The three lights drifted around each other and soon formed a perfect triangle shape.  The triangle formation then moved to the South in perfect formation and moved over the Bay Bridge. The red light disappeared first, and then the &quot;stars&quot; seemed to rise higher until they were out of view.

The light was an incredible bright blue, and it moved so fast that we only saw it for 5 to 10 seconds. There weren&apos;t many stars, and the sky was very dark. My friends thought it was a plane, but because I fly so much, I know that no plane travels that fast, or has a blue light.

After a short conversation about the days events, my friend ((name deleted)) pointed to a cloudless sky and  told me that he learned about  the location and names of constellations in Science class and began pointing out the Little Dipper and the names of certain other star formations for me.  As our eyes were scanning the horizion,  my friend happened to notice 3 colored lights that appeared to be close by.  It was dark of course,  but I would estimate the lights to be about two miles away and about one mile high above the ground.  We were with-in 5 miles of an airport,  so the occasional appearence of multi-colored lights of small aircraft in the sky was not unusal,  and  we agreed that this is probably what the lights were and continued to scan the night sky looking for other interesting constellations. About 15 minutes later, my friend looked to the horizon again and brought to my attention that the multi-colored lights were still in the same place as they were before.  We naturally thought that this was very odd,  but decided that it was either another airplane traveling the same flight path or the same plane had circled and just happened to be in the same location that we were looking.  We quickly went back to obsevering the stars. Some time later,  about 20 minutes,  I happened to look in the direction of what we both dismissed as a airplane sighting,  and again,  in the very same place and of the exact orintation, I saw the same multi-colored lights.  I quickly brought it to the attention of my friend and together we tried to come up with a rational explanation as to why and how an object could suspend itself in the air in the same exact place.  I finally  came to the conclusion that it must be a helicopter,  but my friend reminded me that heliocopters are extemely noisey and it was a very quiet night with no breezes.  If the object was a helicopter, we would definitely hear the sound of the motor and rotor blades. We both became very puzzled,  and our attention was now focused directly on the object for about 10 minutes.  As we stared at the lights, I strained to make out some kind of outline or silhouette of the object, but I could not see any discernable shape because the object seemed to absorb what little light was available and blend into the night sky.  Just as we were discussing what this thing could be, it suddenly moved at tremendous speed to our left at a 45 degree angle, upward about 5 miles in the sky, paused for a brief second, and then shot straight upwards  to the very outer  stratosphere of the Earth,... then stoopped,  hovered,  appearing as a point of light for a second,  and then suddenly  propelling itself into deep space at an even faster speed than I had ever seen any man-made aircraft accelerate to. My friend and I looked at each other in astonishment,... all we could say to eachother is &quot;Woa&quot;,... &quot;What was that?&quot;.  The next day we told all are friends.  Some of are friends believed us,  but most did not.  However,  those that did not believe us, could not come up with an explanation either.  I am in my 50&apos;s now,  but I will never forget the experience, and the memory of it is still fresh in my mind like it happened yesterday.

The date is a &apos;best guess&apos;, as my grandfather (born in 1893) was a teenager at the time.  It could have taken place anytime between 1903 and 1913.Grandpa and his brother were hunting &quot;out in the woods&quot;, as they described it, somewhere in, or near, Adair County, MO.  They spotted a light ahead of them which appeared to be swinging back and forth in an arc.  At first, they believed it to be someone swinging a lantern, then decided that it was too high and the arc was too big for that to be the cause.  They ran ahead to investigate.  When they reached a clearing in the woods, they saw a large, metallic, disc or saucer shaped object hovering above the ground in the clearing.  I can&apos;t remember if my grandfather said that the disc itself appeared to be swinging back and forth in an arc pattern, or if the light(s) on the disc were moving in such a way as to cause this illusion.  I believe he also said it seemed to be emitting a humming noise.Shortly after they came into the clearing, the disc/saucer rose very rapidly, straight up above the trees with a &quot;whooshing noise&quot; and took off horizontally, at a great speed, disappearing from their view.  They walked to the spot, above which the craft had been hovering, and discovered four large, circular burn marks on the ground.I remember my parents and other family members talking about this incident when I was a small child.  Then, sometime in the late 1960s (perhaps as late as 1970 or 1971), my mother had purchased a copy of a National Inquirer with a photo of a UFO on the cover.  One day when my grandfather was visiting us, he picked up the Inquirer and said, &quot;This looks just like what I saw when I was young.&quot;  He then proceeded to relate the story to my brother and me.My grandfather was a man of high integrity, and everyone in the family who heard of his experience did not doubt for an instant that he was telling the truth.  The craft&apos;s shape, speed and flight behavior proove that it was clearly not a zeppelin, nor a balloon, nor any type of airplane which would have been in existence at the time.  I submit this in my grandfather&apos;s memory because he was so interested in finding out exactly what the object was.  It is also my sincere hope that relating his experience might help in the serious research of UFOs, if only to establish that a sighting had occurred in the very early 1900s.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

First I want to say I have been an amateur astronomer since 1972, or for the past 33 years.  I have seen many strange objects in the daytime and nighttime sky and have never seen anything that could not be explained, until now.  I also spent 20 years in the Air Force and know a little about what planes can do and cannot do. At 5:45 PM (East coast of US) I was in my yard looking for the planet Venus with 7X50 binoculars.  I was scanning the southern sky at about 40 degrees elevation when an object appeared in the field of view.For a second I thought I had spotted Venus but quickly dismissed this as it was moving and I knew I was observing too far to the left of Venus.  If I had not moved the binoculars left to begin another sweep I doubt I would have seen this object.I next thought I had picked up an airliner, as there is an air corridor over my house for planes taking off and landing in Charlotte, North Carolina.  I then dismissed this as it was flying almost perpendicular to this corridor and moving much too fast to be an airliner and I mean fast.  I have also seem all kind of small planes from the old bi-winged planes to you name it kind of planes.  Even high up you can hear their engines.By this time the object had moved from almost due south of me over into the southwestern sky.  A fair distance and I cannot estimate how fast it was going other than to say it was exceptionally fast.  I have never observed anything that moved at this speed.I hate the term &ldquo;Flying Saucer&rdquo; so I will say the shape was more of a blob shape.  At the speed it was traveling it was hard to hold the object still in the binoculars long enough to get a good look at it and the entire event was over in a less than 6 seconds or so.I do know it was not an airplane, at least none that I know of.  The speed was too great.  The color was a light gray and almost blended in with the sky.  I have no doubt if I had looked right at it with the naked eye I would never have seen it.  The object appeared to be at a fairly high altitude.  I heard no sound and there was no vapor trail of any kind and I did not see anything like wings sticking out from the sides.  No mater how high airliners fly I do not always see a vapor trail but I have always seen the wings.The sky was very clear and a dark blue color.  This may be the only reason I was able to see it.  If the sky were the usual pale blue or grayish color the object would have been invisible to the eye.If it had disappeared at this point I would have thought little more about it.  What happened next made my knees weak.I thought it continue on over the southwest horizon.  While watching the object in binoculars the object suddenly made a very quick and sharp turn to the right and accelerated in speed, then it was not there anymore.   It just disappeared.   If this had been any type of normal aircraft the pilot would not have been able to withstand the G forces from such a sharp turn at that speed and maybe not even the craft itself.Was it some type of craft that had no wings, maybe?  But that takes us back to the old &ldquo;Flying Saucer&rdquo; concept.Unless some nation on Earth has come up with an extraordinary aircraft capable of performing astonishing feats in the sky, then what I saw was indeed what I would call a true UFO sighting where the &ldquo;U&rdquo; stands for &ldquo;Unidentified&rdquo; of course.

It looked like a rusty ball bearing. It was hanging motionless at approx. 10,000 ft and was&apos;nt drifting with the clouds like a balloon would do.I decided to keep my eyes on this thing to see what happened.It hung there for about 20 min. until an airplane came into view from behing me flying in its general direction.  The airplane appeared to be approx. 5000 ft below the object and did&apos;nt seem to know it was there.As the airplane came nearer to being under the sphere the object began to move vertically and accelerated until it disappeared from view.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was definately 12:30 pm because I was readying to leave my home for the bank, which closes at 1pm.  Completely clear and sunny, no clouds, calm air at ground level. I never would have seen them but I paused to watch an eagle circle in the sky over the lake.  I saw 2 spheres, 1 behind the other, coming toward me from the south heading smoothly due mostly north.  They were the same color as sky, barely paler blue/gray, slightly pearlescent sheen.  I watched continuously as they approached and a small cessna style aircraft turned and slowly flew on general intercept coursetoward them.  I assumed the pilot saw them too.  The spheres veered slightly to the northwest, the cessna soon turned back toward the southeast and seemed to be flying slower than the planes usually do in this area (about 7 miles from Arlington Airport).  The spheres seemed to turn again toward the north, 1 behind the other still.  I ran to get my binoculars in the house, and saw the objects thru them when they were just north of my position.  No other details were discernable but for a slightly darker blue gray &quot;core&quot;.  They were close enough so that I should have seen details, such as appendages, balloon baskets, ropes/cables, but only a sphere was seen.  I am guessing they were 2 miles or less from me now.  The discoloration core was approx 1/4 to 1/5 the diam of the spheres.  I would guess the spheres were both approx 30 to 40 feet in diam.  Maybe about 5-10 thousand feet up, with no sound or light, definitely moving as fast or faster than small aircraft do in this area.  I watched until out of sight, 2-3 minutes worth.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I saw the previous red lights reported to nuforc on october 31st 2004, so I am always looking in the sky now for things like this. I was driving south bound on 80th avenue and 167th street when I noticed the red light in the sky moving north east. I was driving my automobile so I could not sit and stare at it as much as I would ahve liekd to. Allthough as I was sitting at the stop light of 80th avenue and 167th street the red light movered directly over me and my automobile. It was over my head for about ten seconds, steadily moving, and making no sounds. i continued to deliver my pizza to the hotel I was driving to. I continued to stare every 1 seconds from the red light in the sky back to driving, because I wanted to see it, but had to hurry. I entered the hotel, delivered my pizza, and exited the hotel in a hurry to continue to watch it as I was then done with work. When I came out of the hotel, a second red light apeared. the were moving at differant speeds, or differant directions because when I first saw the second red light it was about a 12 inches apart when looking in the sky. After a few minutes they lined up over each other, about 8 inches apart from each other. I raced home to show my girlfriend. She was home and we looked at them together from our home in tinley park. By the time I got home the red lights were far east of tinley park, but still very visable. We watched them move farther and fartehr away from us for about ten minutes before they ultimately burnt out in the night sky. the whole insident was about 30 minutes I would say. I would like to add again that me, my mother, my brother saw the last 3 red lights on october 31st of 2004 reported by many others to nuforc as well. My mother is a working class 9 - 5 tax paying citizen, my brother is a college graduate working in the news business, I am a attending college student, and my Girlfriend is an attending college student. We are all very normal poeple, no history of any psychotic behavior or any visits with phsyciatrist. none of us have ever seen any thing like these red lights before in our lifes. The only differances with these red lights and the ones from october 31st last year, is there was only 2 this time, and these seemed smaller to me in my memory, and last these didnt move around as much as last years did. last years seemed like they formed flight patterns, as these kinda just floated over our heads. If I ever see these again i&apos;m going to use my video camera on them.(NUFORC Note:  All reports of the two sightings (23:15 hrs., 30SE05, and 01:10 hrs., 01OC05) from Illinois will be passed along to Dr. Mark Rodighier, Director of the CENTER FOR UFO STUDIES, Chicago, as well as to Mr. Dave Marler, State Director of the MUTUAL UFO NETWORK for the State of Illinois, who will pass them along to his Field Investigators in the Chicago area.

PD))", "A stubby oblong/circular shaped UFO sighting occured over Newnan GA 40 minutes south of Atlanta.On the evening of last Saturday, Sep 17, 2005, I decided to go out to eat dinner at my favorite Chinese place in Newnan GA, a medium size working-class town about 40 minutes south of Atlanta GA on Interstate 85. I had just arose from a 45 minute nap, and felt relaxed, with a little grogginess from the nap. I left my home in the extreme north tip of Coweta County, driving South on Fisher Road. I turned right onto Hwy34 and started going West to Newnan GA. I arrived in the vicinity of Andy Lewis car dealership around 740 PM EST, which is in the eastern part of Newnan. I stopped at a stoplight there. This is a busy part of Newnan, and a busy time of the week, and there was quite a lot of traffic going both ways through the junction.While sitting there, at the light, facing West, waiting for the light to change, I noticed someting moving up in the sky. I could see it through the top portion of my car&apos;s windshield.  The movement caught my eye.The object would have been a little further North and West of my position.  It was about at the &quot;1:00 High&quot; position, using the old WW2 terminology. It appeared to be a couple of  thousand feet up. It was shaped with an oblong or short-stubby-cigar shape. It was moving from right to left (North to South), at a moderately slow rate. It did not look like a bird, helicopter, large plane, small plane, or anything else I&apos;ve ever seen. In disinct contrast with the hazy fading summer afternoon light, the object&apos;s color appeared to be a solid very dark or black color. I could not detect any patterns or lights on the object. Nor did the object emit any light, or any other extraordinary emittance. It was just up there, moving from right to left at a lesurely pace.I did see the object turn or sort of bank once or twice, and then its shape changed from the stubby oblong shape to a distinct circular shape, like a Frisbee or dinner plate. When it banked back the other way, I think I saw 2 stubby fins on the top. Due to its height, the hazy quality of the light, the objects extremely dark color, and my lack of binoculars, it was impossible to see any further details. I also checked my watch, and it was 7:44PM EST.About this time, the traffic light changed, and my lane had to move. I continued driving west. I did not see the object fly off, zoom away, or disapper, but my automobile reached the point where I could no longer view that part of the sky through the windshield. It was more or less directly over my position, at that point, and I could not see it. At no time did I feel afraid or threatened, just very curious.I continued driving West to Walmart where I withdrew some money from the ATM machine, and then decided to drive back to where I had seen the U.F.O., to see if it was still there. I did not feel afraid, or threatened, just very curious. By that time, it was 8:00 PM EST. I drove east, on the same road, looking out the windows and scanning the skys for the object. I continued looking for the object as I reached the point where I had been a few minutes earlier. I drove on past that spot, and kept on going, still looking. But the object had dissapppeared, and I never saw it again. I then made a U-turn, going on to my favorite Chinese place, where I enjoyed dinner. AFter dinner, I went home.My background? I am a 43, almost 44 year old, white, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant, unmarried male. I have a Bachelor&apos;s degree in a technology field, and have been in computer systems admin for about 19 years. Some people have called me a &quot;smart guy&quot;. I work a 40 hr/week job as a computer systems administrator for a major branch of the Federal Govt in Atlanta. At the time of the sighting, I was in a relaxed, typical Saturday afternoon frame of mind. I was thinking only of pulling out some money, and then eating Chinese.  &quot;UFO&apos;s&quot; were the **furthest thing** on my mind. I consider myself a &quot;realist&quot;; I do believe that many UFO&apos;s, perhaps most can be explained by a reasonable rational explanation; yet I also recognize a spiritual dimension that can manifest supernatural out-of-the-ordinary occurences and that cannot be measured with instruments.

I think it was a UFO.Somewhere in the early eve while sitting outside talking my friend and I noticed an object in the sky.It was a cool autum eve.As the crow flies it was about 1/2 mile away at the side of a large natural gas storage tank. It was silent and to my amazement it was all aglow and it seemed from where I stood that if there were molecules they were swirling around it.I think it was some kind of energy.  It did not apear overly large...maybe 20 feet in length or so.It hovered at the side of the tank, moved horizontally then it moved straight up to the top of the tank and then at the top of the tank it moved a small bit horizontally again, hovered and then shot straight up into the night sky and disappeared.It surprised me due to the precise movements it made.Almost angular.My friend ran home frightened but I was just in awe.To this day I wonder what I saw.Was there any UFO activity reported in the fall of 1960 or 1961 in the Buffalo NY area.Thank you.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I trned off the &apos;street&apos; light to better enjoy the moon.  Then i noticed it.....just about 1- 1 1/2 inches to the right of the edge of the moon.  My first impulse was to think of a plane.   but it had too many lights for a plane.  then it began to sink in that it was not moving. i reached for the binoculars and began watching it.   it appeared big.  it had either blinking or rotating red and white lights.  there may have also been some green but using the binoculars i would hesitate on the green.  there were 4 each white and red  lights. They were all in the same horizontal  plane....giving a &apos;cigar&apos;  shape impression.   of course they could have been rotating around something. it dd not move.   after a bit i began  to perceive slight movement in relation to the moon.....but  it was due to the moon  advancing.  The object was  stationary. after several minutes  a most remarkable thing began to occur.   the large object began to ever so slowly divide into two smaller objects......as if two attached craft were separating.   they ever so slowly parted until they were about an inch apart. After several more minutes they began to move &apos;outward&apos; from earth.  i say that because the elevation did not change in relation to me or the moon.   this caused me to believe they were going &apos;away&apos; from me.   I watched them with binoculars until they were out of sight, which was quite some time.   This also indicates they were moving &apos;out&apos; and away.  the elevation did not vary in relation to the moon.  I watched them for a total of about 30 minutes.

PD))", "Fleet of silver-ish cigar shaped objects, one appearing after another and then disappearing.Although I saw what I am about to describe a long time ago,  I can still recall it exactly, as if it happened yesterday.  I am by no means saying that what I saw came from &quot;outer space:&quot;  just that I have never seen anything like it before or since and that it was very strange and un-earthly.  And while I believe that there is a good chance that there is intelligent life out there in the universe, I do not particularly believe that it is coming here.  Furthermore, I am the type of person who needs to see proof of something that is so unimaginable before being convinced that it exists.  Not a skeptic - but not a believer either.  My mind is open. I am writing to you because I would like to know if what I saw matches the description of anything that anyone else has seen, or if there is an explanation for it.  Although there was another witness, I have not seen him for many years and we never really spoke about it afterwards, probably because I was facing the scene and got a much better look.  However, he definitely did see some of what I saw, so it was not just me. Anyway, this is what I saw.  It was around dusk.  We were sitting at an outside swimming pool area in South Miami-Dade County in Florida, which is about thirty five miles south of Miami and near the Florida Keys (and the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico).  I was facing south/southwest.  I was absentmindedly looking at the sky, since we were just sitting there and relaxing and not doing much else.  All of the sudden I saw a fairly large, cigar shaped object that was silver-grey in color.  It was very strange because it&apos;s not like it came from anywhere, it was just -there-.  The sky was relatively clear, and I should have been able to see it come from somewhere before it appeared in my view.  For example, if you are watching an airplane fly, you can see it coming from somewhere and then it is in front of you and then you can watch it go away from you.  But this object did not behave like that - one moment there was nothing there, and the next moment there was.  And it is not like I even saw it appear - it was just &quot;there&quot; if that makes any sense to whoever is reading this.  It did not appear like &quot;poof!&quot; and it&apos;s there, it just WAS there, where it WAS NOT before.  I cannot explain it any more clearly than that.  So it is in the sky and I am watching it.  It makes no noise at all.  Another strange thing was that it was hard to tell how high in the air it was.  It&apos;s as if it was both close and far away at the same time.  Overall, it did not seem to be very high - it seemed to be lower than a typical stratus cloud.  My best estimate of the altitude is around 1,000 ft.  Not being able to tell the altitude also makes it hard to estimate the size of the the thing, but I am guessing anywhere from 100 feet long to 300 feet long.  It did not seem to be larger than any airplane or blimp that we have on Earth.  It was also going slow, but not other-worldly slow (ie. too slow to remain in the air). However, speed  is also hard to estimate without knowing how far it was from me.  It did not make any strange or sudden moves, and moved in a south to southwest direction, as if heading towards the Gulf of Mexico.  It did not seem to have any lights on it per se, but it did sort of glow - consider that it was near end of dusk when I saw it and the sky was fairly dark.  It had no lights, yet I could see it.  So it must have been illuminated in some way but it was sort of &quot;hazy.&quot;  Now - I would probably have forgotten about this a long time ago and figured that it was something that was somehow explainable.  However - what happened next is what convinced me that I was seeing something -very- strange.  Just as the object appeared, so did many others.  First one, two, and by the time they were done there were around fifteen to twenty of them.  They -seemed- to be emanating from the first one and then flying in a slow formation.  They also seemed to be smaller, but of uniform shape and size.  The strangest part of this whole thing was that I could never actually -see- the new ones appear.  It was like the first one - it WAS NOT there, and then it WAS there.  It&apos;s not like I could see it come from the first one, or see it &quot;blink on.&quot;  I really cannot explain - even to myself - how exactly they came into view. After a couple of the new ones appeared, I pointed it out to my friend, who had his back to it at the time.  He saw about half of what I saw, I suppose.  So we watched them for a couple of minutes more, then just as strangely as they appeared - they were gone and I never saw them, or anything like them again. I expected to see or hear something about this the next day, but there was nothing.  Other people HAD to see it.  The only thing that could help to explain what I saw is that it occurred in the general area of Homestead Air Force Base - but these things were nothing like anything else that I ever saw come from the base (or anywhere else) and I lived there for almost twenty years. They were not searchlights, nor did they look like anything else that man has ever made.  And the way that they &quot;appeared;&quot;  I have never seen anything even remotely like that, anywhere else. That&apos;s my one UFO sighting.  I say UFO because as far as I am concerned, that is exactly what they were - unidentified flying objects.  I am not saying that they came from another galaxy.  I do not know.  It was definitely strange enough for me to write to you about it, around twenty-five years later (please note that the date of viewing that I entered here is very much approximate.  It happened sometime between 1980 and 1983, and probably closer to 1980.  The day and the month are a total guess - it was a warm evening, but we are talking about the Miami area and it&apos;s always warm in the evening). I&apos;d be interested to hear from anyone who has seen something similar, or who can explain this.  Please - only write to me if you saw either exactly what I saw or something very close - or if you think that you can explain what I saw, or if you are an investigator who wishes to hear more.  But I am not a UFO &quot;buff.&quot;  Thanks.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

I was on the phone to my girlfriend, enjoying the clear sunny sky. Whilst talking i was observing the small clouds disapating under the suns stress and glint caught my eye. I followed the object from directly above me, several times higher than the planes flying overhead, to the horizon to the east. The object was oval in shape and appeared white, but that could have been the sun reflecting at relative angles to my position. The entire duration of its flight to the horizon was between 6-10 seconds in length maybe faster, because I only questioned what my eyes were seeing after it had disappeared.

The object briefly hesitated about 3/4 way across the horizon and appeared to move more southward.  The object was a bright blue sphere that appeared almost transparent but also seemed to emanate light.  By size comparison, the object appeared to be the size of a full, harvest moon.  It is very difficult to determine the distance from the car to the object, but estimates are about 3 miles.  The observers were a male professional bank auditor; a female college student working for an environmental consulting firm and a professional chemist and quality auditor.  The female student reported this incident at her workplace and discussed it with the firm&apos;s meteorologist.  It was the meteorologists opinion that the object was a plasma ball or ball lightening.  The female thought this not to be likely as the object appeared to be quite perfect and manufactured rather than a spontaneous natural occurrence.

I looked back up to where it was, and it was gone.  Now the area where it had been flying was completely clear of clouds, and it is over marshes and bay, so there is no way it could have gone behind a building, now short of crashing in the water, which i&apos;m sure we would have heard, there is no way it could have gotten out of sight at the speed it was going.

I watched it for 5 minutes and realized that it was not moving in any direction.  This sparked my curiousity.   There are always plenty of airplanes coming and going from Maui but this was not one.

DEFINITLY under intelligent control. utterly silent.Lying down in a local park, looking at the stars, I witnessed what seemed to be a BOOMERANG shaped craft cross the sky directly overhead. The craft had no lights, but was quite large and easy to spot if one were to know where to look for it. Also the moon was just coming up over the horizon and was nearly full which is probably how I managed to see the craft, in addition to watching the backdrop of stars blink in and out as it traversed the sky. To get an idea of the size and scale I was looking at, extend your hand out above your head, and then create a distance of 3 or 4 inches between thumb and index finger.  The craft was definitly under intelligent control and moved from North to South/Southwest.  The craft was utterly silent. No sound whatsoever that I could hear.  It appeared to be dark in color, roughly matching the color of the night sky, though just slightly lighter and greyer. I watched the craft traverse the sky overhead in a straight line for between 8-10 seconds, until I could no longer make it out against the night sky.  Various other airplanes (with required lights of course) were in the area, as usual. None appeared to me to take notice. There are three possibilities for what it could have been. 1.  Could have been a glider flying at night (but I still think it was boomerang shaped) 2.  Black military project.  Stealth? 3.  Unknown craft guided by unknown intelligence. I had a similar, yet very different sighting about 7 or 8 years ago in october with a friend, of another silent craft that moved directly over our heads to the point that it filled half of the visible sky.

Before I go farther, I should mention that I have a private pilot&apos;s liscense for hot air balloons. Thus I have a very good idea of distances and sizes as they relate to airborne objects.  I am familiar with the airspace around the University.  We were laying on the pole vault mat, looking upward, facing the westward sky, and at approximately 10:45 pm (22:45) a large,  cigar shaped object descended from the cloud cover.  The broad side of the object was parallel to the ground, and what could be considered the nose was at approximately 80 degrees to the direction of travel.  Flying no more than 1000 feet agl directly over us, I could tell because the ceiling that night was 2500 ft, and flew directly over us. We were perfectly aligned to see it, as it flew between the moon, (~3 days before a full moon) and our position.  As it flew over us, I estimated it to be about 300 ft. long.  There was a faint purple aura around the margins, and it appeared to spin clockwise at moderate speed.  It appeared to be constructed from some sort of metal, and gave the impression of a brownish color. Moving to the east at roughly 75 mph, soundlessly, it passed over us and came to a complete stop.   At that point, it changed shape into what looked to be a boomerang.  At this point, it moved to the north, back to the west, hovered, would move to the south, then southwest, stop , hover and move again.  It appeared to be doing some sort of manoeuver.  Finally, it changed shape one more time and became a cube-like structure, it began moving to the east again very rapidly.  I was extremely disturbed by this image.  It then disappeared behind a building, and we pursued it on foot, but when we moved behind the building it had completely disappeared.Vincennes University and surrounding is a MOA, and there are scheduled dogfights with F-16 fighters regularly.  I know what these occurences look like. This was not one of them.  I notified the FAA, and was informed that the MOA just hours before was scheduled to be shutdown for dogfighting for the night.   At the last second, the dogfights were cancelled and the F-16s were grounded.  Not more than 1-2 hours after the figure had disappeared, the MOA was active again with airborne F-16s engaging in dogfights.Other people were present during the sighting, at least 200 yds away, but had no concrete view of the craft because the angle between the moon and the craft was wrong.", "UFO in Mojave DesertMy mother and I were driving from Arizona to my grandmother&apos;s house near Death Valley, CA.

No more than 30 feet above our car was some kind of object, gold in color and literally hovering in one spot.  It didn&apos;t move at all.  It was completely silent.  Oddly enough, I know this sounds stupid, it was shaped like a sperm! I swear on everything! The craft was smooth, no bolts, screws, or seams.  I know for a fact that the US military routinely tests new aircraft in the Mojave because of the ideal flying conditions.  This was just unlike anything I&apos;ve ever seen.

Range undeterminable.  Apparent speed varied from about that of a high altitude passenger jet to twice or more, usually with the lower speed for a distance followed by a high speed burst of from one to seven seconds. The short bursts were sometimes a few seconds apart; the longer isolated bursts were after a time at the lower speed. A passenger jet was crossing at crusing speed north of the area of observation for a speed reference. There were no audible indications of power plant noise, and no sonic booms, suggestingit wws out of sonic range.The observed object was operating in a traffic free zone. Acceleration - deceleration was almost instantaneous. Change of course was almost instantaneous, including 180 degree course reversals. Apparent altitude was mainly constant, except for shallow apparent dives during highest speed bursts. In the high speed operations, a hint of a wake or propulsion-generated whitish exhaust could be inferred, but this could not be confirmed.Observatons were from 2,200 feet in a residential area.

I was walking across an open field on a well traveled path between buildings.  There were between 5-7 other people on the path.  Someone pointed to the sky and we all saw a large metalic disc.  I knew we were all seeing the same thing because we were verifying what we were seeing at the time. It was very slow moving, clearing the treetops but not extremely high in the sky and easy to view.  It had a row of what could be decribed as &quot;windows&quot; or a variation across the middle.  I doubt they were windows, but I describe it this way to try to explain a different looking type of material around the middle area.  It moved silently and finally out of sight in about a 3 - 4 minutes period of time.We all just stood there transfixed, but verifying the details for eath other.  I remember looking at my watch to verify the time.  After it was out of sight, I continued toward my class and I remember saying to another person walking beside me...&quot;You know, no one will ever believe us when we talk about this... and no one ever has.&quot;   I remember these details well, as I wrote them all down at the time later that evening and drew a picture of the craft in a journal which I had for many years but have since lost.I only regret I did not get anyone else&apos;s address or name.

The lights were about 2 fingerwidths apart with an outstretched arm and of a magnitude of approx. -2 to -3. One light was behind the other. They shined for no longer than 8 seconds or so then faded out quickly.

Our camp was about 100 yard from the beach.  We were sitting around the campfire at about 11:00 when out of the corner of my eye I saw what looked like a bright star over the ocean.   When I turned to look at it the light grew to an enormous size and it was extremely bright.  If you were to take a nickel and hold it at arms length at about 45 deg into the sky that will give you a bit of prospective. I said to the kids &quot; What the heck is that?&quot;   As the kids turned to look, another light appeared right next to it to the right.  Not quite as big and bright as the first one but still pretty bright. Then another one, and another one and another one.  So hanging over the ocean were five balls of light that were lined up horizontally. Then from left to right and fairly quickly they went out one by one. I&rsquo;m thinking to myself let be logical about this.  It must have been a flare or something.  So we ran down to the beach to find other people standing by the ocean staring at the sky.  I immediately realized that the boats that were out off shore were very small compared to the lights we just saw and that the lights had to be at a pretty high altitude.  These were gigantic lights in the sky!  We walked up to a couple that was standing down by the water and asked them if they ad seen the light.  They said that they did and that&rsquo;s why they were there.  Then the girl said that this was the second time she had seen them. She said that the first time was a few minutes earlier up north of where we were. Just then it happened again down the beach over the jetty.  Same thing with the big bright light and the other four that followed.  It hung there for about 10 seconds and the disappeared from left to right again.  We all stood there looked at each other with no explanation. After about 5-10 minutes my daughter noticed two faint red lights coming right towards us from straight out over the ocean.  They were very tiny and silent and they went right over the top of us inland.   We decided that they were probably air force jets at I would say about 10-15 thousand feet   Were they doing something out there or chasing something?  All I know is that the small red lights were tiny compared to the other ones. Pretty Bizarre!

The sky was almost cloudless, apart from a sparse, almost mist-like covering, extremely high up.   At first, I thought the items were two aircraft travelling together, as is often seen, and the sun seemed to be reflecting off the planes. Then I realised that they were, in fact, stationary.  They also appeared far too high in the sky to be planes.  I called my husband to have a look.  He also observed them and thought that we should report it to the Airport (Birmingham flight path is above our house). I quickly took the binoculars outside to view the objects at closer range.  Through the binoculars I could see that both objects were flashing slowly from red to green to red, and so on. The two spheres were visible in the sky for approximately half an hour and then completely vanished from view. Although I have not previously taken a great interest in UFO&apos;s, my Mum is a subscriber to the MUFON magazine and a keen ufologist.

The lights would flicker, but not is any sort of routine.  The two lights were on an appx 45 degree angle from each other.  The third light that a few of us saw was on an opposite 45 degree angle, thus causing the 3 lights to form a triangle.

After about 5 minutes, 1 light seemd to just disappear then about 30 seconds later, the second light took off to the east in a rather high rate of speed.

We were at the new Hudson River Park on Manhattan&apos;s west side. I noticed six lights in the sky.  I noticed they were stationary and were at least 15,000 feet up.  Airliners were flying below them. I was looking north at about 2 o&apos;clock (angle).  Soon there were only four.  For the next 15 minutes I observed them, always stationary.  Two were bright spots, and the other two changed shape periodically.  One took the shape of half an elipse...Like a hang glider shape....pure light though.  This part is strange,...when I walked about twenty feet west, to the boardwalk, I could no longer see them.  I thought they were gone, but I saw them again when I walked back.  It seemed the reflection of the evening sun on the horizon and my location on the ground determined visibility.  I informed other people lying on the lawn of my observation.  I took a picture using a 2 megapixel FugiFilm camera.  We couldn&apos;t figure it out.  My wife and I left after 20 minutes...they were still there. It was very difficult to see the objects in the photo, but when I did an &quot;automatic level adjustment&quot; in photoshop...they are very obvious. In the picture there is also a dark object which we didn&apos;t recall seeing.", "My wife and I saw one of the more common UFO&apos;s that have been seen in New Mexico, Arizona, and other places. This UFO has been described as having several lights that are turned on and off, and described as being very large, square, pizza shaped, and very quite or silent. And capable of moving extremely slow for it&apos;s size.I saw the UFO up close and analyzed it closely to try and figure out how it was able to stay suspended at such a slow speed, and wondered how it was powered, and naturally if it was human.What I noticed first off, was that the body skin was made of dimensional metal that was riveted. This told me that it was indeed an Earthly craft. I then noticed a retractable landing gear that was in fact folded up under the wing structure, that I also see as being earthly in structure, shaped for a gear and tire setup. Then the two most telling and interesting features that I noticed was; the thickness of the wing and craft structure, the center fuselage and intake and exhaust louvers. These features, not only were all suggestive of human engineering, but explained clearly how the craft worked as it did. This craft was able to fly slowly and quietly because it was designed to use the very large wing structure as both a muffler for the internal jet engines, and as a source of lift, similar to that of a hot air balloon, by trapping the exhaust heat within that large thick wing structure, thus allowing it to fly very slow and quiet. In trying to guess the thickness of the wing structure from what I was viewing, I&rsquo;d have to guess that it was between eight and twelve foot thick, plenty of room for both the jet engines and the space to create the volume of heat storage to create the lift that was needed. My conclusion is this; Not only is this a human aircraft, but it is in fact an American made aircraft. In my opinion it was designed and built to fool the naive and the inexperienced, so as to stimulate fears within the American public for the intention of justifying research and development projects that would otherwise be deemed unnecessary. A way of continuing to justify some &lsquo;special interest groups cash flow&rsquo;. That is partly why this individual UFO effort is done most always at night, and when not done at night, then from great distances away from people&rsquo;s analytical view. Are we to believe that the American air space is this vulnerable to invasion? And if by chance this is the case, then we need to do something about that!  We should not allow our selves to be fooled by such ridiculous efforts. And we should cut all funding to those who are responsible for such antics. Our time and hard earned money should be spent on justifiable projects, not hoaxes. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. Though, I do not logically believe that any physical spacecraft could ever cross the vastness of the space between earth and it&rsquo;s closest star safely and within a reasonable and rational amount of time to justify ever doing it   with living creatures inside, because it would take at least 100 years at extremely unsafe speeds as we know them. A small pebble would pierce any spacecraft that we humans could potentially  build today, if able to travel anywhere near the speed of light which is only half as fast as would be necessary to even get close to traversing such a vast span of space. I could how ever rationalize potentially sending a very small, strong, highspeed craft that was projecting different types of signaled information, across our galaxy for the sake of it potentially being heard someday by another intelligent and more advanced planet, within our own galaxy, that possibly could sent something back directly at us to let us know that they are too. Don&rsquo;t think for a second that I don&rsquo;t believe in unexplained objects seen in space, because I myself have seen such phenomena, and absolutely could not rationalize what it was, that I was seeing. These objects or images were both viewed on clear nights without any apparent visual interference about 30 years apart. They were to far away to have a shape or visual image other than a single light source. They both were actually being see as faint stars that just suddenly seemed to start moving. Both changed directions several times. They both gave the appearance of extreme acceleration for the distance that they were considered to be at. Then they both appeared to accelerate directly towards us, in that the small faint light grew to several times the brightness then both seemed to turn and fade as if traveling away, then streaked off very quickly and vanished as if flying out of view distance wise very quickly or as if turning the light way or off as it accelerated. Neither one flickered or turned off as if it were actually a mechanical light. Neither one ever was heard, thou other small aircraft could be heard and seen around the same time in other parts of the sky. Those events really boggled my mind, because of the situation that was taking place at the moment that they appeared. I was left with pondering a potential spiritual involvement as much as anything else. I can explain later if anyone is interested.Thank you!

I went outside to call a friend and noticed the three red lights.  They were definatley way to high to be a helo, and too quiet and too still to be an aircraft (a jet turbine requires far too much inlet pressure, and these objects were moving relatively slow, too slow to power a jet turbine).  While I first started watching the lights, I noticed an airplane flying through the area, I first thought the lights would react to the plane, but they just kept moving very slowly.  The airplane flew over me in about thirty seconds, the 3 lights remained.  I got my friends outside of the bar to see them.  They slowly circled each other, 3 red glowing balls, slowly getting brighter, then dimming themselves out.  They had moved from a staggered line formation (when I first saw them) to a broken triangle formation.  After my friends were watching for about fifteen minutes, the top one on the triangle did its normal, bright then dim out routine, but after it dimmed it never returned.  The remaining two lights moved very slowly around each other.  After I had seen them we were deductively going through possibilities of why they were getting dim and brighter.  My one friend suggested cloud cover, but the sky was completely clear.  My parents had contacted me via my cell phone, and informed me they we watching the lights as well.  Now from where I was standing, they looked very far in the distance and to the north.  My father had informed me that they were very close over the golf course next to our house (george w dunne. forest preserve course/yankee woods) and insisted that they were withing the atmosphere, therefore ruling out a possibility of satellites.

Our point of orientation was just above and just to the right of a large spruce tree.  Because it was so bright, we were observing it and trying to determine if it was a  star or a planet.  As we watched, it moved slowly up, then left, then right, and back down - but not as low as it had been.  We were all amazed and watched intently for several minutes.  It moved almost continuously, but not very much at one time.  The pattern was never exact but always up and down, back and forth.  It reminded me of a balloon, with some type of brilliant light attached, tethered to the ground and swaying in the breeze.  However, in general, it continued to gain altitude and move to the right.  We watched it for nearly an hour and finally gave up trying to figure out what it was.  I did not think too much more about it until the following night (Saturday) around 8 PM.  I thought about it as we sat around the camp fire and asked my children if they had seen yet that night.  As we all looked in the direction we had seen it the previous night, sure enough, there it was again.  Some differences this time.  It appeared to be farther away than the previous night and much lower on the horizon.  It was much further to the left of the same spruce tree than the previous night.  Also, instead of a brilliant white light, it had more of an orange cast to it.  The movement was excactly as the previous night.  It looked as though it was swaying in the breeze but steadily moved higher and to the right.

This object was cigar shaped and was moving rather briskly in a S.W. direction from the N.E. sky.  It took approximately 10-seconds for this object to traverse the sky and disappear behind the treeline.  The color was black, but far darker than any shade of black we&apos;ve previously seen.  It was almost &quot;void&quot; of reflectivity, so much so that it&apos;s shape was clearly dilineated against the night sky (which by comparison seemed to be dark gray).  There were no clouds in the sky, only a modest wind of about 15 mph from the N.W., perpendicular to the motion of the object.  While the object could be characterized as &quot;cigar shaped&quot; it would have to have been a pretty fat cigar as it was almost a third of the way between a basic cylinder and a football in overall shape.  The front and back ends were brighter, with a steady but dim glow.  There was no apparent sound for this object.  After it was out of sight, we scanned the sky and found an airplane as a point-of-comparison.  The plane was clearly and significantly different from the object we had just seen.  The plane&apos;s shape could be seen against the night sky, but it was lighter in color than the background.  The plane also had strobing beacons that flashed quite brilliantly.  The plane also took about 45 seconds to traverse an area across the sky that was roughly the same number of arc degrees that the ultra-black object crossed in only 10-seconds.", "A white bright star like object moving slowly in the 15 degrees above the horizen from Henry Co State Park!While photographing celestial objects with my telescope and astro-photography gear atop on Henry Co State Park at about over 3400 elevations, I noted this consistant bright white star like object, approximately -3 in magnitute, traveling slowly from East to North-East covering about about 15 degrees of the sky in about 45 second, very low in the horizen just about 10-20 degrees above the horizen and barely above the distant mountains as visible in the photograph. Earlier that night before I head up there, I checked for any possible Irridium flashes or ISS (International Space Station) passes as well as other bright and visible satellites which could have been photographed throughout the night (Sep. 5-6, 2005).  There were no passes over California of the ISS or any other other known objects that night.  The brightest I have ever seen ISS was about -1 magnitute at the most and at it&apos;s highest in the sky!  This object was not ISS or any other known satelite for sure as it&apos;s orbit indicted that clearly, not to mention it was too bright to be ISS or any other Earth orbiting Satelites! So the only thing I suspected was an aircraft flying towards me head on since there were no flashes and the lights were extremly bright!  However, after observing it&apos;s flight path for about 45 second, I realizing that it was not flying towards me. Therefore eliminating to be a normal aircraft as well!  No aircrafts has a bright white spot light on it&apos;s side as far as I know!  I have been doing astro-photography since 1986 and I am pretty much familiar with all known flying objects, aircrafs and space crafts in the sky.  I can quickly identify what sort of objects it is when I see one! In this case, I was puzzled as it did not make any sense!  Luckily, I had my digital camera mounted as piggy-back on my telescope&apos;s counterweight bar and was ready to take sequences of tracked 30 seconds wide angle shots to be stacked later.  So I snapped a shot of the object.  The duration of the snapshot is 30 seconds so the star like object streaked a bright white light through it&apos;s flight path right below the constellation Auriga! Note the brightness of thte star Capella (Alpha Aur.) is about 0.1 magnitute! In the photo, the stars are being tracked for 30 seconds so the light from them has been accumilated for 30 seconds.  In contrast, the object was moving so the brightness of it is not accu milated like stars. Meaning it is much brighter than it appears in the photograph!  It was so bright that I was confused for a second there as it was the planet Venus (-4 mag.)", "Bay Area Ball of LightLooking SW from the area of Hopyard and Las Positas A White Sphere - ball of light - moved west and east Appeared to be over Fremont, CA Quickly disappeard after 5 minutes((NUFORC Note:  Vandenberg AFB missile launch.

All I know is that it was nice and dark and out of no where everything got really bright.  It started flying from the left side to the right on a straight line. Never flew up or down, never changed direction. This didn&apos;t look at all like a falling star. This light was very close to me, I would say about 1 and half to two telephone poles tall. From this distance it looked to be the size of a basketball or a little bigger. The only thing I can describe it to is a ball of fire flying super fast. But, the light that it was emitting didn&apos;t look like fire at all. Picture a basketball on fire flying to one direction at a high speed, the flames thickly trailing behind. But instead of being fire it was all light. It got brighter and brighter as it picked up speed till it disappeared with no trails or sound. The color in the center was so bright it looked almost white. The closer it got to the surface the more yellow it looked; the actual surface was a bright electric blue. The light was leaving a thick trail, as it got to the end it was small yellow sparks.  It flew about 150 to 200 feet, when it disappeared. This happened in about a minute with no sound what so ever.

Surprisingly, the swiftly moving unusual object did not produce any sound, and disappeared from the sight within a minute. There were no clouds in the sky at the time of sighting of the UFO. I was utterly confused about my having personally seen an abnormal object in the sky which did not match description of any of the established heavenly objects on that eventful day of my life.

While one flew off to the northeast, the other remained in the same location, moving so slowly that you would have to concentrate on it to not mistake it as a star.  Whatever these were, they appeared mainly white in color, with a faint reddish flicker.  These objects made no sound whatsoever.  Even though we were approximately 3 miles from the lights, and not hearing them would make sense, there was an odd silence in the sky, I mean come on, there is ALWAYS a jet flying over this area going to/from the airport producing a sound from the jet, but during this, there was nothing at all.  Also, the intensity level of their lights varied thoughout the sighting, going from extremely dim/nearly blacked out, back to the brightness of say, Saturn.

Our location is at the East end of Airport Way.  The Airport runway is at the West end of Airport Way.  We assumed that it was an Airplane preparing to land coming in from the East.  It was moving slowly.  The Lights seemed Fixed.  In other words, if a person were to measure the distances between the lights during the 15 - 30 minute period I observed the phenomenon they would have stayed at a constant in relation to each other.  So the cluster of lights seemed to be from one solid structure.  There was no noise.  It was a crystal clear night with temperatures well below freezing.

I was walking east and as I turned the corner I saw, through some trees, what at first glance I thought was an airplane heading towards me.  Once I had a clearer view I saw two nonflashing bright white lights, arranged horizantaly, rather low in the sky.  They were clearly connected to a craft though I could not discern its shape.  The craft travelled north by north-west until it was out of sight.  The movements of the craft were unlike anything I&apos;ve ever seen in the sky.  It kept a general course, but it would visibly accelerate and decelerate while veering side to side.", "maybe sighting of ISS?Sitting in my back yard I observed a cigar shaped light gliding slowly along in the sky.  It was not blinking and was very bright and moving pretty slowly.  There was an airplane (jet) in the sky at the same time and it&apos;s light was blinking and was nowhere near the size as this light...that is how I could tell that it was not an aircraft.  I figure maybe it was a sighting of the International Space Station?  Anyway, it disappeared into the clouds but the brightness could still be seen for a few more seconds thru the clouds.  That is how bright it was.  And compared to the plane that was in the sky at the same time it was significantly larger than the plane and definitely a cigar shape...longer than a jet (from grounds-eye)and much, much brighter.", "Two animal shaped crafts fly over the beach in Queensland on an westerly breezeThe craft was shaped like an animal, as it had are large mass, and four descending columns from each side. There were two of them, one in front of they other. They appeared over us as my freinds and I were swimming in the morning.  Everybdy else was still in bed, but us 14 were there, watching them as they came from the east, went over the beach, and then travelled out across the country.

I&apos;m at work with several other people. Slow day, so a few of us are hangin&apos; around outside helping one of the guys work on his car. We are in the parking lot of a small strip-mall. (Not all of these sightings happen out in cow country.) Two of us go inside to get a few sodas, on our way way back outside we hear one of the others yelling &quot;Get out here, you gotta see this sh*t!&quot; We ran. It sounded like an emergency from the tone of voice. So there we are a group of five all pointing up at the sky slack-jawed. The traffic just keeps goin&apos; by like theres not any UFOs dancing around in the sunset. There were 3 &quot;craft&quot; from what we could tell. Each identical to the other, they were shaped like a discus and appeared to be a metallic color with a soft glowin&apos; white halo that surrounded them. They flew in perfect unison and in ways that seemed impossible, especially to what we know of as vehicular flight. It only lasted a minute or two but the lil&apos; airshow was spectacular. As they flew away (quite fast), it was like all 3 &quot;ships&quot; flew into each other and became one burst of light... poof... gone. One of the guys, the manager, comes out just in time to see the last half of it. He drops whatever he was holding. This is were I get confused. He can&apos;t believe what he sees... even while 5 of us point it out. He goes into complete denial on the spot. To this day I&apos;m sure he wouldn&apos;t admit to it. He didn&apos;t go into hysterics or anything like that, its just that He went back inside saying &quot;No. Nope. No way.&quot; Which was actually stranger than seeing what were probably our own creation. I should note that this happened not far from the Millington Navy Airbase NAS Memphis. (Formerly the largest by enrollment and most active training center for new Navy &amp; Marine pilots.)  We stood around outside, looking up &amp; talking for several minutes afterward making sure that we all saw the same thing.

I do not know how long previous to that they had been visible.  I was advised of the lights by a family member who had just arrived home by automobile.  The lights had been visible to the family member while driving east on 151st St. between Route 45 and 94th Ave. (approximately 5/8th mile north and &frac14; mile west of and 5 minutes from home). Following are my observations:  The three lights were approximately 40 degrees above the eastern horizon.  For comparison they were about the same distance above the horizon as the star Belelgeuse was at that time. I am 6&rsquo; tall.  With my left hand and arm fully outstretched, when the south (or right) light was lined up along the right edge of my pointer finger, the north (or left) light was lined up with the left edge of my middle finger. The southernmost of the three lights was due east.  The northernmost light was about the same distance north  of due east as Betelgeuse was south of due east. The lights were of a brightness similar to that of the anti-collision lights seen on commercial broadcast antennas. The color was similar to that of the red LED on the tape recorder I was later making notes into. The planet Mars was much higher in the sky, almost due south and almost overhead.  The lights were much brighter and much, much redder than Mars. The lights pulsated, meaning the brightness varied, but did not disappear.   Pulsation was independent of other lights. The lights were equidistant from one another. From a drawing I made during the sighting, the lights were at an angle of about 45 degrees from the horizontal with the south light being the &ldquo;high&rdquo; light. When I first sighted the lights, the middle light was slightly out of line with the other two lights, being slightly above an imaginary line drawn between the two outer lights.  The middle light slowly drifted closer to being in line with the other. As a whole, the group of lights was almost stationary, with just the slightest drift to the north. A commercial type airplane flew from north to south during the sighting, and appeared to be between me and the lights.  I am very familiar with the commercial air traffic in this area due to our being under one of the approach paths to Chicago Midway airport.  What was unusual was the altitude of the aircraft.   The aircraft was at the low altitude that I normally see inbound craft at while in the approach pattern to Midway.   The aircraft was heading south, away from Midway.   Southbound craft are normally much higher in the sky and under full power.   Perhaps he had been asked to tale a look. The sky was exceptionally clear.  In the Chicago area you do not get nights this clear very often, usually only in the dead of winter.  The weather at Midway Airport at 0053 Oct. 1, was 58 degrees, clear, SW 9. Although I assume totally unconnected with sighting, family member did see white meteorite trail in sky almost overhead going south to north during sighting. During the sighting, I observed a neighbor looking out his second storey window.  I verified that he also had lights in sight.  He also confirmed this later in the day. Family member and I agreed that we would maneuver by automobile to get a better fix on location of lights.  We went inside to collect cell phone, police/air scanner, tape recorder, etc.  Another family member stayed outside to observe.  By the time I came back outside lights were gone.  Family member who had stayed outside had seen lights disappear.   We did drive around the area for a while but were unable to reacquire lights.  Did not hear anything on scanner concerning lights.", "I was driving home on I-474 headed towards Pekin IL, when I saw this very bright object making a sharp turn from the west to north.  Thinking it was a plane since the Greater Peoria Airport is a mile or so due west of it thought it was a plane.  Just jokeing around with myself I said &quot;O look a space-ship&quot; and started laughing.  But then I thought that every plane I had ever seen in that area (and having been on a plane in that area)  They dont fly out of the airport in that direction but fly into the airport in that direction.  As I was coming up to the bridge to cross the Illinois River IT was just there in the sky about a few hundered feet off the ground.  IT wasn&apos;t moving at all.  IT had 3 very bright lights on the front that looked straight accross when viewed from the front but at a side ways glance it was a triangle shape with very bright lights that covered the whole back underbelly.  IT also had a red blinking light not as bright as the white lights though under the left side of IT.  The last thing that was very strange was on the back left side there was a huge yellow bag hanging off if IT.   Almost like a hot air ballon but smaller.  U could see no flame in it and it was very defined.   Once I drove across the bridge I turn it the gas station and u can see across the river towards Bartonville IL, and nothing.  I then drove back over the bridge and if was a plane I would of still been able to see it going towards the airport and still nothing.  What was also out of place was that there was alot of traffic in the air from the west and I believe the southwest.  We don&apos;t get a whole lot of planes in the air at the same time from what I seen living here my whole life.  Well to let u know to I am a believer and I am not someone who looks for strange aircraft in the day or night time sky&apos;s ever, but I know what I saw and others had to of seen it too since the Highway was littered with cars, vans, semi&apos;s and what not.

I saw it while I was outside running laps on the high school track, so I got a very clear view of it. I describe it as a fireball for lack of a better word, but really it wasn&apos;t because I&apos;ve seen bolides before and they look much different in both color and it the expulsion of material. This was more like a very bright, very large flare because of its glowing nature, but it was falling way too fast to be a flare. It was quite beautiful actually.", "seven objects sighted with one apparantly landingmy son and i were standing outside my friend&apos;s house ready to leave after visiting and noticed two lights moving in the east. these lights looked about the same size as a star, but they were moving in a zig zag pattern downward. then we noticed five more from southeast moving towards the first two. they all moved in a sort of zig zag path. we started getting concerned because they were coming closer so my son and i left. driving home to bertram, one appeared to land some where east of liberty hill texas. the night sky was clear with no clouds.", "Triangle FormationSlight orange in color, 3 objects in the shape of a triangle, traveresed the sky changing order of formation disappeared", "Group of white lights over lakeAt 9:00 PM, a group of 12 white blinking lights were spotted over Lake Winnisquam, headed south over Belmont.

I observed them for 10 minutes until they were out of view.At 10:30 PM, 3 blinking white lights, in single file but close together, slowly flew over Lake Winnisquam from Meredith, down the Sanbornton side.  At the exact same time, all 3 stopped blinking and turned orange.  The 3 orange lights continued slowly just above the wooded areas of Sanbornton and Belmont, until out of view.", "Three white objects in a loose triangle formation moving ESEIt was around 4:11 and I was walking East through a parkinglot on Ponderosa Drive when I noticed three white objects in the sky.  They were not quite directly overhead and appeared to be stationary. They were in a loose triangle arrangement with two of them fairly close to eachother and the other one to the upper right.  Their apparent location relative to the trees seemed to change over the course of a few minutes and I gathered they were slowly drifting in a south east direction.  There was one point where the two close ones started to move closer to eachother until they almost appeared to be one object, and then separated by a few &quot;inches&quot; again. After about 15 minutes I lost sight of them as they moved further and &quot;sank into the great blue yonder&quot;  I suppose they could have been balloons in a calm spot but they struck me as moving in a somewhat peculiar manner for balloons so maybe someone else got a better look.", "Air Force bombing runs mistaken for UFO&apos;sMy wife and I were returning to our home in Mills, Nebraska. It was about 10 pm traveling north on HWY 137, north of Newport Ne. We observed two orange objects falling like flares  in an area over or north of Burke, S.D. We then came to an interchange to proceed on Rt. 12 to go west and then again in the sky to the north we observed 5 more orange objects, they were like round flares being droped from an aircraft, each one lighting up, one after the other in a horizonal line.  Then one final  large flare falling lower. Upon watching we noticed a plane was droping these flares.I am sending this because we read in the Norfolk paper, that someone reported seeing a flying saucer that same night.

It was a clear night while walking within 4 miles from my parents home outside Davisdville, PA. I saw what appeared to be a bright light between me and a hill side some 1/4 mile away.   I thought the light was a glare at first, allowing it to move past my vision, but quickly followed it some 3/4 mile North and parallel with the hill and road I was on (Route 403 between Davisville and Tire Hill.  The light appeared to follow the elevation of the ground uniformly, some 30 feet of so off the ground.  What proved to me that it wasn&apos;t a glare or something explainable, is that it made a &quot;U&quot; turn slightly disappearing into a valley area, so it was very distinct in it&apos;s travel pattern.  The light &quot;flew&quot; back past me now heading back South (again about 2/3 the distance to the hill), and traveled up over another hill into Davidsville, but at that point seemed to fly a higher trajectory, because I could see it partially in sight and then out of sight as it undulated South and from its original trajectory.  It then appeared to turn West towards Thomas Mills, where I then lost sight of it.  I then kept walking South on Route 403, and about 200 feet from where I first say the sighting, staring off towards Thomas Mills way, I noticed over Thomas Mills area, what appeared to be a plume of circular smoke or vapor that went &quot;upward&quot;.  This &quot;upward&quot; plume of smoke or vapor appeared strange to me.  I would have expected it to go &quot;downward&quot;.  That was the extent of my sighting.  And the amazing timing of this sighting from first sight to last sight, over some 4 miles was an amazing 7 or 8 &quot;seconds&quot;.  Why this timing sticks in my mind is that it was traveling so fast and so precise, that I actually counted the seconds.  I don&apos;t know of anything that can go that fast.  And it made no sound.  There was a body that was somewhat visable, but I was fixed on the light.  The body of this UFO was not clear in my mind.  As much as I wanted to form a shape, I couldn&apos;t.  But the light was real, and lead me on its venture.", "Gray Oval ,Bright orange square lights, viewed from open skyAround early aprox 8:30 this morning I went outside to find a black truck pulled over on the side of the highway next to my house.

They passed about 80 degrees westward over me, arced to the north and quickly disappeared. I looked around for someone that I could say &quot;What the hell was that?&quot; but there was no other person within sight.  The thing that struck me was the absence of any sound.

From Fort Pierce to about five miles south of Jacksonville, reports came in to Coast Guard offices starting about 7:30 p.m., said Dan Yates, a Coast Guard petty officer in Port Canaveral. Yates said one caller who was walking his dog near the Sebastian Inlet described the object as &quot;huge, like a giant fireball.&quot;  The caller said he looked toward the Atlantic Ocean and saw the object disappear into the sea. Bart Lipofsky, a professor of physics and astronomy at Brevard Community College, said it more than likely sailed over the horizon instead of splashing down. He added many witnesses often make the same visual mistake. Yates said callers to the Coast Guard station thought a boater might have been in trouble. &quot;A lot of people thought it might have been a flare that might have gone up,&quot; Yates said of other callers. Babs Angel, a public affairs spokeswoman for Patrick Air Force Base, said no local military activity was taking place Tuesday night. The Coast Guard in Brevard received more than 17 calls throughout the evening from residents and two police agencies, Yates said. The Coast Guard base near Jacksonville also received calls. &quot;It&apos;s kind of new to all of us. We&apos;re not used to meteors coming down at the beach,&quot; Yates said of that possibility. Lipofsky was teaching a class Tuesday night and missed out on the show. When told of the range at which the object was seen, he said: &quot;Well, if it&apos;s a meteor, that&apos;s quite a fireball. &quot;Another possibility is it could&apos;ve been space junk coming out of orbit.&quot;  Contact Ortega at 242-3632 or jortega@flatoday.net  Follow-up story:  http://www.floridatoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050922/NEWS01/509220325/1006((NUFORC Note:  Source elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We were the only car on the road at that time.  We had only traveled about a quarter mile when I spotted a stationary bright light above a ridge to the east.  I quickly pointed it out to my roomate and he suggested we we take a road leading up to the top of the ridge.  We drove rather slowly trying to make sense of what we were seeing.  The light was very bright hovering just above the treetops to the right side of the road.  We got extremely close to the object which was now almost directly overhead when all of a sudden two more bright lights on the craft were illuminated.   We could now see that the craft was triangular in shape with lights at the three points.  When the two lights were turned on the craft began slowly rotating in a clockwise motion and then moving slowly away from us.  It realized that we were following it.  We continued observing the object which was now travelling at about the same speed as us at about 30 m.p.h.  We followed the craft for another minute or so when all of a sudden it zoomed away from us faster than I&apos;ver ever seen anything move.  The craft was metallic, dark grey in color and completely silent.  My roomate and I got a very good clear look at this thing which was, without a doubt, somekind of aircraft equipped with technology far more advanced than any commercial or military aircraft.

These seemed to slightly brighter and then seemed to be slightly dimmer, then quicly faded away.  None of the seven lights that I saw ever seemed to move.  We could see the radio/TV towers east of these lights that are on top of South Mountain and it appeared from the angle where these lights are and where we were located that these seven lights were to the western end of South Mountain, certainly west of Central Avenue.

Then the trail of light stopped and the bright light kept moving upwards and it looked like a haze shaped like a cone was behind the light.  Then all at once, it disappeared.

Also, airplane lights blink rythmically and these lights had absolutely no blinking pattern.  They were fading in and out and almost twinkling at the same time.

When I turned back around the light was STILL in the exact place it was before. It just hung there like a star, but unlike any star I ever saw. So of course we pointed the telescope at it. When I zoomed in and got a look at it, it was sooo weird. It reminded me of a rocket ship, the way the flames shoot out of the back, except they were flashing lots of colors. There was definetly some sort of solid object in the middle. So thats all it did, stay in one place and flash red, blue and green.

My son called a meterological friend in Dekalb, Ill. some 45 miles away and he reported to us seeing only one red light to the eastnortheast (approx 45degrees)from his viewing area.

Not knowing what they were, I alerted other family members to get out of the house in case of a crash. As the rest of the family came out, we all observed for another ten minutes as these lights seem to be gaining altitude. At this point the lights were seperated by 5 degrees. My older Son went into the house and got his digital camcorder and started to video this event. As we continued to watch, I observerd a commercial aircraft fly East(90degrees) exactly between and above these lights. Estimate height of aircraft about 3500 feet. I did hear the faint jet noise from this plane and can only assume it was preparing for final approach to O&apos;Hara using the Lake Michigan corridor. The surface wind was 5 mph from the southwest.

This observation was from his bedroom window and they were seperated by 10 - 15 degrees apart. We again went outside and watched from our backyard (west side of the house). My son again videotaped these lights. They were NOT in a triangle as some later reported. They seemed to be in a straight line. After about 7 minutes or so, the Red lights changed course and proceeded onto the east (90 degrees). They did not come over our house as the earlier sighting. AS we watched, the middle Red light overtook the first one and as it was doing that, both Red lights were woobling. It was only a few moments were we obsevered both lights coming together as one. Then seperated. We watched all three lights proceed east and were moving a little faster than the earlier sighting.

They rose from behind a hill across the lake on which I live, along a set of power company transmission lines and stopped just above a set of power lines.  Using 10x50 binoculars, we could clearly see two bright, distinct lights, at least as bright as what might be found at outdoor stadiums.  The lights lit my home and trees brighter than any moon ever has. I am a consultant to the Department of Defense, an aviation buff and the son of an airline pilot; this was no standard aircraft.  Using the notch cut into the hill for the power lines as reference, I would estimate the distance between the two lights at anywhere from 100 to 125 feet.  The lights hovered over the power lines and remained silent and motionless for nearly 23 minutes.  I contacted the local police, but they were unaware of any activity in the area.  I contacted the local power company, but they relayed that they had no service or repair crews in the area. At approximately 20:58, while observing through the binoculars, the lights began to move slightly towards the left (my left) and then appeard to turn slightly on their own axis to their own right, as the distance between the lights began to close and the light on my left dimmed a little.  After 30 seconds or so, the lights appeared again to turn on their own axis, this time back to their left, re-establishing the original distance between them.  Then both lights slowly (5 seconds) dimmed until they went out.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with the witness, and we deem him to be an exceptionally qualified observer.  He provided several photographs of the area where the object was observed, and provided a witness graphic of what the two lights looked like to him through binoculars, which were mounted on a tripod.  The witness has contacted the FAA, the local police, and the airport at Manchester, NH, to inquire whether anyone else may have reported the same phenomenon, and is awaiting return telephone calls from all those institutions.

The sky was overcast with a ceiling of 7500&rsquo;. I noticed a small Cessna-type plane in the sky that was towing an advertising banner. I would estimate that the plane was flying at an altitude of about 1500&rsquo; to 2000&rsquo;. While trying to decipher the message on the banner, I noticed an additional object in the sky above the plane. It was considerably higher than the plane and appeared to be smaller than the plane, even when the greater altitude was taken into consideration. After watching the object for a while I thought I could discern a chevron shape with a reddish cast. I pointed it out to my wife and my fourteen year-old daughter. They both immediately saw it. The object seemed to &ldquo;pace&rdquo; the plane, mimicking the plane&rsquo;s path, though much higher in the sky. We watched the object for several minutes. At one point I looked away for a couple of seconds and when I looked back the object had disappeared. After the game I asked my daughter what she had seen and she said that it looked like a huge red hawk. Several  possible explanations come to mind. It could have been a paraglider, but if it was, it was flying at an altitude far higher than I have ever seen before. I thought that it might be some type of kite or balloon device used to support the tail end of the advertising banner. But the pacing behavior didn&rsquo;t coincide with the movements one would expect from a &ldquo;trailer&rdquo;. Besides, when the plane flew directly over our heads later, at a lower altitude after the object had disappeared, there was no evidence that the banner had any attachments. It might have been an eagle or a hawk, but it seemed too big as well as being the wrong color. Whatever it was, it was unusual.

I saw something move in the sky at an extreme speed which caught my attention. It did not travel far. I am unsure of the distance at which I saw it but, it over an hours time did travel farther away. It was to the best of my judgement circular but its possible it may of been of other shape due to the distance. I did notice that it was equipped with lights. Some green or blue, some red, and some white. This led me to believe it was an fighter jet on test or practice mission. It moved slowly in virticle and horizontal directions... Then it would instantly accelerate.... Un realistically, completely intantly travel at sureal speeds. only in a horizontal or close to horizontal direction. It did not travel across the entire sky only short distances before it would stop as fast as it accelerated. It  would slowly return to its gerneral place of origin.

It was a white object and at some point it reflected sunlight on its edge.  I signalled to a boy sitting next to me and he looked out too.  We didnt know what it was and at that time I believed it was someone in a parachute.   The teacher dismissed us and as I got outside, I looked up but the object was gone.  I assumed it was a parachute.  I never forgot the sight but a few years later, logic reasoned that it couldnt have been a parachute I witnessed.

In the past I have observed 10-15 weather balloons released from Ft. Sumner, NM or Pasadena, TX. Immediately I noticed two things which drew my attention to this object. The rate of travel to the SE was slow but much faster than any any previously observed weather balloon.  And the color of the object was brilliant silver as if reflecting sunlight from polished chrome, whereas weather balloons appear to reflect a dull white, almost beige, color.As I ran back in to the house to retrieve my 7x35 binoculars, I called out to tell my roommate to have a look.  As I was observing the spherical disk, now stationary, through my binoculars, I noticed what appeared to be a long, thin, silver antenna-like rod, three to four disk diameters in length extended from the top side of the object.The total estimated NW to SE distance the object traversed from initial sighting to stationary point was approximately 25 degrees (one palm width at arm&apos;s length equal to 10 degrees).At the same time, my roommate asked if I could see the two blue objects approaching the disk.When I handed the binoculars to my roommate, I then saw two bright blue pinpoints (not disks) of light slowly approaching the disk, also traveling NW to SE.  Initially, the distance from the blue lights to the object was approximately 35 degrees, the spacing between the two blue lights varying from 10 degrees, then closing to 5 degrees, then opening again to 15 degrees of separation and finally converging on the silver object with very little spacing between the two.  The closest of the two blue lights moved to the left side of the silver object and became stationary approximately 2 to 3 degrees from the silver object.  The second blue light became stationary approximately 5 degrees to the right of the silver object.After one minute of observing these three objects, the two blue lights disappeared as they converged onto the silver disk.Immediately thereafter, the silver object, with no observable acceleration, silently moved off to the NE at the rate of speed equal to two or three times a jet airliner traverses the sky.I, myself, have been &quot;watching the stars&quot; all of my life.  I have observed and photographed several solar eclipses, as well as many lunar eclipses and meteor showers.

I watched them and thought there were an awful lot of planes out that night.  Then I noticed that two of the red lights seem to stay in the same spot and were not moving.  I watched them for a while and noticed that they seem to be pulsing.  It appeared to have several little red lights pulsing around a larger red light in the middle that did not pulse but stayed constant.  I got my husband out of bed and told him he should get up and look at these strange red lights in the sky.  He looked at them with binoculars but to me I could see them better with a naked eye.  We watched for a while and noticed they were getting dimmer they seemed to be going further out in the sky they did not go north or south just shot straight back into the night sky.  They got dimmer and dimmer.

The craft was over a residential area just on the border of a farm/Field. I notice that the plan must have been coming directly toward us since it did not appear to be moving. As we got closer to the object I told my girlfriend that it was not moving...She laughed and a moment later said &quot;Oh my God, it&apos;s not moving. I started to get closer and closer to the object. At my closest point I was across the street slowed down to about 15 mph. The craft seemed to be maybe 500 to 1000 feet over the tree line. It was hard to tell since it was dark, and since I could not see the body of the craft I had no frame of reference. As we got closer to the craft I put my window down and was amazed that I didn&apos;t hear a sound for such a low flying object. The craft appeared to be just staying in place. It was three lights directly across from one anther and what possible appeared to be a faint light in the back forming a &quot;T&quot;. The back light was so dim I&apos;m not sure I even saw it. Now to me this seems to be the standard shape of a plane. Under any normal situation I would pass it off as such, but the lack of movement almost made it eerie. Since it is a busy street I had to keep moving. I got to the next light less than a quarter mile and way and did a U-Turn. When I got back to the area there was nothing. This was a strange event but at the same time very exciting. I&apos;m a big time skeptic but this I had trouble explaining. I was hoping I was not the only one that saw it...I will check the local paper in the morning to see if there is any news on the event.", "Red lights over sky of Orland Park, ILAt approximately 11:25 p.m. on 9/30/05 I got a call from a friend to go look outside at the sky to the east.

The lights were far too bright to be that of an airplane and also were not moving, so I ruled that out immediately.

They look like laser dots, if you&rsquo;ve seen a laser pin, that is all you will see, if you can see them from your location. As the earth rotates to the south, this location stays in its location under the Star Arcturus. It can be seen by other countries during spring, summer, fall and winter. Ask your local weather news station when it will be available for viewing in your area.

On August 24th, 2004 they showed up and have closed down this portal and have stopped mother ships from dropping off/unloading their planetary ships.

As I rounded a turn in the road just past the New York State Firemens Home, I could see the  intersection of Joslen Blvd  approximately a quarter mile ahead of me. On my left I was approaching the newly built Hudson High School.  I was traveling only about 25 mph. since it was a school zone. It was dark already by about 4-4:30 pm, in mid November.  There were no leaves on the large old trees which lined Joslen Blvd. at that time. It was at this point I saw two large bright lights off to my left, in the distance, approaching from the east, above a house located on Joslen Blvd.  I took my foot off the gas and rolled down my window.  I was sure I was seeing a large plane with it&rsquo;s landing lights on, about to crash. At the same time, I noticed there was no sound of jets or any engine noise at all, except my own car engine.  The lights came over top of  the house, then sharply turned south, following the road.( Joslen )  The lights flew in what seemed to be perfect unison, above the roadway, maybe 15 to 20 feet in the air, ( judging from the height of the trees along the road ).  The lights followed the road for a few seconds.  At that moment I thought it was going to crash into a small grocery store to the right of the intersection.  But when it got to the intersection , it changed direction again and shot quickly up in the air, and over the trees going east toward route 9 and out of my sight. The same lights remained visible even after changing direction and heading away from me. I could see no outline of any air craft, only the 2 lights. Instead of going home, I turned right at the intersection and immediately drove over to the shopping center on route 9 to see where it went or if anyone there had also seen it.  I found no one else had seen it. Driving home, I realized that the trees along the back road could never accommodate the wing span of a plane that size without some contact or damage.  These lights were the size of what you would see on a large passenger plane or jet coming in at night for a runway landing. But these lights did not seem to throw light into the distance as the landing lights do on an aircraft. I went home and told my children and my husband what I saw.  I don&rsquo;t have to describe the reaction.  And, since no one else had seen it, I have never spoken of it again. Thanks for the chance to relate my experience to someone. Is it possible that someone else has witnessed something similar?  I have heard many different types of sightings described, but not any description similar to mine.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))", "Back when i was 11 or 12 early 70&apos;s I was laying in my bed and the brightest light came in my window, then somehow i ended up in my backyard and seen this huge craft overtop our house and the neighbors house who lived at the end of a row. This craft was right near the roof, not even four feet above it.  This craft was bigger around than the houses and the bottom was lit up, either one big light or a whole lot of lights to light the whole bottom up.  then i remember running down my yard and following about 5 or 6 of them to this field we called Sandy Hill.  We had a very long skinny backyard and at the bottom we could access this trail that went through the woods and at one end it ended up at the stores at the top of Freeway Rd. and at the other end of the trail was this huge giant sand field we called Sandy Hill.  These objects were headed toward sandy hill.  After this experience i remember my mother saying that she was awake and floating overtop her bed, my dad said it was probably some type of spiritual dream, but she insisted it was not a dream and she was definitely awake.  I remember my brother coming into my room, terrified cause he had all these little men all around his bed.  I remember our television could not get a picture at all and my dad and his friend got on the roof to check our antennea and it had been completely broken off by something and could not be used anymore so they took it down and it layed in our backyard for quite some time and we use the rabbit ears antennea that you use to put ontop of the television.  I remember when i would get near the t.v. or touch it the picture would completely get static and you could not see the picture, i would play around and touch the t.v. quite a bit and my parents would make comments.  I remember for some reason that i started waking up with these splitting headaches that would make me throwup every morning for quite a while.  I regretted waking up in the morning cause i didn&apos;t want the headache.  I remember something happened to my right shin bone.  What? I just remember i use to roll my sock down and roll my pant leg up so nothing would touch this spot on my leg.  This spot was extremely sore, like down to the bone, but no bruise or mark at all.  I remember for some reason this huge thing was really scary and this little thing was scary too but not as scary as the big one. I remember laying on my right side, and remember a needle thing or something. To this day i still don&apos;t know what the big and little things were.  In the early 90&apos;s i called my brother and asked him if he remembered the little men and he didn&apos;t but he does believe in ufo&apos;s and has seen them throughout his life.  I remember a dream i had in the 90&apos;s that had to do with my leg.  I was laying on an operating table, lifted my head up and seen my leg open in the exact spot where it was sore when i was a kid, and i seen these so called doctors or something around me, mainly seeing eyes around me.  I remember thinking i should get my leg checked.  Never did.  I have many, many dreams of ufo&apos;s and have seen objects while definitely awake.  I find this subject the most fascinating of all time. Also in the early 90&apos;s i began investigating my dreams and memories and went to the local library here in cumberland, i asked if they could find out if there were any ufo sighting in balto. in the early to mid 70&apos;s and i ended up getting articles from The Baltimore Sun and The News American dated October 18,1973 about ufo sightings in baltimore and surrounding counties.  This confirmed my ufo sighting for me.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting event is approximate.

We normaly stay in a hotel in Amsterdam, traveling to places like Haarlem and Beverwijk. This year we decided for a change seeing as we had gone to Amsterdam for the last 3 summers. We went to a place called Den Helder on the Northern tip of Holland. The place was beatiful, we enjoyed the first 2 days of the Holiday greatly.

At around 9:30pm we got ready to leave, we left the building out the front entrance. As soon as we left the restaraunt there was a bright white streak of what looked like flour fill the sky. It was amazing, at first we thought it must be some type of odd dutch firework, but after a minute it started to fade like rising fog. Behind             this &apos;powder&apos; we could see a few little blue diamond/kite shaped crafts wizzing round and round. I didn&apos;t get too good a look through the white streak which went off onto the horizon.

My wife and I were traveling South on Interstate 75 in the Spring of 1975, we were making a trip to the Ft. Lauderdale area to check things out.  I liked driving at night because there was a lot less traffic and much nicer traveling.  I remember very clearly that night I saw the UFO, there was no mistaking what it was.  It was approximately 2AM in the morning and my wife had fallen asleep while I was driving South.   I remember it was a very beautiful night that night and there was not a cloud in the sky.   I even remember sticking my head out the driver side window to look at the constellations a few times.  It was South Ga. and there were no city lights and the stars were magnificant that night, like I said, not a clould in the sky.  Then, all of a sudden, the entire Interstate highway in front of me was completely lit up as though it was daytime.  The road is very flat in that part of S. Ga, so I could see cars for several miles in front of me on both sides of the road.   I was amazed that the whole Interstate was suddenly lit up in a manner very similar to the light when a large lighting bolt lights up everything.  But there were no clouds or lightening bolts that night, only perfect weather.  As the light stayed lit, I began searching the sky and my view from left to right trying to figure out where all the light was coming from... Then I saw it perfectly through the rear passenger window, as it was just hovering in the sky.  It was enormous!   At first it looked like a full moon because it was a perfect sphere, but it was 10 times the size of a full moon.  It was only a couple hundred yards from the Interstate, and it was very low to the ground.  I couldn&apos;t believe my eyes!  I knew exactly what it was the second I saw it because I knew we don&apos;t have any technology that is perfectly a sphere, can hover like that, and 10 times the size of a full moon.  And, the colors were amazing.  The whole sphere was a solid bright green color, and all around the perimeter the light colors appeared to be a red and organge flashing of colors.  My guess was that the perimeter colors of the sphere was reflecting the propulsion system as they went completely around the sphere.  So here I am, still driving but totally focused on looking at the amazing, huge, bright colored sphere.  Then, as I was looking at it through my passenger rear glass, it went from standing still in the sky to shooting 180 degrees across my front windshield.  It went from standing still, to completely across my horizon in less than 2 seconds.  I had no doubt whatsoever what it was knowing that we have never had technology that can move that fast.  Then, I noticed that I was just approaching an Interstate exit, I was in the area of 20 miles north of Tifton Ga.  The exit had one of those very tall gas signs which use to be so popular.  As I was approaching the exit, my wife suddendly woke up in an absolute panic.  She started screaming, stop the car, stop the car, the car is on fire!  I immediately said to her to look at the tall gas sign, as I wanted her to see that the sign was complete enveloped in a type of smoke from the UFO.  She saw it, but it took me a minute to convince her that the car was not on fire.  But what really happended was that she was smelling the smoke left behind by the UFO as it tore across the sky at light speed and the reason I asked her to look at the tall gas sign, was because she was sleeping when I saw the UFO and I wanted whatever proof she could still see, I filled her in on the details later.  Oh yea, one more thing that always amazed me, the smoke actually smelded like honeysickels.... Really!  It did not smell like smoke at all, it was absoultely the sweet smell of honeysickles.

It had gone well. On the Monday morning we had a group session with local psychic, Isabelle Kingston. This went well too, I was getting encouraging messages and ideas from all manner of people and places. My confidence was good. After Issy&apos;s session, I thought on my way back to Somerset I would call in at Warminster, a place well-known for UFO sightings, and check out whether &apos;ET&apos; and UFOs really exist. I drove through Warminster, up towards the start of the fenced-off, huge army training area of Salisbury Plain. I sat and just relaxed my mind. After a while I had the impression ET really did exist, so in my mind I said, &quot;Don&apos;t bother coming out of your way to appear for me, you probably have far more important things to do&quot;. Then I switched on my engine and started driving back west towards Somerset. After about ten minutes, I noticed a red light over to the north keeping pace with me, it was followed by a second red light, then a third red light. The next thing was they were veering towards me, then they went over my car at about 50 feet. I was excited. I swerved the car onto the grass verge, and got quickly out of the car. Three, disc craft, of approximately 23 feet in diameter were hovering close to me. They were at an elevation angle of approx 45 degrees, and were only about 60 feet away, i.e. they were VERY close! Around the mid section of each craft was a continuous line of windows. I did not see anyone at the windows, but I felt a communication coming from the ship; the communication did not come to my head and mind, but seemed to connect to the middle of my chest. This was undoubtedly a most wonderful experience. The three craft started to move off, back to the south-east. I quickly got back into my car and accelerated off in the direction they had gone. A minute or two later I had caught up with them; looking up through the windscreen, the 3 craft were moving gently side-to-side as they progressed on their way. The road started going uphill, to the entrance to Longleat House. Looking across and downhill a little, I saw the 3 craft going past the foot of Cley Hill, at this time a little, white light came up behind the group of three, and entered the trailing disc craft. We parted company as I drove through Warminster. I felt I had to go to where I had been parked in my car half an hour before. True enough. The three disc craft were there; they were 100 yards from where I had been parked when I sent them my telepathic message. They were circling a stand of trees, flying beautiful, slow circles around these tall trees. http://www.michael-irving.com/meetings1.html((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

As we were watching a small light dropped out of the cloud on our right side then a second later another one dropped out of the left side.  They both hovered there for maybe 5  seconds, with the one on the left being a little higher in the sky than the one on the right.Then they took off to our left ,,,which would be east,,,and were gone in a flash.  The cloud continued toward us looking like it was going to pass right over us.  My girlfriend at this point grabbed our 3 year old daughter, who was asleep and ran in the house being very scared that it was going to do something to us.  I followed her in the house and got my binoculars. When I went back out it had gotten within 500 yards of our house and with my binoculars I could see in the cloud and saw a huge ship with windows and doors  made of some dark kind of metal.It made a light sound like the wind blowing very light but the lightning type flashes made no sound at all.I watched it as it moved slowly to the north at about 10 mph.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I am sure that agnostic optical phenomenon under my analyze, it was UFOs!!!", "We were headed on 80east heading east and we saw this very bright flashing light that just sat in the sky", "bright streaks of light, hovering crafts, triangle lights, different colors , numerous aircrafts appeared to be playing in the skyIm not sure of the exact date it happened, but it was this summer and the space shuttle came back from space the next day. I had just come home from work and I stepped outside onto my porch along with my husband and a friend around 10:30 PM. I immediately saw a very bright streak of white light travel across the sky and i thought that i had seen a shooting star, so i kept on looking for another one and then I saw one that only went a very short distance and it was very bright..I then started to think something was going on and then my husband spotted what appeared to be a star moving very quickly and jumping across the sky it swirled around in circles very fast and then dissapeared behind what looked like a normal star. Shortly afterwards, we began to see bright streaks of light zoom across the sky periodically and then what we thought were stars in the sky began moving around and coming closer (about airplane level) they were moving in very odd jumpy patterns and each of them had a bright red light. There were about 5 or 6 of them that we could see and they seemed to be playing with eachother. Then suddenly they started following eachother and they were all flashing bright lights in the shape of a triangle and the light started at the top and flashed down to the bottom of the triangle like christmas lights and they were green, purple, blue, red,and orange. They continued to play with eachother and they would periodically stop and hover, when they hovered they looked like nothing more than a normal star until they moved again. I witnessed one of them pass over the highway and when it did, all of its lights turned off. My friend did manage to snap some pictures of what we saw, I dont think that she has gotten them developed yet. The &quot;show&quot; finally ended around 1:00am. Also, when I woke up the next morning, i went to my computer and there was a warning message on it saying that the computer had not been able to shut down that night because other people were logged onto it at that time (we did not have the internet so i dont know how this was possible) I have never been a beleiver, but the things i witnessed that night have definately altered my perception of things. I would also like to bring to your attention that the space shuttle came back to earth unplanned the following day and I think that what I witnessed very well could have had something to do with it....just a theory.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "Performing maneuvers near Clovis, NM, same craft as 9/11UFO was seen in approximatly same area of the sky as last night.  Tonight I drove out to the country to get a better look at it.  I am almost certain this is not an alien craft, but rather a military craft doing test maneuvers. For the first hour it moved around in the sky on maneuvers described last night.  It appeared that 1 or possibly 2 small aircraft were staying in close proximity to the UFO, maybe observing it, but after about 15 minutes they left. Within the first hour I positivly identified an aircraft, possibly civilian or perhaps a small military craft approach the UFO.  Upon getting in close proximity the aircraft did a 180 turnaround and proceeded in the opposite direction it had came from.  About 20 minutes later another unidentifiable craft came down from the southern part of the sky.  Craft was a bright light heading towards the UFO at a high rate of speed and downward angle, after reaching approximatly the same elevation, second craft&apos;s light went out and it disappeared. Not sure what happened.  After an hour and a half, the UFO took off across the sky in an easterly direction at a fairly high rate of speed, stopped in mid air, and traced it&apos;s path back to where it had come from.  Will be checking again on 9/13 to see if it is again performing maneuvers.", "As I was driving on an open highway I saw what looked like a huge white sail from a viking ship. I had followed it and then saw it slowly flip down horizontally to take the shape of a saucer. I was able to see the saucer shape because the futher side was elevated. It was a glowing opalescence.The perimeter seemed to be almost outlined. It seemed to have been moving slowly in the atmoshere slightly below the clouds.", "&quot;Whining&quot; cross between quiet helicopter and blimp seen sailing low going southwest over Park Slope, Brooklyn, NYAt 11:45, 9/20/05, I was watching television when I heard something like a gong or church bell. It seemed too late for churchbells. I looked out the window and saw what I thought was a blimp. But it was making a whining sound by now, and it was too close/low overhead to be blimp (lower than any plane) and too small to be a blimp. I was looking out from a high floor on a building on Prospect Park West and 10th Street in Brooklyn. The UFO sailed by in a southwest direction, over Prospect Park. Now it looked to me like a cross between a small blimp and some kind of &quot;quiet&quot; helicopter--it was still making a whining sound, but MUCH quieter and nothing like the sound of a helicopter. I decribed it over the phone to 911 while watching it go further southwest, over Midwood, Coney Island (approximately) and I guess out to sea (I could see the blinking lights far away). 911 hung up on me. I called 311 and asked how to report a UFO. They said it was outside their jurisdiction. I called the FBI. The FBI said to call the FAA. I could not get working number for the FAA from information.", "Strange gathering of objects in the skyi was driving home from my buddys house crossing the bridge over morse resevore.  i was heading east and noticed to my north east what appeared to be a 747 airplane about to crash.  it was traveling south and downward.  as i stopped my car in shock i realized this was no plane.  i thought it was a sinle object because all the lights were traveling together.  they were moving way to slow to be a plane and i listened for the screaming engines.  not a sound. i then noticed each individual light was moving apart from one another.  the lights split up slowly and vanished.  i could see reflection off the lights but couldnt make out any objects.  whatever i saw, it was huge. and very low. shocking!((NUFORC Note:  Probable hoax.

We saw 5-8 red lights maybe 1/2 to 2 miles away in the sky at about an angle of 35 degrees. The lights were stationary and then some moved and one rose up a bit to make us wonder if it was somekind of fireworks. Then they seemed to change to white lights, smaller, and more of them - the white lights moving and changing position. They then disappeared. The noise slowly ended. About fifteen minutes later white lights could again be seen. The noise resumed at a lower volume and then two white lights moved from west to east and then back east to west at a constant speed and seperation between the lights finally disappearing to the west as the volume faded.", "Lights near  Lake Point/Grantsville, UTI was traveling Westbound on I-80 approx Mile Marker 98, looking up into the sky and I saw something that I was thinking was an aircraft near Dugway, but this was odd.  I grew up on military bases and this seemed odd.  What I saw was a bright lite going just a little into the clouds, but it seemed unusally bright for reflection.  I watched and it made several quick changes in alittude and course corrections-way to maunverable for military or civilian aircraft that I am familar with.  It moved in a WSW direction and took off at a great speed and then noticed a second one..both very bright-white.  The first one speed off toward the mountains just to the west and north of Grantsville, Ut.  The other I lost sight of for a minute as it went just over the lip of the mountain then it was back...very bright against the mountain then it changed to a black color. As I got closer (about MM 87), I watched it, it looked like it had a shape-like a upside down pie plate (I hate saying that-everyone sees that) but black in colour.  I watched it moved south then suddenly gain altitide then drop.  I lost sight of it as I continued west.  I am a Professional Truck Driver.", "3 satellite looking objects moving close togetherAs I was looking up to the North to see a satellite that was due over my house in a couple of minutes time, suddenly there were 3 satellite looking objects, moving together from NW to SE. I already had my binoculars in hand, and thro them they appeared a rather gold colour.What was weird though was being three of them they we obviously in a triangle shape but they didn&rsquo;t stay still? Every few seconds or so one or two of them would move relative to each other but they all seemed to keep within similar distance.As they got more to the south east they dissapeared instantly, which to me seems that the light from them was reflected from the sun and they went into the earths shadow.", "I was evacuating from the hurricane Rita down the conterflow of I45 highway.   I had been driving several hours and decided to jump the curb and park in a parking lot to try to rest.   As I looked out the car window, I saw a large black triangular aircraft flying very slowly from South to North off the counter flow highway flowing I-45 pathway.  My first thought was the government was taking pictures of the blocked traffic on I-45.  I noticed a fluoresce tube light that was also shaped like a triangle on the bottom side of the craft.  Then I realized triangular shaped American craft fly very swiftly while this one glided very slowly and silently along.", "UFO sighting ,Nottingham England.Bright light eventually appeared to grow and change shape b4 vanishingWhilst putting my son to bed on Sunday night (25th Sept 2005) I noticed a bright light in the sky, which I initially thought was a star. After watching it for a few seconds I saw that it was moving erratically throughout the sky and was too bright for a &apos;normal&apos; star. Also, the sky was not yet dark.After watching it move around the sky for a couple of minutes, the object suddenly appeared to grow in size and vanish. At this point, an aeroplane comes into view. I captured the latter end of this on our video camera. When playing this on our TV, we can clearly see that at the point the object appeared to grow and change it becomes a spherical shape with a rotating circle running around the middle of it. It is far larger in size at this point and it also moves at some speed after this, which probably explains how it &apos;vanished&apos;. We often see planes in the sky, as we are on a flight path, so the appearance of the plane is not unusual. It&apos;s almost as if the &apos;UFO&apos; saw the plane and wanted to get out of its way.", "stange long light in a vertical position hi in the skydriving down dark backroad nd saw a flash 1st thought flash lightning, but then it flashed again and was like a glowing vertical line which lite up mist clouds nd which made the line a faded orange and white colour but still a real wierd colour, it flashed brighter nd duller 4r another few times then just stopped, the place nd height the object tells it was def. the sky was its only bkround and it did not move after each flash so was still nd was to big of a line 2 b a helicopter, my passenger total freakd out coz both us hav never seen nothin like it in the sky", "Me and a friend had a teloscope out and were using my binos to spot a star to view.Somthing blocked out the star i was looking at,i lowered the binos and made out a large black triangle! It was moving so slow, no sound,very dim white lights in a circular fasion in the center of the object.  Was able to get the small 3 inch reflector scope on it briefly! This thing was NOT from here!

At around 6:30 PM or so, I looked up at the sky (something very bright caught my attention from the corner of my eyes). As I looked up I saw this HUGE BRIGHT ROUND FIREBALL (not really a fireball, but instead a huge bright round ball). I called out to my fiance&eacute; and we saw as this ball travelled West to East at an incredible speed. It was an intense blue with pinkish hues of color. It trailed what I would describe as a fire tail. It made absolutely no sound though it was low enough we though it would crash. What really caught our attention was the intensity of its brilliance. Though it was still daylight its brilliance was greater than the daylight itself. We watched in amazement as it started to plummet downwards and all of a sudden it simply dissapeared in front of our eyes. It did not fall nor did it fly away, it just simply dissapeared in a yet brighter color than it previously had. All that was left behind was a small, thin trail of smoke. This incident was only a couple of seconds long. Did anyone else see anything on the evening of September 20, 2005 over the Florida&apos;s skies? My fiance&eacute; and I are still in shock and even asked family, friends and co - workers, no one else saw anything. What was it? It was definitely not a meteor or shooting star (too close to be that). It has been by far the scariest experience I&apos;ve had in my life.", "Randomly flashing lights of red; blue; green; yellow ,small sphere quickly; randomly darting back and forth .The objects seen had blinking lights of red; green; blue; and yellow. They were darting back and forth very quickly in one small area. The second one we saw came about half an hour after the first one almost parallel across the sky from it. The second one we saw for only 10 minutes, and then it went behind the horizon. The first one lasted about an hour, darting back and forth while slowly moving behind the horizon. The blinking lights and the way the UFO was moving had apparently no pattern and was very random. After an hour the first UFO had also moved behind the horizon. The shape of the object was hard to make out, it was very small from where we could see with the naked eye, or even binoculars from the ground. It was closer to a sphere than other shapes. Myself and 2 other witnesses live in a very rural area where the sky is wide and open with no tall buildings or street lights to block our viewe.

This was somewhere around Arizona or New Mexico.  We saw a very large blue beam come down out of the sky.  This could very well have been a helicopter with a large blue spotlight but it wouldn&apos;t make sense out in the middle of nowhere.  This all happened so fast also.  The mannerism seemed as if it could have been a helicopter but it was really fast.  It just went accross in a straight line.  It was on the north side of Highway 40.

What caught our attention was the manner in which it was moving vertically up and down with inconsistent speed and while it kept going up it was getting invisible and then back into its blue color. Now, since we have a lot of local and international flights flying all over us due to the Intl Airport at Delhi, I know that the light could not have been any thing that I can imagine to be usually visible in the area.

My window looks over a large hay field with no obstructions to the view. I watched the light which was an orange color like a sodium vapor light. There are no other lights of houses that I can see from my farm. The light appeared to move slightly and went out and I thought it was probably just an airplane. I looked again and in the same location the light was there again about 10 mintes later. It went out again when I looked. Then I looked again about 10 minutes later and I saw a sight that freaked me out. It was four orange lights in a horizontal row to the left and slighly above where the single light was. The single light was there too. The lights were round and glowing very brightly. It was a totally clear night. The moon was to the east and visible. I saw the lights stay stationary for about 30 seconds and then they just winked off completely. I kept watching and did not see them reappear. I called the Sheriff&apos;s office as I was sort of afraid and told them that I thought maybe someone was driving in my field, (but really the lights were in the sky). But I didn&apos;t want the police to think I was a nut job. But an officer came out and looked and didn&apos;t see anything, but I felt better for the reassurance. I am a teetotaler and do not take drugs. I am sober as they come! I don&apos;t even believe in UFOs. But I maybe do now! I grew up around airplanes as my dad is a pilot and I know the running lights of aircraft very well. Red port, green starboard, white strobe. These lights I saw were not running lights of a conventional aircraft. I listened for an engine and it was silent. From the closeness of the lights the craft would have been on a course to land on my house or buzz over it very closely. It is totally dark out here with no other farms around me and it was excellent visibility that night. I checked all over my field the next day and saw nothing unusual. I have seen The Northern Lights many times and it was definitely NOT that. I&apos;m an outdoors person and know the night sky very well. I have never seen anything like this before.

While our mouths were hanging open as to why that happened.  We saw a second shooting star that came from the left and stopped right next to the first.  Then the second one stayed in position and the first one moved about 45 degrees and out towards space and met with a third shooting star that also just stopped in the air.  Then the third one went and stopped next to the second one and the first one headed into deepspace in a direction of about 1:00.  The second one went back in the direction it came from and the third one went in the direction that the first one came from.

I watched for a few minutes, expecting it to be a bird, or a kite...but it stayed in same relative spot in the sky.  It was to the East, about 50 feet above the tree line..so it might have been farily low to the earth.   I then went back inside to get my Mom (63) and daughter (9) to have then take a hear and look.  Both heard it, both saw the dim light moving around kind of &quot;intelligently&quot; but also kind of random.   It seemed to stay in the original spot for at least 10 minutes.  By this time, I secured my LED flashlight and started to try the old Close Encounters light flashing...Hoping of course that I didn&apos;t upset what ever it was...but mostly trying to see if it would respond to me. It didn&apos;t.  After a few more minutes it started to move off to the East and get higher..at least higher so that I could no longer hear it.  I watched it another 10 minutes as the light moved, again in seemingly random pattern, and behind some clounds until it was no longer visable.  Near the end of this sighting I did see an airplane flying west to east ( most likely towards Sacramento Airports)...and I could clearly see the plane. I am a computer IT manager.  My dad used to fly P-3&apos;s for the Navy looking for Soviet subs ( when that was the treat!)...so I am quite familiar with things in the sky. I have seen satellites at night, planes at night, helicopters at night, birds and kites at night.  This was NOT any of them.   It was weird, but I don&apos;t think it was from &quot;outer space&quot;.  I tend to think it was either some new UAV that is autonomously roaming, or maybe some really weird birds (owls ??)  but it just sounded too loud to be a bird, and stayed in the same spot too long.  I have seen birds feasting on gnats and they move about differently. In my 38 years, it is by far the only time or object that I have seen that I have been compelled to write about.

After maybe five to ten seconds it transformed into a string of three or four (I think it was three) lights moving in an east/southeast direction.  By this time the lights had stopped blinking. Then the last of the lights dropped off and moved away from the group.  This light stayed pretty much in the same area for the whole time and blinked. The other group continued in an E/SE direction when suddenly it transformed again into a glowing red/orange ball.  The glow was like nothing I had ever seen before.  Then we noticed a trail behind it. The trail was not like the ones created by a jet, it was wide, but was more transparent.  It was moving faster than anything else in the sky.  All of a sudden it made a right turn toward the ocean and then another heading south.  Then it appeared to stop, giving the impression that it was heading away from Earth.  It then suddenly diminished in size until it had disappeared.  The last bit happened in less than a second and it was definitely moving away from us. We had lost track of the blinking light and it was not visible in the sky.

Neighbors were walking westward down our cul-de-sac street when they passed in front our driveway and asked &quot;do you see the light in the sky?&apos;  I stepped out of the garage and walked down the driveway approximately 20 feet to the street in order to see a trail of glowing orange-white light low in the western sky.  This trail of light had a &quot;switchback&quot; appearance to it and originated in the west and traveled across the low horizon towards my location in the east.  This trail glowed quite brightly with varying intensities across the length of the trail for approximately 10-15 minutes and then slowly disipated and disappeared. Above the trail of orange-white light low in the sky appeared a very bright blue-white light traveling northeast to southwest high in the sky at a constant altitude.  This bright blue-white light illuminated an obvious and very large &quot;cone&quot; of smoke or spent gas behind it as it progressed across the sky.  This light burned much shorter than the low trail of light glowed - perhaps 5-7 minutes.  When the bright blue-white light extinguished it did so with a momentary super-intense bright white flash.  After the high, bright blue-white light extinguished the extremely large &quot;cone&quot; of smoke or gas eminating from behind the light was still visible for approximately 10 minutes until it too disipated and disappeared. Throughout the event I was looking at the western sky with binoculars and sighted 5 aircraft that appeard to be helicopters operating along the low horizon. Local radio news reports broadcast on KFYI AM 550 in Phoenix, AZ reported the event as a &quot;top-secret satellite launch from Vandenburg A.F.B. in California&quot;.  I have witnessed several night launches of missles, rockets and space launch vehicles (some from Vandenburg A.F.B.) and none of these previous launches left a &quot;switchback&quot; trail of orange-white spent gasses in the atmosphere.  Further, if this was a vertical, space-vehicle launch, what explains the bright, blue-white light traveling northeast to southwest across the sky at a constant altitude and then extinguishing with a flash?  I could understand the news report as a &quot;satellite launch&quot; if the launch vehicle went out of control (creating the &quot;switchback&quot; trail of orange-white light) and the launch was pre-empted by ground control and the vehicle destroyed.  That would also explain the &quot;horziontal&quot;, northeast to southwest travel of the bright, blue-white light at a constant altitude, the &quot;cone&quot; of smoke or gas behind it and the momentary super-intense bright white flash just before the light extinguished.((NUFORC Note:  Vandenberg AFB missile launch.

This happened again and I got my camera out to take a picture. I was able to get a shot of the jet trail just when the craft moved after taking a right turn again sharply at 90 degrees. then it did the same movement and curved left and down and dispeared. 30 seconds later it performed the same procedure.

My friend pointed out that it wasn&apos;t travelling in a straight line! I stopped walking and noticed that the light was moving quickly from one parallel line to another (all lines going 125 degrees from north) The jump from one line to another occured very quickly, I was unable to see the light actually make the transition. The parallel lines were approximately 1/2 degree apart. I guess you could say the flight path was zig-zagging as if to dodge something in it&apos;s path. We were unable to determine the lights altitude. If it were in low earth orbit it would have been moving about twice the speed of the ISS. It took 15 seconds to cover half the sky. When it was about forty-five degrees up from the horizon in the SE sky it wasted no time in fading away. It just ceased being visible. There was no cloud cover at the time as many stars were still visible behind where the light vanished. There was no sounds of any kind for several minutes after. We listened for a distant engine. Both of us were in the USAF in the late 70&apos;s and could not figure out what type of aircraft could move in such a quick moving zig-zag manner.

However, on the stated hour I witnessed something that I couldn&acute;t immediately explain. It was dark outside and the stars were shining.  Planet Mars  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus is in the western sky, at present.  PD))  was visible near the western horizon  I was walking with my dog when I noticed an ordinary looking satellite (a spot of light) high in the Southwestern sky. It was visible just out of the right side of what astronomers of Northern hemisphere would call the Pegasi Square and it was almost as bright as the stars of the Square. The satellite was moving slowly towards southeast and also gradually fading away as satellites usually seem to do. Well, before the satellite was completely out of sight I noticed something strange: the satellite was closely (less than 2 degrees behind) followed by another, very faint satellite.  They were visible together for about 15 seconds before fading away and they were moving into exactly same direction maintaining the visible &lt;2 degree distance. The objects behaved just like ordinary satellites. I&acute;ve heard of NOSS satellites and I know that they usually travel in a row or in a triangle, but I&acute;ve never actually witnessed them.  This could be my first witness, but I&acute;ve always thought that the visible distance of these satellites would be greater (more like 15 degrees or so).About 8 minues after the satellites had disappeared I noticed an extremely bright satellite just above the Ursa Major heading north. It was brighter than Mars when I noticed it. Then it faded a little but brightened again for some seconds before fading out of sight. This again was nothing out of the ordinary. It was probably one of Iridium satellites that usually appear like that.

So we drove to the main highway, which is west University and found a road which led to a little road which goes to the radio tower.  Whether or not the ufo would have interefered with the elctric system of the car, I do not know because we killed the car and stopped at the beginning of the little road that led to the ufo.  We were probably about a half mile, maybe a little farther, from the ufo.  The color of the ufo was a stainless steel.  My brother in law and I sat there and started having the discussion of whether or not to drive up to the ufo, which we could have done.  We actually decided not to drive under the ufo, because we thought we might get a flight we did not want.  I don&apos;t recall what we said during the time we sat there but gradually the ufo moved from the radio tower to the north, it made a 90 degree turn and drifted off toward the west, out of sight.  We drove back to my house and they were no longer reporting the ufo on the radio station.  I called the radio station again and got the same disc jockey and said, why did you stop reporting about the ufo, and he said that the government told them to shut it down or lose their license.  He said, I will tell you something else though.  Our electrician went out there to check on why we were having static, and when he got back he was so excited and disturbed that we had to take him to the hospital to get him a hypo to calm him down.  He said there were hyroglyphics on the bottom of the ufo.  So I hung up after that discussion and later on I called him back one more time and he said one of the t.v. stations had pictures of a ufo above the street lights on west university at night and the government confiscated their pictures and told them to be quite or lose their license.  He said that he didn&apos;t want to talk about it anymore, because he was afraid he would get in trouble.  This completes my version the best I remember of this event, and it is the truth.  There were five witness, and I have thier names and occupations on the original report.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting event is approximate.  PD))", "Very bright light appears, disappears, reappears.On Wednesday, Sept. 28, 2005, at approximately 9:10 PM (PDT), my wife and I were sitting outside, facing east, enjoying the clear night sky.  I turned to my left (North) and saw a bright (Magnitude -5.0 or brighter) light and said to my wife &quot;What&apos;s that light? A plane with its landing lights on?&quot; In the time it took for her to turn her head (about 1 to 1 1/2 seconds) the light dimmed to look like any other star in the sky, and within another 2 seconds it was completely gone from sight.  It did not really appear to dim down (or drop below the horizon), but rather it appeared to fly directly away from us.About four minutes later, while I was still watching that area of the sky, I said to my wife &quot;Here it comes again.&quot;  It slowly reappeared as a faint, distant star and within 2 to 3 seconds was again very bright (Mag. -5.0 or brighter).  My wife said &quot;If it gets any closer, I&apos;m going in the house.&quot; It then again appeared to fly directly away from us to the North and disappeared within 3 seconds. We never saw it again after that.((NUFORC Note:  No sightings of the International Space Station or of Iridium satellites would have been visible from Valley Springs, CA, on this date, at the time indicated, according to &lt;www.heavens-above.com&gt;.
