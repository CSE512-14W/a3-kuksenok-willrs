One of the persons in the party asked me if a light in the sky was a meteor; I looked up and saw a bright light and said no, because a meteor would have been streaking across the sky and this was stationary.  I then went back to digging out my MRE.A few minutes later someone else in the part said it might be a satellite because it was moving.  I looked again and verified that it was moving and likely was a satellite.About 5 minutes later the second person pointed out the same light again at which point I looked up and it was still in the same area of the sky but was no longer moving, and could not be a satellite as far as I could tell.  I then began watching the light, which remained stationary for several seconds and then started moving in a corkscrew fashion.  To be sure that I wasn&apos;t seeing things, I asked the rest of the party to look at it at which point the person who originally observed the light said it has been moving on and off since he asked about it the first time and validated that it was currently moving in the corkscrew fashion that I was observing.At this point we all laid down on the hillside and watched the light, which was moving in alternate corkscrew and fishook patterns, and also randomly moved quickly across the sky in straight lines, while making 90-degree direction changes as well as reversing instantly.  All four of us observed identical behavior, and we soon found a second light to the west performing similar behavior.  As it was still just past dusk and there was a full moon, the only other objects visible in the sky were the moon and Jupiter(?).We continued to watch these lights as other stars appeared in the sky for the next hour or so, and validated that they were moving in relation to each other and the stars.  Given that we could not determine how high or how big these objects were, it was not possible to tell how fast they were moving, but the instantaneous changes in direction were strong indicators that they were not satellites or the ISS.  To the naked eye they appeared to move at about the same speed as a satellite for 3-5 seconds before changing direction.  Both objects never left the general areas of the sky (almost straight above us and East of us towards the rising moon respectively) and eventually we got cold and hungry and went on about getting dinner and going to sleep.On Sept. 6th from my home in Wasilla I again looked the general area of the sky at around 10:00pm just after dusk and did not see either object present, nor any other objects moving around in odd patterns although I did see several meteors and satellites over the next hour, again confirming what we saw did not resemble either in the least.", "Bar shaped craftThe object was flying around a cow processing plant it was doing afly around it while I was driving to my home, it had 2 lights on each end it looked like it was a bar floating around the lights did not change colors as would a helicopter or a plane.

We were coming in the Harbor on our boat (4 people on board) from Sprite Island after a BBQ, with our friends following us in their boat(with 5 people on board), heading for the dock, when we noticed this exceptionally very large bright light over the harbor,that was a conical shape shining down. We watched to see is this was possibly a helicopter,or some other type of aircraft that was searching for something, but then the light started to go straight up into the sky until it was no longer visible.

My mom and I excitedly called the rest of our family over to where we were so that they could see it.  By the time they got to where we were, it was nearly out of sight, but a couple of them seen it.  About an hour later (about 10pm) we were all sitting on the front porch of the camp talking, when my husband suddenly seen the SAME bright orange ball flying past again--same spot, same speed, same direction.  This time all 5 of us seen it.  We all ran out into the yard, one of the men ran out onto the dirt road to get a better look.  Every single one of us got a very clear view of it this time.  It was incredible!  We have NO CLUE what it could have been.  It was definitely not an airplane!  Every time we all get together since then we all speculate as to what it could have been.  It makes for some very interesting discussions...

If the center of a clock were our location, and 12 O&apos;clock was dead north, the object was north northwest in appx the 11 O&apos;clock direction.The object was quite large for a distant object, roughly 4mm of size in appearance and circular. Incredibly bright and white, it was more intense in brightness than the intensity of the streetlamps on the street below. It gave off no amount of light to the ground or area, the idea is simply to describe the relative brightness and intensity of the light.The object appeared to be at a great distance, and was no more than white light. There was no way to determine any sort of object detail with the amount of distance, but the size and brightness was utterly striking. It was holding dead still relative to a building&apos;s roofline below it (simply used to reference). It initially appeared to be an incredibly large and bright star to the observers, however it then began acting very strangely.While continuing its perfectly dead hold, a small light resembling the size and intensity of an aircraft warning light (viewed at great distance), left it. The smaller light exited perfectly from the center and bottom of the large light and had appx 1/2 the intensity of brightness and only a small dot of size, much smaller than the first object.This small light moved slowly and perfectly downward with zero flashing from either object and perfectly steady light and movement (no stuttering or jumping). It had the appearance of a falling flare on a parachute in descent speed, however over the 10 or so seconds of fall there was zero lateral movement. From the original object to its lowest point, the distance was likely 2 or 3 degrees between objects. The smaller light then stopped perfectly still and hung dead still. The total journey down lasted appx 10 - 15 seconds of travel time. The object then hung for 5 - 10 seconds dead still below the first one.At this point the upper object became very slowly less intense, until it reached appx 1/2 original brightness. This made the two objects the same intensity at this point. The small lower object then began to traverse upwards and to the right slightly at the same rate it had used on the descent but now at a relative diagonal. Eventually it passed the original large object on the right by appx 1/2 of a degree and continued until it reached appx 1/2 to 1 degree of distance upwards and to the right of the original object. Using the clock analogy again, with the larger object at the center of the clock, the smaller object was located at appx the 1 o&apos;clock position.During this ascent the large original object began again another very gradual fade and size shift until it was smaller in appearance and eventually equal in appearance to the smaller second object. Eventually the original object became so dim and small that it was unable to be seen at all. The second object remained visible and dead steady for appx another 5 - 10 seconds before it too dimmed slowly until disappearance. The entire encounter lasted likely 1 or 2 minutes total. The objects were both white light and circular / dot like. No defining shape or features could be seen. No flashing. No flickering. No trails or tails. No other movement in any directions or traversing of the sky in even the most minute amount unless otherwise described above. Zero chance of confusion with aircraft. Only possibilities could be orbital objects. Researched &quot;Iridium flare&quot; objects, wrong coloration, intensity, and timing entirely. Smaller secondary object is utterly confounding in movements. Cannot explain the utter lack of movement for larger object. Appeared almost perfectly like a star expect for extreme intensity and size. Thank you", "Spotlight over new jerseyI&apos;m not sure of the time of the event.  There were 4 of us who saw it.  We were eating dinner on our patio at night.  I looked up and saw what looked like a spot light shining down from the sky through a mist or a cloud.  I pointed it out.  First reaction, rational, was that it was a helicopter.   We heard no sound of a helicopter at all, and the light seemed to high up to be a helicopter, especially given the fact that it seemed to be emanating from a cloud.  About 20 seconds later, the light seemed to rise straight up, getting enveloped in the cloud.  I say this because the light became diffused as if in a cloud of mist.  Eventually it dimmed and was no longer visible.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.

The white &quot;object&quot; seemed to twinkle like a star but zooming in with a 20x camera I could see it had multiple parts so this was not a star. There was a large part with 2 smaller parts separated but close to it, these smaller parts seemed to move away from the large part, then return (I think that is the reason for the twinkle effect).

The light beam was very high in the sky and we never did see or hear a vehicle. We don&apos;t know what caused this but speculated that it could have been landing lights on a jet plane showing up in a jet  trail or the clouds. Or could it be the exhaust from a military jet (or rocket) going supersonic?  The beam of light seemed somewhat unusual in that it seemed to spread out more, almost appearing like a jet trail. The light beams seemed to point downward to the earth and the direction of movement seemed to be upward. We get a lot of jet traffic in the sky from New York (JFK, La Guardia) and and Newark airports. But this was different than anything we&apos;ve ever seen before.

What occurred was by far the strangest thing that I have ever experienced. Its very simple to describe.My son, my daughter and myself were on out lanai behind our house.

However, the sound became louder and more clear over the course of about 45 seconds. We walked outside the lanai door to see what it was. The sound was moving above us through the air but we could see nothing but stars. As the sound approached us, it was less like a rumble and more like the sound of &quot;feedback&quot; from a speaker turned way up. Very steady and deliberate and definitely not the sound of any combustion type engine.

PD))", "Before I go into any detail about our experience, I would like to preface this account with a description of the area we were in. Our campsite is nestled in a stand of trees in the southwest corner of a huge rock bar in the Owyhee Canyon area, south of Vale, Oregon.  The rock bar is approximately two football fields in length and I would say close to three hundred feet wide.  Next to the river&rsquo;s eastern edge sit&rsquo;s a small hill about 100 feet tall.  Due west of our location is the ridge line near the Owyhee Breaks, approximately 1 to 1 &frac12; miles away.  South of our campsite, around five miles away is an area called Birch Creek.This is a wide open desert area, where we can see for long distances in most directions.As we were sitting near the river&rsquo;s edge that evening, we noticed two red lights above and beyond Red Butte.  This is a volcanic mesa with an elevation of 4584 feet and is around 7 miles northeast of our location.  The two red lights were huge; in relation to the stars behind them, they were at least twice the size.  The lights were perfectly parallel and were heading our direction.We had a campfire burning that night and our curiosity was piqued as the two lights continued their approach.  As we continued watching the red lights, we began to hear a &ldquo;soft&rdquo; jet noise.  Jeff made a comment that he believed they were two military jets headed our  way to check out the campfire.   As the lights began to drop lower into the canyon and slow down, I disagreed with Jeff&rsquo;s assessment of these lights being military jets, as the lights were going far too slow.  From Red Butte to our location,  had they been jets, they would have arrived at the rock bar in a very short time.While the two lights continued their advance toward our location, their steady drop in elevation and deceleration became more noticeably evident.  It was becoming quite clear there was something not right about these lights.  The noise did not fit the bill of military jets either, they weren&rsquo;t loud enough.Here is what bothered me about the noise.  The jet noise of the two advancing lights was similar to that of conventional aircraft, but what I can relate as only &ldquo;soft&rdquo; jet sound, nothing near the decibels you would expect for a low flying military craft.Another thing that wasn&rsquo;t quite right was that we have seen numerous commercial and military jets fly through this area, but NEVER have we seen military aircraft out at night at this location; an area we have been visiting for almost a decade. The commercial planes flying at night and at day are what you would expect to hear given the planes respective altitudes.  However, the military jets we have witnessed doing maneuvers in this area, are ALWAYS during the daytime and generally flying much higher  and are remarkably louder.As the lights reached a distance between one and two miles away, they had descended to an elevation of maybe 1000 to 1500 feet and the closer they approached the lower the elevation and slower the speed.Somewhere around 1000 feet away, the altitude of these mysterious lights dropped to what I believe is 500 to 700 feet in elevation and began to literally float like a blimp towards us.  I was unnerved to say the least and completely fixated on what I was seeing.  &ldquo;Military jets can&rsquo;t fly this slow,&rdquo;  I said to Jeff.It was at this time that I got out of my chair and approached my four wheeler, which was approximately 15 feet away.  Prior to this, I had been sitting about 10 feet from the river and 8 or so feet from the campfire&hellip;I wanted a better look.When the two lights began entering the north area of  the rock bar, I became transfixed.  My heart was racing as these lights were slowly making their way towards us, all the while emitting the &ldquo;soft&rdquo; jet noise.  The altitude had dropped even more, to somewhere around 100 feet above us.What in the world is going on, I thought.  As it continued getting nearer, my mind was trying to make sense of what my eyes were seeing.  The sound, the speed, the color of the lights, the fact it was floating&hellip;nothing seemed logical&hellip;and it was big whatever it was.  Jeff and I were flinging  commentaries to each other, but I haven&rsquo;t a clue what he said until&hellip;  The lights were almost directly overhead when Jeff began yelling something about two red lights.  I was mesmerized and began moving further up the rock bar, my head craned directly up.  As the lights were just barely past me, it was here that the realization hit me.  I could see a solid structure between the two red lights.  I began yelling at him that, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not two red lights, it&rsquo;s a solid object!!!&rdquo;   &ldquo;It&rsquo;s solid, the lights are connected!!!&rdquo;  I stared in utter amazement.  I could not see underneath, it was as black as the sky, I could only make out the structure between the lights.  (My estimate as to the width of the craft is 100 feet, based on how much of the rock bar it appeared to cover at it&rsquo;s apparent altitude).Jeff yelled again and said, &ldquo;No, no&hellip;look up higher and to the left, there&rsquo;s two more lights!&rdquo;  Not wanting to take my eyes off the object, I quickly glanced up and left and there they were, two more red lights, another object identical  to what I was seeing directly above me.  This one however, was at a much higher altitude&hellip;possibly one to two thousand feet.  I quickly diverted my attention back to the one above me.I was stunned!  What I had just seen didn&rsquo;t make any sense.  With the realization that these lights were one solid object, a craft, I was left bewildered.  There was no transition between the approach of the two lights and the departure of the two lights.  I never saw two coming and two leaving.But I didn&rsquo;t have time for this passing thought.  I was truly in awe of the events transpiring at the time.  Thoughts and emotions were whipping through my mind and body at that moment.  I didn&lsquo;t want to take my eyes off it for anything.  &ldquo;Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, do you believe this?&rdquo;  &ldquo;No one is going to believe this,&rdquo;  I yelled to Jeff.  I was overwhelmed, astonished and excited.  My body began shaking and my knees literally went weak.Grab the camera!!!&rdquo;  Jeff yelled.  I ran back to the four wheeler and could not remember what side I had put it in.  I was fumbling around in the dark, trying to watch the object and feeling through the myriad of items I had in my atv.The craft was nearing the far south end of the rock bar, while I was still searching feverishly for the camera.  On the back of my atv, is an added seat that has two storage units on either side.  I am an avid rock hound and both sides were full of rocks, water bottles, towels, clothes and snacks.  I ran from one side of my atv to the other trying to locate the camera.  Minutes were passing by and the craft was disappearing down the canyon when I finally found the camera case.I was shaking so bad, I could barely unzip it.  Trying to watch the craft and operate a camera with my mind racing and trying to function normally was an impossible mission at this point.  I finally did open the lens of the camera and thought I was hitting the shutter button when I had actually hit the off button.  I was exasperated.I turned the camera on again.  By this time the craft had picked up speed and altitude and was now nearing the Birch Creek area.  Pointing the camera towards the craft, nothing was registering on the viewfinder&hellip;the screen was black.  I yelled at Jeff , &ldquo;&hellip;nothing is registering.&rdquo;  I hit the zoom, but still could not find the lights in the viewfinder.  I realized it was a fruitless attempt, so I turned the camera off and put the handle over my wrist as I continued to watch the craft depart down the canyon.  (I had just purchased this camera in May and was unfamiliar with all it&rsquo;s settings).It was at this juncture that we were to witness an amazing exhibition  that left me completely awestruck.As the craft went beyond Birch Creek, it had gained considerable altitude and had met up with the other craft.  We could no longer hear them.  While the  initial craft always appeared to be much larger, I am unsure whether this was due to the fact that it was always higher and farther away.  While I know this is the logical train of thought, the second sighting has me in doubt of this presumed fact.All of a sudden both crafts apparently turned and when they did, we now saw three red lights each on both crafts&hellip;both vessels were now triangle shaped!  An isosceles triangle to be precise.The crafts stood still for a moment and in almost slow motion pointed their noses relatively straight up, sat momentarily and then shot off into the night sky like a rocket, the smaller craft first and then the larger one.  They moved so swiftly that within seconds we lost sight of them.Again, and with much fervor I exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh my God, do you believe what we just saw&hellip;this is the stuff you see on TV,&rdquo; such was the discourse upon witnessing this spectacle.Jeff and I were conversing loudly and excitedly to one another for the next few minutes.  After ten or fifteen minutes of our impassioned discussion, we heard jet noise again.  It couldn&rsquo;t be&hellip;but it was.  Slightly southeast over the small hill across the river, came two red lights.  Not three in a triangle shape, only two like we had seen to begin with.  This time however, it was flying at a few thousand feet in altitude.  I would hazard a guess at roughly three to possibly five thousand feet.Camera still in hand, I turned it on and began clicking.  I made the same faux paux I made before and accidentally turned the camera off.  Regaining my composure, I made sure this time my finger stayed on the shutter button and I began clicking away.  Still&hellip;nothing was registering on the viewfinder.  I quickly realized I needed to change the camera settings and began flipping the dial as I tried to get the lights in the viewfinder.I found the &ldquo;night&rdquo; setting, but still nothing in the viewfinder, so I just pointed and shot.  The craft was crossing the canyon at a much faster speed this time and I was having a hard time keeping watch of it and trying to shoot photos.After snapping several shots I lowered the camera.  Since I could see nothing at all through the lens, I at least wanted to see with my eyes.  It was then we noticed the second craft.  It was once more flying at a much higher altitude, escorting the first and larger craft.  They  crossed almost due west over the rock bar in very short time.As they reached the west side of the canyon, the speed slowed to a near halt and again they turned.  Once more we could now see two triangular shaped craft, each possessing three lights.  Again, one craft appearing much larger, at least two to three times larger than the other.The larger craft slowly lowered itself to just above the mountain top, hovered momentarily and then began a series of maneuvers.  The second craft turned to horizontal and remained stationary, as if watching or waiting for the larger craft.  While viewing the objects at this location, which is barely a mile or so from the rock bar, we did not hear any noise coming from the crafts.The larger craft tilted what would seem to be it&rsquo;s left wing or side up and then came back to horizontal.  It then slowly maneuvered it&rsquo;s nose up and again back to horizontal.  In it&rsquo;s final movement, it tilted the nose down&hellip;and back again to horizontal&hellip;hovered briefly and then sank slowly behind the mountain as if it were landing.  The second craft did no maneuvers of any kind, it slowly descended down, almost in sync with the large craft as if it too were landing.(While the craft was just passing over me when we were on the rock bar, I did get a spectacular view of the rear end of the craft.  I have since drawn diagrams and images.  Please see attached).The story doesn&rsquo;t end here.  A couple of odd things happened the very next day.  While we didn&rsquo;t see any craft the following day, what occurred on Thursday has definitely made me wonder.It was 9:05 a.m. when I was taking a stroll through the stand of tree that surround our camping area.  I heard an extremely loud jet sound and looked up.  There above me, flying at only a couple of thousand feet was a Stealth Bomber and it was heading directly towards the location the two craft had appeared to land the previous night.How odd, I thought&hellip;is this just a coincidence?  For as long as we&rsquo;ve been coming here&hellip;never have we seen Stealth in this area.  I came back to camp and asked Jeff if he had seen the Stealth&hellip;his reply was no&hellip;although he did hear the jet noise.Approximately 10:00 a.m., Thursday, August 20, 2009.  We&rsquo;re cleaning up the breakfast dishes when we hear noise on the mountains behind our camp.  Behind us are two roads that traverse this recreation area.  A lower road, which is directly 20 feet behind our tent and then the upper road which is maybe a hundred yards further up toward the base of the hills.  Both roads run north and south.Inspecting the noise, Jeff had walked out of camp to the access road that leads to the road behind us and stated there were two rigs coming down the hill.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re kidding,&rdquo;  I said, surprised at this development. As far as I knew, this road was nothing more than an atv trail, a fairly steep one at that.  I made my way to Jeff&rsquo;s location and for a brief time watched in amazement as these two vehicles slowly made their way down.Here again was another anomaly.  In all our years at this area, a place that we come to at least twice a year, only once have I seen anything on this hill, and that was a four wheeler - an all terrain vehicle.  Although I was surprised that two vehicles were on this road, I didn&rsquo;t give it much more thought&hellip;I returned to camp and began to prepare our atv&rsquo;s for our morning ride.  My thoughts were due to change promptly.While loading the atv&rsquo;s with the necessary items, it struck me.  I grabbed our Oregon Road and Recreation Atlas to see where this road leads.  This steep desert road takes you to an area in the general vicinity where the crafts seemed to land the previous night.Shortly thereafter, with both Jeff and I in camp, we heard the vehicles getting nearer&hellip;very near.  Within a few seconds, the vehicles were coming down the road directly behind our camp.  Jeff and I quickly walked out the short driveway that leads to the road behind our camp to see what was up.The first vehicle we observed was an older model jeep, white in color I believe, and the second rig was also an older model blue pickup with an atv in the bed.  Both men were middle aged, I would say early 50&rsquo;s or so.What was so peculiar about this encounter was that as the two men drove slowly by, within 30 feet, they did nothing but stare.  There were no hello&rsquo;s, no waves&hellip;nothing but a stoic gaze.  We have ran across or met a few people in our visits here and with one exception everyone either waves or stops to chat, but not these two.  Another odd thing was, it seemed pretty obvious to me that the two vehicles made a bee line to our location.  But why?  If you&rsquo;re hunters (antelope season had recently opened) and you&rsquo;re checking to see if this camping area is available, you would have noticed this location was occupied when you were directly behind our tent.  There would be no need to slow your vehicles down to a crawl and stare as they did.  Granted these thoughts are mere speculation as to the motives of these two individuals, it was nonetheless strange behavior. The two vehicles proceeded to the upper road, headed north and we never saw them again.  Now had they been hunters interested in bagging game in this canyon, there are only a few other camping areas available and we would have either seen them, heard their vehicles or atv and in all likelihood heard gunshots.  Neither occurred that day.  For within an hour, Jeff and I rode our atv&rsquo;s a few miles past Red Butte, passing all the camping locations along the way.  There were no sign of the men or their vehicles and no indication they had taken the road we were on as there weren&rsquo;t any  fresh tracks on the road that goes due east past Red Butte. Now whether these two men are witnesses to the previous night&rsquo;s events, I can only conjecture.  Their sudden appearance and quick disappearance seemed odd. The next occurrence was at 4:00 p.m. that afternoon.  After returning to camp from our ride beyond Red Butte, we headed for the rock bar.  The day was hot and we wanted to be near the river the remainder of the day. Within a very short time, we began to hear jet sounds again.  I was in the midst of my hunt for rocks and Jeff was in the river on the float tube.  Every time we have visited this locale, the military jets do their maneuvers directly south of us about two to three miles above a place called Griffith Ranch&hellip;but not today. Today the sound was very loud and close. Looking up, I spied only one jet.  It&rsquo;s not at the usual altitude either, this one is flying lower than normal and is crisscrossing the rock bar at an east and west trajectory.  Here again is a peculiar thing.  In all our years camping here, we have always observed two jets executing maneuvers. I watched the jet momentarily and returned to my rock hunting.  As the jet proceeded to traverse the canyon, I went to the river to cool off.  What happened next is another unusual event. If you recall the small hill I mentioned earlier in this report; this hill is no higher than 100 to 150 feet.  I was standing in the river, a mere stone&rsquo;s throw from the base of this hill cooling off, when the noise of the jet became extremely loud.  Looking up, the jet had changed his flight path and was suddenly approaching from the south at an extremely low altitude.  As he neared, he flew directly over the small hill around 20 to maybe 50 feet above it&rsquo;s peak.  His air speed had slowed to the point that when he flew past, I could see his headgear, oxygen mask and upper body.  He turned his head and looked directly at me. Needless to say, I was bewildered by this action.  I yelled to Jeff, who was about 50 yards downstream saying, &ldquo;Did you see that?&rdquo;  I met up with Jeff within a couple of minutes and we discussed how unusual this incident was.  We both pondered the pilots odd behavior and speculated on the possibility of being photographed, as nothing of this nature had ever taken place before. This was the end of the remarkable events we witnessed during our time here. I have given much thought to the depth and length of the craft I witnessed over the rock bar and have been unable to determine the measurements.  Possibly with those who possess knowledge of geometry this issue could be resolved. As a side note, a possible witness to be contacted would be the caretaker(s) who man a residence at Birch Creek.  While we haven&rsquo;t been to this residence in four or five years, there used to be an elderly couple who manned a small ranch at this locale. The following information is stated to give the reader(s) more information regarding the area where the sighting occurred. Near where the craft initially appeared, which as I stated is above and beyond Red Butte, is a very big reservoir called Lake Owyhee.  (Pronounced o-y-hee).  According to Trails.com, Lake Owyhee is &ldquo;53 miles long and 139,00 acres, with an average depth of 80 feet and a maximum depth of 117 feet&rdquo;. Different internet sources state contrary information regarding Lake Owyhee.  (A report from the Argus Observer, June 27, 1991 cites, &ldquo;In some places the lake is nearly 500 feet deep and even in the worst of the drought Owyhee had 250 feet of water for 40 miles&rdquo;). According to the Oregon Bureau of Reclamation, &ldquo;Owyhee Dam is a concrete, thick-arch structure which was designed to carry about three-fourths of the water load by arch action and the remainder by gravity action. The dam rises 417 feet above foundation in the river section, and 530 feet above the low point of the excavated fault zone. At the time of its construction, Owyhee ranked as the world&apos;s highest dam. The arch section is 623 feet long, and a gravity tangent extends 210 feet to the right abutment. The total capacity of Lake Owyhee is 1,120,000 acre-feet (active 715,200 acre-feet). This site further states that, &ldquo;&hellip;Hydraulic height (the normal operating depth at the dam) is 325 feet&rdquo;. See link:  http://www.usbr.gov/projects/PrintFacilityAttributes.jsp?fac_Name=Owyhee%20Dam  Another observation I noted while perusing our Oregon Road and Recreation Atlas, is a location called Ben Odell Reservoir which is not too far from where the crafts appeared  to have landed.  I have researched this small reservoir and can only find latitude and longitude information of 42.27922 and 117.60444 respectively.  I did find one small map that leads me to believe this reservoir is approximately &frac34; of a mile long.  I have yet to find any more information.  This, as I stated previously, is in  the same general area the two unknown men came from. As for the photos I took.  Having downloaded the images from the night of the sighting, I did manage to click the shutter 14 times and only captured one image of what appears to be a single point of light&hellip;possibly Mars. In the accompanying images, drawn by the reporting witness, please note that only the 3 red lights (per craft) were visible that gave the crafts their triangular shape. The first image is what I witnessed upon seeing the craft pass by while on the rock bar.  The outer ring on the lights were a bright red/orange.  The inner ring was a lighter orange/red. The bottom four sketches are the maneuvers the first and larger craft accomplished over the western ridge line before seeming to land.  All the maneuvers were done at a relatively slow pace. #1.  Shows the craft&rsquo;s first maneuver, in which it appeared to lift it&rsquo;s left side up. #2.  Second maneuver was to lift the nose of the craft. #3.  The craft lowered the nose. #4.  In it&rsquo;s last move, the craft went back to horizontal, remained stationary for a moment, and then accompanied by the second craft sank behind the ridge line.

At first I thought it might be a reflection from a ground-based spotlight, (i.e. the kind you&apos;d see at a movie premiere, or in the 20th century fox logo, etc.) but looking closer it appeared to be a shape moving in a linear southbound path.  It was faint enough that I can&apos;t be sure of a coherent outline, but my best guess is that it was bow-shaped, i.e. an archery bow without the string.  Faint amber lights were spread across it, perhaps 10 or 20 in total.  The object was perhaps twice the diameter of the moon in width.  There was fog to the south, and it moved behind that and disappeared.  I kept looking around for another 20 minutes or so, but saw nothing further.

The only thing is that it seem to stay in the same place for a long time. I knew it was not a airplane, because they can&apos;t stay in the same spot.  I was sure it could not have been a helacopter either. I still drove toward it thinking maybe it was a tall, bright street lamp.

It then stopped temporarily, and then began to move very slowly again, but this time in a trajectory to the right or west, but each time it did this, it would stop, and start going in a circle toward the east once again as if to stay above the treetops.

When it began the trajectory portion of its journey the object took on an oval shape resembling an eye with multi-colored lights projectin! g from underneath its shape.   Another shape that the object took on resembled a ball with spikes on all sides instead of soft edges.  The spikes took on multi-colored lights, green, red, white, and yellow.

My sister-in-law had not seen a satellite at night before and it was fun for us to pick them out from the sky.  There were flashes of light in the southern skyline that had been going on for about twenty minutes and although we could not hear any sound produced from the flashes of light we commented there was probably an active fireworks display from a distant town event occurring.  One thought it was lightening, but it was a clear sky in our area.At approximately 9:00PM to 9:15PM, only my wife was looking into the sky.  My brother had been adjusting the wood in the fire which drew the attention of the rest of us.  My wife called out, &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;  The other three of us looked up in the southern direction she was pointing (about a 10 o&rsquo;clock position from where we were sitting) and saw a very large object, which appeared to be a burning ball of orange fire traveling in a southern direction away from us.  We all stood up and began calling out our observations to each other as it continued in a southern direction.   We all commented about the unusual size and the orange flame.  I asked if it could be a military aircraft afterburner, but this was dismissed due to no sound produced by the object and it seemed larger than a known type aircraft and the burning appearance continued throughout our entire observation which, to my knowledge,  was inconsistent with an afterburner. We commented about the possibility of space debris! or a large meteor, but it did not appear to be descending. It continued in the direction of the suspected fireworks display which I suspect should produce more witnesses. It&rsquo;s difficult to estimate how long in seconds we watched the object.

The taller IDS Tower is located to the left of the Wells Fargo Tower, the object would typically move slowly from the right of the Wells Tower, left above the top of the Wells Tower, and continue further to the IDS Tower, and would go out of view behind the IDS Tower.  The object would come from behind the IDS Tower back over the Wells Tower, then move to the right beyond the Wells Tower, and back again.The object sometimes performed fast complete loops in the air, would abruptly stop, and would drift slowly once again.  Sometimes the object would change direction abruptly moving up, down, sideways, or diagonally at a high rate of speed, sometimes instantaneously changing direction at a high rate of speed several times before abruptly stopping and then beginning to drift again.  There were times when the object would appear to hover without moving for up to a minute.  On at least two occasions the object quickly, at a high rate of speed, darted down at a diagonal between the towers toward the ground, covering two thirds the height of the Wells Tower in perhaps one half second.  There were times when the object would go dark and reappear several seconds later, sometimes at the same, sometimes at a different location.  There were times when the object would become dim, then brighter.  There were times when the object would appear to pulsate in intensity.  The second witness, ! a woman who stopped to watch, stated that the object changed colors.Luminosity:  Variable, from dark to dim, but often about as bright as Jupiter would appear in a dark sky.  Note that downtown Minneapolis is highly lit at night, as is the Wells Tower itself.Other:  The aircraft obstruction light on the antenna mast at the top of the IDS Tower functioned normally during the entire observation.  Several large commercial aircraft, apparently on approach to MSP International, made typical runs across the general area appearing to be at a higher elevation than the object observed.  There was an advertising searchlight scanning the sky in Minneapolis that night but it had no effect upon the observation of this object.  I observed the light for twenty five minutes, left and returned twenty minutes later to find the object still presenting itself as before.  I left and returned once again thirty minutes after the second observation and could observe no trace of the object.Opinion:  This was not a conventional aircraft, helicopter, or bird.  The abrupt stops, instantaneous change of direction, zig-zagging, and fast rates of speed, loops, and abrupt stops are inconsistent with such explanations.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Far away from this object. One the object got to this point it sustained that level of brightness, and appeared to come towards the Hill we where on.  But then Stopped, omitting such a bright light and resumed its greyish/soft omitting light. Right after that, I kinda sweep the whole bay, from where I was, and now saw 3 identical small objects show up in sequence, and at parallel height. (could draw a straight line through all 4)  At that point, I was panicking, and wanted to get off the 25ft tower I was on, and rush to my truck, just down the hill to grab my camera. (Truck was about 500 ft away from the antenas) So I did and returned with my camera. The first main object was gone, and the other 3 behind it where leaving in sequence as well. I was able to snap off pictures of the 4th orb/sphere/object, which was closer to San Francisco, out over the south Bay.I&apos;ve been up there 30-40 times this year, I have never seen any lights up there that could compare, ive never seen any reflections that could compare or have ever been 1/10th as bright as these in clear sunny day light conditions. I just cant explain what these where.", "Lights in Spring Hill, FlOk, here it goes. I&apos;m not going to go into some long detailed story. This is what I saw. I was talking on the phone to a buddy of mine in DC. There was a little lighting going on so I decided to grab a lawn chair and sit in the entrance to my house.  As the clouds passed, I walked (as I usually do when I talk on the phone) around my drive-way.  As I was looking up at the sky I thought I saw one of those spot lights that business&apos;s use for grand openings and stuff.  As I continued to watch I didn&apos;t notice the beam of light going into the air.  I also noticed four objects about the size of quarter in the sky.  They circled around the part of the sky I was watching, and then collided together and spread apart again.  Almost looked like a game of pong or something.  Now granted there was a bit of lighting in the clouds...but this was not lightning.  I truly wish I could explain it better; it&apos;s something that I&apos;ve never seen. It had a certain tempo and pattern.  It lasted! maybe 15 minutes; four orbs of light circling around, coming together and splitting off; then starting the pattern all over.  Of course I continued to watch.How it ended:  All that happened was the three other &quot;strobes&quot; stopped. One other  light circled the sky for another couple of minutes.  And then it was gone.Folks, truly the weirdest thing I&apos;ve ever seen.  Since I ain&apos;t that smart this description of events doesn&apos;t do it justice.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was hovering in the sky, then it became very bright (still blue/green) and decended straight down - vertically - and dropped below the tree line.

They made no sound.  They appeared to drift slowly in a Southerly direction.  The lights were bright, somewhat yellow-orange and faded in brightness as they moved higher in the sky and then disappeared.  Both myself and my husband saw the event.  We saw some students near the building and we went to ask them if they had seen the lights.  They answered no; but as they were saying no, one pointed out that another group of three lights was coming up from the North at that very moment.  Again there were three bright lights yellow-orange. At first straight across. They then formed a triangle and slowly and silently moved in a delta form towards the Southwest.

My friend and I were talking face to face and a bright light lit up in the sky behind him.  I glanced over to see what it was and I saw an object in the sky about 2-3 inches wide from where I was standing... not too sure how far it actually was though.  If I had to guess I would say possibly 20 miles north and lower then an airplane flying in the sky.  It had a few VERY intense lights underneath it that I seemed to have felt the heat from... it was very faint, not enough for my friend to feel it, but I completely felt it get slightly warmer.  The same warm feeling as if someone were to turn an intense spotlight on you.  The UFO was traveling extremely smoothly at a very slight angle (maybe 15 degrees or so) up toward the sky for about 3 or 4 seconds, then all of the lights turned off, my eyes adjusted from the intense lights going off, and the ob! ject was completely gone.My friend saw my expression change in my face and turned around to see what I was looking at, but when he turned around he only turned enough to see into the apartment next to us.  He thought I was looking at something in the apartment so he didn&apos;t turn around all the way enough to see the craft.  He told me that the expression I made was so genuinely fearful that it freaked him out... although after it passed I thought it was awesome!  - Dan", "flashing lightone object observed sitting in one position. it would turn its lights on real high like with a dimmer, then turn them real low to off. it was repetitive. it was a ball of light in just white. this background was set among the open night sky as seen from a well lit parking lot.", "I was on my way to milk cows at my dairy, like any morning.

The lights were really bright. All i could really see was the shape the lights were in. The actual craft was hidden. I then just drove off real fast. I was so scared. It was very close to me, just above the trees. I have never seen anything like that in my entire life.", "Odd rectangle shaped object hovering over Cape Cod Bay after sunset.My wife and I had driven to Wellfleet&rsquo;s Duck Harbor beach on the bay (western) side of the Cape Cod peninsula. From there one can see the sun set over Cape Cod Bay, making it one of the few spots on the east coast where one can see the sun set over water, though in actuality it may be setting over the Massachusetts mainland about 30 miles distant.It was a clear evening, as a high pressure area had just arrived within 24 hours. There were no large clouds to speak of but the normal atmospheric haze of pollutants made for a beautiful sunset.The sun set about 7:10 pm EDT, and about 10 minutes after that I began scanning the western horizon with binoculars to glory in the subtle shadings of red and orange in the vicinity of the sunset.On one particular scan, I was panning left (south) and came across what to me initially looked like a passenger plane descending in the direction of Boston&rsquo;s Logan Airport. It was about the right size for a large jet in the distance.  It was about one binocular field over the water. By the way the binoculars are 8 x 40&apos;s.I made the mental note of &ldquo;plane&rdquo; and continued panning south looking at the subtle atmospheric shadings as well as at boats and sea birds. I then began panning back to the right (north) and came across the &lsquo;plane&rsquo; in what seemed to be the exact same location as before. I looked more closely at it and could detect no wings, it looked like a very dark rectangle set against the lighter orange-red haze. It was above the lowest darkest haze lines, the rectangle shape was distinctive, outlined against the lighter orange colored haze &ndash; definitely an object over the water &ndash; but closer to me than the coast of Plymouth, MA, visible in the far distance.I asked myself if this could be a plane after all, but I looked even harder to discern any movement against the background and saw none. In order to test this, I took my binoculars off the object and scanned straight down towards the water line and beach to get a fix of where the object was. When I came back, the object was still there. I said to myself &ldquo;too bad you don&rsquo;t have your birding scope&rdquo;, for in that I would have had a very good view. I again tried my experiment of fixing the object against the water and beach, but when I came back a second time the object was no longer there. I scanned to both the right and left to see if it had moved but there was no object in sight.Now I can&rsquo;t say I saw a UFO, because I saw no odd movement, but I am quite sure there was an object out there, apparently over the water and not moving. It was definitely not a structure in Plymouth or elsewhere on the Massachusetts coast.  It was just an odd sighting, perhaps explainable. If only I had my birding scope!", "Saw odd shaped object in sky in daylight.While arriving to work, I noticed somthing strange in the sky.  It was dark in color.  I could see it plainly against a cloud in the background.  It was a tall looking object with something sticking out of the side of it.  It did not look very aerodynamic.  I went into the locker room and changed clothes.  When I exited the locker room I noticed it was much closer than before.  I walked about 100 yards to the shop I work in.  By this time it was flying over the shop.  I grabbed one of my co-workers and showed it to him.  At the same time another co-worker rode up in his work truck and asked me &quot;What was that?&quot;  By this time it was almost out of sight.  There is an air force base in the direction it was headed.  It was very strange to all of us.  We thought it might have been something from the base, but at the same time it was so strange it makes me think otherwise.", "Ball of flame that appeared to prepare to land!I was standing on my back porch, and noticed a big flame type of object in the sky.  I called my family out to view it, and they were able to actually make it oustside, and see what I saw.  The object came closer to the tree line, and all of a sudden two streams of light projected from the bottom as if it was preparing to land.i&apos;m not sure as to what we witnessed, but it appeared to be an aircraft on fire or something else.  My wife ran out with our video camera, but by that time it was below the treeline.  I have never in my life witnessed such a thing!  It seemed like 50, 100 or more miles out from us.

It disappeared 1 1/2 hours later. Completely.First of all, at the time of this sighting I was not under the effects of drugs or alcohol.   At 9:07 PM (21:07) at the Ford Forestry Center in Alberta (L&apos;Anse), MI, I was standing outside talking on a cell phone when I looked up to see what I suspected was a satellite.  Seeing satellites was extremely common place in Alberta, as the light pollution is very low.  As I watched the satellite, it drifted across the sky at what seemed like a much slower pace then any satellite I&apos;d ever see had.  The object traveled roughly 1/4 of the visible sky.  As I watched, it came to a dead stop at a heading of southeast (I had a suunto compass readily available).  It then split into two separate white lights, much like stars and then re-merged together.  Not believing what I was seeing, I ran to one of my friends dorm room window and knocked on the window of one of my dorm mates.  I told her and every one else to come out and look at the star.  Her and 5 other of our class men came out and begin looking at the object, which swayed slowly back and forth, much like a pendulum.  We watched for a while until the object settled on a southeast heading and remained perfectly stationary.  We all wrote it off to our mind playing tricks on us, and it must be a normal star just flickering or giving the appearance of moving.  We all went back inside, but at this point I&apos;d become suspicious.  Roughly an hour and a half after we first saw the object, I went back looking for it in the sky.  It had completely disappeared.  I got my friend out of her room again and she too confirmed the object where we&apos;d been looking earlier was gone.  I did not get any pictures or videos of this happening since it was so slow in happening and I couldn&apos;t decide if I was seeing something noteworthy or average.  Looking back, there may have not been aliens, but there was something extremely unusual.", "2 Strange lights in a line formationI saw 2 lights in the sky that did not look like airplanes or a helecopter. They were flying in a straight line and keeping the exact distance between them the whole time.  The lead craft was a very dim light and the second following light was very bright.  When I first saw it I thought it was Venus but then I noticed it was following a dimmer light.  I watched as they flew north then gradually changed direction and started west to North Branch.  The unusual part was the lack of blinking lights and It was bright as it was going away from me. Generally the planes I see go dark as they go away from me. They were silent which also seemed unusual to me.((NUFORC Note:  ISS and Space Shuttle in formation.

When I came outside, I did not see the helicopter but saw a plane way up where planes usually fly at, around 30,000 feet.  I really felt a kind of experience next as I looked to the west north/west in the sky and saw another object. At this moment I saw the plane and the object at the same time and could tell that the plane, moving at a fixed speed, was different than the other object. As I looked at the object longer it started to dominate my vision as the sky around the object began to turn pink and change color. It was moving towards me but in a fashion of looping circles and it was moving clearly faster than the plane as well as different directions. It than took a different direction totally and went behind a cloud. I never have seen an object like this before and I couldn&apos;t stop looking at it. I knew it wasn&apos;t a plane because of the plane of reference that it was near. The cloud was qu! ite big and I never saw the object again.

We decided to drive all night because we have a disabled son that has a late schedule. Twenty miles out from Spokane on HWY 90 east around 4:30am we encountered several sparklers like things hovering over our car just off the right side of the windshield. I noticed that they were pacing our car as we drove. I felt like I was being hypnotized by the sparklers like objects. I noticed my wife and son staring at it and not saying a word about what was happening. I thought this was some kind of warning and felt very scared that something was going to happen to us. I was afraid to stop so I lowered my speed and shielded my eyes so I could not see them. By doing so I felt like I was not being affected by the attempt by them to hypnotized me. I was scared at this point and yelled out to my wife, &quot;Is it trying to hypnotiz! ed you, is it a warning of some kind.&quot; Cathy finally said something like &quot;I don&apos;t know what do they want?&quot; I kept looking down at the time and it didn&apos;t seem like it was changing even after a very long time and miles had past. I was thinking they wanted to hurt us or do something to the road ahead to hurt us. Each time I took my hand down from shielding my eyes I felt again they were trying to hypnotize me, like I was blacking out and not in control. I remember cars and trucks passing in the other direction and honking there horns at us as if they were seeing these things over our car. We begin praying and saying the lords prayer, it seem as if I could not think as if my mind went blank and I could not remember even what was happening to us and even what these things looked like. I had to put a memory into my head what they looked like or I think I wouldn&apos;t remember what they looked like. I remember saying to Cathy they look like giant sparklers at the same time she said it! . I thought they had gone away but they must have just moved a! way for a short time because I noticed they were back and I remember saying to Cathy no they are still here, don&apos;t look at them. She noticed my speed had dropped to 40 miles an hour in a 70 miles an hour zone and she told me to speed up or we were going to be hit from behind. Soon after that they left. I think that they tried to abduct us but were not able to because of the medication I take for depression.

My wife, brother in law, and myself were playing golf at the city course on the south side of Tallahassee, Jake Gaither Golf course.  We teed off in late morning, and were on the 5th hole, a par 3,  around noontime.  Weather was perfect, clear blue sky.  While waiting to tee off, I noticed a USAIR turboprop flying south along the east edge of the golf course at maybe 1500 ft. altitude.  The plane was approx.  a mile away. It was heading towards Tallahassee regional airport.  I noticed that it was starting to make a right hand turn for final approach and it was going to collide with a flock of birds that was also flying south.  I watched for a few seconds and as my eyes changed focus from the plane to the birds I then realized that the flock of birds was not a flock of birds but rather several small grey spheres flying in formation heading south but at a slightly higher altitude than the! plane, or maybe a little farther east of the plane. The plane made its turn and the spheres continued south.  I yelled to my wife and brother in law to look but they could not locate them before they passed behind the trees.

The sky was dark, after sunset. I had been watching the stars come out. The sky was clear, no cloud coverage at all. No moon in the sky. (The moon was in new phase, and rising and setting during the day, according to a moon phase website). The hammock is on a self-supporting frame, and there is nothing on my porch to block my view facing east or south. My house was to my right, or west. I was looking at my phone when a bright light above and slightly to the right of my perspective caught my attention. The light was an extremely bright and extremely large white light, shining down towards the ground. It was very high in the air, possibly higher than aircraft would generally fly. The light spread out like an upside down cone, but without a distinguishable tip.  For about 15 seconds, the outline or form of the light was very clear and distinguishable. The light was about the size of a normal full moon, or just slightly smaller. The light rose vertically.  As it did, the clarity of the outline of the light dissipated and was replaced by a patch of &ldquo;brightness&rdquo; in the sky, which slowly became larger and larger, then faded slowly to black. This process lasted about 4 minutes. At its largest, this patch of brightness against the night sky would have about filled the dipper portion of the big dipper before fading to black. The simplest way for me to describe it is it was as if someone had turned on the brightest spotlight I could imagine from the atmosphere, and as it ascended, I seemed to be viewing the light from underneath the source. According the compass on my iPhone, the light was approximately at 180 -189 degrees south. I thought to run inside and grab my camera, but figured I would miss it. I attempted a picture with my iPhone, but by this point, I could only make out a bright patch against the night sky and the iPhone could not record anything in the sky.

The entire event lasted approximately 4 seconds and she was not able to look up fast enough to see it.  The lights seemed to be emitting from very large recessed pockets.  Similar to light protruding from recessed ceiling lights.I could not see the craft due to all of the light pollution.  It was a clear night, so there there were no clouds for the city lights to reflect off of which would have made an excellent background.  I could not give an estimate of the size of the lights or how high it was hovering since it happened so quickly.  However, they came across as very, very large.  If I had to guess the shape of the object, I would guess that it was a triangular shape due to the positioning of the lights.After the lights disappeared, I quickly turned into the Braum&apos;s parking lot to scan the sky.  After not seeing anything for roughly 10 minutes, I turned around and drove through exactly as I had just done to make sure I wasn&apos;t seeing a reflection on my window or a streetlight or something.

The UFO we witnessed was HUGE and black metallic bottom with several lights around the cross/weird shaped object.  It was smokey looking around the lights, possibly due to the cold  (40 degree) night sky.?  We watched it move slowly left and right as it went away from us at 5-10mph. (approx.)

It was around 9:30 pm, a little later than our usual time.  The moon was almost full and very bright, the skies were perfectly clear and very low humidity for us here in Louisiana. Jupiter was bright and almost parallel at the time we were looking up.We were about to give up and go inside when I caught a glimpse of something that I first thought was a shooting star. I quickly pointed at it and told the wife to look before it faded away. But, it did not fade away.  I then though it was one of the plentiful White Cranes we have here in Louisiana, but I quickly realized it was not flapping any wings.My wife and I started asking each other what is that?  The object appeared to be a large wing shape and white, and had sort of a faint glow as if light was reflecting off of it. It was moving at a very fast speed, coming from the east headed directly west. It did not very the speed, or waiver off of its direct course. We were able to view it until it just faded in the west sky. We were both stunned at what we just saw.We love to star gaze and watch for meteors and satellites, and I&apos;m an avid NASA site watcher and I always know when the ISS or Shuttle are in viewing range, and we watch it every chance we have. But this was so different.As we stood there reflecting on what just happened, we started re-playing it out loud to each other, trying to make a logical explanation of what it could have been, either a plan, a bird, whatever, but we were completely puzzled and amazed..Here are some details that we recalled and discussed that really made this sighting even more mysterious to us. When it first appeared over the house it was already visible. The moon was very bright so if it was a low flying object it would not have been reflecting the moon light from the bottom, which made it appear to be glowing from within itself. It was not a bird because the wings never moved, it was moving very fast (faster moving than the ISS sightings) and it never fluttered or altered from its direct line of flight. It made absolutely no sound. There were no white, red, green, or blinking lights on it. We live in the flight pattern to the airport just 10 miles away, so we are very familiar with what aircraft looks like on its approach. When it faded from view, it was some where around 10 to 15 degrees above the horizon in the west sky, and I know from my many years of keeping up with the ISS, it would never be moving from east to west. Also, if it would have been a ! low flying object, it would have disappeared due to obstructions such as houses in the neighbor hood or the trees in the woods just west of us.So, since after nearly 50 years of looking at the skies, and since this was the first time I ever saw anything I could not apply logic to, I felt I needed to write this down, share it, and hope to find out if anyone else saw it, or anything similar to it. I would love it if someone could explain what it was.", "2 large lit objects 1 in front of other, stationary, then moving NE , and up into  sky disappearing with no sound.We were looking at 2 very bright lights that were about 5 timess bigger than the stars .

It was probably goin around 30 mph. It eminated no light or sound. It was observed from an upstairs porch by two of three people. The person who did not witness did not have her glasses. It was an opaque metallic gray color. The object itself looked like a massive boomerang with a wide wing span.

The object started dissapearing from view behind a large tree in our garden.  My brother and I jumped up and went around the tree to keep looking at this UFO while our mother rushed inside the house to get a pair of binoculars.  I was able to have one last quick look at the object mooving very swiftly across the sky before it disappeared beyound a forested mountain in front of us.The shape was somewhat like a diamond with facets arrayed concentrically and displaying hues of blue red and white or silver.  It had no wings and was flying without making a sound.  There were winglike protrusions however but in such a bizarre angle that they would have been useless to help the object fly in terms of an airplane.  We have never seen anything like this not even in an science fiction movie.Thats why it is so hard to describe what it was like.  We were baffeled.  What on earth is that???  It was still broad daylight so there was no mistaking it for something else.  I hope this is helpful in some ways to your research.  Greetings from Germany", "Many lights, changing color and blinking randomly, merging and dividing, flying randomly and also in formation, in Ajo, AZ on 9/16/09.My friend Lisa and I are currently on a road trip from Pittsburgh, PA to Las Vegas, NV and back. Last night, at around 6pm. mountain standard time, September 16th, 2009, we arrived at Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument which is roughly 25 miles South of Ajo, Arizona, and roughly 5 miles North of the Mexican Border. We set up camp and cooked dinner, and at around 7:30 pm, I whitnessed a reddish/amber light blinking  twice in the sky just over the horizon in a Southeastrn direction.  It then disappeared, and then several white lights started blinking in the E/SE direction of the sky.  I would say Probably 3 different lights blinking randomly. Lisa did not see this with me.  A few hours passed, we went into the tent to go to sleep.  The tent has a mesh top so that you can see the stars.  At around 9:00 pm, Lisa and I heard a very loud sound, kind of like a jet engine, that ended abruptly.  We decided to look in the sky at the area where the sound was coming fr! om, East.  I saw another red/amber light moving slowly from East to Southeast, it then disappeared and 3 or 4 more objects started blinking randomly, on no set pattern.  They then slowly dissapeared and we stopped watching.  About 15 minutes later, we decided to look East again and we saw the flashing lights again.  This time, there were 4 lights.  They all were flying different directions at first, but then then formed into two pairs in formation and flew from East to Southeast.  We heard brief sounds of engines.  Then, it looked liked 2 of them were about to crash, they then merged into one orb of white light.  Then, they all started blinking and some of them turned off completely while others stayed on, and others turned off completely.  Then, all four started blinking frequently but randomly, and all of a sudden, there were six lights blinking in the sky.  For the next few minutes, they all spread out then slowly disappeared at different times.  At times we could clearl! y see that they were flying over Mexico, as we could see Mexic! an citie s and border crossings South of us and the objects were definitely over these towns and farther away.  That particular sighting was about 9:15 - 9:30/9:45.  We saw no other activity that night.", "Fast moving white light over Lansing Michigan area.The sky was hazy and only 2 bright stars were visible. I saw a light moving rapidly and silently from east to west. It appeared at first to be a very bright satellite but they usually travel north and south so that is one reason this caught my attention. It was moving fast and was about the same size and brightness of the two stationary stars. About the time it was directly overhead and forming an obtuse triangle with the stationary stars it came to a complete and instant stop. Now I was really interested because that seemed impossible to me. Next it started to move west again and very slowly. Then stopped and came back east and then turned north and took off so fast I couldn&apos;t believe what I was seeing. It stopped and came back south. It reminded me of a humming bird the change in direction was so quick and effortless. It seemed very high in the sky and that is why at first I thought it was a satellite or some very fast and high airplane.If this is something the government (ours or someone else) is doing then there are flying capabilities way beyond what the public know about. I am a pilot and have flown for many years so I am used to looking at flying aircraft and tracking them. This was not an airplane. Maybe a small helicopter flying at a lower altitude but in that case it was silent and I don&apos;t see how it could have traveled across the sky so quickly since there is a limit to how fast a helicopter can travel (~200mph).", "Triangular object in the sky in Evans City paWe were driving towards Evans City.  We looked into the sky and next to a very bright star was an object which looked like it was projecting a triangular light underneath the craft.  It was very bright but the light did not come to the ground and it was very high up.  The object was near a very bright star or maybe planet.  We then were blocked from the view by some trees but we could make out that it was fading away.  Once we passed the trees the object had disappeared.

During the process i was looking at the sky, then i saw what looked just like a bright star moving fast but at a choppy speed. As i watched it moved a good distance before slowly disappearing into the darkness.It was moving too slow to be a shooting star, but to fast to be a plane or chopper.

It was a red blinking light with one white light at 9&apos;clock and another white light at 3&apos;clock. I started to realize it was strange when the white lights were not blinking (which would have been the wings of a plane). I called to my husband to come out and look at it. The lights around the object were actually illuminating the craft. &apos;If it were a plane that low, why aren&apos;t we hearing any sound?&apos; is what was going through my mind. As it was moving towards the east, towards the hill in front of our house, the white lights moved clock-wise so the object was now vertical. We both are saying out loud &quot;what the heck is that!!&quot;. At this time the white light that was now at 12&apos;clock separated moving up- further away from the other lights. It continued to follow the lights (i say &apos;lights&apos; now that the craft is not visible by illumination). We bot! h ran through the house to the front to watch it more. As it reached towards the horizon of the hill the white light that was at 12&apos;clock was gone and a quick flash of white light (as if the flash of a camera) was seen in the north. After this flash the lights were now beyond the hill&apos;s horizon and out of our sight. About 4-5min after this we returned to the back porch. My husband soon noticed a bright whitish light coming from the west (near where the border patrol is located in VT) towards the east moving slower than a &apos;shooting star&apos; but too fast to be a plane. I only noticed this light at about the half-way point of where my husband first noticed it. Just after that left our sight there was a plane moving towards the same direction. About 3m after this there was another plane heading in the same direction of the craft. There seems to be a lot of flight activity tonight and I&apos;m hoping these pilots noticed what we did. We&apos;re having a hard time naming the shape of the craft. It was almost like a really fat cigar shaped or oval-like. We could only see what was facing us. I&apos;m not sure if there was another side of the craft that was not visible to us or not. It could have been saucer shaped but it&apos;s hard to say.

Fairfield, CTI figure I would submit my observations, though it has been a few weeks since the events had accrued.  I guess the events took place around the 1st of October.  I smoke cigarettes out side my home and observe the night sky every night.  I live around NYC region and see many planes travel over my home, and so I would consider my self capable of identifying a plane easily in the night sky. My first observation.  I saw a bright light breaking through the tree line on a clear night, at a height I observe many planes around 11PM.  At first I figured it was a plane coming at me in a direct line, and I was observing a line of sight to its head lights, although it was brighter than most planes, so I decided to observe it longer than I typically would for other night sky lights.  The path the light was traveling was coming at me and it did travel directly over my house and off into the southern tree line.  What I would typically see when a plane travels in this fashion would be. First the head lights when it is traveling towards me. 2nd the underbelly lights as it traveled above me. 3rd the head lights would dim and fade to black as it passed away from me, and I would observe the tail lights and the underbelly lights. Well this light didn&apos;t follow those rules and it sutatined its single point of light through it entire traverse of the night sky and maintained its lluminosity.  It did appear to be low in the sky although I can&apos;t declare how far that would be.  It made no noise.  After it passed beyond my ability to see it, I noticed that there were many planes in the night sky, more than usual, and their paths didn&apos;t follow what is typically the flying paths for airliners and personal aircraft comiing in and  out of the airports around my area.  Made me think that I wasn&apos;t the only person to observe this event.  A few days later, it was over cast but it wasn&apos;t raining.  I was observing the moon light breaking through the cloud cover and it resembled the NASA Black Brant XII cloud dispersal I viewed on Youtube.  I watched the moon light break through the clouds for awhile as it sustained the appearance of the Rocket launch for awhile.  I have to mention that I felt that something was going to happen, it was odd, and it made me uncomfortable. I looked into the northern sky and observed a light break the tree line, it was followed by 2 other lights. They appear to hold the points of a triangle and were traveling to the south. When I declared to my self that this was not something that I had ever observed before, the 3 lights broke formation and the leading light changed direction towards the west and the other 2 lights followed, but didn&apos;t take the paths of what I would say are typical of things I have seen in the night sky (radical and some what random change of direction.) It was a short event and lost sight of them in the western tree line.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

I thought it unusual since most planes that fly as low as I perceived this one to be, fly south to SeaTac airport or Boeing Field.  Then I noticed that the lights were in a triangle formation, seven lights in all.  I could not discern the craft itself, and I didn&rsquo;t have much time to do so, as it was flying quite fast across the sky.  It didn&rsquo;t make the slightest sound, and since it was early morning the area around me was pretty quiet, I thought it odd.

Yet, the light was much brighter than an aircraft&rsquo;s navigation lights, and not red or green, but orange-white, similar to a flare. See graphic representation no. 1.As the object became closer, I expected to hear the sound of an aircraft, but there was none. The light became more orange, larger, and less bright. Sam, standing about 20 ft apart from me on his balcony said this was the second such object he had seen this night, the first going in the same direction, but much higher.I stepped just inside and grabbed a pair of binoculars that I use daily to observe happenings on the lake. Looking through these at the object, I could see the center of the object was bright orange, surrounded by a dark ring, which in turn was surrounded by a dimmer orange haze. These binoculars were in good condition and fairly clean, they never before produced a haze around a light source. The binoculars may not have been properly focused, which could have made the object appear to have a haze around it, but that would not explain the clearly defined dark ring around the bright center of the object. See graphic representation no. 2.I watched this object with these binoculars as it moved over us for about 30 seconds. It began to slowly fade out. The object did not appear to ascend, nor change size. The objects speed did not change. The object did not approach any cloud, as I checked for this condition as I was losing sight of it.

Well on this night I noticed directly across the lake, there was a star that was as bright as the Northern Star. The difference was the fact that this star was sitting just above the tree line.  I observed it for awhile and asked my uncle to come look at it because I have never seen a star sit that low in my life. He came and looked and agreed that it was strange. We both tried to rule out a radio tower because the light in the center remained white, but out of nowhere there was this red light that seemed to circulate around the white and almost seemed like the colors blended together.  I thought at one point that I saw smaller little balls come out of it, but I couldn&apos;t be sure from the distance I was away from it. We stood and continued to watch the colors like a light show and then all of a sudden there was a quick burst of white lights, as if the object swelled in size and then went back to the same state again.My uncle asked me if I had seen that and I said yes. The flash of white light reminded me of the sensation of a bolt of lightning. He was weirded out and went back to the camper. I continued to watch in amazement and then all of a sudden I saw the object move. I called my uncle to come back and watch to make sure my eyes were not playing tricks on me because I was watching for awhile. When he came back to see, the object moved again. We both decided that ruled out the possibility of it being a radio tower. I continued to watch. The first movement was from left to right at a slanted invert, maybe 35 degrees. Then the object came back on the same path to it&apos;s original position. It then went from the left to the right again in a direct line and then make a movement in the shape of and N. I do not know of any Aircraft that can move in that way. The object did go back to it&apos;s position and remained there for a few minutes and my uncle left again. I had a big flashlight that shone a ways out and decided to try and flash towards the object in a signal fashion (On and Off and On and Off). I noticed that when I did this, the object would start to move again. The best way I could describe the patterns of movement was in the fashion of a diagnostic, but It would always return to the original position it started out from. I then decided to shut the generator off to kill all the lights at our campsite and get an even better view, seeing as I was the only one still up at this point. The part that made me a little nervous was the fact that within 30 seconds of turning off the generator and all of the lights, the object started one last motion from left to right, in an upwards direction of about 35 degrees again just like the first motion I had seen, it then disappeared in the blink of an eye. At this point I figured I should go to bed and that&apos;s what I did. Now it got a little bit stranger from here.... I was sleeping in the cab of the truck, in the back seat. The truck has slightly slanted windows so you can see the sky when you lay down. As soon as I laid down and noticed the stars directly above me, I noticed one of the stars moving. This star was just a white light and not as bright as the one I watched from across the lake. This star did follow similar patterns, but the movement reminded me of how a Water-Spider moves on the water. I really didn&apos;t know what to think at this point. The only conclusion that I could draw from the second object I saw was the possibility of it being a GPS Satellite, but I&apos;m not sure what movement patterns they would use or whether you can see a GPS satellite in Space?  I did watch the first object for almost an hour before it left and then laid in the truck and watched the second object for over an hour before I got out of the truck and went to the lake again to see if the first object came back. The first object never did come back. When I got back to the truck the second object was still directly above the truck and continued to move in random patterns until I eventually fell asleep. The second object I do question was it was because it remained but the major differences between the two was the fact that the second object I observed was outside Earth&apos;s atmosphere and the first object was definitely within Earth&apos;s atmosphere. I&apos;d say only several hundred feet off the ground. The next night was my final night at the lake and unfortunately I was unable to follow up to see if either objects we&apos;re back or still there because a storm front came in and the entire sky was overcast with clouds. I guess I will be haunted for the rest of my days with not knowing what I really saw, seeing as I didn&apos;t make out a specific craft or anything that would allow me to identify either of the objects. I&apos;m not forcing anyone to believe me, but I know what I saw and that&apos;s good enough for me due to the fact that I now have no doubt in my mind that there is intelligent life out there or man has created something that is truly amazing and that should be shared with the rest of the world. Either way, I felt I should share my experience and I hope this may get other people that will be in the area to keep there eyes towards the skies at night because it was confirmation that I&apos;ve waited my whole life to see and be able to put all doubt outside of my mind.

Thinking it was kids scoping out the yard/house for something to steal I sent my rotti out who did not react at all. Then the one sweeping light became two that were perfectly parallel and coming forward towards the house. I then thought it was intentional, and having an X with a restraining order, I thought for a moment he had someone out there and ducked under a glass table, that&rsquo;s when the two parallel lights, about 10 ft off the ground, moving towards the house, went from a pinpoint white light, to a yellow silver dollar sized light, and I said, &ldquo; nothing does that, nothing moves parallel like that and comes at you!&rdquo; my friend ran out and said, &ldquo;there is nothing behind it!&rdquo; I think meaning a light source. Still, my dog who goes off at squirrels, was not at all alarmed, and h! e&rsquo;s 70% blind. There was no sound.  But the two yellow lights came about 20 ft into my fence line, and when my friend got to where it was, it just stopped and was gone.  We got a mag light and looked behind the fence for footprints, but there were dead tree limbs I threw out a week ago, that obstructed the path and there were no broken limbs, even on dried, dead limbs.  There was no way for someone to stand near my fence and with the dramatic angle behind my house for someone to shine any light up my 20 degree angled yard without being at the fence line aiming up.    There was no sound and my dog never reacted as if anything was out there. It was the most amazing and unexplainable thing I&rsquo;ve ever witnessed.", "Object moving at what looked like warp speed with trailing white tailI was driving westbound on Interstate 60 going to work.  I was going through the Ontario/Pomona area. I just happened to look up and to the right when I saw what at first I thought was a shooting star. This object (for lack of a better description) took off in the W-NW direction and left a trailing bright white tail that quickly followed it. It disappeared within a couple of seconds. The only reason that I don&apos;t think that it was a shooting star was because I have never seen one in the day light. At 7:02 AM in the morning the sun has already come up.This object and the way it acted reminds me of how the warp speed looked on Star Trek.", "2 bright lights, that maintained equal distance from one another, travelling at great speed, north-northeast,2 bright lights, higher than a plane&apos;s altitude, but lower than satelites, travelling at great speed, at an equal distance from one another, in a direct north-northeast direction, traversed the sky from above the west horizon to the northeast horizon for approximately 4 minutes at 19:45 on 9/08/09", "About 25 mph and silent tablet shaped bottom covered in small dimley lit light blue lights.   About 50 ft long and 150 ft off the groundAs someone who has spent a life time staring at the sky I have seen some unexplainable things.  But in the last two years I have lived in Mineral Wells Tx  I have seen four unexplainable things in the sky.  In the first case about two years ago I saw something that I can only to explain as the aurora borealis.  Two color changing orbs moving at phenomenal speeds and erratic directions moved from the east to west horizon in seconds.  They were in the same place about three hours apart about march 2007.  I wonder what I missed.But my newest sighting has me on edge.  On 8-27-2009 at about 3:30am I saw what appeared to be a flock of birds come out of a light cloud covering to the east moving to the west at about 100 feet in altitude.  I stepped under a tree to pick up a puppy when I realized that the dots I believed to be birds were stationary to each other.   At this point the completely silent object turned to the north directly above me and then back to the east in almost a u turn.  At this point I stepped out from under the oak tree as it continued to travel in a circle back to the west.  This is when it hit me that I was looking up at a tablet shaped craft about fifty feet in length about a hundred to a hundred and fifty feet above me.  It was difficult to see because the bottom was covered in about thirty to fifty very dimly lit light blue lights less then an inch in diameter.  The lights made it very hard to see because it looked like I was looking through the clouds into a  dense cluster of s! tars.  I think the body was black because I could see a definite outline.  Coming out of its second u turn it was pointing west as it continued to circle.Yes I think this thing was looking back; that is when fear over came my curiosity and I hauled ass inside.  Only to have my fear replaced by intense anxiety as I thought about the fact I just saw a UFO looking back at me from about a hundred feet.  As a habit I second guess myself, it&rsquo;s the scientific process, and I have seen a lot of strange things in the sky.  But this is the first time I have seen anything  that was more then a strange light moving erratically in the sky.  This is the first time I have ever seen something so close to that really spooked me.Here is where it get really spooky; I saw it again last night at about 4:45am on 9-1-2009.  I stepped outside to smoke a cigarettes which is one of a dozen or so ten minute brakes I take a night outside to stargaze.  This time it was moving north to south in a perfectly straight line.  Again it was as silent as ever  and moved in a straight line at about 25mph between one and one hundred and fifty feet above the ground.I just spent the day reading a hundred other experiences with  only occasional vague similarities to mine.  Did I just experience the rarest two minutes of my life or am I loosing my mind?  Why so many different types of sightings; is it the many different ways we can describe the same thing, are we an extraterg,restrial highway, or are we all just nuts and haven&rsquo;t realized it yet?

It was much bigger than an aeroplane, it was a very large circle with a flat bottom and diagonal sides and a rounded top, it was like nothing i have ever seen before! It caught my eye very quickly as it was so big. I was facing east watching the UFO as it hovered and it moved left and then came forwards towards me then quickly built up speed and flew away from me and all of a sudden it was out of sight.

There was a light in the sky like a huge lamp or a flash light. It was turned on over Long Island Sound and very obvious light.  We saw it and then it faded slowly UP outward away from us.  It did not go right, left or down, it just faded away. the light lingered in the sky for 20-30 seconds and everyone sort of got over it.  It still bothered some of us.

At first i couldn&apos;t really be sure what it was, but than it came down from the clouds and i could see it better (the trees and ground cover of the other side of the valley gave good contrast, we were about 3/4s of the way up on our side of the valley).  it was oval, white metallic, and at one point i thought it changed shape but couldn&apos;t be sure.  I&apos;d guess it to be about as large in width as 5-6 feet, but couldn&apos;t judge the distance well enough.  after flying through the valley, it flew up into the clouds again and got smaller and vanished. What was weird was that my friend complained that she was feeling weird and threw up a little under a minute before it passed by... does nuclear stuff/magnetic fields do that to people who are sensitiv! e?

Then appeared two disk or perhaps sphere objects moving in the south direction.  They were white in colour, had a slight hue or glow to them, and perhaps quite large in size. They did not appear to be to far up in the sky and moved at quite a speed, I only saw them in my vision for about 10 seconds at the most before the objects descended in to the southern sky; they disappeared behind some trees and were gone from sight.My mind raced as to what those objects could be.  They did not make a sound so I can rule out fighter jets as they frequently fly over, and rattle my apartment foundation.Since it is nearing winter I had the idea that they might be White Canada Geese flying south for winter, but their was no evidence of wings and the movement was far to fast for any bird.This is the first time in my 30+ years I&apos;ve seen an Unidentified Flying Object.Since they were moving south I thought perhaps they were heading towards a military installation south of Saskatoon called Dundurn.I&apos;m absolutely blown away.

It was 10:30 at night in rural Northeast MS.  My daughter was ahead of me in her car she saw the lights first then as I came up on them I almost ran off the road trying to see what the object was.  We both saw a line of lights with one in the middle blinking, it was  hovering above the ground just taller than the power lines. The closer we got the more triangular shaped the object seemed.  My daughter then called my cell phone to see if I was seeing what she was seeing.  By this time I had drove past the object but could still see it in my rear view mirror. I decided to turn around and go back to get a better look when I got back to the spot, the object was gone.  Nothing flying off in the distance, no trees blowing around from it, no noise, nothing.  When I had first saw it flashing in the distance I was thinking when did we get a cell tower there but as I got closer I realized it wasn&rsquo;t attac! hed to anything. It was just hovering above the power lines and then it was gone. I don&rsquo;t know what it was and I am not saying it was alien in origin but it was definitely unknown to us what it was.  Also in the mid nineties me and my sister where driving from our parents house to my house and as we crossed over a railroad track a glowing green orb dropped down out of the sky, hovered for a second in front of us and then flew off.  We looked at each other in disbelief then drove on home.  Of course when you tell people these things they look at you like you are crazy.

From what appeared to be a stationary point (possibly like a small star) that was the apex, a cone of white light emanated downward.  It continued to radiate downward for approximately 10 seconds, remained there for maybe another 5-10 seconds, and then began to dissipate slowly.

We had a fairly good view of the sky towards the East.  A person sighted a blinking white light.  This person alerted the rest of the group and all five people began to observe this light.  It would blink on, then blink off.  It seemed as if every time it blinked off, it would blink on again at a different point in the sky. At first it seemed to have a general direction of South to North.  However, after 4 or 5 blinks it moved in the opposite direction.  Every blink had the same intensity of white light, however altitude and direction seemed to vary.  It made one final blink, turned off and then an even brighter white light came on and accelerated at a downward trajectory towards us.  It seemed that it was going to hit us when it angled up into the sky at thousands of miles per hour leaving a reddish white trail that arced across the entire visible sky.  The composition of the trail the craft left behind seemed to have a reddish white, very bright dusty appearance.P.S. Upon returning from our trip, I was looking at my digital camera pictures.

It moved through the sky in a pretty straight path though it did deviate from it&apos;s path slight at times. Twice, it quickly skipped forward at 45 degree angles. I will say that I saw the light three separate times so I have no way of knowing if it was the same light three times or individual lights.There were a two separate airplanes in the sky during my sighting which gave a good point of reference. The planes had flashing lights and were much closer as the lights were much larger than the tiny points of moving lights that I saw. While the planes were clearly much closer, the light moved across the sky several times faster than the planes.The first time I saw the light it was flying to the North through the sky and as it flew over my house, it slowed gradually as the light grew smaller until I could no longer see it.

It traveled across the sky going to the South in the same way as before and disappeared again exactly as it had the first time.5 minutes later, it reappeared the same way a third time further to the North, having changed directions to the North yet again. It traveled and disappeared in the same way again. I waited for 10 more minutes to see if it would return and I did not see it again.

I had walked outside to smoke a ciggeriate after dinner as I always do every night. The sky was totally clear of clouds, and as I looked up into the sky towards the northwest direction I noticed that in the distance was what looked like a very small wisp of a cloud. I looked at this for about 3 to 4 minutes and realized that this wasn&rsquo;t a cloud and that this was a small con-trail and that the object was moving towards my direction. I grew up in SanAntonio Texas around a lot of different kinds of air traffic so I can pretty much determine what I am looking at when I see something in the sky. Whatever was in the sky on this day was no plane because planes leave a lingering con-trail. This trail did not linger, also this object was extremely high. I would estimate from my experience of watching aircraft in the sky that this object was above 75,000 ft. I know what planes! look like at a cursing altitude between 33,000 and 37,000 ft. this object was much higher and going very fast. As I watched the object it flew directly over my location, I heard no noise and could not determine the shape of the object because it was either too high or it was too small, but it was reflective and I could see a small object in front of the con-trail. This is where my story becomes interesting. As I tracked the object in the sky I thought it would just keep flying in the same direction but as the con-trail started to finally fade the object re-appeared moving in exactly the opposite direction within about 5 seconds. That is impossible to do with the type of technology that we have now. The object did not slow down and it did not make a wide sweeping turn as a jet would do. This object just did a 180 degree maneuver and proceed in another direction, and the whole time the con-trail stayed the same and did not linger in the sky as all other trails do. This trail! was completely gone and was very small in length. I ran into ! the apar tment and told my wife and she laughed at me for about 20 min. I then went back outside and looked in the same direction that I first looked in and the object was back almost exactly in the same position that it was in when I first saw it. I then went and got my wife and she saw it to, but this time the object was moving away from us and I could see it for a very long time. I don&rsquo;t know what I saw but I do know that it was very high, going very fast and it was not an airplane, helicopter, weather balloon, or anything else I can think of.

It was very cloudy for several days in a row. That particular day there were large fluffy couds -some dark rain clouds, others white- some sat low, while others were very high in the sky....I think there was a cold front. In between some clouds I could see slices of blue sky in a few areas. When I looked up at one slice of blue, a very shingy round/oval/disk object darted accross the sky on a sort of hair-brained odd path that was wavy (almost the way one hops accross stones on a creek). It would be straight one minute, then changing direction like it was changing its mind. It was extremely high in the sky and would be hidded for a moment here or there as it flew above the clouds. It did not look or act like any plane or man-made vehicle I had seen, but it was flying at a high rate of speed it seemed and! , as I mentioned, almost irradically or at least, in an irregular fashion from the way planes fly, particularly considering its high altitude. I eventually lost track of it when cloud cover blocked my view.

I could see my entire neighborhood and all of the sky from that vantage point. I looked up and I saw an orange ball very high in the sky over my neighborhood. The orange ball was about double the size of a regular star. The ball was motionless for about 25 seconds and then it moved very fast and squiggeled, left a faint trail of orange and was gone. When it &quot;squiggeled&quot; out of view it looked like it left a wiggely trail or tracer of orange behind it, which quickly disappeard. The night was fairly clear.

The object was in the general vicinity of Dulles Airport, but appeared to be much too high, much too bright, and moving in the wrong direction to be airplane landing lights.  In addition, the lights disappeared from sight vertically. The object was only about 10-15 degrees away from a planet we believe to be Jupiter, and we noted its relative size and brightness to be similar to slightly larger than that of Jupiter. A massive cone of white light first appeared below the object, then brightened and grew in size as the object rose vertically.  The object and its&apos; cone of white light disappeared from view after 15-20 seconds.

It had the same light colors and same movement pattern, but it moved somewhat faster.  Then I am on the phone telling someone about it, and as the second light moves this dark yellow light is ignited like fire, and becomes a strobe-like light near the ground on the golf course.

Just as our meal was ready to eat, it very suddenly began to rain very hard, like someone had flipped a switch. It had been hot and sunny just previously.We quickly grabbed the food off the grill to avoid getting too wet and ate indoors.About 9pm we sat in my car while parked in the driveway to have an after dinner cigarette, as that I had promised not to smoke in my father&rsquo;s cottage.I was seated in the driver&rsquo;s seat and she was in the passenger seat. The front door of the house was located about 3 feet directly off the passenger door of the car. The front door had 3.5&rsquo;x2.5&rsquo; glass pane window with curtains.Very suddenly, the rain just stopped.It was suddenly deafenly quiet compared to the rain pounding very hard on the hood of my car. I had the strange &ldquo;sensation&rdquo; that something had just fallen from the sky nearby. It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.About 10 seconds later, when I turned my head to the right to face her and comment on the strange weather I saw the creature in the window of the house. It was inside the house holding the curtain back making eye contact with me.It was huge. It was crouching yet its head was still only inches from the 9&rsquo; ceiling of the room. I estimate that it must have been over 15&rsquo; tall when standing erect.  It&rsquo;s hand holding the curtain back was as large as the window.  It&rsquo;s  skin was black and shiny but not wet or slimy. It was very muscular and predatory looking. It had a snout about 6-9&rdquo; long and had pointed incisor like teeth throughout its entire mouth. It&rsquo;s eyes were very human looking and seemed to denote a  very focused look of sentience and/or intelligence. My mouth dropped and I froze. It seemed that even with the two doors between us we were already much too close (about 3-5 feet away) for safety sake.  It was clearly some kind of predator of great physical power. I didn&rsquo;t make a sound. This went on for about 30 seconds. I was making direct eye contact with it. When my college sweetheart  finally turned to see what I was staring at, her immediate reaction was to turn back toward me and start punching m! e in the arm screaming &ldquo;just drive away!&rdquo; over and over again.This shocked me back to my senses. I started the car and peeled out of the driveway immediately. As I drove away I saw it running down the road in pursuit of us, but it seemed to &ldquo;phase&rdquo; in and out&hellip; almost like a bad TV reception. She saw it too. I drove very recklessly to put some distance between us. It worked but even so I continued to &ldquo;feel&rdquo; like we were being watched. We talked about what we saw but didn&rsquo;t know what it was or what to make of it. We were too scared to return back to the cottage that evening. I dropped her off at her parent&rsquo;s house and then drove to Geneseo NY. I still &ldquo;felt&rdquo; like I was being watched. I ran into a friend walking down the street and told him the story. He wanted to see it. I reluctantly drove him there. When we got there he too could &ldquo;feel&rdquo; the &ldquo;vibration&rdquo; and was now too scared to go inside the house. I however felt that I hadn&rsquo;t come for nothing and also wanted to turn off the lights and lock the doors of the cottage. When we went inside! the &ldquo;vibration&rdquo; was much stronger and we both found it difficult to breathe.  I felt like I was being stalked. After about 5 minutes we left. I still &ldquo;felt&rdquo; like I was being watched. For about a week I still &ldquo;felt&rdquo; like I was being watched. Even at times even threatened. I was very scared. I felt like I was being followed. I finally couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore, instead of being afraid &ndash; I got mad! I wanted to challenge it, wanted to physically fight it. That&rsquo;s when it stopped and I never saw it again. I still remember it like it was yesterday, even though for a long time had not a clue as to what it might have been. I just knew it wasn&rsquo;t of this world. That&rsquo;s all I knew.About a year ago I saw a sketch drawing on the internet and it was exactly what I saw.

I immediately tell my friend, this is no satellite.  We discuss what it could be for about three minutes, till it began to move again.  It drifted, dropped, darted to the lift and the right, came back to stationary, and generally danced around like a bumble bee.  Once I was sure of what we were seeing, we grabbed a few more witnesses.  At one point, the craft moved up to Orion&apos;s right shoulder and sat there.  My friend and I were afraid we had lost it, until it started to move up and down, over and over again: waving Orion&apos;s arm at us.  It had to be within 15,000 feet, because I could make out a shape, and distinguish colors of light that it flashed: red, blue, green, yellow, and white.  They wer! e brighter than Orion&apos;s belt, twinkled, and were distinguishable by a haze or glow it emitted. Several planes entered the area but stayed far away from the lights.  The night was super clear, just a sliver of a crescent moon, and not a cloud in the sky. By the end of the night, I had spotted three more disk shaped objects, two were moving in unison.

Its edges were rounded instead of being sharp and there appeared to be something like windows around the bottom part.We left the house and about one-half mile away she saw it again.  She became excited and told me it was aliens.  I saw the object which I first took to be an airplane seen from the side, but it was motionless and silent.  I could not stop because another vehicle was behind me but I did see it as I drove to a place to stop.  We turned around and drove back to get a look.

This was a very bright, clear, deep blue, cloudless day in October a month after the WTC disaster.  We were all standing on a street corner right next to the downtown Atlanta post office and I looked up into the beautiful sky to take in all its glory and as I panned across the top of the Westin Peachtree Plaza hotel something caught my eye.  I saw what appeared to be a &quot;fleet&quot; of UFO&apos;s noiselessly drifting across the sky in a Northwest to Southeasterly direction.  It was an incredible sight to see at least forty or more objects floating at the same speed, silvery white in appearance contrasted against this crisp, beautiful deep blue fall day.  One of the most amazing views of what appeared to be inexplicable objects that I never would imagine I would see, ever.  There is one detail I have left out till now.   I would estimate that from these forty plus objects at least one third of them  there was a similar, silvery white &ldquo;tether&rdquo; or &ldquo;cord&rdquo; that connected between two of the spheres.  This was a very unusual sight.  From the distance I stood from these craft, estimated at approximately 5,000 feet, the &ldquo;tether&rdquo; appeared at arm&rsquo;s length to be the size in diameter of thread used in sewing.  The objects themselves appeared to be the size of a very heavy &ldquo;period&rdquo; one would produce with a pencil on paper, held at arm&rsquo;s length.  When I called attention of this remarkable sight to a local street vendor I was surprised at his reaction.  There was relatively none.  He could care less.  I thought this to be very odd behavior.  He looked up and as quickly as he looked up he went back to his business of selling handbags and sunglasses without uttering a single word.

These are college-educated people with common sense and would like to know what we saw.We all agree on what it looked like with different ways to describe it.  First, it was orange in color with a fire or fire-like source of energy on the inside of this translucent object.  We all agree that it could be described as a small hot air balloon, jellyfish or Chinese lantern.  It was not a total sphere.  You could also describe it as a dome with a rounded top.The object made no sound and traveled in a direct line from SE to NW at a swifter speed than the wind that came out of the east.  We were concerned that if there was fire inside, the hills could be burned if it floated down.  It did not come down, however, and continued at a constant altitude and speed until we could no longer see it.None of us have ever seen anything like it and are very interested to know what we saw.

We saw what looked like a wide blue line that flickered.  You could see it better with your peripheral vision.  The light seemed to move side to side and up and down but hover in the same general area.  I grabbed my video camera and it wouldn&apos;t pick up the lights.  I then grabbed my still camera with a telephoto lens and was shocked to see on the view screen 3 distinct blue lights.  I then took a few pictures and went back to finish our poker game, while my son continued to take more pictures.  The time was about 9:30 pm when the kids first noticed the lights and it was about 10:45 pm when they (the kids) said it slowly moved to the right and lowered out of sight.

I could still see the same shape but the color was gradually becoming dark grey, however it was in the same position from my location.  This shaft disappeared behind the cloud level about 55 degrees where the cloud level staeted assuming that the horizon is 0 degrees.  Below the clouds it was crystal clear. I estimate the size to be a little smaller than a full moon.  Also the shaft of light was not jagged at all, instead it was razor straight.

One person was ab! out 10 miles WNW from me and he and his grandkids also saw the same shaft of blue light.

I found this web site and realized other people did report the incident.  Anyway, my neighbor and I noticed 4 saucers in the sky to the west above the SFV, over Canoga Park, near the Pacific Ocean.  The clouds were streak like that evening and the red sunset was beautiful in the sky.  At around 6:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. (unfortunately not sure of the exact time) but right as the sun was setting that year, we noticed 4 aircraft with colored lights around each of them.  The aircraft were flying in uniform formation, all somewhat close to one another.  I think the lights were blue, orange, red and yellow (not sure how many colors I saw).  Anyway, the 4 aircraft hovered down ! for a short period of time (not sure how far down to earth or how large they were as they were miles above earth)and then as if by mental telepathy they knew we spotted them as we were commenting on them to one another.  Then, the 4 aircraft stopped, changed course and with a fast trajectory zipped into some sort of hyperspeed out of eyesight and were no where to be found.

My impression was that it was three to 10 feet from tip to tip, 20-50 feet above the ground, moving silently at a steady speed of about 10 mph in a straight line. It was very faint, barely visible, perhaps even transparent. There were no details I could make out. I saw it for about three to five seconds, until I lost sight of it. I am not at all certain that this was not an owl or other nocturnal bird, or even a trick of the eyes. I will admit that a few months or so later I saw what I am sure was an owl, and noticing the resemblence concluded that that must have been what I witnessed previously.

That is when I saw a bright white circle with a cone-shaped light shining underneath it. It was hovering over one area.  The circle was brighter than the light underneath it.  At first I thought it was a star, because other stars were in the sky, but then I realized it was much too big to be a star.  I ran inside to get my husband, but by the time we got back outside (less than 10 seconds), the circle of light had disappeared.  There was, however, a very faint bit of light remaining that looked like a cloud. The remaining light was initially the cone-shape that was there when the circle of light was still visible, but once the circle disappeared, the cone-shape also dissipated.  I told my husband that it must&rsquo;ve just been a plane passing through a! cloud, but then I realized there were no clouds in the sky and no plane ever reappeared, as it would after it passed through the cloud.

I had watched this light for approx 4 hours the first night.

I work second shift and got off work at 12:00A.M. At first I thought the lights were search lights for planes because the airport is nearby. I kept seeing the lights too frequently for them to be search lights or even the giant spot lights used sometimes when a car dealership is having a big sale. When I got to my exit, I pulled off to the side of the road and exited my car. I saw 4 large white lights going around in circles. They would meet in the center and spread quickly back out again. I guess I stood out there about 5 or 10 minutes just looking up in wonder and amazement. I am female, and as cars came up the exit, not one stopped to see why I was standing by the side of the road, looking up and pointing at the sky. I called my sister who works at Wal-Mart third shift, just a few miles away and told her something was going in the sky and described what I saw.When I got to Wal-Mart, I went in and got my sister and one of her co-workers to come outside and look at the sky. They were also witnesses to the lights. As one lady was leaving the store, I pointed to the sky and told her to look at the sky.

Hey, if it&apos;s a landing light, how can I could still see it as it winked out over the ocean?  This made no sense.On first impression, a jet and the bright light I saw was the landing light - then thinking about it, No - it couldn&apos;t be a landing light - I could see it as it went away from me.a meteor, A luminescent blue meteor? But, it didn&apos;t &quot;get dim&quot; over the ocean, it just &quot;winked out&quot;. making me think: no smoke trail. How could it be a meteor?  I couldn&apos;t figure out exactly how close it was - but, it appeared at my 10 o&apos;clock and went over the ocean at about my 2 o&apos;clock - and it was only visible for 2-3 seconds. So - it had to be darned close. If I had to guess, less than 200 feet. Maybe 6 to 10 feet long, 4-5 feet wide and 1-2 feet thick.

Mother-in law was outside on the back patio with a couple of her girl friends deciding on where they were going out to eat. This was around 19:50. Being a very clear night sky. Facing south, I looked up and noticed a very bright star a little Southeast from where I was facing. This was just a normal star. I got involved in some conversation and then again at about 20:00 I looked back at the same star just noticing how bright it was on the clear night. I then glanced over to the East. I then saw another bright light that was very high, and illuminating light downward.  (like the sun does when it shines through clouds). First, I thought it was another star, but as I watched it , it was weird since it was shining a very noticeable light down like the sun shining light through the clouds. I just starred at it wondering what it was since the light shining down illuminated like the sun shining through clouds. Not knowing what it was. I grabbed the attention of my wife, mother-in-law and her friends, and my oldest son. I asked them what it was. There was no reply as everyone just starred at it. I would say about 30 sec. after I grabbed everyone&rsquo;s attention, the light giving off the illuminating light started to rise, slow at first straight up. Then within a sec. the light and the light shining downward were gone!! You could actually see the ball of light and the illuminating light rise up.!!! THEN....There was no light anywhere!! It was gone within a sec. of moving up. We couldn&rsquo;t even trace it. It was gone!

Trying to reason by saying it could have been a jet since the Akron/Canton Airport is 10 miles from the house. However, We were able to compare a jet flying in the distance about 8 &ndash; 10 min. later. We all came to the same conclusion. What we saw was not a jet. The jet did not give off nearly as much light as the light we saw in the sky (actually, there is no comparison).  Plus the jet moved. The light we saw sat still for about 30sec. while we all were watching it, The jet was considerably smaller, and had flashing lights. The light we saw in the sky did not flash any lights. We had no answers to what we just witnessed. I would say the light location could have been I the area of Canto! n/Louisville/East Canton, Ohio.

This night was clear but dark, not much of a moon. I remember this because I had dared my friend to walk across to the playground as it was unlit and two baseball fields away and it was, a dark night.  The area is nestled in the woods surrounded by trees and sparsely populated. As we started walking we got about to the pitchers mound when the sky in front of us flashed red. The flash was not like a lingering flash; it was extremely quick and seemed to span the horizon. My friend said&rdquo; did you see that&rdquo;.  It was very strange, and the color was vivid. I remember at the time thinking I hope it&rsquo;s not the nuclear power plant exploding; the plant is about 15 miles down the coast.

As we watched it came closer, it was at our 9:00 position; it seemed to be flying along the railroad tracks when it suddenly stopped.  I new it was not a helicopter because it made no sound and no aircraft looked like this. At this time it began coming toward us.  I would say around 10 mph maybe. I could see it looked like two saucers facing each other with the lights spinning in between. It seemed to have no color that I recall. It was about 100 feet away from us when it again stopped and a beam of light hit the ground.  The beam had a sort of bright bluish tinge. The beam of light started to scan the ground, up back left and right. I told my friend not to move or it will see us. The object was around 100 feet high or so, it was hard to tell. The beam then went off and the object proceeded to m! ove about 50 feet to our right and did the same thing with the! beam, a gain the beam went off. Now the object moved closer, to just above our heads and again the light hit within 10 or 15 feet away and I heard my friend start to whimper.  The light came to a point so close that I felt I could touch it, then nothing the light was gone the object was gone with no sound. We never saw it leave although I was looking at the light on the ground moving around because I didn&rsquo;t want it to see us so I never actually saw it vanish, but it was gone in a second.

Once there we saw nothing then we only walked out maybe 25 feet and the beam landed right in front of us. We all ran, my brother got to the top of the hill first and I heard a car skidding down the road, it nearly hit him as he ran across the street. My father! , a policeman in our town drove me down in the police car after he grabbed a German mp-40 machine gun to take with us.  I don&rsquo;t know what he could do with that but I later found out the police station had got a call from someone else who also saw it. We never saw any sign of it ever again.

I was brought into the craft by two small aliens that stood at my eye level but with such strong strenght they shoved me into a room with a metalic table off to the side of the small room.  The lights in the room had a blue silvery incandescent glow.  A Female alien try to set me at ease by communicating to me not by speech.  I know this sounds off the wall but by telecommunication that we&apos;ve seen in science fiction movies.  She said that they came from another world unknown to us and they plan on not hurting me but would like to perform some quick test&apos;s on me, I was frighented and tryed not to look at her large grey piercing eye&apos;s.  She said please disrobe from your clothing and I shook my head in fright.  It was icy cold in the craft it felt as if I was in the cold outside in the snow.  Then from behind her another alien came walking in and he seemed to be a little angry in the fact that I was still in my winter coat and clothing and was not yet even placed on the metal table for what ever they had in mind.  The female alien then said. look what you have done BoBo is now angry at me allowing you to waste precious time.  BoBo the alien who seems to be in charge looked at her angerly and said why did you reveal my name to this human ! boy.  She quickly than appologized and said look what you&apos;ve d! one he i s now angry again at me.  He walked over to me and she said he is only a small boy he will not remember your name.  Getting away from this ufo encounter from that day on anytime I heard the name bozo or hobo I would feel a chill go up my spine until later on in life I remembered his name and realized why.  I noticed in the craft a engraved picture of a whale on it and it seemed to relaxed my mind a little because everything else in the craft looked alien to me and not reconizable. Bobo noticing I was transfixed on the whale asked me telepathically do you know what that is a picture of I nodded no in fright looking at his taller slender body with a large bulbus head because I was to scared to make conversation with any of them.  He laughed and said when I was your age I had already the intelliegence of five of your highly respected scientists.  The female alien then interrupted him and said that&apos;s not true.  You had the intellegence of 2 of their respected scientists.  That i! s true, maybe I am not giving your kind to much credit because I find you humans to be so ignorant and primitive you have so much to learn about your planet and about yourselves.  All this what you call war towards others.  He noticed that I started to look puzzled and stopped talking about what he thought of humans.  He than pointed to the picture and said that is a blue whale.  That is the symbol we use to identify your planet here in the milky way galaxie.  These whales when they communicate to one another in your blue ocean can be heard millions of light years away to our planet.  Their sound waves travel up onto iceburgs working like a radio wave and reached us millions of years ago and we followed the sounds here to your planet.  I am getting tiered typing this e-mail now and will wait to see if you would like a interview where I can share a whole lot more.  I must say I am glad the goverment keeps all ufo information hidden because what I saw can be mind bottling and! scary for most humans that our weak minded citizens could cau! se great stress in how humans think and excell in life knowing that their our intelligent beings way more advanced then us but the good thing is we have God and that is another subject I will talk about.  One quick data I did some reasurch and believe the craft I was abducted in was the ufo that crashed in Chihuahua, Mexico on 8/25/1974. It has the same discription that I reported and learned of this craft this year watching the new tv show on the History channel UFO Encounters.", "Orange Orb in West VirginiaTonight, around seven in the evening, I was driving home from the store when I saw an orange orb to my left. I was driving down Hospital Hill when I saw it.It flew across the sky from my left to my right behind some trees out of my view.Once I arrived at the bottom of the hill, I saw it still flying down Main Street in the Fetterman area above some houses across the street from where I live. It moved rather slow. I watched it fly over a few houses across the street from where I reside and then it just disappeared.The UFO was a rather small orange orb.  It had no other lights on it.  It pulsated an orange glow. It did not make any sound or noise.I parked my car outside my house.  I did not see it reappear.  This is not the first time I have seen an orb in my area.  This is the first orange UFO I have seen, though.  The others were different colors.  I have a few on video if you are interested in viewing them.

I saw a silver sphere and as I was looking at it two other sliver spheres (smaller than the first sphere) came out of it and began to circle around the larger sphere.  The sphere seems to be looking towards the California wild fires (Mt. Wilson). I watched as a fourth smaller sphere came from the larger sphere.

The object was like looking at a saucer or flat shaped object from a fairly close but side view (see drawing).For a few seconds we watched the object and then it emitted what looked to be a smoke or some kind of water vapor, or vapor of some sort (white like steam) as the light shined through it.It looked like the vapor was forced really hard out of or from the object for a few seconds and then the light, or bright object rose into the sky and dissapeared. As the object dissapeared, the smokey looking vapor stayed there and looked like it stayed lit from the object and then faded into the dark and &quot;un cloudy&quot; star filled sky.In lititz, as we watched this object, Jupitor was to the left if it.The object looked to be only a few hundred feet off the ground.

At first I thought it was an airplane headlight, but then I realized that the triangular beam of light was behind and slightly above the ball and not in front of it as an airplane head lamp would be.  The diffuse beam behind the bright ball began to change shape.  For about a second it was heart shaped and then more triangularagain.  It looked as though it was passing through a cloud, but the sky was cloudless.  The ball of light in the front went out and then within about 30 seconds the entire thing was gone from the sky. There was no associated sound or explosion, no falling debris. Don&apos;t think it was necessarily a space ship, but it was definitely unlike anything that I have ever seem.

I live under an MOA, heard T-38&apos;s flying, spotted dark colored chevron shape. At first I thought it could be a B-2 Bomber but the trailng edges appeared straight and there was no central bulge. Object was westbound about 400kts estimated speed. Disappeared into clouds which were reported to be at 4500&apos; (I called local AWOS). The object made a 180 turn and returned from clouds at same altitude. the object then made several rapid zig-zag manouvers and then pitched down abruptly increasing velocity rapidly. object then made several abrupt turns while climbing up to original altitude. the object then turned to south heading away from my position on ground. I spotted the two t-38&apos;s in formation and moving above me at an altitude slightly higher than object which now was not visible to me.The jets appeared oblivious to the object and continued to manouver.I am a pilot and aerospace employee.This object did not manouver like any conventional aircraft that! i have ever observed. No lights were visible. object appeared to be close to the same size as the T-38 aircraft. max observed speed seem to be 800kts. object was silent, and did not cause a sonic boom.It seemed like it was chasing something smaller that i could not see.

They faded as they moved from NW to SE and SW.  The objects were large and orange, larger than the space station appears.  They looked like large meteors, but did not follow typical trajectory.  One was followed by a small object that did look like a meteor.  The last object was particularly strange as we saw it through the tree line near the horizon and it then traveled overhead.  We have video of the fourth one, but it is shaky due to the zoom.  The entire event took about 5 minutes.The event occurred during a back yard gathering.  The witnesses (about a dozen) were mostly college professors and school teachers.  The object appeared to be a sphere surrounded by diamond.  Oddly, the sphere is clearly brighter on the back edge of its directions, contrary to what one would expect from atmospheric entry.  This was also the north side of the sphere two hours after sunset and was clear even at the western horizon, ruling out solar reflection.I am not suggesting that this is extraterrestrial, we simply cannot determine what it is.", "Fast moving round white light over Hood Canal, stopping and changing direction on a dimeI wasn&rsquo;t going to report this but felt compelled to since I can&rsquo;t get it out of my head.  I would like to remain anonymous though - I will be as descriptive as possible.My two friends and I were camping in Dosewallips State Park in Brinnon, WA where the Dosewallips River meets the Hood Canal.  We were the last ones up at roughly 1am in our area of the campground and we were chatting and star gazing by the camp fire, facing the northern sky.  We had been drinking, but were fairly sober and lucid at this time before we went to bed &ndash; only slightly buzzed.  We are in our mid to late 30&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;t drink a lot in any given sitting anymore.  My one friend and I were looking at the sky and I was watching a high-flying aircraft (pin point of light but larger than a satellite) moving slowly across the sky from the west to the east.  It was partly cloudy that night so we could only see the brighter stars (no satellites).Suddenly out of the corner of my eye I saw a round white light shoot from the eastern horizon to the center of the sky directly above us and slightly north.  It was many times larger than the aircraft but still as high as the cloud cover.  It seemed like it was lower than the other aircraft, which at this time was still way over in the western section of sky moving slowly toward this fast moving object, but I could not tell how much lower (it was hard to discern).  At first I thought it was a meteor entering the atmosphere &ndash; it moved that fast &ndash; a second or two to cross half the sky.  But there was no trail of fire and it was not red or orange in color.  It then stopped on a dime, remained hovering for 1 second above us in the center of the sky and then suddenly changed direction 90 degrees and took off toward the northern horizon, making a couple counter-clockwise loops in the sky, slowed at the end of the second loop and then sped up and shot off to the eastern horizon aga! in faster than it had come into view.  I think the entire event lasted no more than 5 or 6 seconds.  We didn&rsquo;t have a camera anywhere near us and it happened too fast &ndash; even my third friend didn&rsquo;t look up in time to witness once my second friend and I started exclaiming when it changed direction.As it was happening, my mind tried to make sense of it, and once it changed direction I considered the possibility that it was a laser light from someone further away in the camp ground.  But the light appeared to pass over, through and even behind the cloud cover (there was dimension to it in comparison to the clouds) and even passed through the clear night sky.  The light was not &quot;reflected&quot; on the clouds.  I would expect a laser light would not have these characteristics, but could be wrong.  Also, typically the path of a laser light is a bit erratic and the movement of this light was intentional in nature &ndash; it was very smooth and almost gave the impression of propulsion.  I do know that there have been instances of people shining laser lights at airplanes near the SEATAC airport and blinding the pilots - they apparently have been trying to catch the culprits.  But we were nowhere near the airport.My friend (a psychotherapist) and I were left speechless.  We simply starred at the sky until I finally asked if we had both just seen what I think we did.  She slowly said: yes, I think we have.  Our other friend was not looking up to witness.  We discussed afterwards for a period and later in the light of day, and we still remain confused by what we saw, but certain we saw something quite advanced if it was aircraft.Obviously I am aware that this may have been some sort of military aircraft (we were located on the Hood Canal near many military and airforce bases), and that the military is very possibly capable of designing aircraft that can go that speed.  The strange thing was that the bottom of the aircraft was all light (I could not make out the shape of the aircraft in the night sky &ndash; it was merely a light) &ndash; it was not headlights directed through the sky &ndash; the light faced us on the ground.  Also, the speed at which it changed direction was astounding.  If we do have military aircraft that can accomplish what my friend and I witnessed, our military capabilities are far more advanced than I had ever imagined.Not sure if it is of any consequence, but the next night (8/15 - maybe midnight) we witnessed something else.  Facing the same direction we were looking up at the sky on a very clear night, watching the satellites and stars.  Third friend, a massage therapist, saw a flash of light from a satellite in the western sky (as if it took a flash picture of the earth).  It continued to move across the sky to the eastern horizon, and when it got to almost the same level on the horizon as before, the third friend and I witnessed the flash again (very visible &ndash; twice the size of the object itself).  It then disappeared slowly beyond the horizon.  I assumed it was the sun reflecting on the satellite.  No flash from the satellite could be this bright.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It wasn&apos;t flying too fast for the altitude it was at, and made many tight turns quickly. When it first turned it tilted to one side which confirmed the triangle shape of the solid white lights with a flashing red light.Not knowing what it was i did an internet search by writing &quot;triangle lights in sky&quot; and the image results were exact to what i just witnessed.Although on many sites it has been reported that black triangles are quiet, this made a low droning sound which made me look out in the first place, as i had never heard anything like it before.", "Bright light seen over Aberdeen, Scotland, United Kingdon at approx 03:14-03:16 hours.Bright white light - as brilliantly clear as the stars - looked like a very bright star, although closer down to earth, speeded off into the distance (not across the sky,but into the sky, as though moving up into space, yet at a slight angle - i.e. controlled ascent), at a quick, constant pace, yet fading in visibilty - as though a star was being plucked out of the sky almost?

So when I was looking at the stars I noticed 3 strobe like lights heading in a pattern.  3 were flying together and kept going around the sky twice.after that they disappeared and they no longer were there the rest of the night.  I have no idea where they went either, I didn&apos;t see them fly off or nothing and it was a cloudless night too.  It&apos;s a shame I did not have my camera, I also might add that 9/4/09 I saw an object in the daytime on a cloudless day it looked like a saucer and it was metallic looking but it was far away and I could not see it fully.

I witnessed a white round object travelling from the west at the distance of about 1-2 kms max. The background was a absolutely clear blue sky with patches of cloud and a heck of a lot of puffy, white chemtrail lines and even included &quot;X&quot;s. (Crisscross) Watching this white light for about a minute with the naked eye. I pulled out my binoculars for a better view. As I viewed the object at a great distance with a amazement. I could also see through the binoculars to the west. Six or seven smaller white objects around larger one.Or the larger object was closer to me then the others. This could be the first multiple sighting for me this year. I continued to observe the closer object with now my naked eye again. Now I focused on the larger one heading towards me from the west.

Y! ou could almost classify it like a large orb.It moved like the Pac Man game. After 2 minutes of viewing with binoculars on and off. It got closer to me now to describe. I called a Fed X Courier Driver across the street to view.Within 10 seconds where I pointed straight south of us, he too could see the white round object with the naked eye moving across the sky. I passed the binoculars to let him have closer look. He had problems to focus through my binoculars and passed them back to me. We watched the object. as it got closer for another 2 minutes. It was travelling east.Now it was directly south of our position and to our closest point to view. This object travelled in a straight line.. What&apos;s also interesting is a large grayish-white jet flying in from the northwest towards the southeast towards the UFO. The jet was dispensing one hell of a chemtrail and talk about rainbows just behind the jets trail. This jet looked military with a longer wings span, travelling about the same altitude as the UFO.We watch the UFO continue east, as the jet intersected behind the UFO&apos;s flight path. The jet was slightly turning more to a southeast away from the object. Makes you wonder if chemtrails are used to blanket crisp clear blue skies in obstructing vision of UFO&apos;s. The good news is I snapped a picture, the bad news is, it&apos;s a disposable and there was no image found when developed. But at least I have a witness, and it&apos;s his first sighting.

I could see no reflection or there was no color just lights that were dim and not bright at all as I have would expected from a ufo craft.

I took a closer look at it and realized that my initial impression of the craft was wrong, there were no wings, windows or tail like a small plane.  It was bright silver and it gleamed in the sunlight.  It was a very clear day with a bright blue sky, and the craft was shaped like a cigar.  From my perspective, it moved over Route 22, and! it seemed to be very maneuverable.  My son was excited, and when traffic began to move again, he gave me updates as to what the craft was doing.  Unfortunately, there was no good place for me to pull over, and I had no camera on me, so I just continued driving him to school.

We were very surprised to find that the last three photos show two deer being &quot;spot-lighted&quot;. by a bluish-white beam from above.  The beam first shines on both deer together, then on just one after it moves to the left, then on the other back to the right.  The beam definitely moved and encompassed only on the deer themselves, and never lighted the ground beneath the deer.  In two of the pictures it appears that the camera flash reflects off the beam.  We have no explanation for the beam of &quot;light&quot; that appears in these images.  What is shown in the images is exactly as they came off the camera.The images were taken with a Moultrie digital game camera.  The camera is mounted on a tree 6 feet above the ground and about 20-25 feet from where the deer were standing at the time the images were taken (an exact measurement to the inch can be taken if needed).  We pulled the chip about 4 hours after the time on the photos and noticed nothing odd at that time.  I have since gone back and taken a digital photo of the tree canopy from the location the deer were standing and looking up at about the same angle the beam was coming down.  As close as I can tell the beam came from an angle about 20 degrees south-west of nadir.  The canopy at that location is almost solid as shown in the additional image taken a few days later.  In our opinion, there is no way a helicopter spotlight could possibly have generated the beams caught in our digital photos.  Also, we considered the possibility of an insect on the camera lens, but since the lens is separated from the flash, an insect on ! the lens should have just made the image blurry and would not appear as a bright light following the deer.Images 1-3: Deer and beam Image 4 : Tree canopy Image 5: Normal image from this camera", "Brillant oblong object spotted over Aurora, CO.It was a clear, Sunday afternoon.  No clouds.  I was sitting in the kitchen have lunch. My sliding glass window faces my backyard.  My backyard backs up to a park. I live in a new development. The trees are young, not very big. At approximately 13:20 hours (or 1:20 ish) I saw a oblong/oval brillant object in the sky. It appeard like it was floating. There was no noise. It was the brightest and most unusual object I have ever seen. I live very close to Buckley Airforce base. I am very familar with the jets/planes that fly around as well as the very loud noise they make.  The object was not very big, although it was hard to gage the distance.  It probably was the size of an F14 - just oval and made of light. It was sun brillant.  I could make out by the shadows that it appared to have two decks. I watched as it moved behind a small tree.  I waited to it see appear on the other side, never looking away, but it never reappeared on the other side of the tree. I w! ent outside to look in all directions and it just vanished.

My 4 year old son and I went outside to play with his balsa wood airplanes when I noticed a star like object moving west to east directly over our heads.  It was very bright, brighter than any star in the sky and was moving at a rate faster than a jet, but too slow for a shooting star.  It had no blinking lights, just a bright single star like light.  No perimeter of the object was visible.  My angle of view was further west than the pilot that also witnessed it.  It appeared to slightly elevate in altitude before disappearing making me believe that it accelerated at a high rate of speed towards space giving it the appearance that it just went dim.

While still in his bathroom he heard a vibrating hum outside, then went back to his bedroom and looked out the window.  He saw within 20 feet of his window an object hovering slightly up and down, holding a position between our house and a wooded area approximately 100 feet away from our house.  The object appeared to him at this close distance to be approximately as wide as his room, about 12 feet wide, and approximately 5 feet in height. The object was shaped like a flattened football with a dome on top.  My son said if looked down on from above the object would have been shaped like a circle.  The dome appeared to be made of green glass.  The object was colored all black except for a pattern of three sets of square-shaped lights on the side which alternated flashing lights of green, blue, and red.  The object appeared to be disc-shaped, but the left and right edges, from his perspective, had blue lights that glowed continuously and did not flash.  The object hovered there for a few seconds and then moved slowly up and away from our house. The sky was clear and not raining.  Behind the object was a dark background of dense trees.  My son&apos;s window is approximately 15-20 feet above our basement patio, and my son said it appeared to be close enough to be partially over the patio.  The patio extends out from the side of the house approximately 15 feet. I awoke when I heard my son opening and closing doors in the hall when he was going to the bathroom.  I heard him speaking to his younger brother for a few seconds, and then he came to my bedroom and told my husband and me what he had seen.  It was then that I checked the time and it was about 4:35 a.m.  My son was afraid, but calmly related what he saw.  Later this morning after breakfast I asked him with nonleading questions to describe what he saw and to draw a picture of it.  He described the incident the same as he described it at 4:35 this morning, and the picture he drew matches the description of what he described verbally.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The light would get brighter and then darker but not completely turning out. I looked at other lights in the sky to compare and they were blinking on and off, not up and down like a dimmer switch. Also while looking at this it seem like it was changing color. It was moving slowly in a straight line across the sky in the south east.

It was silent as was the first object.  It passed directly over us as we tried to stay quiet to listen.  The glow was brighter than any star in the sky and seemed to be just within our atmosphere.   The object started to dim and turn a slight reddish color.  It dimmed completely and seemed to blank out.  The object never fell from its altitude nor did it change direction..I immediately told a third witness to get out of the car.  I told her she missed a U.F.O only to scan the sky once more and see an exact replica of the glow again.   The third object appeared to be in exact flight coordinates of the second object and repeated the dimming process in the same spot in the sky.  Afterwards I noticed a large plane coming from the East a few minutes later.  Important because its lights were much dimmer and it appeared to me much closer to earth.

We had just gotten off the River Boat Dinner Cruise headed back to our Hotel room at the Radisson.  As we were walking in Riverside Park along the Mississippi River I was taking pictures. The sun was just setting for the evening.  I had snapped a few pictures of the sunset and some of my family. I came upon this beautiful bronze sculpture of a playful young boy &amp; girl.  I took a picture with my Canon Power Shot digital camera.  I was not using the view finder, instead I was using the digital screen.  My boyfriends sister was standing right next to me at the time.  An extremely bright light just above the trees in the eastern night sky appeared on the screen along with the bronze sculpture.  We immediately took our eyes off the camera screen to see what was in the sky, but nothing was there.  My boyfriend thought that it was the flash from the camera.  Within seconds I took another picture, using the same camera and setting. Absolutely no light or flash in the sky. It&rsquo;s appeared at first to be a six pointed star shape, but after some thought I believe it could have been a horizontal oval shape.  The shutter could have stayed open for a second or two and I maybe caught on camera it changing from horizontal to vertical and then disappearing before our eyes.", "I reside in the USA.

He saw a round, moonlike object in the distant sky (nothern direction). The object looked like the moon, but was about 4 times the size of a distant moon. Some round light-like pulses started to emit from the object in circular fashion.  The object then split into two similar shaped objects, with the same pulses emitting from both.

So I look up at the &quot;star&quot; again but this time it was moving to the right from my point of view.  Again I ignored it and told her it was a helicopter, but as I was about to look away i saw it move quickly to the left and then it caught my attention.

Both had altitude between 5-10,000 feet -no clouds in the background-rich blue sky.As I continued to watch these objects in fascination for about 15 minutes.One of the objects moved off at the same altitude,heading southeast,towards Lake Ontario.There was no sound,and they had size way up there ! I then returned my eyes to the spot where the other still stayed almost stationary.I was in just a awe like state,wondering in my mind to identify this thing.Then after 5-8 mins.The second one started to move off.It headed off like the first one.

After about 5 minutes,the second object was about 2-3 miles away from my position.I could clearly see with the naked eye, as it was moving underneath the clouds.It looked like a white  &quot; light &quot; moving eastward.I then lost visual contact due to further distance.I could not believe in witnessing this daylight sighting.Though, I will NEVER forget ,what it was I had witnessed on March 3rd 2003[333].Due to this unusual daylight sighting and being totally dumbstruck.I did not run to get any witnesses to view this dramatic sighting.I must report to you that this was the first sighting witnessed, since August 3rd,2002.This was the beginning of a incredible year 2003-Mars and!

The object was round and either white or silver in color.  It was quite far away, and very small, but definitely visible as the sun was positioned in the northeast sky and so was reflecting very well off the object.  The sky was filled with lots of clouds, but with much blue sky in between.  The day was bright and quite windy.I first noticed the orb moving in a straight horizontal line across the sky from northwest to southeast.  Given the proximity to Charlotte Douglas International Airport we see airplanes in the sky all the time, and initially I assumed that was the case here.  But the object did not look like a plane, even from a distance.  It was definitely round.  Within one minute of my first noticing the object, it slowed, then came to a complete stop. It hovered for a moment, then slowly descended.  I can only guess at the distance of the descent, but it must have been at least a couple hundred feet.  It was a smooth, seemingly controlled, descent that took less than one minute.The object hovered again for a couple of minutes.  It was not entirely stationary, rather it moved around a little bit, perhaps just moving with the wind.  It was very windy on the ground, so it was probably even more so up in the sky where the object was.  Even so, all of the movement I saw seemed very controlled and stable, not as though it were just a balloon being blown around.After this, the object started rising.  It rose back to its original height, in a mostly straight line, but now it was also moving south - away from me.  The object continued to rise while moving south for about 2 more minutes until I lost sight of it.The obvious conclusion is that this was just a balloon being driven by strong winds. And it may have been.  But the object was very visible even though it was very small and far away.   Perhaps a mylar balloon would have this effect, especially with the sun being opposite in the sky.  But given the distance it was from me, I really think the object was much larger than a balloon otherwise I would never have been able to see it.Also, the movements seemed very controlled; it was not being whipped about.  It&apos;s path may have been affected by the wind, but given that it initially was going in a straight line, slowed, stopped, descended, stopped then ascended in a uniform manner it just did not at all appear to be a balloon.", "Brilliant white color cone shaped UFO observed annd filmed quarter mile away in the afternoonThis is my third sighting report of something unidentified Sept.17,2009.

There was a bright star in the south (looked bright like Venus).  The unusual thing was that there was a second bright star (as bright as the other one) just to the west of the first one.  I had never seen one there before.  I told my daughter and she looked up.  She continued on the walk, but I stopped and kept looking at the second star-like object.

This all occurred in about 5 to 6 minute time fr! ame.", "Triangular craft with multicolored lightsI heard a humming sound much quieter than a typical small aircraft but loud enough to get my attention.  I turned in the direction of the humming and saw a vehicle rising above trees at a small park.  The vehicle had 3 large white lights in the front with many colored lights along the wing edges.  The overall shape appeared to be triangular, delta or perhaps a chevron.  The center white light was pointed straight down as the craft was rising but swiveled up to point straight ahead matching the other two white lights when it was just above the trees.  Once above the trees the craft started to move forward on a path that took it in my general direction.  At this point the three white lights went out and only the multi-colored lights on the wing edges remained on.  The craft accelerated while gaining altitude and moved out of my field of view.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

First sighting, object was in the North Westerly sky.  Very Cloudy night, so much so that you could not see thru the cloud layer to the sky above it.  This object was slowly raising straight up at a pretty constant pace.  It can be described as a oval shaped, that had a fiery apprearance.  The object did not make any noise, nor did it emit any smoke, or anything that would lead you to believe it was actually on fire.  The color resembled a molten lava appearance, flickering similar to a candle.  It did not have a strobe light, or any flashing lights visible.  This object slowly raised, almost hovered, until it raised thru the cloud line.  About 45 minutes later, we seen the object again.  This time, the clouds in the sky had broken up a bit.  Still mostly cloudy, but you could see patches of stars between.  The Object was coming from the direction we had previously seen it.  H! owever, it was not rising up, but rather traveling in a Northwest to SouthEast direction, eventually traveling pretty close to over our heads.  At no point was their any audible sound from this craft. The object was moving much quicker this time, but still had the same, Fiery, flickering appearance.  Once this object traveled over our heads, it actually picked up speed traveling to the South.  It then actually made a subtle dart from left to right at one point, making all of us watching actually scream &quot;did you see that&quot; at the same time.  The most amazing part was still to come.  As we all watched this glowing fireball pick up speed, there was a patch of clouds ahead of it.  The object then appeared to &quot;turn off&quot; or change to a jet black appearance.  It could be described as it turned into a shadow, darker than the actual night sky.  It was at this time you could really see the oval shape of the object. When the object turned black, it was only visible for about 4 or 5 sec! onds more before it was out of our viewing range.  The witness! es inclu ded mechanics, computer analyst, sales men, plumbers, Managers, Nurses, and a Doctor.  Most of these people could be described as skeptical, but no one was doubting that we had just seen something very odd.  We are located 15 miles SouthEast of the Detro Metro Airport.  At one point during the first sighting, i actually pointed out a couple of airplanes in the distant sky.  The light was no where near as intense, nor no where near the size.  Also, the strobing light on the airplane makes it a sure give away.  I pointed out the airplanes just as a frame of reference for all of us witnessing this object.  Due to the proximity of the Airport, i have to imagine something was picked up on radar.", "I saw a Small Light in the sky, Then it moved away quickly.I was watching the moon and there was a star next to the moon.

It appeared to have a brilliant white-hot fireball on the leading edge and a tail of light trailing behind. Just behind the leading edge there appeared to be two connected rectangular window pane shaped objects on the craft in the midst of the fireball. The time it took to travel from the eastern to the western horizon was less than five seconds. The object was not ascending or descending, and appeared to be traveling parallel to the power lines which were also laid out east to west.

PPB officers usually ride alone in patrol cars but it was the week of Spring Break and night-shift officers, like myself, were asked to pair up to enforce city curfew ordinances that night. At approximately 21:10 hours, my partner and I were dispatched to cover another officer who was responding to the report of a domestic disturbance. The problem address was located either three or four houses north from the intersection of N Moore Ave/N Jarrett St. Portland, OR 97217 (Latitude: 45.565156, Longitude: -122.667971).After we were done assisting the primary officer on that call (~23:30), we remained outside our cars to discuss the night&rsquo;s events to that point. As we were talking, I glanced to the southwest and noticed two gleaming lights, flying in formation, moving in an east-southeasterly direction. I pointed out the lights to my partner and we walked south 15 or so yards to the NW corner of the intersection. We stood there and continued to watch the lights.The two lights were visible against thick, high clouds. It was not raining, there was no noticeable wind, and no stars were visible. The lights were a pale streetlight-amber, the lights shown steadily, and about were approximately three to four times the diameter of the brightest/largest star I have ever seen in the night sky. The height of the clouds helped me estimate the sources of the lights were no larger than a small shuttle bus. There were no aircraft navigation strobes or safety beacons visible on or near the two light sources.My partner and I both commented we could not hear any sound coming from the lights. The two objects were moving at a speed I judged to be slower than a typical propeller aircraft could travel. We assumed if the light sources were helicopters we were close enough to hear the blades of their rotors and see additional lights on the aircraft. Aircraft was audible in the distance to the northeast. Portland International Airport is only a few miles from that area. However, it struck me as odd that the lights were flying eastbound since almost all air traffic approaches the airport from the south or east. My partner is a captain in the Army National Guard and is familiar with military aircraft. He had no idea what we were watching.The two lights were flying in a loose formation, at the same altitude but one slightly ahead of the other. The northernmost light was leading. The lights&rsquo; relative proximity to one another was also out of the ordinary. I estimated the source of each light was approximately 25&rsquo; in diameter. With those dimensions, I would guess the distance between the two lights was 150-250 yards. It is very unusual to see aircraft flying that near to one another over the city.The lights began to turn toward the south in a lazy arc. The leading light took a wider turn than the other. As they did so, we were surprised to see another pair of lights following the first pair. The second pair of lights was at the same altitude, moving at the same speed, and flying in the same general formation as the first pair. The distance between the two pairs of lights was hard to estimate but I would guess there was a half-mile or so between the two pairs of lights.My partner had received orders he was deploying to Iraq in a few weeks and had bought a video camera in preparation for his departure. He had brought the camcorder to work that night, and he ran back to our patrol car to retrieve it. He returned and began filming the lights as the first two lights began to disappear out of view behind some tall trees. The second pair of lights followed the same course and began to make the same turn to the south when something odd began to happen.The southern light of the second pair slowed noticeably and began to flicker. The random tempo and change in luminosity of the flickering reminded me of a lit candle in a slight breeze. The flickering had been going on for about eight seconds or so when we both saw something begin to &ldquo;drip,&rdquo; multiple times, from the bottom of the object. The molten substance was the same color as the light and it dimmed then sputtered out as it fell from its source. The speed at which the incandescent substance fell from light indicated to me it had significant mass. For example, a drip fell at a greater rate than that of a fizzling firework ember.My eyes traveled downward in-line with some of the drips. I saw the material reignite briefly although it was significantly dimmer. Overall, I estimated it would have taken the material ten seconds to fall to the ground. That intuitive estimate of altitude helped me get a bearing on how far away the lights were from us. I suppose the nearest light passed within 15-25 blocks south of our location. My partner stated military aircraft are forbidden to drop flares over populated areas in order to prevent fires. No unexplainable fires were reported in that neighborhood that evening.The flickering light eventually stabilized and began glowing steadily again as it continued moving to the south-southeast. I estimate we watched the lights for the better part of two minutes. The non-flickering lights did not move toward or away from the flickering light.  That led me to think the flicking light was not in distress.I did not get the opportunity to view the footage my partner filmed. He promised me he would get me a copy of the raw video but failed to do so before being shipped out to the Middle East. I imagine it looks like all the other night UFO videos in that it depicts a strange light with a black background. I do not know if he caught the flickering and dripping on video.I have never seen anything else in my life that I would call a UFO.  My partner and I discussed what we had seen for the rest of the evening and were unable to come up with a plausible explanation for what we had witnessed.", "Upclose saucer experienceAt night on golfcourse with my girlfriend.

The first witness called his wife outside and she saw the two bright lights, one still following the other to the right.

We were looking up towards Jupiter, as it was really bright and the sky was so clear. All of a sudden, to the right of the bright planet, there came this light that looked like it came through a cloud, but there was not a cloud in the sky.  It&apos;s hard to describe.  It got brighter and then a cone of white light shone downwards.  The cone of light was hazy as if there were a fog, but there was no fog or clouds.  It was a completely clear sky.  It traveled along towards us slowly and then slowly faded away.  The total time visible was 30 seconds.  Unfortunately, I did not get a picture of the object. We were not the only ones who saw it.  The people walking next to us were gasping amongst themselves about it.  We walked further into the parking lot and the parking attendants were chatting on their radios about it.  The one man even asked me if I saw it and asked me to confirm on the radio what he was saying to the one other who hadn&apos;t seen it. It was the strangest thing any of us had ever seen and we spent a long time trying to think of plausible explanations for it, but couldn&apos;t.

They all show the same object, something stationary in the sky from about 5:15-7:30 p.m.   At first, we thought it may be a balloon since it is NM.   We were walking into our hotel and saw this and decided to go back to the car and grab the binoculars.  Using them, we could see that it wasn&apos;t a hot air balloon.  It was silvery/pearly white, teardrop shape, but no basket on the bottom.  The inside was dark grey-black, like a small circle in the middle.  It wasn&apos;t moving.  There also wasn&apos;t a string or thing on the bottom showing that it was a weather balloon, either.  I took a few pictures from outside the hotel (you can see the billboard in the pics).We went up to our room and sat in the window seat to get a better look.  It still hadn&apos;t moved, but clouds started coming across it.  Then clouds settled in, so we stopped looking and ate dinner.   We decided to go for a sunset drive by our hotel and into the foothills.  Sure enough, when the clouds parted, it was still there.  At this time, the black area inside of it started to turn orange/red.  By the time dusk turned to night, it started to fade and was gone completely.  All in all, for 2 hours, it didn&apos;t move left or right, up or down.  Considering this, its design, and strange behavior, we decided that it couldn&apos;t be a weather balloon.

It was 5 times larger than the biggest star in the sky at the time and twice as bright. It at first appeard to be an airplane since an airport is nearby and other aircraft were simultaneously visible, however as it went overhead there was no noise and we noticed a wobbling effect every couple seconds.  I should also mention that these aircraft were likely commercial or private and weren&apos;t pursuing this object.  There were also a couple satellites tracking across the sky high up in the background moving in varying directions, they were MUCH smaller and appeared to be moving MUCH slower than the object in question.This light headed SE from NW and would suddendly wobble left and right, in a predictably rhythmic fashion every couple seconds or so.  It wasn&apos;t changing course, instead, it appeared to rattle and continue straight... then over again, similar to wathing the line on a heartbeat monitor.  It eventually faded out of view.I&apos;ve seen this object once before around the same time of evening on what appeared to be an identicle track, size, and brightness however there was no wobbling on the first occasion.

Several things struck me about this event. First, it was very large, covering several degrees of the sky horizontally and vertically. Second, the apex of the cone was flattened, as you would see if someone were shining a flashlight down -- it wouldn&apos;t come to a perfect point, it would be flat at the rim of the flashlight. Third, it did not move at all -- at first it reminded me of a comet, but I knew that couldn&apos;t be, and then a meteor, but that would be true only if it were coming straight at me (which is possible). I turned to the screen door and called for my wife to come see. When I turned back, ther! e was only a luminescent cloud where the light had been shining. My wife, exiting another door, confirmed this. Could it have been a meteor coming head-on at us? That&apos;s the best explanation I can come up with.

After a couple of minutes this fire flared up immensely huge, larger than the sillouhette of a house at night. It was quite blinding to be honest. My girlfriend and I immediately convened that this was indeed paranormal at best. After a short spell of being very bright, the light died down and eventually extinguished.

All the witnesses saw the object at the same time. Most thought it was an airplane. Witness 1 thought it was a UFO on the first pass. The object was straight up in the air then moved lower before it disappeared. The object just disappeared before the witnesses including witness 1. The object moved in a straight path in a northerly direction. The object then vanished in the southeastern sky. The witnesses started stargazing and discussed the various constellations observed in the night sky. Witness 1 saw the craft reappear in the eastern sky, about 45 degrees or close to the horizon,  while stargazing and two two of the witnesses saw what it looked like. The third witness was on his cell phone and missed this. The craft was then golden metallic and triangular in shape. Kept moving normally, moving in a straight line, then disappeared again ! during pass two. The craft disappeared in the center of the sky during its second pass by the witnesses. Shortly after this they observed something twinkle over the El Paso Mountains. Then the object disappeared again. Shortly after this the witness heard a high pitched whistling type hum after the craft left the area in a south to southeast direction. The craft was seen flying over the local mountains when leaving the area. Witness 1 reports a strong need to get out of there. Felt scared by the sighting. All the witnesses got in their car and left the area around 9:15 p.m. local time, because of Witness 1&apos;s strong desire to leave. Witness 2  Time:  8:30 p.m. approximate Duration:  Approximately 30 minutes.Date:  Sept. 12, 2009 Location:  South of xxxx, near the El Paso Mountains, behind community college Weather:  Clear sky, no wind Witness:  Does not wear glasses Size:  About the size of a small airplane (prop job) before breaking into three vertical pieces. Observation:  Craft:  Triangular. Flashing lights in a pattern. All white lights. The pattern observed was:  Center light was off while the side lights were on.Right side back light on. The center light was off.Left side back light on. The center light was off.Cycled through in a regular pattern while crossing the sky. The craft flew close to the horizon during most of the sighting(s). Lights:  Cycling lights were seen through the whole observation.Craft color:  Craft structure looked metallic but color was not discernible. The craft was dark in color (couldn&apos;t describe color) with white lights that  were solid. The actual lights did not strobe but they exhibited a pattern of cycling light formations. The craft color did become &quot;orangish&quot; with white lights when it broke into three vertical 90 degree triangles.Windows: None Aliens/Humanoids sighted: None Sound:  Mixed howl or a &quot;like wind blowing through a mine&quot; and the sound kept moving with the craft. Experience details:  Arrived at the trail head of the college, past the BLM sign giving the trail name, and parked in a dirt area. College was directly to the north of the witnesses. Got out of the car and Witness 2 looked to the east and saw three lights. The two lights disappeared which caught the witnesse&apos;s interest. The lights were observed on the horizon. The lights stuck close to the horizon throughout the flight. Two of the witnesses were talking while Witness 2 observed the object fly east when the object was seen again. The craft turned south and moved in a southeasterly direction skirting the horizon. It was low to the mountain tops. When the object was directly south of the three witnesses, Witness 2 saw the object lights &quot;jump back&quot; before continuing in a southeasterly direction towards Trona. The object flew east before disappearing behind an easterly mountain range. Before disappearing over the eastern mountain range the object broke vertically into three triangular shaped objects which flew separately in formation. When the object broke apart the witness reported the craft became the color orange of a street light while the lights became white.", "A loud strange noise and a blue beam of light showed at 8:15 PM.There was a big noise coming from the east.

The flight took off on time 7:25pm EST.  The weather was completely clear.  I was sitting in a window seat in front of the wing.  At approx 8:30pm EST I saw an light that I can only best describe as a &quot;Search light&quot; directly below me.  The light was a white light (nothing unusual) and it kept pace with an MD80 at crusing speed.  The light would go off completely for different amounts of time.  And stay on for different amounts of time.  There was no pattern.  The light was concentrated/focused in a tight beam sometimes and at other times a wide pattern.  The pattern was never circular or oval but at times square. I believe the source of the light to be very close to the ground.  It would sweep the ground sometimes, appearing to follow a road for example. The light would be more active in rural areas but did shine on buildings and populated areas.  At no time could I see any craft, no flashing/running lights.! I believe the American flight began crossing the Gulf of Mexico near Tallahassee.  The light paced the American flight for Approx 35 mins.  Approx 9:05pm EST when the American Flight began to cross the Gulf, I no longer saw it. IF the light was traveling at 500 KMH (The Crusing Speed of a commercial aircraft) It would appear as only a flash to someone on the ground.  The widest pattern appeared to be about 3 to 4 football fields.  The tightest pattern appeared to be less than one half of a football field.", "looks like a blinking star with white, red, blue lights, appears and disappears  It appears low in the sky.This isn&apos;t the first time I&apos;ve seen this!

It was a bluish white light in a column that did not reach the ground. Within seconds, it broadened to a conical shape and reached its maximum brightness. It then faded away over the course of the next minute. It never moved laterally. There was a slight vertical movement as it developed, but then it was stationary as it faded away. My imprssion was that it was very far away. My guess was that it was vapor in the stratosphere lighted by the twilight. I have no idea what caused it.((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.

I say &quot;strange&quot; because neither of us had ever seen anything like it before.  It was significantly bigger than a typical airplane or helicopter light; it was amber orange in color; it was very bright in the cloudless sky, even with the full moon; it did not have a well-defined outline &amp;#8211; more like a flaring ball of plasma than a solid circle; it was a steady light, with no flashing or strobing.  The speed seemed to be about the speed of an airplane. When we first looked up, we were afraid because we thought a plane was on fire.  But it was traveling in a deliberate, straight line, going in a SW direction, approximately 45 degrees up from the ground.  We could not discern how high up it was but the size made us think it must not have been at a high altitude.  We heard no noise from the object.  It never veered from its course but c! ontinued on in the same direction the whole time.  At some point, our vision was obscured by trees in the distance, but the object did not reappear from out of the line of distant trees.  It seemed to have disappeared.  We looked for it for a long time afterward but saw nothing.  At the point where it had been obscured by the trees, it was still visibly large to us, so we doubt that it simply got too small to see in that short a time.  The entire sighting took several minutes as it went from the NE sky (where we first spotted it) to the SW where it seemed to have disappeared after our vision was blocked by the tall, distant trees.  We saw airplanes flying over the same general area both before and after we saw the amber light.  Seeing them right after the amber light confirmed to us how different they were.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

What appeared to be just North of Dillon Rd., was a flying object going Westward. Although I was not close enough to see great detail (I was about 3/4 of a mile away), it did not look like anything I have seen before; it was flying slowly at a constant altitude (approximately 100-150 ft. off of the ground).  It was going slower than an airplane and appeared far too big and rectangular to be a helicopter.  Because of it&apos;s rectangular shape, I first thought it was a banner trailing behind an airplane (like the type you see at sporting events).  There was definitely no plane ahead of it though.  It was broad daylight and many cars were on the road...surely someone else saw this today?  Also, perhaps coincidentally, my car&apos;s engine timing seemed &quot;off&quot; for a minute...the engine reved up and down while at a stop light.NOTE:  there was a reported UFO sighting in the area (on Dillon Rd.) about two weeks ago; it was reported in The Broomfield Enterprise.

At a house on Woodlawn Ave. in Walled Lake, at around 10:00 p.m. on Saturday, 9/19/2009, we were all outside. We noticed a group of 3 round orange lights coming out of the southeast sky heading northwest, then turning gradually west. They appeared to be moving slowly and made no noise but they seemed to cover a lot of distance quickly; they looked like they were about 4 miles away when we saw the area they were coming from and it took them roughly 30 seconds to be over the top of us. Though they looked like about 4 times the size of the brightest star in the sky or the size of a porch light from 50 yards, we could not tell exactly how big they actually were.  They seemed to maintain the same size the entire distance. As the first group went over they disappeared overhead but not into the clouds; it was mostly clear except for some very light clouds overhead and I don&rsquo;t think they were high enough to even be in the clouds.  There were many visible stars in the sky.  It made no sense that we couldn&rsquo;t see them after that.  The glow of light was not like a flame though close to the same color. The glow of the light didn&apos;t go outside of the object. They stayed as glowing circles and didn&apos;t vary in shape. They didn&apos;t fizzle out, they just disappeared. Seemed to be burning off energy from the front while traveling forward. As the first group disappeared another group of 5 appeared coming from the same direction and maintaining the same course. They were grouped together at what appeared to be about half a mile from each other and maybe a half mile to a mile up in the sky.  We did see a steady flow, where there were at least 12 visible at the same time, at different distances, this continued for at least 15 to 20 minutes. We saw a total of approximately 35 bright to dark orange, round, orb like lights, no blinking lights on them, no headlights, just a sort of bright to dark orange glow.

We did see 2 jets,  one with blinking white lights and one with red and green, flying over, way, way above these lights, from west to east, the jets lights were only tiny dots. I have never seen anything like it. The people that I was with speculated on what they could be. Some said flares;  flares would glow brighter or flicker.  Some thought rockets, maybe from Williams Research; they seemed like they came from further away and if they were rockets we should have been able to see them as they went by, they disappeared almost directly overhead.  Some thought maybe we had launched nukes and were at war; there was nothing about it on the news. This was not NASA&rsquo;s launch from Virginia.

Then, three lights appeared almost simultaneously--one, two, and three. They faded out in the same order. We saw one or two more lights, and my husband remembered that we had our night vision monocular in the truck. He saw the last orange light with the night vision and saw that when the light went off, there was still something there that we could not see without the night vision.For about 15 minutes, we watched a number of small spheres travel back and forth in the areas where we had seen the orange lights. One of the spheres appeared to pulsate, but the others were just faint solid objects. We saw no more orange lights during this time.

I would say this object was about four foot tall at the max, it was maybe three and a half wide. The shape best I can describe was something like an old arrowhead. This object was motionless when I first noticed it however, it was not there when I looked up in that direction a few seconds before. It was black or dark grey in color but it wasn&rsquo;t a solid object, it was almost like looking through dark window tint, transparent in a way if you will.

There was no movement for a couple of seconds but the object seemed to wrinkle and take a textured look quickly. The object then lifted off the ground and projected in a straight vertical line upwards. It went straight up and was gone extremely fast, out of sight in maybe a second tops. Whatever this was kicked up dust from the area when it went up but showed no signs of damage to the grass. It also made no sound at all. There were no lights, disc shape objects or any of that foolishness. It was just there, changed its texture and then shot up out of sight. It was a normal sunny Florida afternoon about 3:30pm.

It was dusk, if I had to guess it would be about 6:30pm to 7pm. There was enough light outside to see but not like day time. I had walked out of the house onto the car port and towards the parking area where a family member was parked. They and my parents were coming right behind me. When I cleared the edge of the car port, I looked towards the right and saw this object once again. This time it was located under two very large oak trees that are about sixty feet from where we were. Once I realized what I was seeing, I turned to my family to get their attention so they could see it. When I started yelling to get them to look I turned back to point at it and the object seemed to wrinkle again like the first time. Maybe a second later it shot straight up through the oak tree breaking or shearing off up to two and a half inch diameter limbs as it went up and out of sight once again. The others never seen the object howev! er, they did see the aftermath of limbs falling from the event. Looking at the limbs, they were not clean cut but broke off from the object.

I looked above me in the direction of NW and witnessed a brilliant flash of light in the sky.

I will note that no alcohol had been consumed that night, and I do not ever partake of any drugs.

I looked in the direction that my son was pointing and also clearly saw the object.  The object was an egg shaped light that emitted streams of light from the bottom which radiated out of the bottom in the shape of a cone.  Picture a egg shaped flood light shining down, that was the image we were watching going up.  My son and I had the object in our sights for about 5 to seconds and then it just kept going until we couldn&rsquo;t see it any longer.

I noticed some orange lights in the sky. My kids thought that they were planes because we live near a military base. They moved in a different way than a plane and the planes here do not have orange lights. They were not moving like a helicopter either. They were a different shape, almost like an oval-ish triangle. They moved horizontally and were low in the sky, then changed directions and made a diagonal shift upwards then again until they disappeared. We watched them for a good 10 minutes. There were 2 of them that we noticed. They were not moving simultaneously and they were a slight distance apart. The one disappeared before the other.((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.

It was quite high up, near clouds but could be clearly seen with binoculars. Did not appear to be a plane or anything else recognizeable.

He noticed other people looking up in the sky so it caught his attention.  The object was in the south eastern sky. It was not a plane or helicopter. The people I talked to who saw the object all agreed to that. It was red in color and appeared to be bright, almost glowing on and off. It looked like it was fairly far up in the sky because a visible star or planet was just to the north of the object, so I kind of used that as a reference.  Another friend of mine who has his own local cable TV show was at my stand and he had his video camera with him because he tapes all of the street fairs in the area and shows the footage on his show.  He filmed about 30-60 seconds of the object and he zoomed in and out on the object and after watching the video replay on his camera, when he zoomed in on the object, it appeared to be white in color.  He has promised to give me a DVD copy of the footage which I will gladly mail you if you&rsquo;d like. I should be getting the DVD over the weekend. Please let me know if you would like a mailed copy. Maybe it was a weather balloon or flare or prank by someone but I&rsquo;ve been an advent sky watcher for UFO&rsquo;s and this is the first time I can actually say that I saw a UFO. I&rsquo;m not saying that it was a space ship, but no way was it a plane. The object eventually seemed to fade away and get smaller and then a cloud moved in front of it and it was gone.  The reason why I say it could have been a flare is because about six months ago, reports were all over the Star Ledger (Major New jersey newspaper) about red lights in the Morris County sky (I live in Morris County) and the sightings occurred on multiple nights and were compared to flares. If you Google &ldquo;red lights over Morris County NJ&rdquo;, you may see the articles. I am a grown man and would never waste my time with a bull shit story and as previously mentioned, I&rsquo;ve always been fascinated with UFO&rsquo;s ever since I bought a book in the 1970&rsquo;s titled &ldquo;Is something up there&rdquo;  I would very much like to hear what you have to say about my sighting.  Right after the event, I called a New York radio station to see if they had any reports of flying saucers in the area and they said no.

Out of the corner of my eye I saw movement and focused in on it.  An object was moving at an extrememly fast rate from the west.  It was an oval shaped object which at first I thought just had some white coloring on the outside edges opposite each other but then realised I was seeing lights when the shape moved over some slight cloud cover to the west of my house.

I was awakened by splashing noises and water smells.  I looked out my tent door and saw a bright light gliding over the lake sucking up the water.  I was curious and frightened.  I laid face down and watched the light move over the water.  I started to worry about it and tried to wake up my tent partner. I could not wake him from his sleep and moved back towards the tent door but stopped.  I saw hairy 2 legged monsters.  I backed away from the tent door but could still see their images because the light was now closer.  I don&apos;t remember much more except that I have unending dreams of being pulled into the lake and emerging inside a cavern under the lake.  There was air, but it was hard to breathe it and I could see moving shadows.  The inside of the cavern had some kind of light source. In my dream I pulled out my scout flashlight with the rubber seal and point it toward the shadows and see spider like creatures, ! but hairy with tall thin legs. My light bothers them; I don&apos;t know why the light is an irritant.But, they move to my left and right as though they try to surround me. My flashlight dims over time and now I can see their wet black eyes. I hold back my tears and try to shout but I can&apos;t hear myself. Exhausted and with little light left they stick me with their pointy legs and smother my breath. I always wake up the same way I did that same morning after, soaked with sweat or lake water; I can&apos;t tell which.  I am scared to death every night I sleep, because I know they come in my dreams and I can&apos;t stop them.

It weighed about a pound and! was about the size of a small orange.  The doctor said it was! an unus ual size and sent it to the lab for biopsy. That lab was flooded and the tumor was lost.  I have always wondered if that tumor was a spider sack?  I guess I will never know. If anyone has had similar dreams, I&apos;d like to know?

And after the few seconds elapsed it went from being on to off, and judging by the brightness of the sphere when it shut off so signal like I never forgot about when I was trying to signal them in a similar fashion.That&apos;s just one of my sightings in Rockford Illinois and probably the strongest case I have here to instill my belief in a higher existence.

The object was stationary and continued to be observed from the corner shopping center, surrounding streets, neighborhood and from any point on the family property adjacent to the eleventh tee of the Painted Mountain Golf Course in far northeastern Mesa, Arizona.  The duration of the sighting was between four to eight minutes with a desert monsoon thunderstorm cell moving in from the north at approximately twenty-five miles per hour ended the sighting by piling in to mask in part, then wholly obscure the apparantly stationary object.  The angle of observation f! rom the mean horizon (Horizon is mountainous and a badlands region) of approximately forty degrees of angle.  The Azimuth from the driveway of the witnesses&apos; home was a north-northeast heading of approximately twelve degrees.

No stars were visible in the northern or eastern sky above or between thundercells.  The quality of the light on the object precluded any possibility of it being illuminated by reflected or refracted light from the sun due to it being the wrong color and spectrum.SPECIAL NOTE: OBSERVER&apos;S OPINION:  If the object were in fact an intensely glowing helium weather balloon, the altitude would be above twenty thousand feet and the size of the expanded gas bag would be a quarter of the internal volume of a sports stadium.  The flourescent spectrum-appearing internal glow was of an intensity that battery power for such a structure would be the size of a Uhaul trailer and would be too heavy to lift.

That approach corridor takes the aircraft over the northern crags and spurs of Superstition Mountain and the Tonto National Forest.The entire flight pattern was at far lesser altitude than the object and was under the acumuated thunder cells inbound from both east and north.Lightning was flashing at a rate of severa discharges per minute both east and north from an azimuth of 120 degrees to zero degrees.", "Strobe flashes moving in a way which no space- or air-craft is capable of  Strobe flashes White/Blueish 0f high energy.

Our house is quite close to the local airport and is almost directly under a common flight path taken by incoming airplanes. It is therefore extremely common to observe planes with bright, white flight lights approaching from the south. For a number of reasons, however, this was different:  1. Even indoors with the windows closed, you can always hear approaching passenger planes. They are very loud, because they are very low. This object made no sound audible from inside the house.2. The path taken by planes on their approach is completely predictable (essentially, they go over our neighbor&apos;s house to the east). This went over our neighbor&apos;s house to the west.3. It was moving very slowly. Because it was a light in the sky, I feel it&apos;s hard to say how far up it was; it seemed like it wasn&apos;t much higher than 2 or 3 times the height of the tall, mature trees in our neighborhood. Could be wrong about the height. Regardless, it appeared to be making the progress of a car going around 5mph (if it was as close as it appeared).4. The light was bright amberish orange, unlike the lights of the passenger jets that pass overhead ... bright white at first and then red and blue flashing lights as they get closer.Because it looked odd, I went outside to our porch to get a better look. I found it in the sky again outside. I could still hear no sound. Again, it seemed strange because it was moving so slowly. Its path was completely straight and it moved from roughly south to north. I tried to film it with my cheap digital camera, but the camera was unable to pick up the small light. After a minute of observation, it had finally reached a point parallel with our house. Then, the light dimmed out completely. As I turned to go back inside, a speck of light shot very quickly upwards from the point where the light had dimmed.This final observation, of sudden insanely fast movement, is what really spooked me. I&apos;ve seen plenty of lights in the sky that have seemed odd, but I always felt that my impression could be a misinterpretation of something mundane.

We sat admiring our work while we both smoked a cigarette.  I was talking to her and looking up at the stars as it was a beautiful clear crisp night.  I noticed a brightly lit object approaching at high speed from the north.  I kept looking trying to figure out what it was.  At first it kind of looked like a big white bird gliding through the air with light from below reflecting off of it.  As it got closer I realized that it was not a bird.  I immediately told my girlfriend to look and she spotted it right away. We both watched it fly from north to south at a very high rate of speed. It was a bright white light, kind of chevron shaped. At times it kind of looked like 2 chevron shapes but the whole time as only one unit.  As it headed south it took a slight, but very noticeable, left turn to the southeast and then a right turn back to the south.  It ! was hard to judge the altitude of the craft but it looked to be maybe 10,000 feet or higher.  I have seen many satellites during my career as a pilot and for sure this was not a satellite, it was low and moved across the horizon much faster than an orbiting object.  Also, the object was very visible and large with a distinctive shape, not just a star size as a satellite appears.  The speed was definitely super sonic/hyper sonic.  I saw it the whole time from a small light to the north until it disappeared out of sight to the south.  The whole incident lasted maybe 10 to 12 seconds so it was moving fast!   There was absolutely no sound at all, I listened very close for a couple minutes after it had passed for any sort of sound trailing behind it and there was none.  The exact time was 9:41pm.As I mentioned, I am a professional pilot.  I am a pretty good judge of speed and altitude.  In my opinion this was not a military aircraft as it was traveling much too fast, was brightly lit and there was no trailing sound.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure military aircraft, unlike civilian aircraft, are allowed to travel supersonic speeds over the continental US; however, this was at lower altitude and over a major metro area.

When it happened again a few days later I did not even really sit up...I saw it enter and just lay still... I was being observed..but I felt that perhaps it could read more information about me than just visual but that is only my impression or feeling at the time. I had no sence of impending danger.I would like to know if such things have ever been reported before.

It was extremely bright with the reflection on the ocean right up to our beach 100 feet away.  It was not moving and there was no noise.  A second light exactly the same appeared right next to it and both faded away after 10 seconds.  I yelled to my wife to come and see this but by the time she came they were gone.  So I grabbed my camera and went back on the deck and flashed it in the same direction.  Within two seconds one of the lights turned back on in the exact same spot aimed right at us and my wife got a good look at it.  I then took a picture of it while it was fading away and got a good photo of it.

But at this point it sat so still, we continued to believe it was a heavenly body of some sort.But the lights looked so conspicuously different than anything else, we continued to observe it carefully.  At first it moved about the speed of a bright planet setting on the horizon.  Then it seemed to set  fast but had moved slightly south.  We lost sight of it and it looked like it was gone so we ignored it for about 10 minutes.Suddenly, it was there again sitting in the sky higher up than when we last saw it and much further to the south, more in front of us.

It was dim, perhaps transparent; I could barely make it out.  I just noticed the movement - it would have been easy to miss.  It did not have any details or color I could make out.  My impression was that it was anywhere from a few feet from tip to tip to maybe 10 feet.  It seemed to be around 50 to 100 ft. away, moving 10-20 mph.  The bow center or angle corner was the front.  It moved silently in a straight line towards the south or southeast.  It went behind the trees, and I didn&apos;t see it again after that.  The total duration of the sighting was about five seconds.I will admit that what I saw could have very well been an owl or something (or even a trick of the eyes, e.g. a &quot;floater&quot;), but I cannot be certain, so I thought it would not hurt to report it, especially since I witnessed a very similar phenomena a year or two earlier.", "circular stationary white light shining straight down thru an apparent hazebright stationary light in sky, looked as if it were a huge flashlight shining down thru a mist.  the night was clear, no clouds, lots of stars...the light was white, and dispersed the light in a conical/teardrop pattern.

The object can best be described as the size and brightness of Jupiter but red.  The light also seemed to fade in and out at times slowly, not like the strobe light on a airplane.  We stood there for between 30 seconds to a minute while the object continued on its southerly path, until it turned towards the west and within a few seconds was gone.

Clear blue skies were present. I was outside my office and I looked up at a passing commercial jet.  As the jet passed over, it flew by a stationary bright (white in color) object, I could not tell the actual size or altitude of the object. Based on my observation it appeared to be slightly larger than the jet with no wings. It did not have a well defined shape, but it was close to rectangular with lumps on each side. It was sort of blurry with no sharp edges.  I don&apos;t think it was the same altitude of the jet because the passing aircraft did not alter course. The object could have been above or below the aircraft. The distance between the jet and object was about the width of a pencil held at arms length. At first glance I thought maybe it was a clump of balloons; however when I took out my cell phone camera to snap a picture and looked back u! p, the object had vanished.

We partied well into the night, and it wound up being just myself, my brother and two or three friends that were still awake at 2:00 am.While the two or three friends stayed at the campsite talking and playing cards, my brother and I went fishing off of Soldiers Bluff.It was there, while sitting on an ice cooler, rod in hand&hellip;eyes on the stars, that we witnessed this event. I had noticed a white light moving across the sky that was to close to be a satellite in orbit. As I watched this light, I noticed a smaller one appear next to it that I assumed was the other &ldquo;wing light&rdquo; of the &ldquo;Plane&rdquo; and that it was turning towards us. As it continued to &ldquo;Turn&rdquo;, (One was slightly higher than the other) the lights got further and further apart. The further apart they got, the more I thought to myself &ldquo;My God, That&rsquo;s a HUGE Plane. As they leveled off, seven smaller lights appeared to swoop into formation with the other two lights. They now were heading in the opposite direction they had originally been traveling. The first light was very large and round and white. This was being followed by seven smaller round white lights. The light taking up the rear was a large white rectangle. We stared in total disbelief as the 9 craft soundlessly floated across the sky in front of us. We remarked to each other as to what they could be and finally decided it was a small plane pulling a lighted banner. AS SOON AS I said that to my brother, the craft in the rear raised up slightly higher than the others and SHOT forward halfway up the formation, very quickly, where it stopped and slowly floated down thru them to be below them where it hung there motionless until the last little light passed it. As the last light passed over it, It raised back up behind the last little light and continued across the sky, taking up the rear, till they were finally indiscernible.We had asked our friends if they had seen them also.

We observed the light for probably about four minutes total.  Then, one at a time, the lights went out.

I continued watching it, as it was flickering different colored lights (red, blue, and white) and kept my attention.  After some time (probably 30-40 second), I noticed it wasn&apos;t moving.

He watched it for a few seconds and went through the same thought processes I did.  At first he thought it was an aircraft, until he noted it wasn&apos;t moving.  Then he offered that it might be a &quot;nova&quot; (he is studying just such a thing in school).I sent him into the house to get our digital camera, and I took several photos of the object, but it appeared that the camera was unable to capture an image.We watched for several more minutes, and noticed that it hadn&apos;t changed its location or actions.  The evening was fairly cool, so after 10 minutes or so, we decided to go in, and I would check it later.Thirty minutes later, I went back out and searched the general area of the sky, and the object was gone.

I know it was in a different position because when I first saw it I compared the position in the sky to the  plant on my patio railing.  I looked at it for another 10 seconds or so to determine that it was definitely stationary in the sky.I closed the curtain, because my dogs will stare in the patio door instead of doing their business, and went over to a window on the same wall and two feet over from the patio door (taking about 2 seconds to do that).  I could not see the light anymore.  There are no large objects on my patio which would block out the area where I saw the light, in fact I have a very clear view of the sky from the entire North side of my house.  I got right up to the window searching for the light all over the sky and horizon.  Did not see anything but a few regular stars.About 3 minutes later I let my dogs in and saw the light further down on the horizon, just above the clouds and more toward the West visually about 1 foot above the horizon, above the town water tank.   I had looked in that area minutes before and did not see it there.  It appeared further away because it was about 3/4 the size as when I first saw it.  I went outside stood there for approx. 5 minutes watching it.  Getting cold, I went inside and watched it for 45 minutes.  I watched the light stay in exactly one position, still very bright and still twinkling 2 different pulses.  There were tiny flashing lights that would pop up all around the sky near the light at different times, about 8- 10 of them.  At one time a cloud passed in front of it, but it was still there once the cloud moved.  The clouds slowly went away, and now it was completely clear.  After 45 minutes,I walked over to grab a chair to sit in to watch it, when I returned seconds later, the light was gone.  I ! right away started to e-mail my Mother, when I noticed my computer was 2 hours off.  I had not been that way the night before because I always check the time while I am e-mailing someone.

Need clarification.December 23, 2001    To whom it may concern,   On or about October 5, 2009 I was outside at night and became interested in taking a photo of the moon through some over-hanging trees. The moon was full or nearly so, the sky was a bit misty, and it looked like it would make an interesting shot. There was a very dim incandescent yellow light behind me.I was shooting with a digital camera and had the flash off. The camera was set on auto-focus. Because it was dark I couldn&rsquo;t be certain I had correct focus, and the camera was hand-held so I couldn&rsquo;t be certain I was holding it still enough to preclude blurring.I took 6 or 7 shots right in a row, over the course of about a minute, without changing position. I did change the zoom a bit with each shot, blindly attempting to bracket the shots in hopes of getting at least one crisp, focused, and non-blurred image of the leaves.Sometime later I viewed the pictures on my computer. Only then did I discover that one of the images had a blue orb in it. I did not notice the object while taking the pictures.  I was using the LCD monitor at arms&rsquo; length for composition; the camera is otherwise a viewfinder that&rsquo;s difficult to use, especially at low light levels.I haven&rsquo;t assumed it was a UFO or a &ldquo;physical&rdquo; object. But I am no less curious about it, and wonder if I can have the picture analyzed.I thought perhaps it was a refraction within the lens. But, again, this orb appears in just one picture and not the others despite the fact all were shot at the same time under exactly the same conditions.When enlarging the image on my computer there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a clear indication that it is the result of refraction. Further, at maximum enlargement, the blue orb seems to have structural depth, though this might be pixel positioning or pixel structure.Considering the potential, however slight, for actual structural depth, coupled with a little imaginative assumption, I thought it might be a disc traveling perpendicular to the ground.The object is round, powder blue, and looks like a ball. It looks much like a planet might look if observed through a powerful telescope.I was shooting more or less straight up and overhead while facing roughly ESE.I haven&rsquo;t altered or otherwise fiddled with this image. You&rsquo;ll notice that there are &ldquo;holes&rdquo; in the image, areas where my camera media-card is losing pixels. I was tempted to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; these, but decided against it to preserve the image &ldquo;exactly as it was taken&rdquo;.I am e-mailing the picture to you too. Not knowing your parameters I&rsquo;ll send two copies, one at the original size and the other reduced to &ldquo;e-mail sizing&rdquo;.Thank you", "12/11/09 Dexter, Michigan 20:00 hr 4 lg brightly lit objects moved E to W across the N. horizen, NO SOUND able to turn instantaneously~ 8pm (EST)  December 11, 2009, in Dexter Michigan &ndash; (very north Washtenaw county)     Weather: clear &amp; cold 15degrees F  Four large air ships, lit up with bright lights (more like lights would be on a ship than an airplane), moved across the north sky close to the horizon from east to west.

The &quot;star&quot; then seemed to fly in a slight zig/zag pattern.  As it got closer there appeared small rectangular shapes at the bottom of the object- these rectangles had a blue/grey hue to them, and there were two small flashing lights- a white one at the top and a red one at the bottom.  It flew off and disappeared.  About 15 min later another golden star was spotted (North over Kerhonkson and heading south).  This one flew in the same zig zag pattern, as it passed by we snapped some photos.

On 12/01/2009 at about 22:55 I was walking around an apartment complex in the city of Napa, CA.  My girlfriend was talking to her mother on the phone and she had me on the phone as well.  I was listening to my girlfriend talking to her mother through my Bluetooth device.While walking around this apartment complex, I happened to look up through the trees, toward the south.  I saw a bright light in the sky traveling northbound.  At first I thought this was a plane that had just taken off from the airport with its landing lights still on.  Then I noticed that it wobbled as it traveled and had no flashing lights on it.  It was also a little larger and brighter than any of the stars in the sky.Still thinking this was a plane, I found a larger opening in the trees and continued to watch it.  It appeared to stop briefly a couple of times.  The light traveled until it was almost straight up from where I was. It was still slightly south of me though. It just stopped in the sky and hovered.  There was no noise to it either.  As I watched this thing hover, I could see two horizontal lights on the sides of it.  For a moment I thought it could be a blimp with words scrolling on the sides of it but it was too small or too high, to be a blimp.  And a blimp has the lighted words on opposing sides.  This thing had the lights forward on each side, not opposite of each other.As I stood and looked at this thing, I realized this was not a plane and told my girlfriend to go outside and look at it.  She, in turn, told her mother to go outside and look too.  My girlfriend did not go outside but her father, who was with her mother, went outside at her mother&rsquo;s request.  He said he didn&rsquo;t see it.  I told them that it was the brightest looking &quot;star&quot; in the sky, just south of where the moon was.  Nobody else saw this light.As I watched this light, it began backing up and travelling southbound, the way it had come.  As it did, it dropped something.  What it dropped looked like a piece of glitter, but obviously larger.  It sparkled for about a second and then was no longer visible.  The light dropped about 4 or 5 of these things that I could see.  After that, the object flickered and looked like it disappeared.  It then lit back up and flickered some more.I heard some people walking toward me so I looked toward them to point this object out to them.  I wanted someone else to see this besides just me.  Well, the people who were coming toward me went into an apartment before reaching my location.  I looked back up at the sky, where the object was, and noticed it was no longer visible.  I wish I had watched it to see if it just flickered out or if it traveled somewhere else.There was some cloud cover and this object appeared to be below the clouds.  I kept watching for it all night after this and never did see it again.", "the sphere that was chased by a fighter jet  in the morning skyEarly in the morning I was walking out to my shop at about 5 am I looked up in the eastern sky and seen a sphere shaped object hovering in the sky that didn&apos;t appear to be as high up as most commercial aircraft that fly in my area.I decided at that time to go get my camcorder and record what I was seeing to be able to show my friends. I shot footage off and on for about 2 hours until it was light outside witch made it hard to see, then all the sudden I heard a roar in the sky to the south, as I looked That direction I seen what apeared to be a fighter jet with the afterburners on heading straight At it. It looked like the sphere started moveing north away from it as the fighter got close to it It went straight up over the top of the fighter jet and then apeared to back the other direction,  The fighter tryed to turn at that moment but couldn&apos;t turn that sharp and over shot the ufo so far  Because of the speed by the time it came back around the ufo was gone it just shot straght up in Sky until it was out of sight.  I did my best to zoom in and out on the ufo to get objects in the Footage to give some way to judge distance like trees and telephone poles I would like to show this Video along with a few others I have showed to friends that are very amazed at shots I have.I would just like someone that has the ability to examine the footage I have and tell me if its A ufo or if there is a normal explanation for what I seen.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))", "I really know that what i saw was not of this earthI was in my back yard, i looked up at the sky because it was very clear. I was able to see more stars than ever before.  I then all of a sudden focused in on one star in particular that seemed like it was showing movement, i then called my girlfriend to come outside to confirm that i wasn&apos;t going crazy, she also saw what i saw and got scared just to go back inside.  I was amazed, i finally saw a craft that was flying in impossible angles, I would really like to report this to someone that is going to give me some kind of feedback, about what it was that saw.  Also, id like to add that at first when my girlfriend and i went outside to look at the stars, she was looking at a direction that i could not see with my peripheral vision when all of a sudden she said &quot;Ohhh my god!, I just saw a shooting star&quot;, but i assume that shooting stars fall down, not zoom up, which is the direction she said she saw it fly.", "At 9:25pm on 11/01/2009 a bright light hovered over a mountain range due west of eldorado hills, ca and it abruptly disappeared.At 9:25pm I was walking to bed when I passed by our sliding glass door and noticed an unusually (what seemed to be) star due west of home.  The &apos;star&apos; looked to be hovering still over the next mountain range.  At first I thought that is way too bright for a star, so I considered it might be a plane.  I looked closely for appx 30 seconds and the light did not move at all and their were no other lights associated with it to indicate it was a plane.  At that point the light disappeared completely.  If it were a plane, not only would I have saw at least some movement, but I would have saw the tail lights or other lights when it would have turned.

Northeast to Southwest or reverse.   Depending upon atmospheric conditions the light may appear bright white or blue .. again also depending upon the aircraft.There is also a famous Vineyard in the area and the owner employs a Lear Jet in his travels - often flying low.  No noise is heard until the aircraft is close or passes overhead.  The local airport is nearby and low approach speed maintains an optical illusion of a non-moving object when approaching HEAD ON to the viewer..Lexington also falls under a main sky route hub between Greensboro/Winston-Salem and Charlotte and it is not unusual for heavy air traffic .... the planes often employ landing strobes .. but the actual ONCOMING path makes it appear stationary until they get overhead and then one can see the FAA required aircraft lights (i.e. green/red .... varied blinking lights, wing lights, etc.) .Many others have seen similar objects and mistook them for ... Unidentified, until that typical jet noise &quot;catches up&quot;.I am not sure if this applies to the above situation, but may be a possible explanation.This evening I have seen many .... heavy air traffic ... some small aircraft ... strobes are flashed when they are approximate to each other.  TWO in particular were unusual and did NOT follow the normal flight route; however I had assumed that they were the result of heavy inbound/outbound air traffic (Holiday) and may have been put on a &quot;holding&quot; pattern.  The night was very clear, the aircraft did NOT make noise, but assumed (again) the sound would follow.  It didn&apos;t; however the movement was consistent with usual flight speed with no deviations from a straight course, nor any change in speed.  Both objects moved from NORTH to SOUTH, EACH about ten minutes apart - EACH taking about ten minutes to cross.

It had a flashing green light on right bottom side, and a flashing red light on left bottom side. Just a few feet apart from each other. As i approached i slowed my speed, and the red flashing light disappeared. I started to drive underneath it as it silently hovered above. I started to swerve my vehicle as i looked up, it was not very far above me whatsoever.Another vehicle was approaching the aircraft on the opposite side of the 4-lane highway with a grassy median, and slowed down considerably as i assume they noticed as well. By this time i reached and grabbed my phone and called a friend to describe what was going on.

At approximately 1:45 AM, I was desparately trying to get our dog to come back in the house after having just let her out 5 - 10 minutes or so prior to the event.  The reason for trying to get our dog back in the house so quickly - was that she had started to bark at something and I didn&apos;t want her barking to disturb our neighbors. So, I went out into our back yard and found our dog just sitting in the snow in the middle of our yard barking at something up in the air.  At first I thought it might be a squirrel, rabbit, or raccoon - which we have seen in our neighborhood on more than once occassion - so I scanned our one main tree in our backyard for sign of one of these animals but didn&apos;t see anything despite our dog still barking.  It was then that a huge football-sh! aped object appeared out of nowhere in the southwest sky.  The object was more rounded on the ends (as opposed to coming to a point like a football), and was completely on fire.. it was a large flaming object that suddenly appeared, remained motionless for 10 seconds or so, and then rocketed off in a southwest direction at a speed that was - I would say - impossible.

Then the object changed directions and moved to the right at a faster pace but still slow.   As it moved to the right (now over land) I lost sight of it because of the buildings facing me, so I moved to the other end of the balcony where it should be visible again and indeed there it was.  Now it was at a farther distance and it appeared as a black dot slowly moving to the right.

Time was approximately 2030 hours, CDT, US.  My attention was drawn to the clear night sky by the noise/flashing lights of what were obviously military jets, about a half dozen of them, very high up.Military jets are a common sight here, originating usually from a major Air Force base about 70 miles east of where I live.  Daytime flight training activity is pretty heavy usually.  However, nighttime military activity is rare, especially a half dozen jets that seemed to be canvasing many miles of the sky&mdash;they were visible essentially horizon to horizon, passing overhead and making broad, sweeping maneuvers.I was curious so I sat down and watched.  As I was watching one jet, going west to east, approximately 70 degrees from horizontal, a nearly linear pattern of amber-to-red lights appeared about 50 degrees from horizontal, south-southeast.  There were about a half dozen of them that rapidly ramped up in brightness (not instantaneous).  They were stationary and maintained a fixed pattern, no variation in relative position.The pattern was about thumb&rsquo;s width at arm&rsquo;s length.There was a slight warbling in intensity of most of these lights, similar to distant lights on a hot night-heat distortion.  It was a similar effect, but I&rsquo;m not saying that is what it was because it was a chilly night. After a few seconds of visibility the lights faded about half as fast as they had ramped up&mdash;about three seconds to completely black out.  They did not fade all at once, but in a random pattern.  Of course, there was no noise except from the distant jets. About a minute later there were two or three individual lights that appeared, then disappeared, in about the same manner.  These were east-southeast at about 30 degrees from horizontal.  These were not all stationary while they were visible, and were visible only one at a time. I ran inside, called my parents, and asked dad to walk outside (we live only about 30 yards apart), which he did and he later said he saw one of the lights.  I&rsquo;m not sure he did.  From the direction he said he was looking he could not have seen what I was seeing east-southeast, but he could have be observing similar lights further to the west which I would not have seen because I was watching the east-southeast lights. The canvasing activity of the jets continued for as long I was willing to watch, about 30 minutes. From the video I have seen of the Phoenix Lights phenomenon, this event was quite similar in the way the lights ramped up, warbled in intensity, and faded out.  In fact, these could very well have been flares, which was the &ldquo;official explanation&rdquo; of the Phoenix event.  All I can say is if these were flares someone is damn good at placing a group of 6 and having them appear to be &ldquo;tied together&rdquo; on a structure or separate and holding a rock-solid pattern for several seconds.", "Triangular object with three red steady lights flying over Renton.I spotted this object while walking my dog.

I have held several significant positions since my retirement.  I say this knowing that my pedigree may mean nothing to my credibility once this story has been told.While returning from upstate NY, and heading south along the parkway, we saw a large, lighted object in the distance, hovering over the Throggs Neck Bridge.  We all thought it was a blimp. As we got onto the bridge the object, remaining stationery, was clearly visible as a flying saucer.  It was above the center of the bridge with a span that was much greater than the width of the bridge. Around its center were white lights, revolving in a counter clockwise manner. The ship was silent.  All passengers in EVERY other car, were looking at the craft, even the drivers!  It was amazing that no one caused an accident that night.  We were also motioning to one another to confirm that they saw what we saw, and they did.Then as we were just under the ship, it went from hovering over the bridge to gliding along a path that followed the parkway to the Northern State (I believe) and turned east and followed the lighted road out to Suffolk County where it turned south and flew along the path of the Oyster Bay Expressway and out of sight.  It was as if it was intrigued by the traffic and the lights of the cars and the roadways it was above.  Until it sped off towards the southern portion of Long Island, it was cruising at speeds comparable to our cars&apos; speeds. Then it darted off so fast as to become a blip in a matter of seconds.There were times while we followed it that it darted up and down and east and west but did not deviate from the overall path I described above.As soon as we arrived home we called up the Suffolk County A/F base and Newsday.  Neither confirmed any other contact by others or that they had tracked anything on any Radar.My brother and our 3 other passengers all spoke about what we had witnessed and, to this day, 45 years later, we still know that what we saw was a huge saucer shaped object, capable of unbelievable maneuvering and great speeds.

We were setting on the tailgate of his pickup talking about work. A few min after we got there i noticed a light to the N/W. At first i thought it was a light on a light pole at a farm house. It looked like a tree was swaying in front of it. Then it stoped flickering and begain to get brighter. It was moving closer we kept talking. I thought it was maybe an airplane but it was moving kinda strange,  you know left to right and up and down. The closer it got the more I watched it after about 30 mins I began to get a little uneasy you might say. At this time I had drank no more than 2 beers so i was not at all drunk, although that might have helped my nerves a little. The light looked like it was watching us, that made me feel very strange. My frend was downing beers i told him to check it out he said (aw! w its just a plane) I said, &quot;You think? It dosent move like a plane.&quot; (I grew up beside an airport and have seen many planes large and small military and civilan chopers and well you get the point). Well the (LIGHT) was very bright now and extremely close i was standing now I was very excited and scared and kinda glad or something I was finally seeing that thay were realy real!!!

Now when they hit the lights I thought, &quot;O shit it was like being hit with two thousand volts, I hauled ass and ran as fast as I could for about 10 yards. I realised I wasent hurt or being picked  up. Although I was shaking so bad it was like i had been droped in ice water, the  shaking part I mean. So I stoped and looked back and they were still by the truck looking up with there hands shielding their eyes from the light. It was ripped from a scifi movie or something then the th! ing slowly drifted on past. Kinda a smooth oozing kinda glide. Just perfect and smooth my friend said it had to be a plane or chopper from the army in  stelth mode . Thats what he thinks. He realy never said any more about it. I told  him stelth meant that it was  not seen on radar. And a stelth bomber couldnt hover. A choper would put off a hell of a lot of wind. But because he didnt believe in ufos it had to be some type of military craft. What do you think???  I  have seen other things but this is the clearest and i know it wasnt a dream this time.

The object was about 1000&apos; if that above the tree line and about a football field away. I opened the window to get a clear view and to listen for a sound and it appeared to be gliding or floating more so than being propelled.  The only sound was a quite hum that changed in pitch slightly.  The UFO had various color lights on it.  A white light that was underneath changed from white to blueish green when I flicker my outside lights on and off.  A beam of light appeared to shoot down from it but it didn&apos;t reach the ground.  My friend who saw it also said it appeared more square.  I saw the various color lights which appeared to be attached to what looked like 3 prongs or legs beneath it.

Before fading into the sky, the bottom center of the cone seemed to change position from 6 o&rsquo;clock to 4 o&rsquo;clock, the top still anchored in the same position. My daughter saw a dark cloud above the shape, I didn&rsquo;t notice it. I can&rsquo;t estimate the distance with any accuracy but was very far off in my opinion.The shape was a little lower and to the right; a couple finger widths of Jupiter in the Capricornus Constellation; Jupiter&rsquo;s elevation is about 20 degrees approximately. You could see an aircraft heading east very far up in atmosphere with marker lights blinking barely visible, just after incident; by comparison the cone was huge.

I live in Syracuse NY and back on October 30th 2001 while my son was driving me home around 5:00pm/5:30pm we both saw something very strange. There was a full moon (or it looked full to us) and starting at the 4 or 5 on a clock going diagonally across the moon was a thin black line. It grew as it went across the very bright moon but stopped growing once it reached halfway then started to shrink back to nothing exiting at the 10:00/11:00 on a clock. There wasn&apos;t any air vapors before or after the moon and I tried to catch the news hoping there would be mention of it. We were on the road at the time (690 going east).

Jack scott    Here a copy of somebody who saw the same thing of me 10 minutes after over the Miami airport.   At approximately 8:15PM on 9/28/09 I walked out and as usual I looked up into the evening sky. I observed a very bright light in the northeastern sky moving in a southerly direction. What made this unusual was the fact of how bright the light was. My first impression that is was an aircraft, since I live about 6 miles from the Miami International Airport. The best description of intensity of the light that I can describe is that of Venus in the night sky. As I looked at it more closely, I could see no navigational markers (red, green or flashing strobe) visible. During the duration of the sighting I heard no noise from the object. The speed of the object was that of a jet flying at altitude, but the altitude was much lower, maybe 10000 ft (but that is just a guess since it was difficult to determine since it was dark). Living as close to the airport as I do, I am familiar with the flight patterns of aircraft. This object appeared to fly directly over Miami International Airport which is unusual again based on the objects apparent altitude. Another oddity observed was during the sighting no aircraft were visible either landing or taking off. The object continued on its southerly course and made a turn to the east. Even when it made its turn the intensity of the light remained constant. IF it had been an aircraft I would have noticed its national markers. One other note was as I watched it make its easterly turn; I noticed an aircraft to the southeast and its navigational beacons where quite visible.Once it made its turn, I moved to follow the object but lost it between tress and other houses.", "Driving on the highway and saw something fall out of the sky.I was driving northbound on 77 above Columbia, SC and off to my right I saw a rounded shape light falling almost straight down.

I am about 3 miles from home.  As I was driving down the main street I notice three lights in the sky in a straight line. The sky is typical heavy traffic area for planes heading to the St. Louis Airport, which is approximately 27 miles east of this occurrence.What caught my eye was these lights were spread apart quite a bit, but consistent in distance and they were in a straight line and blinking in sequential order (1-2-3, etc.)  I thought that perhaps that what I was seeing was a tower of some sort that I didn&rsquo;t notice before because it would be abnormal to see places flying in this formation.  Plus, these planes were not headed towards the airport, nor were they, from my position; coming from the direction of the main airport.  That&rsquo;s why I thought they could be tower lights that warn low flying planes at night. But, that was not the case.As I continued down the main road (which is a busy road) I stretched to see them out my front and passenger window.  I don&rsquo;t ever recall seeing lights like this as a steady fixture, so I was trying to think of what it could be.  Once I lost sight of the lights, since they were in my blind spot, I continued on and entered into my neighborhood.  Once I am in my neighborhood I have to back track towards where I came from to get to my house.  That&rsquo;s when I saw the lights again.  It was clear that it was not a tower as they appeared to be moving west.I ran in the house, asked my husband to go outside in the back yard and tell me what that is in the sky.  I didn&rsquo;t even turn off my car or park it in the garage as I wanted him to see this and explain what it was that I was seeing before it was out of our sight line.  He is a 23-year military veteran and very familiar with various military air craft.  Looking through the bare trees in our yard, he said he didn&rsquo;t know, but was sure that military planes wouldn&rsquo;t fly in such as straight line with lights that blinked sequentially.  I went in and grabbed the camera and went out front of the house to see if I could get a better view.  A house was blocking the view, so we got in the car.  We figured we could get to an open space and at least be able to get a better view.Both of us thought to head west as that&rsquo;s where it seem to be going towards, and we were going down a road that had  a wide open view of the sky.  We should have at least been able to see the object in the distance, but we drove a few miles and saw nothing but the normal air traffic that is common.This was in a busy area, so I think that my husband and I can&apos;t be the only one to see this!  IF there is a logical explanation, it would be nice to know what that was flying over Missouri.", "My wife and I were outside in the Jacuzzi when she first saw a light.  It glowed and traveled from north to south.  It lit up again when I then saw it and then dimmed and traveled further south and then disappeared.   About twenty minutes latter as I looked toward the upward northwest sky I saw another light glow and travel at the same time.  It dimmed and kept moving west to east.  It lit again and traveled some more and then disappeared.  I have seen something similar and wonder what it is.  My wife saw a flying wing last year and we see other lights on occasion.

When I pulled around the corner by my house in the rural village where I live, I saw two large, bright golden orbs above the road just south of my house.  They were stationary, parallel to each other, and fairly close to each other at a height of, by my estimate, of about 150 or so feet above the road.  They were also moving in an erratic manner side-by-side to each other, sort of leapfrogging over one another.  One would quickly leapfrog over the other to a parallel position next to the one just jumped.  Then the one just jumped would perform the same maneuver over the first one in the same direction.  This occurred maybe two to three times then they reversed the process in the opposite direction. Once, the lights seemed to flick off to black but shortly came back on.  When the maneuvers seemed to have ended and they both went black, I parked my car and got out in the dark, but seeing nothing in the sky went into my house.Within about twenty minutes of my sighting, I received a phone call from a friend in my town who lives about 2 miles from me saying that in the company of their son they had observed a similar display on their way home from a different direction to town.  They stopped, got out of their car, and went to a field above their home to further observe a similar performance to mine above their field.The activity I saw occurred maybe two to three times in a matter of a few minutes from the time I stopped in the road to observe them.  I was stopped in the travel lane of the road while seeing this activity.  Three or four cars passed me in the road during this time.  Though no one else stopped, I can&rsquo;t believe no one else saw this because of the size of the orbs, their proximity directly above the dark road, and their erratic behavior.  Very odd.Apparently many UFO sightings were observed and reported locally at this time, but the media has attributed them to the Leonid Meteor showers that are occurring.  This is not what I observed.  I have watched the sky most of my life. I have seen the comets Hale-Bopp and Halley&rsquo;s, meteors and their showers, and satellites.  These definitely are NOT what I saw.I have seen many anomalies in both the night and day skies here since the mid- to late-1990s.

The weather conditions were clear skies at dusk - but with plenty of light in the skies to make out objects - blue skies, not complete nightfall.The object appeared to be approximately one mile in elevation and perhaps about two or three miles away from my location - straight shot.  Skies were clear, there is little to no air traffic over southwest Virginia and if there are planes then typically at very high elevations - so lights normally appear very small.The light formation was composed of three large, horizontally oriented, oval shaped lights that were relative close to one another, like my depiction below with parentheses, and the lights appeared to wrap around the structure.(                    )(                   )(                  )  Three things stuck out about the lights:  1) Lights made the structure appear much larger than any aircraft that would normally fly into the private airport that is located in Blacksburg - any aircraft that would be flying that low would be flying into or out of that airport; 2) There were no red and blue flashing lights indicating the wing tips that would be required 3) The lights made no movement, they appeared to remain at the same point in the sky even as I drove closer towards them.Finally, the three lights simultaneously dimmed down, like a light dimmer switch you would have in a living room, rapidly until no lights remained.  At this point the sky was still light enough to make out the shape and color of any craft had the lights just been turned off, or if the lights were on the front of the craft and they had just turned a new direction that would not allow the lights to be seen anymore - but nothing remained in the sky.

The object stayed in the same spot and hovered around for nearly an hour and then moved off slowly to the north.  I thought maybe it was some kind of balloon, but we have been having 30-40 mph winds here for two days, so don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s it.  As it moved north it did not disappear on the horizon, just got smaller.  Then it changed shape and took on an elongated, cigar shape, with white lights flashing all around it, and blue/green lights flashing on one end.  Directly to the west, as this was hovering, there was another light, hovering, not as close, flashing more red.  I shined a flashlight in the direction of this one, looked away, then looked back and the red light was gone.We see a lot of airline and military air traffic where we are.

It came over a house, it moved about 5mph and move to the middle of the street and stopped( it was facing me).It scared the heck out of me and I wasn&apos;t going waiting around to find out was else was going to happen. I took of quickly and called my husband and and asked him to go out and tell me what he saw. He said that there was nothing out there but that entire weekend choppers flew in the skys all day.

The oldest friend was driving the truck; next oldest friend was riding in the passenger seat, and me (youngest) was sitting in the middle.  Arrived in front of my house in a small community called Wolf Creek, and my friend opened the passenger door and got out of the truck so I could get out. I lived out in the country and there was a small farm across the road from my house with a pasture and a hillside. Upon exiting the truck, I noticed a large object hovering about 8 feet above the ground that had a fireball appearance. This was only about 75 yards from us. Both my friends saw the same thing. There was a very low hissing type of sound coming from the object. At first, we thought is was a tall bush burning, but there were no bushes there to burn, and obviously none that would be 8 feet tall. After watching the fireball object for about a minute, the! large object started slowly rising up toward the sky and then shot up in the sky at a very high rate of speed. The night was very clear and one could see every star in the sky on that night. Not a cloud anywhere. After the large fireball reached, what appeared to be the edge of earth&apos;s atmosphere, it split into two with a slightly smaller fireball now trailing right behind it. Almost immediately after that, the trailing fireball split into two and there were 3 fireballs streaking toward space.  Each fireball disappeared from sight as it reached far enough out in space to be out of sight.  I have told very few people about this incident and am not sure if my friends have told anybody as I have not seen them in a very long time.  I no longer live in Spring City and now live in Ashland City, TN which is just north of Nashville, TN.  We all had no doubt that this was some sort of craft from somewhere other than this planet.  Since then, I have thought about this incident many times in an attempt to define what this craft may have been.  Not sure if it was some sort of major alien craft, but feel now that it could very likely have been some sort of probe sent here from another craft in space.  But that&apos;s just speculation.  I do, however, know that this was not something man made, and that there was no one at the observation site other than the 3 of us.  I have no further information to disclose regarding this sighting.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

It was almost like a loud &ldquo;lawnmower&rdquo; type sound not the sound of an aircraft.  Definitely loud.  I looked up in the sky and was in awe.  It was silver/aluminum looking in color,  one large white light on the underside and was definitely triangular in shape.  It was low and was in full view over our yard.  I ran to the front door and yelled for my husband and then ran back to view it.  It flew almost straight at me, but up where a small engine plane would fly.  It had two short &ldquo;flaps&rdquo; that went up vertical on the two back corners &ldquo;like if you made a paper airplane and put little flaps on the corners. It had no wings.  By the time my husband got outside it was going higher and circling around.

I am a very reliable person to tell about this as I taught school for 28 years, have lived in the same home for 20 years, work at a church and do not smoke, drink or do drugs.  I did have my glasses on. To be honest, I kept thinking &ldquo;this thing has to be a remote control&rdquo;.

I saw it on October 26th, 2009 at approximately 6:15 p.m.   My husband did not see it up close like I did, but he did watch it glide or fly across the sky and circle around and then disappear into the clouds.

At around 7:40 pm CDT, I drove to a corner store, about one mile from my house, for a package of little cigars and a coke to see what remained of our first &lsquo;white Christmas&rsquo; in 83 years (before I was born!).As I returned to my car from inside the store where I had visited with the owner for a few minutes or so, something caught my eye low in the due northern sky: a yellowish/white broad light that was not shining at me, or out in front of the object, but was &lsquo;glowing&rsquo; downwards, but not casting a &lsquo;beam&rsquo; of light! I thought, how strange, but then the brisk cold air got to me so I hurried on home to see if I could get a better look at this, thing.Less than five minutes later, or, about 7:46 to 7:48 pm CDT, I parked my car at home and walked to my porch and looked up to the lower southern sky and saw this HUGE rear end of what could not have been an airplane, as it was only a few hundred feet off the ground, and the rear lights were perfectly huge!  There were four of them, two yellowish/white and two reddish/white, perfectly circular, spaced one after the other (white, red, white, red) in a roll in shape with a red blinking light in the middle or, possibly in the bottom area, when I thought it was likely an airplane, but I heard no sound whatsoever.What I was looking at, that was gliding so slowly that if it had of been some known aircraft; it would have fallen from the sky, seemed to me to be the rear end of a triangle-shaped UFO I have seen graphics of and some videos of from eyewitnesses.These lights were not bright, did not give off a &lsquo;brightness glow&rsquo; nor were they hard to look at, yet they were soft in their illumination.The huge object was almost hovering as it was gliding so slowly. I watched it moving towards the due south, and I know where the due south is from my front yard, having a compass watch that I calculate with every season, plus I know my star charts, being a former Navy SeaL and navigator.These four lights were perfectly round and did not blink at all: only the small red light blinked in an odd manner unlike the belly lights found on traditional aircraft that blink in a continuous series as a warning. I know this from having once worked for Delta Airlines as a Fuel Service Agent. This little red light would blink real fast, and then stop, and then blink real fast a few seconds later, and stop.I was very awed, despite my past in witnessing and videotaping such oddities we call UFOs, standing out in the 30F odd degree cold night air, as I truly believed that I was seeing the rear end of a triangle shaped UFO gliding southwards, ever so slowly.The area where the large lights were located was a perfectly boxed-in area, or squared off with the lights within.Now, I had my camcorder just inside my house on the coffee table, as I had been taking footage of the very rare snow that we had gotten yesterday afternoon, 12/24/2009, for the first time since 1926, as the TV news had related.When my camcorder came to mind, the object had traveled farther away to the due south, although I thought I could get some footage of it.I decided to watch it instead, as if I had of gotten footage by that time of watching it for about four minutes, it would have been seen as simply colored lights that I described above in the cold night air, becoming smaller as it traveled slowly away.CONCLUSION:  This object was too huge and flying too low and silently to have been any known, earthly aircraft! Because of the placement of the huge circular lights to the rear of the object; rule out any earthly aircraft.These were not &lsquo;fixed winged lights&rsquo; that shine out in front of airplanes, as this object was heading away from me to the south, plus the fact of its slow rate of speed and freezing night air; rule out a horizontal hot air balloon of any type based upon little to no wind and the object was moving in such a fixed position that it did not vary even slightly!  I affirm that the above is true and correct as I have described.", "I saw blinking lights which at first looked like an aircraft except for irregularities in the sequence.

It was dark at that time, and as I was passing through the opening of two end units, I heard a power hand saw being used by a resident on his rear deck of the townhouses backing up to the drainage ditch which I was approaching from the opposite side.  The sound stopped and I saw him walk back inside his house as I reached the spot where I let my dog loose to run and fetch the ball (I know its dark, but I throw it to a spot across the ditch, just like I have done hundreds of times before).After I threw the ball, I have about 40 seconds before she returns with it, I looked up in the sky just to see the stars on this clear and crisp evening.  Panning the sky to the north, I saw what at first looked like a tighter that usual grouping of faint stars, a shallow V of an angle approx. 135 degrees to the backside of the V.  The V shape wasn&rsquo;t a group of stars, because it was moving from the north to the south.  There were 5-6 dimmer than a star lights on each arm of the V and a gap of no lights to the front of the V.  The dark frontal gap was approx one-seventh the size of the V.  I spotted it approx 30 degrees from vertical where I was standing and tracked it moving south for only 5-6 seconds before it went dim.  It went dim before it was obscured by the height of the roofs of the townhouses across the ditch. Total view angle was approx 90-100 degrees.The height was hard to determine as I had seen nothing like it before to compare the size, although planes come from various directions regularly coming of going to Dulles or Reagan airport.  The speed seemed very fast even if it was low, but in the relative quiet moment of the evening as it was, I heard not a whisper of sound before, during or after the craft passed overhead.

There were no stars out, just the moon.  It was hard to tell for sure it the lights were blending together as we were driving and I wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was just because our vantage point was changing or the lights were changing.

It didn&apos;t appear to be extremely large, and was clearly not very high above the trees (perhaps only 500 feet above the ground or less), so it caught my attention. It also wasn&apos;t moving quickly--- in fact, it wasn&apos;t moving at a steady rate of speed either. It was moving like a car might move when people are in a parking lot looking for a space to park, steadily moving but at different rates depending on the view. It was nearly perfectly triangular, at least as far as I could tell. The tips of the triangle&apos;s corners were edged in white constantly shining &quot;v&quot;-shaped lights, and at the exact center was a red, unblinking light.

As the light got closer it intensified in brightness and size!  While outside watching them to determine what I was seeing was real. I noticed that they both emitted some type of search/spot light. This could be seen as something clearly above the clouds was lighting clouds up below it. This light appeared as a search light of some sort. At this point I was starting to get frightened. Basically I was right by the entrance of the house, as uncertainty coursed through me. As I watched the light circle around, and at times lighting up the clouds. It came to stop on me. I stood there helpless, wanting to run inside though was unable to move. Which lead and leads me to believe this was or is some type of probe of some sort. Standing there it fealt as if information was being expelled from me. I too took notice it seemed to extract the information in waves, rather than all at once. It seemed almost rythmatic!

I was walking northward towards my back yard.  There were a few low clouds that were mostly transparent.  I saw a streak of light traveling from east to west above one of the clouds.  Because I saw it through the cloud, it was kind of blurry.  It was traveling very fast, and it only lasted a few seconds before it flew out of site behind my neighbor&rsquo;s house.  My first thought is that it was a meteor.  However, I watched a meteor shower several weeks ago, and this &ldquo;streak&rdquo; traveled a longer distance than the meteors I&rsquo;ve seen.  It was also traveling the opposite direction of the meteors I saw a few weeks ago.  (I admit that I don&rsquo;t know much about meteors, and I assume they can travel in any direction.)  However, this streak didn&rsquo;t look as long as the meteors I saw and it lasted longer.  My next thought is that it was a spotlight, but! I searched the horizons, and I didn&rsquo;t see any spotlights shining up and moving around.  My last explanation was that it could have been some light refracting through the corner of my glasses lenses, and it created some sort of optical illusion.  However, there were no cars driving by or any other moving source of light that could have caused that.  Also, since I&rsquo;ve worn glasses for years, I can say that I have never experienced an optical illusion of a light in a cloud due to refracted light though my glasses.  It was too fast to be a plane, plus there was no noise.  It was most likely a meteor, but it didn&rsquo;t look or behave like the meteors I&rsquo;ve seen.  But I admit that may be because my sight of it was distorted though the low thin cloud.  I would say that the chances of this being some sort of ET craft is very low, but since I couldn&rsquo;t positively identify it, it was a mystery to me, and therefore, a UFO.

It had no lights on that I could discern.  It moved at what I would guess to be 10-15 mph.  It was just above tree top level. It created no wind.  It was very unnatural in its behavior.

In the objects last moments from sight, it seemed to change transparant then briefly back to a bright glow then translucent then dissapeard.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Mitchell, KY. As I looked up to the West, towards the airport, I saw three objects that I thought were shooting stars. They seemed like they were falling to Earth from the sky. However, the 3 lights took a turn up. I kept saying to my friend, do you see what I see? Do you see this? My friend thought the items were fireworks. I told him that fireworks are shot up from the ground. I told him these items came downward. Then we became somewhat nervous. As an African-American man, it is rare that we see these types of objects, or at least publicly tell someone. I work for an air line and I tried to tell myself that it was a plane or maybe someone was playing with a flare. However, the lights started to make all kinds of shapes.The three lights became four and made a triangular shape. Then the lights just hovered. Afterwards, the lights became five and made an angle like this &gt;. Then it just hovered. I had stopped driving at this time to watch. After a few minutes of watching I started driving again. I was going to take I-75 north to Cincinnati, but I continued down Dixie Highway going west then north. The light was so bright. By the way, I called 911 to tell them what I saw. They just blew me off, but I was very serious. I know people had to see what I saw. After we headed down Dixie Highway, the lights just disappeared. We continued to look for them, but could not find them. I had never seen anything like this in my life.I had always seen these events happen on television, but I did not expect to see this in my own community. I am very skeptical of people who claim to see UFO&rsquo;s. I do not know what it was I saw, but I know it wasn&rsquo;t a flare, not making all of those formations. I know it wasn&rsquo;t a plane. I fly on them often. I know what I saw wasn&rsquo;t fireworks. There was a cloud in the sky when we witness these lights. It was a clear night. I wish someone would investigate this. I know someone had to see what I saw. I am so glad I had a witness", "white lights moving in staggered formationMy uncle, my 2 sons and I where standing in front my grandmothers house when my 17 yr old says &quot;dad, look at that&quot; we all looked up to see two lights moving in a staggered formation above the high school across the street. there were no no blinking lights or engine hum &amp; the lights appeared to be close enough to have heard either. the lead light seemed to suddenly vanish and within about 5 seconds the second light vanished as well.", "Jumping Light-Point in the SkyI like to report an incident, which occurred 30 years ago, somewhere in October/November 1978.Together with a friend, we were traveling by car in the east part of France heading to Strasbourg. It was already night , might be 10PM or 11PM, 50-60 miles south of Strasbourg on a motorway and still we had to drive 1hour to our destination.  We have been tiered already , so we decided to stop on a park place for to take a little rest and to eat a snack.  It was a starlit night and while resting , we looked to the starry-sky.After a while, we recognized that out of the star-scene in the west of the starry-sky a bright lighting star dissolved out from the star-alliance and started to move.  That light point ( approx. 30&ordm; above the horizon ), moved, even jumped very rapidly up and down, left and right, zigzag and perpendicular. e tried somehow to estimate/scale the magnitude of those movements by stretching or arm forward for to see how many fingers the movement ranged.  So far I remember, the movement from the light-point covered approx. the width of 2-3 fingers on a stretched arm, crossed in less than a second.On the beginning from that &quot;light-show&quot; in the sky, we thought that an airplane or helicopter might be responsible for this , but we rejected this idea because:  1st  the movement started from a fixed-position and 2nd the profile of movements was so incredible, rapidly in speed and rapidly in changing of move-directions.From our location we could not estimate how far away from us that light-point was , as according our first impression , that light-point appeared just as a bright star.We could not hear any noise, either.The light-point movements went on for some time and after a while we decided not to look further to that light-show in the sky and not to bother ourselves with things we cannot explain.Somehow deep impressed and confused we left the scene and continued to drive towards to Strasbourg. We promised ourselves not tell anyone about that event , because we thought that nobody will believe us and we feared of ridicule.However, 30 years past, but the memory on that night is for me still present  as it was yesterday.I am reporting that case now, because internet does provide now the opportunity to share  those experiences with an open-minded community.  Maybe someone has a simple explanation for that .((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))", "Object seen over Kansas City during morning commute.  Vanished 10 seconds after spotting it. Third time phenomenon observed.Saw a definite solid object in the sky just to the west of I-35 near 95th street.  It was far enough away that I couldn&apos;t distinguish any shape or features- just kinda looked like a shiny white object.  I ruled out the possibility that this was a bird and it wasn&apos;t any sort of reflection on the windshield of my car.  This was definitely some type of aerial object that was VERY visible and just suddenly vanished after 10 seconds from when I first spotted it.  While watching the object, it &quot;blinked&quot; a couple times- like if you had a dimmer switch on a light bulb and dimmed the lights partially for half a second and then turned it back up.This was the third occasion in the last couple months I have seen this phenomenon.  All three incidents occurred in the Kansas City area during my commute to work in the morning (different locations each time though).  Each time the object was very visible for about 10 seconds and then just vanished- didn&apos;t fly away, just quickly faded like a light going out.", "3 bright orange flying objects, equally spaced, flying extremly fast, no sound, looks like they were almost on fire.1 hour later 2 more were seen.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous; provides little contact information.  PD))", "Follow-up To Initial ReportFollow up report to incident dated December 3, 2009 at 13:22:  The odor: As previously stated, I did notice a light odor that I have never come across prior. After being asked by others to describe that smell, I could at best state that it smelled like a steamy-metallic odor, almost like iron mixed with steam. It was not a chemical smell (i.e. our hot tub chemicals can be odorous), nor was it a burning smell made by charcoal, wood or other fire-causing source. Although I have smelled a car radiator over heat, this was not comparable. Additional Activity  Immediately following the incident as described in my initial report, the following activity took place. Please note that at no time before/during or after this unusual situation, did we lose power. Cellular Telephone: My cellular telephone began to sporadically malfunction. I had to contact my mobile service provider and had technical support try to trouble-shoot the device and problems, which consisted of:  Frequent inability to make calls &lsquo;Call Failed&rsquo; just seconds after making a call (when I could) The phone turning itself off A loud, electrical interference while conducting what little calls I could place  The battery was fully charged and prior to the incident and I had not experience a problem with the phone. Technical support stated that it did not appear to be the SIM card, but seemed more like a device malfunction. Other members of the household whom were not at home at the time of the initial incident, did not experience any problem with their mobile telephones. Our service provider had me place calls from both my device, as well as from another family member&rsquo;s (we are on the same network). My device was problematic but theirs was not. The technician noted the odd electrical nterference and stated that my only other choice was to get a replacement device if the problems persisted. I agreed to wait a day or two and see what would happen. After two days of problems post-incident, my cellular phone problems were gone and I did not have to replace the device. HD-DVR Cable Box: Our HD-DVR cable box ceased working and kept giving us an &quot;Unrecoverable Write Error&quot; message that technical support stated indicates the drive has been damaged. Due to our cable provider&rsquo;s inability to fix the box, we had to exchange it for a one. Behavior of the cats: Two out of three of our cats exhibited non-typical behavior. All three remained somewhat skittish for the remainder of the day immediately following the incident, however, at approximately 22:20 on the evening of the incident and after retiring to bed for the evening, my son woke me concerned for one of the cats. She was hissing, crying and pacing on the ledge of the window in the rear bedroom. She was upset to the point that she crawled up the screen and had to be pried off, only to remain very bothered for an additional 20 minutes or so. Upon inspection of the yard(s), we did not see anything, however, are surrounded by dense woods. At approximately 03:45 that same night (date was now December 4th, 2009), I was woken when a different cat was literally running and jumping into the sliding glass door window as well as jumping onto the drapes that covered the windows. He was howling and crying as though something was on the lanai, next to our hot tub. Worried that he would hurt himself by running into the glass, I tried to pick him up but he was so upset that he scratched my hand and arms and jumped away. After approximately 5 minutes of this behavior, he retreated to hiding underneath a loveseat where he continued to cry for several minutes. Further inspection of the lanai and yard(s) revealed nothing. Note: The side and backyards are open, but the woods extend from the fences, outward. We have had raccoons, armadillo, possums and bobcats get around the fencing from time to time, but even then the cats act in a more curious fashion and will actually go to the glass doors or windows to observe, never intimidated. We are at a loss as to what could have caused this abnormal behavior. Aside from the incidents above, they have been fine.", "Mind Boggling Lights Seen In The Night SkyIt was last Thursday 3rd December 2009 that my UFO Sighting occurred at just after 3am in the morning, I do not want to give the exact location of where I live, except to say that this sighting occurred in Greater Manchester, UK. Altrincham, Chesire a metropolitan borough of Trafford.I arrived home from work at 2-45 am in the morning, the first thing that I did was to put the dog out in the back garden, I then remember switching on Sky news and then I made a coffee. It was just after 3am when I was stood at the back kitchen door drinking a mug of coffee and smoking a cigarette watching my dog sniff around the garden when I spotted the strange light.The light was a very bright whitish/orangish/reddish object and appeared to be a jagged triangular shape, I have to point out that the actual colour of the light, especially around the edges was much more of a fiery orange colour, but has showed up more of a reddish colour on both the photos and video, I suspect this could be due to the fact that the camera I was using was a cheap digital phone camera? The object was almost directly above my house and it is difficult to say how high up in the sky it was, it appeared to be several hundred feet from the ground but it could have been a lot further away? I am pretty sure that what I was seeing was the bottom/stomach of the object, it was completely silent and I could not see any movement, it seemed to be completely still. Also, what else that is not seen on the photos or video is that at times the object appeared to look like it was on fire and I am pretty sure that I saw what looked like smoke or steam around the object. The li! ght appeared to the naked eye to be roughly the size of a 5 pence piece held at arms length.I stood and observed the brightly lit object for about 45 seconds before I went inside and got my mobile phone. I took 7 still photos in total, 2 normal and 5 at full zoom (5x digital zoom). I then started to video the object on my mobile phone, what happened next was just completely mind boggling and quiet a spectacle. After filming the light for about 30 seconds, suddenly a smaller circular shaped light, greenish/white in appearance appeared from nowhere. I stood and observed the second object and watched as it blinked on and off several times, whilst also disappearing and re-appearing in different parts of the night sky as well as moving around the larger triangular object. I have to say, some of the manoeuvres and speed of the moving light was just simply stunning, mind boggling and just plain weird. After roughly 1 minute the circular light shot off in a north-westerly direction at tremendous speed and blinked out and just simply vanished. I continued to film the main o! bject for roughly a further 30 seconds before it just went out, it was like someone switched a light off, there was an orangish/reddish flash and the thing was gone, I am pretty sure that I saw an orangish streak dart away, this only lasted for no more than a second and unfortunately does not show up on the video clip.I must have gone in and out of the garden about 15 times over the course of the next hour to see if I could see the thing again, I never saw anything else and I went to bed. I have to say, at the time and after the sighting, I never really thought that much about it, I wasn&apos;t thinking UFOS, Flying saucers, aliens or anything like that, I thought &quot; that&apos;s pretty weird&quot; and that&apos;s all I remember thinking. It was the next day and the following few days that it started to dawn on me just what I had seen. I have done some research on the Internet in the last week and I am amazed how much stuff is out there regarding UFOS, I never ever had any interest before my sighting and I didn&apos;t realise that there was so much on the web.I have shown the photos and video to several people and the main reaction that I received was &quot;wow&quot;, &quot;weird&quot;, I showed the footage to a good friend of mine, he thinks that what I witnessed was nothing more than some kind of military aircraft. I suppose that I could not rule that out as an explanation but, I have visited many air shows over the years and seen lots of stuff on the T.V and DVDS about aircraft and jets etc, and I can honestly say that I have never seen anything that can perform manoeuvres and move as fast as the objects that I witnessed. I am not saying that what I witnessed was aliens, but I would love someone to show me something man made that can perform like the objects that I witnessed, I have never seen anything remotely close.I will have to go as time is getting on and I have a million things to do, I have decided to contact several people in the world of UFOLOGY and see what they have to say. I would be grateful if you could perhaps get an expert in analysis to have a look at my evidence and please get back to me. I am more than happy to share my evidence with people and please feel free to publish it, all I would ask is that you please withhold my name and personal details, please remember, I am a professional guy and I would not like to be subject to any kind of ridicule or unwanted attention that such a claim could bring.I look forward very much to your reply.Thanks,  ((name deleted))", "A silver sphere floating through Rocky Mtn National ParkI have experienced three sightings of UFOs in my lifetime. The third sighting was again during the day.  I still cannot believe this sighting.  I was a passenger in a vehicle traveling through Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado.  Literally, the top of the world.  We were headed west over Trail Ridge Road, (the highest continual road over the Rockies that is closed in winter.)  It was a Saturday in June of 2006, around mid-afternoon.  As we approached the highest part of the road over the mountains, I looked out my passenger-side window, always in awe of the majesty of the peaks, and saw a silver sphere traveling silently to the east.  It was probably no larger than a mini-bus, but completely round, constructed of silver panels.  It was moving silently and I watched it for a few miles as it continued east through the park.  Eventually it was out of my line of sight because of the mountains, but I cannot get the vision out of my mind.  Like the night time sighting! several years before, the pace of the craft was very slow.", "7 floating orbs or fireballs moving from southwest to northeast direction.My family and friends who were over for a new years eve party went outside and saw 7 floating fireballs or orangish yellow orbs floating in formation about 500 ft traveling from soutwest to north east.  These were not helicopters nor planes from what we saw.  There was no sound what so ever. No flashing red or green lights on the sides.   I was about half a mile and looked as if it flew over a nearby park that closes at 10 pm.  I am not sure what these were, but they were bright.  I did not see any flickering like a candle or flare.  They were very strange.  I tried to get the camera working for a picture and the camera would not respond.

So I yell to my boyfriend to come out side, that my roommate and I thought we might have seen a UFO. He grabs the video camera but it appears dead. But he makes it to see the lights go from right to left disappear for a moment and then down up and disappear. Then my roommate steps back in the house, leave my boyfriend and I out side. About 2 minutes later we hear a cat screaming in the woods.

Nobody I know of saw the lights come into view and I didn&rsquo;t see them until we came down from the stands.  There were about 8 lights all revolving in different directions but they stayed at the same altitude and stayed clustered together in the same area of the sky.  The lights crossed each other&rsquo;s path which kept me from being to accurately count them.  They did not blink or pulse and looked about 5 or 6 miles away. They appeared to be above a light cluster of clouds. I can&rsquo;t accurately guess how high the lights or clouds were. The area I think is near DFW airport because there were always passenger aircraft flying over. The planes were flying lower then the clouds. We had to move on to the football field for our performance and so I did not see the lights leave. When we finished the show they were no longer there. I know there is probabl! y a simple explanation to what the lights were. I suspected that they were just spot lights reflecting on clouds but there were no upward beams of light visible.  All the witnesses I know of are in the Weatherford Marching Band. I pointed out the lights to most of the people who saw them but they took no interest in the sighting although they had no explanations for what they were. I have always had a interest in paranormal activity ever since I heard of the Stephenville and Lubbock sightings. I live close to both cities. The spotlights of the State Fair was my first guess but since the Stephenville sightings and a wave of strange earthquakes in the area, which I read are suspected to be linked with UFO sightings, I began to wonder.

There were no stars that night due to cloud cover.  The object was a blinding white light not moving at all.  There were no standard blinking lights on it like normal aircraft and it was brighter then anything ive ever seen. It must have been as big as a 747.  As it continued to hover it suddenly changed direction and began to slowly turn hover at an angle upward.  This caused a reflection from the craft on the clouds that made my stomach churn.  As it turned and the light reflected off the cloud it was clear this was no normal craft.  As it began the same flight path it suddenly vanished.  At first I thought it went behind a cloud but I still would have been able to see that bright light through the cloud,  I swear it just disappeared.

Also do this at property in Springville, New York which is approximately 35 miles south of Buffalo.On approximately this night, my daughter and I went outside at 20:50 hours to hopefully see a satellite that the local news stations had said was to pass over the Buffalo area around 21:00 hours and be visible with the naked eye. I have always read that a visible satellite was pretty much a constant moving white light that would move across the skies. If I remember correctly, I believe the news reported that this satellite was to move from the NE to the SW or vice versa. Not positive at this point, but I believe this is what they had indicated. It was to pass over at approximately 21:05 hours.As my daughter and I waited and watched, we apparently missed seeing this or just were not looking in the correct direction. We continued to stay outside and enjoy the night sky above. At approximately 21:15 hours my daughter first noticed the following and then I did. We are not crazy and we both know what we saw.What we saw came across the night sky, curving from the NNW to the SSE. In the shape of a triangle were 3 hazy, dull, orange-yellowish colored lights moving/gliding in a quiet, peaceful motion slightly rotating on its own axis. It appeared to be only, say, a few hundred yards above us and well below the night stars in the sky. It was no aircraft, no helicopter, no weather balloon, no satellite, no military crafts, etc., etc. And funny thing is, its path of going to the SSE was basically going just west of the airport, over the Cheektowaga area.My daughter and I looked at each other in excitement and somewhat disbelief with what we both saw. We know we saw something and we are convinced it was an UFO. I for one have always believed in UFO&rsquo;s and been very much interested in them for years.

I happened to find this site, and decided to report my observation which took place quite a few months ago while in New Mexico.  I just want to start by adding mt comment that I didn&apos;t want to bother to edit this observation report on MS format cause it&apos;s too time-consuming and rather cumbersome, though your guideline tell me to do so.  I apologize for that first^^   Here I&apos;m in S.Korea, my native country.  While searching for UFO reports which i&apos;ve also have some interest in on CNN website and I encountered this reporting site of UFOs.  And it made me to determine reporting what had taken place very long time ago and I forgot to bother to clarify the incidence by way of telling other people, researching documents-i has begun to do this only recently a little bit but not much- or contacting experts on this subject or issue.  I had many other things to take care of, or be concerned about, and Iwasn&apos;t even sure what the magnitude of my observation would be to other people, or society that&apos;s currently still skeptical about accepting this issue of UFO thing!

First, I&apos;d rather want to emphasize the speed of this flying object (or an airplane at the time of observation) wasn&apos;t that fast at all, rather similar to that of normal commercial aircrafts.This object was getting closer &apos;n closer to where I was and at a certain point it was flying, passing right above of my car and if I didn&apos;t look up to see it, I&apos;d certainly have thought it as a usual airplane.  Before I describe how I could bend and lean my head to the right of steering wheel move my neck &apos;n head to look up, at that time freeway traffic was few and I just felt like to look at it, even if it were to be just an airplane.This remarkable &apos;n breathtaking sighting (and a short obersation) happened, therefore, starting its closer approach toward above my car just till its blocked by the roof of my car! What extraordinary about the sighting here it is.. The rear or behind of the object A BLUISH GREEN BRIGHT LIGHT AROUND LIKE CONICAL SHAPE AND ORANGE-CLORED SPARKLING LIKE WIELDER&apos;S SPARKS, OR SOME KIDN ELECTRIC CIRCUIT FAILURE?  Judging upon its speed I doubt it was a satellite crashing down to earth, or meteorites.  And I&apos;m quite certain it wasn&apos;t an airplane.  This odd &apos;n mysterious sighting happened within a period of less than a few seconds-but perhaps longer than 5 seconds! (I was crazy!  Dangerous!) I had an impression that this flying object was a crashing one due to perhaps certain causes.At the time I could&apos;ve pulled over to side road to keep my eyes on this object but somehow I chose not to.  Why not?  First of all, I got scared something bad might happen to me, if not from this odd object maybe from cops or gangs!  Second of all, some whisper told me i saw enough and don&apos;t try to ask the identity of this things any further.  How?  I can&apos;t explain but it&apos;s not a physical whisper I&apos;m taking about, but some powerful feeling or instinct that &quot;Let&apos;s just keep it that way&quot;.  So I told myself &apos;I saw enough&apos; and headed back to my M6 LODGE. That&apos;s all!  Let me know your expertise about this observaation.   Waht was it??  You can contact me to my E-mail^^((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))", "strange orange lights in the sky, fade in and out, disappear, then reappear several minutes laterAt approximately 9:30PM on 11/17/09, my friend and I noticed something weird in the sky as we drove to our other friend&rsquo;s house.  We got to his house, then immediately saw this bright orange glow in the sky as we stepped out.  This one passed over our heads.  My friend said it was high up and was fast, but I think it was lower and slow.  The aircraft, from a closer view, had two bright orange lights, one in front and one in the back, and white and blue flashings lights on either wing.  The shape of the craft was undetermined because it was really dark.Another one of these lights passed over our heads, but still not close enough to get a great description.  Then a third came and we started feeling a little unsettled.  We looked away to get something for ten seconds and the third light disappeared into the night sky.We went inside shortly, but about 15 to 20 minutes later, we went back outside and saw another light, this time coming from the opposite direction (as if it was a previous light returning).  Then, sitting around the table outside, we saw another light in the distance.  This one looked smaller, but its light would dim in and out, and twice the light disappeared altogether, once for ten minutes.We were unsure what this is, but it&rsquo;s definitely something I&rsquo;ve never seen.  My friend tried to explain it by saying it was just a couple airplanes with brighter lights, but that doesn&rsquo;t explain why the light would disappear altogether for ten minutes and reappear in the same place.  That was the truly weird part.", "Round, circular light moving very quicklyOn Thursday, December 11, 2009, at 5:50am, I was traveling on Rte 347 heading to work when I spotted a bright, white circular light traveling 3-4,000mph and about 3-5,000 ft above the ground.  I only saw it for a sec and a half.  I&rsquo;ve been in the aviation business, working with aircraft and I have never seen anything travel that fast.  It looked like it was traveling from the north shore to the south shore of Long Island.  I have been following UFO stories for years and have been looking up at the sky for many years and I have never seen anything like this.  I know what I saw was real.", "UFO New Vienna Ohio, 5-8 lights appear goldish one after anotherSighting: I was driving home about 9:15, 10-29, I saw lights appear in the sky as I was leaving my sister a voicemail and described everything via voicemail to her. One light after another appeared in what seemed like 2-3 second intervals. There was about 5-8 lights, I was trying to watch the road, they came on in intervals, but disappeared all at the same time.  My eyes hurt afterwards and had a migraine, I had to leave work early on the 30th because my head hurt still.  I drove past the next day and there was nothing there.  This is an empty field, nothing else could explain what I saw. I have always been skeptical of UFO&apos;s, but when I saw this craft, I knew.  I can&apos;t explain what I saw, but it impacted me profoundly enough to write you and try to figure out what this was!", "What looked like a star moved to the right very slowly and  then got dimmer and slowy vanished.I decided to go jogging at a local High school track on 11/01/09 at about 6:30PM. I jogged and walked the track until about 7:45 PM. I decided to lay down and stretch before going home.It was a cool and clear night and cool night with a bright full moon. I laid down on my back to stretch and was looking up at the sky noticing how clear and pretty it was.I noticed 3 stars in a triangle pattern that stood out from the rest, nothing seemed unusual about that. But as I was just gazing up at them  I noticed 1 of the stars or what appeared to be a star start moving to the right.It started moving very slowly, so slow in fact I thought my eye&rsquo;s were not focusing well or it was just me. But I then noticed the bright star to the right of the object (a planet more than likely because it was so bright) was staying stationary. NO other stars were moving.The object moved very slowly, I then started looking for blinking lights thinking maybe it was a plane coming in at an angle and then turning or something. But as it moved very slowly to the right it slowly started to fade out. And it then disappeared. I viewed it for at least 45 seconds.I thought of everything it could be because I am a skeptic.  At first I thought maybe it was the space station, but I ruled that out because I have seen the space station before and you can see it from start to finish and it moves much faster than this object was moving.  We have a Navy base that trains pilots in single engine prop planes and I seen three right after this sighting and they all had blinking lights and even at the slow speed they travel they still traveled faster than this object.I ruled out everything, even space junk. Because when I started looking up all 3 stars were not moving. Then one of them started to move very slowly to the right and flickered as it faded out.It just vanished in the night sky. I heard no noise, because when it flickered out I thought it might be an after burner on a jet. I have not other explanation other than it was a UFO.Note: I live in the city where the lights are bright and you can&rsquo;t see most of the stars. But this object was as bright as the Planet to the right of it. If someone was not paying attention they would have not noticed this object moving because it was moving so slow.", "Bright White Light in Partlow Sky !!!!!I was riding my bike down the road and was looking in the sky at the stars.  Next thing I know I saw a shiny bright white circle of light.  I thought it was a helocopter spot light but it wasn&apos;t.  I stopped and looked at it for 10 mins.  It stayed in one spot, moving flat across the sky really slowly.  I continued to ride my bike down the road and it was just hovering in one spot.  I lost it above the tree line.  I kept riding and I saw it again when the trees got smaller.

It was difficult to judge the height but we would guess 500-1,000 ft and it took only 8 seconds to move across. We ruled out a plane as the glow was constant and the path too low for this area.  We ruled out a balloon as it travelled at to high a speed.It was followed by 6 similar sightings travelling in a similar direction.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

He lives 5 miles NW of Okeechobee, Fl.  I went outside of my home and began to look for the objects. I live 18 miles SE of Okeechobee, Fl, as we are rural there is a very low level of ambient light so I have an exceptional view of the night sky. Because I didn&rsquo;t know the brightness of the objects that my stepson was observing, I turned off my backyard and garage light. My stepson and I were talking on our cell phones for several minutes while I attempted to locate the small-lighted objects that he has been observing for at least 10 minutes.At about 1950 (7:50 pm) I was looking west northwest over my neighbors&rsquo; home, and I observed several small lights moving in an area roughly 20 degrees wide and thirty to forty degrees high and approximately 25 degrees above the horizon. This corresponded to where my son-in-law was now looking. I was not able to determine the range or altitude of the small-lighted objects. These small-lighted objects were moving erratically and on several occasions when the lights came within close proximity to one another, I would see a very bright inverted tear shaped orange glow that would last for about 5 seconds. During the time I was watching the group of small-lighted objects were working slowly in a northerly direction. Sometime during all of this I asked my wife to come outside and see what I was looking at. My wife was able to see three of the small-lighted objects but none of the bright orange glows appeared. The activity that I observed continued for about 5-7 minutes then cease! d. All of the small lights disappeared and I never saw another of the bright orange glows.During the time that I was observing all of this activity I was communicating by cell phone to my stepson and he was observing exactly the same activity that I was. I attempted to capture a few pictures on my cell phone camera but the movements were so erratic that I was unable to do so.Some observations that I had were: Small-lighted objects were flashing points of white light, the movements of the these objects were very erratic and of a type not consistent with any aircraft that I have ever seen. The lights didn&rsquo;t appear to be following one another they closed on each other from a heads on attitude. I didn&rsquo;t see anything being emitted from these objects The bright orange glows were many times larger than the small-lighted objects and had no movement component to them. These glows all looked similar in shape and size; there were no trails from these glows in any direction.I also was watching the air traffic in the area. I did not see any sudden course changes or any other abnormal flight patterns. Because we are in the center of Florida there is allot of air traffic transitioning the area at multiple altitudes and directions.After this light show was over, my stepson and I were talking about what we had just seen and I asked him what he originally saw that caused him to call me. His statement is below: He had gone outside to sit with a couple of his friends. They were talking and he happened to look up.  He noticed a &ldquo;V&rdquo; shaped formation of small objects moving from the south. He continued to watch and then he saw another formation of the lights moving from the north. This second group of lights were scattered and not a discernable formation. The &ldquo;V&rdquo; shaped group moved past the scattered group and turned 180 degrees and that is when the orange glows began. At this point he gave me a call.", "3 bright orange balls moving across the sky.I went out to put some rubbish in the bin when a bright orange light caught my attention in the sky.  It was moving and I shouted my girlfriend to come out with the camera where we saw it was being followed by 2 other bright orange fire like balls which, as they all got further away fizzled out in the order that the passed through the sky.", "Made no sound and flew right above our heads in a straight line on a clear night when the only things visible were the moon and stars.My wife was showing me the constellations.  It was a clear night because it had rained the entire day before.  Not a cloud in the sky.  We were both looking towards the sky when I turned to look towards the south.  She immediately calls my name and says &quot;Look!!!&quot;.  Right above our heads the formation flew.  It couldn&apos;t have been any more than 10,000 feet above our heads.  It looked like 5 white circles in a line and another one immediately to the side.  You could see a faint outline around them as if they were art of a larger craft.  Not very big, however.  It was late at night.  No noise and a clear night sky.  No lights on to dim the view so it was clear as day.", "Bright red light seen in the skies of San Bruno, CA maneuvering slowly towards the west.There was a red light which seemed to be moving slowly west, away from our location.  It stopped momentarily, changed directions as if it was going to turn and make a circle, stopped again, and then move a little more west.  It did this two or three times then came to stop for approximately 5 minutes.  Then began to move west again very slowly and steadily towards the coast until it disappeared out of sight over the San Bruno Hills.  The distance of the object was unknown.  We were located on El Camino Real at the Tanforan shopping center it was a little before 2300 when we noticed it.", "unexplained lights in southern californiaat approximately 9:30 pm, my daughter and myself were on our deck looking at the stars as we do frequently, and noticed one extreemly bright light that mooved, more than a satellite would, and would turn so you could see the sides of it lit up.  I got out my binoculars, but they werent very strong ones, so it just seemed as a very bright light.  since it was getting late, I put my kids to be, then I took a bath.  at about midnight, I went back up on the deck, and that light moved about 3 feet froom where I sat, so I think that must have been a great distance up there to move.  and it did the same thing, move about 5 inches, then stay and rotate a little.  I got out a flashlight and flashed it a few times, then it would move closer again.((NUFORC Note:  Time of sighting may be flawed.

It was just as the last rays of the sunset were lighting up a few clouds to the West. It was at that time that we noticed a saucer shaped craft above us, it was approximately 80 deg. from the horizon. There were 3 other people besides us also in the immediate vicinity, (within earshot that is).I remember making the comment that &quot;We are now experiencing a UFO people.&quot; The 50 yd diameter craft was remarkably close, only about 150 yards away. We saw many details on the craft, not all of which we can remember. It moved silently and very slowly for 100 yards or so from west to east. It then changed direction to go away from us in a southerly direction at an ever increasing speed. We watched the craft until it was out of sight. My wife and I then proceeded to our car which was parked across the street and we left the area going on Hwy. 12 south. When we had reached an area that was approximately near where County Hwy. U crosses Hwy. 12, it was already nightfall. It was at that time that we saw what we have assumed is the same craft, however it was brilliantly lit up with a wide lateral band around the craft. We noticed that it was a very complicated pattern of everchanging multi-colored lights. Now this was 1978, it has only been recently that I have compared the lights! to what today we would call a very complicated screensaver or even fractal color display. I pulled the car over to get a better look, but my wife looked very terrified, so i pulled back onto the road.I know what I saw.

Am reluctant to disclose anything vital for security reasons. He asked the radar operator if their was any military operations around from naval vessels to which the reply was NO.  He then asked if any helicoptors could be out their as well, once again NO.

I did not have the bathroom light on and was applying the makeup with the natural lighting.Suddenly, something crossed over the skylight and dimmed the room substantially. Within approximately 2-3 seconds, there was a very loud explosion, as though something very heavy and large, hit the ground. The sound shook the house and sent all three of our cats into hiding.Initially, when seeing the dimming only, I thought it was a bird, although it would have had to be rather large. I also considered an airplane but did not hear one single sound, such as jet engine or other noise. I then went out to see if I could find anything. The explosion so quickly after seeing the dimming, made me consider an airplane due to the severity of the noise and the fact that the house shook.Note: Our house is surrounded by dense woods on both sides, as well as in the back.I went onto the back lanai and checked, however, did not notice anything in the immediate backyard. I did not notice any additional or unusual sounds, nor did I notice any smoke or fire. For a very brief period of time, I did note a very odd odor, which I cannot identify. It dissipated rather quickly. It was not strong, but was something that I have not ever smelled before. I returned to the house after my initial inspection.At approximately 1:26 I telephoned the North Port Police Department. I was transferred to Dispatcher Martin and asked if anyone had reported seeing/hearing anything. She stated that yes, other people in the neighborhood had contacted the North Port PD about the noise. She also stated to me that there were two officers en route to our general neighborhood. The call with Dispatch ended. I returned outside to look around some more.Upon returning to the front of the house, I observed that all power lines/transformers seemed to be in tact without smoke. At that time, two NP PD officers pulled in front of my home and my neighbor&rsquo;s. Three neighbors then emerged from their respective homes. One officer spoke with the neighbors across the street from me, while the other spoke with me.I was asked what transpired and told the officer exactly what I witnessed. I pointed to the skylight and told him that I was almost directly underneath it when the room dimmed considerably, followed very quickly with a loud explosion. All of my neighbors and I thought that the noise came from a slightly different location, but all agreed to it being extremely close to our three houses. To my knowledge, I was the only one who &ldquo;saw&rdquo; anything, in addition to the explosion. The officer asked if I would be home for the day in the event that he had to come back to speak with me, of which I told him, &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.The officers did not go into the woods, nor the side/back of my home. The officers remained on scene for approximately 10 more minutes and then left. I returned to my home and once again, went to look out in the back/side yards, of which did not observe anything unusual.Note: It was approximately 2:00 PM when the cats came out of hiding.At approximately 2:11 PM, I made another call to Dispatch Officer Martin and asked if they had found the cause of the explosion. She stated that despite dispatching &ldquo;several officers&rdquo; to the neighborhood, they did not find a cause and said it was strange.Again, I did not actually &quot;see&quot; anything, but noticed a considerable dimming in the lighting as something passed overhead while in the bathroom, putting on makeup underneath the skylight.  Oddly enough, within  2-3 seconds, there was a huge explosion, that shook the house.", "Bright- non blinking, then dissapearing, lights observed flying over Chico ca area 12/22-12/23 2009.Location: 12/23/09 West Chico, Ca 95928  I&apos;ve been going to bed early lately around 9:00 and waking up around 2 to 3 am.  Early in the morning of 12/22/09, I went out to have a smoke at around 4:30 am to have a smoke.  I looked up to the east side of town to see a light flying from north east to south west.  It was bright enough for me to think it may be an airplane, but as I looked for any sign of blinking lights, I found none.I was excited that finally I had seen something without the blinking lights so I looked on.  I was careful to listed for noise of which I heard none.  The light then sort of fizzled out and dissapeared.  I have seen many satellites, and this was much brighter than that.   Almost like a helicopter spot light from a distance with no noise.  I really didn&apos;t think too much of it at the time.The next morning 12/23/09, I went out at about 3:10 am to have another smoke.  The previous incident was still on my mind as I walked out there.  I was in the middle of thinking how unlikely it would be to see something again, when I looked up and there it was again!  This time it was even a bit brighter than before.  Same, no blinking lights, no  sound.  Flying from northeast to southwest, only this one had a more southerly direction.I actually walked down the road about 500 ft to follow it&apos;s course.  I could clearly see it shining through some trees before it moved out into the open.  Very  whitish light, similar to a spot light on a helicopter.  NO NOISE!  It appeared to stop and start a couple of times and then blinked out again!  It could have been miles away for all I know, but based on the very bright clear light it was producing, it seemed much closer.

I am also aware of what airplanes look and sound like, as well as helocopters.  I lived in L.A. and saw police helicopters all the time.  And there are no blimps or hot air balloons around here.  This was making zero noise with NO blinking lights.I even checked a satellite tracking site to see if there were any flyovers scheduled for that time and saw none.  The international space station was somewhere over Hawaii at the time and flying from west to east.

Between the treetops and above, clear sky view, I spotted 2 large orbs of white light, rapidly circling each other in a large circle, about the size of a football field.  The sky was completely covered by dense clouds and the light circles were quite visible.  They never waivered from their distance from eachother, but did move sideways from time to time.  It resembled a planet with an orbiting planet....not an irregular path. I watched for several minutes and then started to take photographs with my digital camera and flash.  I could see nothing in the view window after they were taken, but kept shooting.  Suddenly, several gold orbs or lights appeared in an arc shape, appearing to flash or move. Then the clouds completely went away, revealing a totally clear sky with lots of stars.  In an instant, the lights just vanished.  One of the photos I have sent has been lightened and set to very high contrast, to show the area was above the treetops.  No city lights, just sky.At first, I thought it might be advertising beams shooting into the air, but it started at midnight and there were no beams back to earth.  I called the police and they had no reports and no knowledge of any promotional beamed lighting in the area.  I thought it might be northern lights or lightening, but it had a very set and regular pattern path.

Though this seemed rather odd for the time of day, I glanced elsewhere in the sky to see if I could see other stars.Naturally I couldn&rsquo;t. But when I glanced back at the formation, I noticed that the formation, which consisted of approximately thirty shining, sparkling star-like objects, was steadily moving horizontally to the right.

The lights at first made me think that it was a collection of birds, but upon realizing that they were all too uniformly spaced to be anything of the sort.  It was amazing how fast it was flying because right after we looked a plane and it appeared to be going at least 10 times faster than the plane.The size in comparison to the moon was about 3 moons in the area of a triangle.

Well yesterday, 11-1-09, I was driving home to North Charleston from one of our stores loacted in Mt. Pleasant.  I always take the 526 home to North Charleston.  It was just before sunset yesterday and as I was driving I saw the strangest thing in the sky.  It looked like a black rectangular object that wasn&apos;t moving, way up in the sky against the clouds.  I thought &quot;what the heck is that?&quot; and had to keep driving but I did slow down some.  There is no safe place to pull off the road once on the 526.  Well I kept watching it and watching it as I drove.  I believe I saw another craft of some sort up way, way above it and to the right of it and this smaller, harder to see craft may have been plane shaped.  I began to think things.  I thought that maybe there was a helicopter or plane towing something.But I really didn&apos;t see a tow chain or rope of any kind between the two, but that&apos;s what it looked like.  Now my immagination went wild and I want to say it reminded me of the Star Trek Enterprise pulling the borg cube with a tractor beam! Seriously, I thought well there must be a logical explanation.  I thought the airforce might have been doing some scientific experiment and may have dropped or pulled something from behind a plane or helicopter as a weather/wind experiment or something like that.  I thought well maybe one of those planes that pull an advertisement sign behind it like those I see off the beach when I go to Daytona.I just don&apos;t know anything.  Now I want to believe that it was a spaceship from outerspace with extraterrestrials on it.  I really, really do!  All I really know for sure however is that I saw something in the sky that didn&apos;t seem to be moving at first, like a black, rectangular window against the white clouds way high up that day.  Then I saw the other thing, the maybe plane shaped craft.  Now the black object either turned and narrowed, or as I drove foreward I saw from a different angle and it narrowed.  I believe they started to slowly move and eventually I lost sight of them because I entered into my own neighborhood and trees blocked any further view of them.  As soon as I got home yesterday I wrote to MUFON and a representative from MUFON called me last night.  Today I told my boss about the incident and I even tried to contact the Charleston Airforce base to ask if they had anything unusual or unexplained on their radar over North Charleston yesterday, but I cou! ldn&apos;t find an e-mail addy that would do any good.  I watched and looked at the thing for a good fifteen minutes on my way home on this 526.  There were plenty of other cars on the road and I&apos;m surprised nobody else noticed, if they did, they didn&apos;t post a report about it.  Well I&apos;m a definate believer.  I&apos;m convinced!

I was pretty startled and jumped back inside and slammed the door shut and locked it while my arm shook furiously (I was that freaked out).When I sat down to immediately start researching what I had just saw, I still had the strong sense of a presense behind me to the point I feared even turning around.I am glad I have seen one of these ufos, and after much research I have discovered a nearby &ldquo;ufo hot spot&rdquo; where people have reported seeing triangular ufos about 12 miles from where I live in a town called Lucky Point. I have also discovered reports of the same ufos 1 week ago 3 hours west of here.For a glimpse of what I saw, please google &ldquo;STS 115 objects&rdquo; to see the live NASA TV video of the same triangular orbs. Also google &ldquo;St. Petersburg Russia triangle ufo&rdquo; to see a cell phone video of the same orbs and many other people witnessed.

When i parked up at my house, i walked into the town centre and saw another craft flying overhead. It was quite low down in the sky, made no noise or flashes, but looked as if it was on fire. It was a bright light so would be unusual for a plane, and it was the same as the other 2 crafts i saw driving home. It was moving about the same speed as a plane in one direction, but the fact i saw 3 of them in such a short space of time, and the way they were lit up made them seem suspicious. After looking around in the town centre i couldnt see the 2 other crafts so theyd moved off before i could look at them again.

We returned to our hotel around 1am and my husband was on the balcony smoking.  He called me out to look at something unusual.  I saw 6 or so orange orbs in the sky.  They were a unique color and at first didn&apos;t look like anything unusual until they started moving.  It was smooth but erratic and unlike any conventional flying machinery.  They would speed up and slow, turn corners quickly.  One appeared to have an even smaller orb orbiting it as it moved.  My husband said he saw a few like that but I only clearly saw the one.  There was also an airplane trail of clouds and the orbs clearly were under those clouds, so closer to the ground than an airplane.I watched for about 2 minutes or so but my husband followed them for about 20 minutes.  Then they disappeared.", "Sphere hovered over neighbors house; possible entity sighting.It was during the summer of 1970. The place was Toms River, New Jersey.  We lived on Fawn Drive. The object appeared around midnight. The light woke me up from my sleep. The object looked like the full moon and it hovered over the house of the neighbor across the street. The actual moon was to the south of the object. I was looking east toward the Atlantic Ocean. After observing the object for what seemed like 10 minutes I returned to bed, very fearful. After a short while I felt paralyzed and could not even yell for my parents. Shortly after that I saw what looked like a humanoid figure dressed in some sort of space suit wearing a helmet. I felt lulled into a sleep. The next thing that woke me up was the sound of what was at least two fighter jets. We lived close to Lakehurst NAS; McGuire AFB was a little farther away; but then again nothing is far away in New Jersey. After the jets passed over my sense of fear went away and I fell back asleep. Interestingly enough, a neighbor two housed down the street, who had mocked us for my sighting was, in his words, &quot;buzzed by some UFO&apos;s on my way to work the other morning.&quot;((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

We went outside for a cigarette.  It was dark outside and overcast.  I live in a small suburb community a couple of miles from town, there are not a lot of street lights around here, so the street is not well lit.  One strange thing that we noticed was that all of the dogs in the neighborhood were barking.  We first saw the object to the right of us.  At first the object was an intense neon blue light, bar shaped at first.  The object would hover and cruse just below the overcast clouds line circling us, flying slowly and changing altitudes.  Its movements were smooth quiet and squared.  The light would change its shape, having a few different light patterns on the craft.  When the craft seemingly noticed us it put on a display of unnatural and impossible maneuvers; Moving from a dead stop to unimaginable speeds in an i! nstant, making 90 degree turns at high speed, then coming to a complete stop, all the while moving without a sound. I told my wife to get the camera so we could take a picture.  She ran into the house to grab the camera but every time we tried to take a picture the craft would pulse and the battery power would be drained. Then we would mess with the camera and it would come back on with battery power but when we tried to take the picture again, the same thing would happen. Finally when the craft was at its furthest points away from us we could get a shot of it, three in total. When we captured it, the craft would react. With the first snapshot, the flash failed to flash, and the craft returned and put on a display of its maneuvers, then continued to circle us. The second snapshot again with no flash. The craft came right in front of us, banked its angle and exposed its shape to us. All I could tell was that it was pure black with blue lights. The bar light turned into severa! l individual lights fading off and on. I could see that it was! triangl e in shape. I couldn&rsquo;t easily see the shape because the craft was dark and I was too focused on the lights. Then the ship would again start to circle us. Still when the craft was close to us it would turn our camera off. So my wife handed me the camera to see if I could get it to work when my wife screamed, &ldquo;O my god look at that!&rdquo; I looked up at the craft; it had a beam of light going to the ground with a red orb returning to the ship. I didn&rsquo;t get to see the whole event with the orb because I was looking at the camera but my wife witnessed the whole thing. The orb returned to the craft and it began circling again. I gave the camera back to her she got the third picture; the best one. The third time the camera flashed. The craft turned to face us and closed the gap of distance from where it had been, to where we were. It sat just above the neighbor&rsquo;s house. We were looking at what I believed to be the front of the craft. The craft fired a pulse of light towards us and I cou! ld feel a surge travel through my whole body, and my car was popping as if the sheet metal was warping. Then the craft began to circle again. We noticed that the phones were now working again and I was able to talk to my parents and franticly tried to explain to them what was happening. I thought we can&rsquo;t be the only ones to see this so I ran across the street to get the neighbors outside to see this as well. I knew they were home and I could hear them in there. I was franticly knocking on the door and ringing the door bell, but no one would answer. Soon enough a car was pulling down the street it was my wife&rsquo;s mom. We yanked her out of the car to see it. Then three minutes after she arrived home, the craft was gone. It disappeared in the overcast clouds. After all of this excitement I noticed that where the craft was flying it had opened a hole in the thick overcast clouds that took a few minutes to fill back in, revealing the night sky above. In total the event lasted abo! ut 30 &ndash; 40 minutes. This has been a very emotional event for m! e and my wife.

It continued in the same direction and same rate of rising until it eventually disappeared in the horizon.  It had just gotten dark but the moon was shining brightly.  There were very few clouds.  The next door neighbor was sitting on her porch and I asked her if she could see it, she looked up and said &apos;yes&apos;. We didn&apos;t discuss it further.

The light was roughly 8 miles away, maybe closer. It drew my attention due to its intensity which remained constant for the time I observed it. The weather was clear, unlimited visibility, a blue sky, no clouds, about 50 Degrees F, a light wind at about 2 mph. I was at about 6,700ft elevation. At least 10 other people in that area saw it. The trail was busy that day and everybody I passed talked about the light. I would estimate the light was probably 100ft in diameter and appeared round in shape. To the eye it was blindingly bright, like an arc welder with a white color that appeared to have a blue tinge at the edges. When I reached the trail head a forest service worker asked if I saw the light. A ranger passed by in a truck. T! he forest service worker asked the ranger who summers at Harts Pass if he knew what it was and he did not. It was nothing they had seen before. I did not see the light in the air or see the light switch on or off. I took some images of the light with a Nikon D90 DSLR using a Nikon 18-200mm VR DX lens set at f/8.0 and 200mm. I was on a steep hillside with a heavy pack, very tired, shaky and did not stop to use a tripod or optimize the camera settings so the images are not as sharp as they could be. To the eye the light was blindingly bright; it appeared to overload the camera sensor when it was imaged. The effect was similar to taking a picture of the sun without a filter, but confined to a small well defined area without lens flare or burst pattern. At least 10 people talked to me about the light and it is likely that more than 10 people saw it because there were many people hiking in that area that day and at that time. The Pacific Crest Trail stays on top of ridges in tha! t area at 6500ft or higher. I would estimate I observed the li! ght over the period of about 30 minutes.

I noticed a man jog by as I was staring at these lights, which were now only 100 yards away from me and getting closer.a sound of a VERY HIGH PITCHED jet engine came closer and closer(it was so high pitched it was almost a whistle) by this time I was looking straight up in the sky a! t this thing directly overhead me. It had a helicopter shaped body but with wings that were slanted downwards at a slight angle, and at the end of these wings were large &ldquo;fans&rdquo; which appeared to be angled down causing the fans to act as propellers. But under the main body was a jet (meaning I saw a small flame shooting out of the bottom which was maybe 2ft long) the object in question seemed to be about 30 ft long with a twenty foot wingspan and was only flying 50 FT OVER THE TREELINE. It proceeded to keep its pace which seemed to be about 100-150 mph  I then ran into my girlfriends house screaming and yelling when I told them what I saw and heard thet were amazed because they couldnt hear this thing fly over.

This light was in approximation 33 degrees north and 117 degrees west from my location (used Google Earth to approximate degrees). The object did not move the first couple of minutes and I had the chance to get my binocular and look at it. The binocular is just a regular binocular; but looking at the light or &quot;object&quot;, it was a bright and luminating yellow light (which it looked as a single connecting object without the binoculars but with them it looked like four slightly separated lights in a shape of four equal sized small circles with the gaps pulsating with light). I was only able to take cell phone photo and images (did not have my digital camera with me) but the cell phone footage along with a drawing and other material is included. Upon looking at the first light for a couple of minutes, on the opposite side of the sky (east to the visible location of the 1st object) I saw another light that was pulsating yellow that seemed to be even closer (as it looked bigger) slightly moving before moving at fast speeds. While spending only a few seconds with the binocular on the 2nd object, it too seemed to be four small luminating circles which looked as one total piece when viewed by the naked eye. The first object seemed to be in Irvine as the Irvine Spectrum is completely visible by my location (and based by my perspective was hovering above Irvine Spectrum). The second object being to the other side of the sky was clearly in a different location and in a different city. After the second light was moving slowly, I saw the 1st light &quot;accelerate&quot; slowly and became barely visible (even with the binocular). The 2nd object while visible, seemed to be moving more rapidly back and forth (appearing huge, then smaller, then huge, then barely visible and faint)th! an the 1st one. Thinking the 1st object was gone, it came to v! iew agai n (about 70-75% of the size appearance) from the earlier appearance &amp; the 2nd object also came back to view. In observing the sky after my girlfriend pointed it out to me, the sky seemed very crowded and busy like never before. I am unsure what the objects were, but they certainly of no similarity to the other objects as the other objects were much smaller and of white colored light. If I had to guess, I would guess helicopters and possibly a jet for the faster moving object. There were other faint objects I could not identify clearly. After this and during the whole commotion, a 3rd light was clearly visible (to the west appearance of the 1st object for a brief time) but no more than two objects or lights were clearly seen and visible at any given time. As stated, the entire event was about 10-15 minutes but as quickly it all seemed to happen, the objects disappeared and did not come back (according to what we saw as we waited 10-15 minutes or so after) and the other lights! and possibly helicopters quickly after that (within 2-5 minutes after). After the 1st light, I assumed it was some sort of projection light from the Irvine Spectrum; but after seeing the 2nd (and what seemed identical) light, I knew that was not possible. I don&apos;t know what the objects were that I saw, but they clearly were not an airplane, jet, or any other similar objects as the objects even stood to what it appeared completely still at times but also seemed to &quot;accelerate&quot; at extreme speeds but surely were the most unusual object(s) that I have seen my entire life.

PD))", "A craft with a portalNOV. 28, 2009  I have been wanting to tell someone about my sighting for a long time, not because I saw a UFO but because of pieces of information that may have some significant value.This was in the late 60&apos;s in California.  I was maybe 15 at the time, living with my parents. I was sleeping, in my own room at the rear of the house, when I was awakened by a noise.  It was the sound that a jet would make, however it was of a slightly different pitch, I knelt on my bed looking out of my window and was frozen in place by the sight of a UFO hoovering approx. 100&apos; above our neighbors and our house.  This UFO was the stereotypical UFO for the time and I am not sure that I could even describe it accurately now.  This craft hoovered maybe 15 seconds in this spot ( which seemed like 15 minutes ) and then it departed in a vertical direction until it was pretty high, before moving horizontally.  The next thing that happened was pretty cool.  It was a clear night with a lot of stars visible and I was watching this craft depart out of frozen, excited, curiosity.  It was traveling horizontally when it came to a spot in the sky that was pure black, no stars, and darker in! color than the night sky, as it got to this spot it turned into it an vanished instantly.I was disappointed that it was gone because I wanted to continue to watch and follow this craft, but I was excited because I felt I knew a little something that others didn&rsquo;t, and that was an explanation of how they are able to travel such great distances.  I have told very few people of this sighting because they tend to not believe you, and I have never really known who I could give this information to. If this information helps in any way than my job is done.  Thanks.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

These lights were not stationary at any point nor were they ever pretending to be stars. They flew PAST us. They made no noise. They came from seemingly nowhere both times, one light at a time. Perhaps the same light visited us both times.On this night we were at some weird place we came across called X-9 Ranch... it&apos;s privately owned land within the Saguaro National Park right by the Rincon Mountains. That night we had two very-low flying bright lights visit us -once to say hello and once as we were leaving.  The light was completely silent, the object itself was indistinguishable but I believe it was just pure light. One solid bright light like a candle, with smaller flashing colors in or around it. It flew a bit quirky and nervously, as though it was drawn to us against its will. I think the attention we were giving it made it feel uncomfortable.The first light came from the south in the direction of the city. Though we were both looking in that direction when it appeared, neither of us saw where the light originated from nor did we see it approaching from a very far distance - it just became &quot;there&quot;. When this first light came I flashed a high-beam flashlight into the sky (the type that beams through the air and can be seen for miles) at it which caused it to start fly/floating a bit drunkardly. It tried to veer itself away from the B-line on which it was coming towards us. Then it just tried to act cool and fly smoothly, attempting to maintain a more android flashing sequence, floating away like it had not notice us.... but in a &quot;looking out of the corner of it&apos;s eyes&quot; at us sort of way. But it was too late for his ruse! He/it had already been busted out and discovered as some sort of an intelligent life form as it responded to our stimuli (both physical, i.e. flashlight; and mental/verbal, i.e. thought and ver! bal command/request).The second light appeared later coming from the north. My friend and I had both agreed it was time to get going. I turned around from my view of the city to look back at the mountain right behind us and coming up from behind the mountain  over the top came an identical light to the one from earlier. I said &quot;Look, they came to say goodbye!&quot; My friend turned around and said &quot;Whoa, where the hell did that come from?&quot; I was pleased and we both watched it as it floated/flew awkwardly towards us and jumped a bit in its flight path with the small quickness of a firefly. It was an entity.Oct 20 12:00 am - 6:00 am Oct 21/2009  They perch over the mountains and I drive up to them. Get close to the basin of the mountain and they&apos;ll give you a private show.The night before the previous incident the same friend and I were again late-night hiking, this time around the Catalina mountain area. It was a man-made hiking trail and an easy one at that, however it surrounds it&apos;s hikers on either side with fencing lined with dense bushes on the left to separate the businesses/housing area and on the right... nothing but desert and barbed-wire fencing beginning where the width of the hiking trail ends and no-mans-land begins. This desert shrubbery was particularly unnerving in an exciting sort of way because there are very dense desert trees, bushes, shrubs and so forth mixed with cacti and all sorts of hiding spots that some sort of stalking predatory animal could come out of.... You could just feel it... I sensed we were in &quot;Cat Country&quot;. I told my friend the vibe I was getting and he agreed it could very well be. Never the less we journeyed on.We found a little hidden rock area to chill and watch the stars. I had noticed while we were on the trail two aliens positioned over the mountain. (I just call them aliens, a.k.a UFOs). I had my eye on them and went back to the trail to go see them while my friend stayed on the rocks. I watched them and they were the typical &quot;posers&quot; in the sky; trying to look like stars but completely having trouble staying still and they were VERY responsive to thought. I confirmed that those were my aliens for the night and went back to chill with my friend on the rocks. Before long we heard the screams of some sort of animal - probably a bob cat or a mountain kitty - and we reckoned it was time to go.Before we left I stopped my friend on the trail and said &quot;Look. See those two aliens?&quot; pointing towards them right above the mountain&apos;s top horizon. He said &quot;Yeah I do...&quot; I said &quot;Watch, does it look like they are moving?&quot; The aliens began to wiggle out of their stationary positions in the sky. I moved my arms, like a conductor of an orchestra, and directed them which way to go in the sky. I would lift up my arm and motion to the right, they would fly that way in the sky in tandem. To the left, and the same. Figure 8 too. I said &quot;Are you seeing this?&quot;.  He said he did. He was astonished and quiet and humble. He took on the same calm awe that I had seen in my other friend who experienced the same phenomenon with me the first time over the same mountains about a month earlier. They just watched in quiet and seemed accepting of it and me, the crazy girl who thinks she is an alien who brings them to the mountains to play with UFOs. I have great friends. lol.", "The green light zoomed across the lake leaving a splitting wake that parted the water.On July 12, 2008,me and two of my friends  from norman, Oklahoma were at lake Texhoma. We were on a deck boat driving to go to a club that was located on the other side of my friends dock. As we started getting closer to the club I realized I didn&rsquo;t have my ID and we figured they wouldn&rsquo;t let me in without identification, so we decided we would just drive around and look at the nice house boats that were close to the club. After we were done looking at the boats we decided to go back to my friend&rsquo;s lake house.  To get to his lake house we had to go underneath a train bridge that went the width of the of the lake. There is a shore that is approximately 200 yards straight in front of us that has a hill that is about 30 feet high. On top of the hill on the shore we saw a white light that kind of looked like a spotlight or a lighthouse light. Our first thought was that the light was coming from the boat patrol, but as we continued to watch the light, the object somehow went from the top of the hill to the water. At this time we know that it wasn&rsquo;t a spotlight or a lighthouse light, because not only did the object move from the hill to the water but it began to move on the water like it was a boat except it was moving too smoothly for a boat, and the object was making no sound. We couldn&rsquo;t tell exactly what the light was connected to because the lake was completely dark. As we drifted across the lake in neutral, the object met us at an angle about 50 feet from the no wake zone. That&rsquo;s when we realized that the object was to big to be a yacht or a boat house. The object was so large that we actually had to look up and down, left and right to see the full length and width of the object.  We started to getting closer to the object when we noticed that we going to wreck into the object if we didn&rsquo;t turn, so we turned to our right where there was a smaller object approximately 15 feet next to us. The object emitted a green light and sat! stationary as we watched it trying to figure out if it was an! other de ck boat but we couldn&rsquo;t see anything except the green light and silhouette of what the light was connected to. In the middle of us arguing about what the object was, the green light took off without any noise across the lake going along the train bridge within less than 0:01.5 second leaving a trail from the wake it created when it took off. After we saw the green light disappear we noticed that the larger object had disappeared as well.This event changed my belief in UFOs and other paranormal wonders of the world.  I believe that whatever me and my friends saw was not manmade, and if it was manmade then there is some kind of military weapon or vehicles that unknown to the rest of the world.", "Bright brilliant orange cylinder object about New Market Gap, with light flying from it and coming back to craft.The object was seen from the road near Luray Caverns airport.  It was above a cloud over the New Market Gap.  It was shaped like a tube, it was bright shiny orange as if reflecting the sunset behind it.  A light flew out of it and then came back to the craft.  After about 5 minutes it disappeared. I was alone so I don&apos;t know if anybody else saw it.  Many years ago, in the early seventies, at Christmas, my family and I saw very bright lights in the same area.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was about 19 at the time, and the other witness with me was about 24. I distinctly remember it being the 4th of July because we had heard firecrackers and fireworks going off all night however I noted to myself that we saw no lights from the fireworks at all and only heard the noises very far off.  The night was perfectly clear and the baseball field had no lights so the night sky and stars were very bright and easy to see, there was no moon that I can recall.We were lying on our backs watching the stars, comets, satellites and planes for about an hour and during that hour a small pinprick of purple light became visible almost directly above us. It was bright enough to easily track and very obviously purple colored. At first it was the size of a star and almost unnoticeable among all the stars in the sky, however it grew slightly bigger after a few minutes (probably as large or larger as the north star on a good night, with a slight purple glow around it making it just that much larger than the stars, however not quite as bright) and flew around in a somewhat erratic manner. It only moved a matter of inches across the sky from my perspective though obviously it must have traveled much further since it was so far away- though I have no idea if it was within the atmosphere or much further out. It was traveling very fast considering we had been watching satellites go by that night and they are extremely sluggish compared to this lig! ht. The pattern of its movement were strange and all I can really remember from that night is that it seemed to zig and zag around at random the entire time we saw it, sometimes stopping to hang for a few minutes before moving again, it&rsquo;s size and color/brightness waxing and waning slightly without pattern. It only moved within a small quadrant of the sky, almost like it was circling something. A reference for its speed I had in my mind at that time was that if a plane was at that height and moving across the sky at a steady speed, the purple light would be moving double that speed- not exactly zipping around but still much faster than a plane. Because we were on our backs and it was almost directly over us it looked like it must have been out among the stars, however at a different angle it might have been within the atmosphere and much closer than what we thought. After staring at it for about 15 minutes it simply flew/faded away (with a little bit of a tail like a tiny c! omet) and nothing else happened in the sky that night.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

In complete shock, I put my arm up to shield my eyes from the light to get a better look, but couldn&apos;t see anything. After hovering over me, it quietly resumed flight. After a few seconds, it stopped again (this time some distance away) and dropped two smaller orange orbs from it&apos;s bottom. Both orbs disappeared before hitting the ground.

At approximately 8:35 PM, My two sons and I were driving southbound on Main street (n Crystal Lake) heading towards Rakow road when my oldest son (who was sitting in the front passenger seat of our minivan) pointed out that he was seeing some very strange lightening flashes. I told him that there shouldn&apos;t be an lightening as there was too few clouds and no rain ot severe weather at that time.  He then directed my attention to a small patch of semi-transparent clouds that were very high in the sky (as stated above).  From this small patch of cloud, bright/intense multi-colored lights could be observed flashing in a strobe-light-like fashion in what seemd like a definite pattern... there were blue, white, green lights and gold lights flashing v! ery quickly one after another and almost to the point (at times) of occuring simulaneously at times. the entire sky lit-up - but only where the small patch of clouds was, the light&apos;s did not flash far beyond the cloud patch - if at all.  As the ligth&apos;s flashed, the cloud became virtually transparent and the shape of an object could be seen. It was very large - especially considering the height it was estimated at being at and was long, thin, and cylindrical/cigar shaped.  We observed the flashing lights for approximately one to two minutes.The second to the last flash we observed, lit-up the entire cloud patch in bright white - making it completely transparent which allowed us to see a much clearer outline of the cylindrical/cigar shaped object itself!  The bright white flash stayed lit for approximately 5 - 7 seconds, which allowed us to see that the object was an orange-ish gold color and was several hundred feet long (on the low-end) and up to approximately 1000 feet long on the high-end.There was one last flash of white/gold light that we observed before the object vanished.The following day, my kids and I checked in with the Lake in the Hills Airport about what we had seen and to check if any one else had contacted them, and were told that there had been no other reports made on this incident.", "11 orange oval objects moving under perceived intelligent controlWednesday evening, November 24, 2009; approximately 7:40 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.Night conditions - clear; moon in crescent;  Noted orange oval in eastern sky; moving south; distance appeared to be approximately 3 miles + in elevation; (I think it was probably at 50 degrees from the horizontal) orange oval moved southerly direction, followed by yet another orange oval;  both ovals disappeared from sight; another orange oval then was noted moving from the northern part of the sky toward the south, this was followed closely by yet another oval;  a group of 4 ovals then followed, they were not in a set formation and appeared to speed up and slow down independently of the other ovals.

For three consecutive years, in the late 1990s/early 2000s, I worked the fall cranberry harvest at the Oceanspray fruit-receiving plant in Middleboro, MA, in the Cape Cod region.  The plant is in a remote area amongst historic cranberry bogs. In late September of 2001, I was working through a second shift break on the outside of the large facility. I never talked about this with anyone at the plant, but it is likely that I was the only person working outside at that time. I looked up to see a craft passing over the factory. Briefly, I thought it might be a stealth airplane or some military craft related to 9/11. However, there were details of my sighting that make the craft I witnessed irreconcilable with known crafts of human origin. It was so low and large that it filled the sky to all horizons/tree lines(the factory was surrounded by pine forest). It was completel! y silent, and this was disorienting. It kept going and going and going. The bottom of the craft did look like something humans could make. There were panels, and it bore a slight resemblance to the bottom of the millennium falcon/starship enterprise. The colors were dark like a stealth bomber and it had the same smooth flat texture. I saw one red light on the end of a stem-like apparatus descending from the craft. It took about 60 seconds from the time I became aware of the object passing overhead to when it disappeared behind the tree line north of the plant. Generally, I would say that its shape was rectangular. More specifically, I would describe its shape as two large rectangular shapes joined in the middle but slightly offset, each the size of an extra-large football stadium. However, the size is difficult to estimate because it was a disorienting experience, but I would guess that it was 400 yards long and 300 yards wide. I couldn&apos;t determine any depth or height. That! is not to say that it was flat, but its width and length were! of a much larger scale then its height. I estimate that its speed was 30mph. When it happened, I said to myself that I was going to keep this to myself and that it was my special weird moment. I don&apos;t know why I had this psychological reaction. It was somewhat traumatic, and the memory came back to me a time after the event. I can&apos;t explain this, but I did feel that the craft was affecting my brain/thought process in some way that encouraged my disbelief. Was the craft silent or is there a superior technology that can make crafts inaudible to our brains etc.? I didn&apos;t tell this story to anyone until this thanksgiving and I am going to try and track down people from my shift at the plant at that time.

I stepped back from the house and looked up to check the lights when I noticed a bright red light in the southern sky.  It was a little lower and to the left of the moon, about 45 degrees above the horizon.  It was about 3 times as large as Jupiter and about 3 times as bright.  I watched it for a while expecting to see some navigation lights appear as it approached me.

Through the binoculars I saw no discernible shape to the object, just a bright red light quietly going across the sky.  It maintained the same altitude and did not flicker or change direction.  I decided to run inside to get my camera to take some pictures.  I managed to get a few shots, however as I am not that skilled with my camera while taking night shots, I had some trouble getting the auto focus to act right.  The pictures show a red (out of focus) spherical light.  As I watched it travel north off into the distance it then started to blink and went out as if someone had turned off a switch.  I believe it blinked about 5 times prior to it disappearing.Besides the moon, this was the brightest object in the sky.

The body of a commercial plane at that height and directly above can clearly be seen on a cloudless night.

This lasted 6-8 seconds.", "I thought it was a start, to begin with, and possibly the fog or mist  was rising over lake to make it &quot;flicker&quot;, but it is clear.Flickering point of light, moving in a straight line -- noted for pst 35 minutes.  Can be seen over Lake Barkley, looking into LBL.  Appears to be very far away.", "i made me feel it was a living thing.  that it was aliveThe best way I can give the exact date of my sighting is there was a news story on tv by walter Cronkite in 1976 or 75. The news story was about ufo and trips to eternity in a ufo where families even gave away there own kids to go on a trip to eternity.A lot of bs agreed.  Anyway heres what happened. Thinking about that news story later that night  I was wondering if they can read minds  So I kept thinking where I am with land marks and directions in my head thinking About new york by looking at a world map.  Right down to where my town is And what my house looks like and what&rsquo;s near it. So later I sead and watched kojack on tv.As I lay on my bed watching tv what I first think was the moon came in view and maybe It was there all the time and I didn&rsquo;t know it. Then it moved. Exact direction north east.The edges of it seem to have points and when it moved it looked like it was crawling on the sky. It was round. With small points all around its edge that get longer then Shorter like its pulling itself across the sky. What ever it was I think it was a living thing Of some kind. I was afraid to go near a window night for some time. Or go out at Night. I reported this to other ufo sites just check my story about the trips to eternity and Walter Cronkite. I don&rsquo;t know how to spell his name so this is a sound like.And I was so afraid  because I could feel it knows me. And can see me. I hope I never see it again. But it leaves me with the memory and I still would like it Explained to me what I saw NOTE i no longer live in greenwich ct and cant give my current address", "Red Green and white flashing lights?My mom&apos;s boyfriend went out on our back porch to smoke about an hour ago after dinner, noticed something in the sky and after watching it for about 20 minutes we know it is not a plane, satilite, or anything any of us have ever seen, it looks like a big star flashing green, red, and white lights, it move slightly. we have it in our telescope. Plans went straight toward it and turned away.  IS ANYONE ELSE SEEING THIS? Do you have an explanation? Thank you,       ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  The report is confusing to us.  The source indicates a time of &quot;6:00,&quot; suggesting a morning sighting on Monday, November 23, but states that the sighting occurred &quot;..after dinner.&quot;  Also, she fails to indicate the duration of the sighting.  We have no means of contacting the person, given that she provided no contact data.  We suspect that the witnesses may have been observing a &quot;twinkling&quot; star.

I jumped out of the car to see them and starred in amazment, realizing they weren&apos;t meteors but were bright red or orange balls of fire that seemed to be following each other like they were playing.  Each ball kept moving ahead of the other until they stopped right in front of us and just hoovered there for about 5 more minutes.  We saw an airplane coming towards them and all of a sudden one of the firballs started to get lighter, then darker again, and lighter until it was no longer visible and then the other one did the same until both were gone completely!  I waited to see if they&apos;d come back into sight but didn&apos;t and my neighbor also was outside and seen them as well.  I do beleive what we all saw was 2 ufo&apos;s and have never been so scared in my life!((NUFORC Note:  Date may be wrong.  Source of report may have intended to write 11/05/2009, not 10/05/2009.
