["Gaffney SC Report. Bright Light With SparksTime was 8:30-9:30pm not sure as we just arrived home from shopping in Shelby NC.I was standing at the edge of my property looking at what I thought was Venus. It was stationary for some time but, started moving. It appeared to start moving very slowly and appeared as just a large star. As it moved closer it emitted large sparks. I would estimate it about the size of a car. I couldn&apos;t make out any distinguishing features only that it was a yellowish/white color light ball.  It was about 50ft high in the air and wobbled back and forth a bit. At first glance I thought it was a helicopter with problems but, as it became closer it was apparent it was not such a craft because it had no noise nor as big as a helicopter. It sped up by the time it reached the other side of the property and made a directional turn northwards. The sparking was occasional and rained down on the trees below.My parents were also witnesses to this event.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

I noticed an extremely highflying object moving east off the ocean then quickly changing course proceeding southwest. The object had an enormously large red haze or halo around what looked like a star, traveled at fast speeds with no sound. Because the object was flying so high, this red halo/haze was the only way my eye could keep tracking its position and movements which I consequently lost sight of behind high clouds. A moment later I tracked another object starting at the same position as the first, again showing a red haze/halo around it and followed the same course.", "2 bright lights going south very high and fast and appearing to go up and out of sight.I was sitting on the south side of my house at the time shown. The sky was clear and the moon was out. I was looking south toward the moon and a bright star on its lsft. I noticed 2 lights to the right of the moon moving fast in a south direction. The light in front was bright and the other a little dimmer. The size of the lights were alittle larger than the brightest star. The lights were very sharp and clear. They were whitish in color. The dimmer light appeared to follow the brighter one. The distance between the lights would be about an inch if i held my hand out and covered the lights with my fingers.

Just then a second craft flew in at such a great speed and stopped instantly next to the one we were looking at.  There was a brief pause and then they both shot off and were gone just as quickly as they came.

My uncle lived in a trailer park just off the side of a Marine Fighter base. We would walk down a dirt road to the end of the AOA area to watch the planes. We especially enjoyed watching them do touch and goes after dark. This was because the f-16&apos;s had bright green lights on their tail fins.On the last night we were in Yuma, we stood on a dirt hill at the end of the base&apos;s runway. It was around 9pm when the last of the fighters took off. This time when they disappeared over the horizon, they never returned. After about 30 minutes of no aircraft activity on the base, we got bored and left. On the way back to the trailer park I just happened to look up to admire the stars. When I looked up, I could only see darkness.At first I wondered if some clouds had rolled in without us noticing them. So I began to look out past the dark spot to see how far the cloud cover reached. It was at that moment that I noticed there were star visible all around the dark spot in the sky. Confused I began to study the dark spot. It was then that I noticed that the object had a long straight leading edge. I could tell, because the stars above were disappearing under these leading edges at an equal rate of speed.Then out of the corner of my eye I noticed a flash. I looked toward the tiny flash and it went off again. It reminded me of an airplane beacon. Next I followed the leading edge of the wing forward until I noticed a tiny white light at the nose. The light was constantly on, just very hard to detect with the naked eye. It looked like all the other stars in the sky. I then followed the leading edge of the wing down the opposite side of the craft. At a great distance away, I spotted another tiny green strobe light.The object appeared to be about 200-400 feet up.  Standing back I looked from one strobe light to the other. Then I followed those lights up to the tiny light in the nose area of the craft. The vehicle was huge. I estimated about a football field&rsquo;s length from wing tip to wing tip. Perhaps half a football fields length from the back of the craft to the tiny nose light. I couldn&apos;t believe how large the craft was!  The craft moved at a very low rate of speed. It almost seemed to have a hover capability. I stopped walking to listen to see if the object made any noise. I heard a very quite blowing sound. It reminded me of a fighter plan idling on the taxi-way. The exception was that it was barely audible. We watch the craft float slowly over the edge of Yuma and then disappear into the darkness. The whole event took about 3 minutes time.I always assumed that this was a military aircraft. I could clearly see the Marine Fighter Base&apos;s air traffic control tower from where I was at the time. I figured if I could see the tower, then the tower could see the object. Since there was no activity on the base at the time, I figured they knew about it. A military fighter base wouldn&apos;t let such a large object float past the end of their runway and do nothing.Then last year I was listening to the Art Bell show on Coast to Coast Am.On that show a guest called in from Arizona. The guest exactly described the same craft that I had seen. This brought up the whole discussion of the famous &quot;Arizona Lights.&quot; After hearing several stories about this large triangle type craft I decided to contact you.Is this a military craft being secretly tested at night? What is your take on this incident?  Ps. I am an air show fan and love all sorts of military aircraft.

We were traveling from Milwaukee south to Kenosha on a road running parallel and just east of I-94.  We first noticed what we thought was a plane flying very low with extremely bright lights flying directly at us.  The plane took a long time to reach us and eventually we pulled over to witness this flyby.  The three lights were so bright.   We pulled the car over and turned off the engine.  The craft was flying around 100 ft off the ground&mdash;amazing.  It was all-white, one winged, no windows, and had to be two stories thick but rounded with slightly swept back wings.  The most amazing part was it made no noise!  It looked like it weighed 300 tons, as big as a passenger jet but much thicker.  Moreover, it was flying no more than 15 mph.  I had a good long look at it 100 feet away.  It flew right along the west side of the road.  By far the most amazing thing I&rsquo;ve ever seen.   I&rsquo;ve told the story many times with a response most often of &ldquo;hm.&rdquo;  I have yet to look on the site but more people had to see this thing.

I went in to the back yard to (which is about 70 yds and slopes downward into the woods) and noticed the trees in the woods background were lighting up in a flashing manner. I thought there may be hunters back there but the flashing light was way too powerful for any spotlight that local raccoon hunters would use. I thought it may be lightning but only a section of the woods was lighting up. The light was like a fluorescent white color and reminded me of a strobe light color. The woods would light up for about 10 seconds and the light (or beam) seemed to be scanning the section of the woods like it was examining the trees and then would turn off for 5 secs.

Coming out of the front door of my unit at an apartment-converted-condominium building, the lawn was surrounded by the building in a box-like fashion, with an exception of the south side fully open where the parking lot was.  I walked toward the parking lot, into the opening, and to my right, I spotted a bright red light in the sky, above the trees.  I looked directly at it, and the red light softly throbbed, like a beacon light.  From my vantage point, to the left of the red light were three bright white lights flashing in a rapid succession.  The red light would lit up and fade, then three rapid white flashes from right to left, then back to the red light lighting up.  It&rsquo;d repeat the process. I could tell that they were lights on an object, but I could not see the shape of the object.  At first, I thought it must be an airplane or a helicopter, so I waited for it to come closer in hope of a better inspection of what it was.

I also realized that the lights were unusually bright: the red light was just too noticeable and the white flashes were sparkling bright &ndash; similar to a camera flash. If it was moving, it was done at a barely noticeable pace.  So slow that I was unsure if it was moving or remaining stationary.  For the most part, it remained stationary.  It remained virtually motionless for 10 good long minutes.  Finally, it moved further from me until I could no longer see it due to the trees being in the way.  The way it moved, it moved very smoothly; in a gliding motion.  There was no sign of the object turning as it moved away; the lights remaining in their same positions.

As soon as i took my phone out of my pocket, the black ball slowed dramatically, i put my fone back into my pocket as the thought of abduction passed my mind. when the phone slipped back into my pocket, the ball sped back up and flew out alond the horizon towards the city. The object was black and in a perfect ball sha. It appeared to be tennis ball sized from where we saw but actual size was probably a bowling ball, to a gymball&apos;s size.it fully resisted the wind and showed no signs of drag. it made absolutely no noise and didnt appear to have any windows or abstract objects, it was just a ball. after this event occured, a severe thunder and hail storm cam in for about 1 hour, then the storm ceased into a beutiful warm calm day. because we were walking across the dune as a shortcut, no one else appeared to have seen it.", "Saw Red/Orange circular glowing objects.Dan and I had made a trip over to Pensacola (which is right next door to Gulf Breeze where all those alleged sightings took place back in the day). It was an afternoon in early November. The whole day had been overcast and you couldn&apos;t see anything but low, dark clouds.. the sun was never in sight. We were heading home over the Pensacola bridge, which is really long.. I was in the passenger seat looking out over the water, where I saw a very bright orange glowing something-or-other with 3 smaller orange glowing something-or-others hovering around it. We were going about 65 miles an hour and it appeared that the 4 objects were stationary. I always bring my digital camera when we go to P-Cola, so I moved quick to grab it and take a picture. When I finally got the camera on and ready, the 3 smaller objects were gone and only the large one remained. I managed to get one picture.. I didn&apos;t get anymore because I must have looked away for just long enough, that when I tried to capture it again, it was gone. I know we couldn&apos;t have been the only ones that saw it. There was plenty of traffic on the bridge and there were quite a few people fishing from the shore that was directly facing where the objects had been. It sucks that I didn&apos;t get a better or long enough view of the objects.. it all happened so quickly.. but I can still see it in my mind of it hovering below the cloudline. Like I said, I don&apos;t know what it was or that it was anything strange, even though it seemed totally out of place to anything I&apos;ve ever seen in the sky. Some people bring up that it might have been flares.. could be. I don&apos;t remember seeing or hearing any passing aircrafts that would have been dropping them though. Other than that, what could it have been? It was in our immediate atmosphere, in the middle of the day, it couldn&apos;t have been any falling stars, comets or any of that stuff, could it? It wasn&apos;t no damn weather balloon, either. Who knows? I just know it was weird and I now count myself amongst the many others! who cla im to have seen such strange things in the skies... The funny thing is, I was watching another TV show about UFO&apos;s, and they were talking about all of the Gulf Breeze (which is right next to P-Cola) activity from a while back.. and in one of the many pictures they showed that had been taken by a witness, was a picture of pretty much what we saw that day, but they got a shot of all 4 objects together... hhhhmmmm???", "red and white lights seen over South Western  New HamphireSaw  a object going north with very vivid red and and white lights Flashing all the way from left to right. it was fairly low but we only saw the lights  and it made no noise.

At the top of a gentle hill I looked straight down the road running through the condo complex to the Pacific Ocean.  At the foot of the hill there are tall Norfolk pine trees on both sides framing the Pacific Ocean beyond.  Between these trees, over the ocean (cannot judge how far out) in the dark starless sky I saw a gigantic bright emerald green object that looked like a beach ball crushed from top and bottom into a shape like an oval with very narrow sides.  It was deeper green around the edges of the object.  It seemed to be floating over the ocean but I could see no reflection on the water.  I was quite fascinated by the vibrancy of the green color one the outer edges of the object.  I stood there watching it possibly two and a half to three minutes and then it shot off straight out to sea, not up, as best I could tell and disappeared immediately.  No afterglow as it disappeared.  It was just gone!  I rushed inside and called the Santa Barbara Sheriff&apos;s office and asked if they had any reports on green foreign objects in the sky.  Non emergency calls were being picked up in the Santa Maria Sheriff&apos;s department for some reason and I was told I could not get a contact for a non-emergency here in Santa Barbara.  The woman who answered informed me, &quot;Whatever you think you saw it&apos;s three days before Fourth of July.  If you really did see something it was early fireworks.&quot;  I am 79 years old and I&apos;ve seen fireworks all my life from Los Angeles to Washington DC to France to China.  I know fireworks when I see them.  This had nothing to do with fireworks!  I then called a friend who is into astronomy seriously and he contacted people he knows involved in it but none of them saw anything.  I didn&apos;t know where else to turn so dropped it, other than for conversation starter at boring dinner parties. Seeing you on Larry King tonight I decided I would file a report.  I was not drinking, I am a very successful published author and lecturer. still working at 79, who is totally balanced mentally and I have good eyesight.

A large Air Force Base (Hill Field), is located just fifteen miles North of Bountiful City, and another fourth-five miles West of Salt Lake (Dugway Proving Grounds), although I&rsquo;ve never thought these facilitys were related to the sittings,  The first sitting was approximately around the middle of July in 1996, at about 12:35am MST.  I was twenty years old at the time, standing outside my family&rsquo;s home in Bountiful in the company of three friends socializing.  As an avid star gaze in the hot summer nights, I took a short moment to gaze up at the stars, when my eyes had caught the attention of something out of place.  Looking around I notice an object blacking out the night sky.  After a few seconds my eyes were able to adjust and focus to the description of a Black Triangle Craft.  The Craft was traveling in a South direction taking it right over the Utah State Capital Building and Down Town Salt Lake City Area.  The altitude here in Bountiful is approximately 4,500 ft above sea level, and the Black Triangle Craft appeared to be another 2,000 ft above ground level, thus easily clearing the small mountain range that separated Bountiful from the down town Salt Lake City area.   Although this Craft could have been at a much higher altitude thus causing me to have a limited ability to give a true description of size, it appeared to have a wing span greater of 200 yards.   I was however able to see the bottom of this Craft was flat, and it appeared to have some unknown design or odd markings that spread over the entire surface.  There was no lights that could be seen, for this Craft was completely black and passed right over the top of me without ever making a sound.  The Black Triangle Craft seemed to glide across the midnight sky, and gave a real strange feeling of something foreign to this world and the technologies we posses.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I fly gliders in Surry and surrounding counties and am familiar with aircraft in the area.  The Coast Guard (not Ft Eustis - Army) provide security with helicopters for the nuclear plant.  Just after 9/11 they would land at night, with permission, at our glider field that is only a few miles from the plant.  They could respond within moments of any threat to the plant yet not be detected before hand.  One of our glider club members is one of their pilots.  There is also a blimp factory on the Virginia / North Carolina border that often fly blimps in the area. (The Blackwater private mercenary intelligence company along with many other military black ops are in this region too) The blimps prefer calmer days and usually stay further south, but it isn&apos;t a requirement and could account for the hovering effect by flying into the wind to get back to their field upwind.  They normally don&apos;t fly that close to the eastern part of the area, along the James River, because it is a longer flight back. A strong s/w wind could blow them over there and their small engines would work hard to get them back to N. Carolina.  If they were there they may have been sightseeing over the James River.  Jamestown, Colonial Williamsburg, and the small Williamsburg airport are on the east side of James River and the airport could be used for an emergency landing if the blimp were in trouble.On the Jamestown, James City County side of the river where the witness was standing also is home to a very highly restricted military inteligence community / base, where they are known to test experimental spy craft.  Local pilots have witnessed small unmanned recon aircraft being flown over the base.  Pilot in the air away from the restricted airspace but close enough to see it.  I strongly suspect the witness saw one of the above explanations.  It could have been a very planned flight by the plant security, but I suspect it was a blimp, helicopter, possibly an off course military item, or maybe even a small airplane waiting to come in at the Williamsburg field.  There are very strict rules against flying near the nuclear plants.  Pilots are not supposed to &quot;loiter&quot; over them in an airplane.  Whatever that means.  If a blimp were blown over the plant by the wind it would be an embarrassment to the plant to admit nothing was done.  There is also some ultra light activity in the area.  It may have been unidentifiable to a distant viewer but to someone near it may have not been an unusual object to be seen in those skies.  Hope this helps.((name and telephone number deleted))((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS WHO SUBMITTED ORIGINAL REPORT))Response To So-Called Explanations Of Previous SightingI am responding to Mr. ((name deleted)) &quot;explanation&quot; of what I saw on the 19th of May 2008.His statement that there is a blimp factory on the NC/VA border is patently false. There is a company with an office in Durham, NC, called Flairships that leases out aerial advertising blimps to various companies, but they did not have any blimps in the air over SE Virginia on the day in question. I contacted other companies that utilize airships (including Goodyear and MetLife), and none of them had a blimp within 200 miles of the James River on that day.  Having seen advertising blimps on various occasions over the years, I can assure you that this was not a blimp. I had a close-up view of it under ideal conditions. What I saw had no writing of any kind on its sides.  Nor did it have a crew cabin on its belly, a tail assembly, or motors or any other protuberances from its surface. The craft I saw was perfectly smooth and silent.  It was also in the range of 300-400 feet long. Even the largest advertising blimps in use today are only about 200 feet long. And they, like the Goodyear blimp, have the company logo prominently displayed on their hull.  Otherwise, what&rsquo;s the use of having an advertising blimp?   The idea that a blimp might have been blown from north to south by a southwest wind is laughable.  If anything, it would have been blown towards Williamsburg, not away from it. As I said before, the craft I saw moved strongly INTO the wind and was not at its mercy.  And, with all of the empty real estate it could possibly encounter along the river, it chose to stop just opposite a nuclear power station?  That, in itself, is telling.I called the Jamestown airport (which is less than a mile from my house) two hours after my sighting, and the fellow in charge assured me that there was nothing even remotely like a blimp in the air that day. Unfortunately, the local airport does not use radar, so he couldn&rsquo;t tell me just what may have been flying over the river at noon that day.The &ldquo;very highly restricted military intelligence community/base&rdquo; he refers to must be Camp Peary, aka &ldquo;The Swamp.&rdquo; This is the well-known CIA training base on the York River. It lies on the other side of Williamsburg about 5 miles from where I made my sighting. Having lived here for the past 15 years, I too have heard tales of remotely piloted vehicles like the Predator drone flying over the base and the nearby York River. But they are never seen over the historic areas or the James River. I know what a Predator looks like, and with its sleek body, long wings and bulbous nose, it was the complete opposite of what I saw. I suspect you could pack twenty Predators inside of what I saw.Having seen this alien craft up close (at first from less than half a mile away) and then at a distance of about three miles, I am absolutely certain that it was not a helicopter, &ldquo;military item&rdquo; (whatever that means), or small airplane. I spent 6 years in the Navy and believe my eyesight is still good enough to distinguish helicopters, Ospreys, and fixed winged aircraft from the absolutely unique craft I witnessed. And the idea that I&rsquo;d mistake an ultralight for a 300 feet long craft leaves me speechless. I have seen ultralights fly over directly my house while out doing yard work, and I&rsquo;d know their shape anywhere. Besides, they make as much noise as a flying lawnmower. What I saw was silent.In summation, I&rsquo;d like to add that I&rsquo;ve attempted to get in contact with Mr. Ebersole, as he so obligingly left his phone number, bur he has so far refused to return my calls. All I know of him is that he lives in Virginia Beach, about 60 miles from the sighting area, which, by the way, is home to Oceana NAS. Just up the peninsula a few miles is Langley AFB, a first response base which is tasked to defend US airspace in the event of hostile activity (such as 9/11). This part of Virginia is home to at least a half dozen very sensitive military bases.I am speculating here, but I suspect that the idea that an alien craft could literally &ldquo;stroll&rdquo; past these bases, at midday, right over the heads of millions of people, and not be detected, much less confronted, and then loiter next to a nuclear power station, is something that no one in the armed forces or the intelligence community is willing to admit to. There also appears to be a coordinated effort to discredit valid sightings.((e-address deleted))((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides little contact information.

Then it began to slowly move back and forth I thought my eyes were playing games but I judged the realationship between the other stars and this bright object had subtle movment then it smoothly started &quot;sliding&quot; off to the right and quickly got darker at the same time moving east/northeast then it was dark and I could no longer see it, just 10 minutes earlier I saw a Solid white &quot;star&quot; blinking off and on every 5 seconds seen in the northwest sky moving left to right,East did not have the normal red and green lights of a normal aircraft, I thought it could have been a satelite rotating reflecting the light of the sun on it&apos;s solar panels that had set hours earlier.About 5 to 10 minutes after seeing the object in the big dipper 4 F16&apos;s flew out of Luke air force base in the general direction of the object I saw in the big dipper and flew right over my house, they normally do not fly at that time of night and not in loose formation, I live near Luke AFB and have a general idea of thier flights they train pilots and fly in tight formations in gruops of 2 to 4 aircraft.

The object would move around a small area with high speed and maneuverability.  Several times the craft would shoot straight up into the atmosphere until it was out of sight and then return to the same location below the clouds.  This occurred several times.  If an airplane came into view the light would disappear until the plane was out of sight.  The craft was visible for at least 30 minutes.  I went inside the house to get a 35mm camera.

I was living in down town Sacramento, California. I don&rsquo;t remember what time of year it was, but I lived on the corner of 13th street and F street. I always took my dog out for a potty walk, roughly between 10 and 11p.m. Across from our place was a vacant lot, that I always walked him in. I took him out that night as I always did and walked across the street to the vacant lot. It was a cool evening and the fog was hovering above the roof tops, when I noticed above me, in the fog, lights. I looked up and was amazed at what I saw.There were three sets of triangular lights, each triangle was made up of three long strips of light, formed into each triangle. What ever it was, where ever they came from, was huge, I don&rsquo;t even believe I could accurately describe the size. They were enter moving about each other, they were red and blue.I could only compare what I was looking at, to some type of computer graphic design you might see on the web. I was so amazed that I ran back into the house and asked my then 15 year old son to come out and look too. He did, and we both stood there in the middle of the street amazed, at what we were watching above our heads, the lights moving in and out of each other, and changing about, while what ever was making them, hid in the fog.I didn&rsquo;t own a video camera at the time, or I would have tried to film the spectacular sight that was occurring. We stood there, my son and I, for a very long time. Two of our neighbors emerged from their apartment, and at first look, they laughed at us, like what the heck are they doing standing in the middle of the street. And then they too, glanced up to the sky above us, and muttered something to the matter of profanity when they too saw the lights. It was at that moment that the lights disappeared. I have never in my life before or since seem anything like it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Similar to a &quot;shooting star,&quot; what I saw was remarkably closer and larger in perspective.  It didn&apos;t look to be far away in space but nearby in our sky. The core was bright white and had a glowing aura of blue. The tail appeared blue as well. It shot somewhat diagonally in a slight south to north direction and disappeared from my vision behind a cluster of trees.

However, I began to notice that the &ldquo;star&rdquo; was hovering/vibrating.With binoculars, I observed two white-lighted objects, one above the other, shaped in opposite fan-shapes.  The two lights would work together, one above the other, and, at times, go back together as one. The two &quot;lights&quot; would hover and vibrate for a moment in an area, swirl a flash of blue light or send a white streak out or flash a white or red dot somewhere on the perimeter.  It was as if the two &ldquo;white lights&rdquo; were in the center of a larger object.  As it would hover, vibrate; send flashes or dots and then move slowly to the next area.  The object was always &quot;moving&quot;- meaning vibrating/hovering/flashing. It worked westward. There was no sound.  The evening was clear- minimal cloud cover and approx. 75 degrees.I spent from 3:30 a.m. to 4:30 a.m. watching from my balcony with small binoculars.  I sent a text message to a friend of mine and described it.  I attempted to get pictures and video, but the object was too far away and the sky too dark for my camera to be able to record.During this period, a small plane approached from the north, in a, what seemed, direct path with the object.  I observed the plane continue on its flight path, without changing direction, and fly directly &quot;below&quot; the object.

There was no sound.The lights then stayed lit together and the object traveled slowly above the house and away to the east.

The object was on the ground and I could see definition in the lights going around the object.  I studied the object for several minutes going back into my bedroom to see if maybe it was a glare from the TV or some other light in my house.  I turned off the TV and there were no other lights on in my house and went back to look and it was still there.  I then went into my dining room area an looked out that window and watched the object again.  I then called my 17 year old son to come look at this as well.  He watched the object with me in disbelief trying to figure out what the bright orange glow was.  We than went outside on the carport and it was very quiet and my dog was not barking at the object.  My son went in the front yard to look to see if it was the moon somehow glaring in the pasture but it was not.  I called for him to come in the house because I was actually beginning to get frightened at this point.  I do live near West Georgia Regional Airport and thought maybe it was some sort of aircraft.  We went into the house and within 10 seconds when we left the back yard and went back to the dining room area the object had disappeared.   I also could see a strange glow where the object had been.

Ever since that night, I watched the same areas of the sky&hellip;hoping I would see it again.I did see it again tonight, June 17, 2008 at 10:15 p.m.  I saw what I thought was a star just light up so bright, and move slowly downward, it hovered for a couple of seconds, and I could see the shape of the craft this time.  It was definitely triangular.  The light that came off light up the sky all around it like an electrical charge, and the color of the light was a very bright bluish-white.  After it hovered, it turned and took off an absolutely incredible rate of speed, and followed a commercial flight that was heading due north.  It easily caught up to the flight, and passed it up as if it were standing still. I have seen some weird things up in the sky, but this was by far the most unexplainable thing I have ever seen.    Only the Joint Strike Fighter Lightening II, a helicopter, or a Harrier Jet can hover like that.  All I know is&hellip;both times I have seen this thing it was silent.  It is my theory the only HUMAN thing I know of that could fly like that is&hellip;the Air Force/NASA experimental TR3-A or TR3-B &ldquo;Night-Walker&rdquo;, which is part of the Aurora program.

I was northeast of Lee Vining and while star gazing with a telescope I noticed a brillant light sitting on the ground appox 3 miles away near the east shore of Mono Lake.It rose straight off the ground and began making slow circles in the sky.Absolutely silent. At one point it passed over a mountain ridge to the east and lit up the entire ridge line so that every detail of the terrain could be seen. I later checked a topo map and this ridge was almost 12 miles away.It was so brillant that I noticed that when it came within 3 miles of me that my body casted a shadow on the ground. I also had a pair of binoculars but the orb of light was just a bluish white plasmic blob. At no time did I ever see the red and green running lights that would readily identify it as an aircraft. At one point it was joined by a much smaller and dimmer orb of light.Through a pair of binoculars this orb also had no red or green running lights and made no sounds. They circled each other and made severl &quot;passes&quot; at each other. I eventually lost track of the smaller object and don&apos;t know what happened too it. After about 2.5 hours the large bright orb of light landed on the ground about three miles from me. I put all my scope gear on the backseat of my car, turned off the lights, and headed slowly down a dirt road directly towards the object. When I got within two miles of it, the dirt road dipped into a dry wash that was about 1/4 of a mile wide, and when I came up the other side of the wash the object was gone. I turned of the engine and stepped into the darkness but the object was gone. The only sound were several upset packs of coyotes howling in the darkness. THEY WERE SPOOKED AND SO WAS I. I have never reported this incident until now. I have seen a lot of strange lights in the sky after twenty years of star gazing but I could always explain them away. But this one has me baffled. At no time did I ever hear the tell tale noise of an aircraft engine. I am reporting it now because I noticed in your data of sightings that others at the same time camping near Bodie also saw the same thing but I was much closer.

Second, these were not military nor civilian aircraft.  There were no blinking lights, they defied the laws of physics, and they glowed -- in that the light seemed to emanate from within them than without - and were brighter than any star in the sky.All the craft were spherical.  They seemed to mimic stars in their appearance.The first two craft traveled parallel to each other and in formation. They seemed to come from the low northeast, banked south, then headed northwest.The third sphere seemed to come from the north and moved in zig-zags.  It also moved northwest, in the same general direction as the first two.  This single sphere seemed to pause (from our POV) in the head of the constellation Draco for at least 3 seconds before continuing its flight.The last pair (totalling five spheres), also came from the northeast and in formation, traveled south.  At one point in this pair&apos;s flight, one of the spheres paused in the sky (it did not move) while the other seemed to catch up to it. The movements and flight of these spheres was very fluid, as if they were traveling through water. They were, for lack of a better description, swimming in the sky.At times all five sphere&rsquo;s  light wavered into different colours, but with a soft transition between red and silver light. They DID NOT blink. Their light was constant. There was a total lack of sound. They also seemed to be flying outside of our atmosphere but not as far away as the moon. All five objects seemed to be following a definite flight pattern - but we must stress that the movements were soft - like watching swimmers. Slow.

There was absolutly no sound.I awoke, at 03:53 on 5/14/08, to an amazingly bright blue light shining directly through my black mini blinds into my face. I quickly opened the window to see a large electron blue star slowly moving across the sky. This star suddenly became very large and seemed like it exploded, yet there was absolutly no sound. Out of this star came an oddly shaped aircraft that looked similar to a space shuttle, yet instead of having wings on the sides, it had two cylinders that thrust came out of. The ship took off like a bat out of hell, faster than any airplane i have ever seen. The odd thing was that the star it came out of was traveling east, while the ufo shot south. The small glimpse that I got of this craft showed two very bright red lights on the bottom, a green light on the nose, and the rest of the craft glowed orange. After the craft disappeared (which only took a second) i saw three other glowing stars, same as the first. Within half of a minute, they faded awy.

After exiting a store in the Tualatin area, I was walking to my car in the parking lot and a very bright light in the northern sky caught my eye.  It was a warm sunny day with only a few vapor trails in the sky &ndash; no real clouds.  I then noticed two bright star-like lights in the sky, to the north of the parking lot area.  They appeared to be high in the sky, but slightly lower than jets would normally fly.  They were moving very strangely at right angles and seemingly together.  The lights were bright white and very bright.  I observed their movements for what seemed like 5 minutes or so and I then noticed an older couple leaning over their SUV and the man was looking through binoculars in the direction of the UFO&rsquo;s.  I went over to the couple and we watched the lights for about 10 minutes or so more.  He said he could see fluorescent green lights on the lower half of the oval object.  He stated that it appeared to have a metal appearance.  He said &ldquo;those are NOT airplanes!&rdquo;  Then one of the lights went behind the large vapor trail and we lost sight of it, while one of the lights proceeded to move to the right side of the vapor trail.

I was describing the weather to a friend of mine when I noticed a triangular shaped object moving silently in the sky above me but not directly above me. It was fairly high up and was completely dark. The only way I was able to see it was because the city lights were reflecting off of it. If I hadn&apos;t looked up I never would have seen it. It was very dark in color like a slate gray except for circles at the tips of the triangles and perhaps circles in between and in the center.

I was gone for approximately 20 seconds, when I came back I noticed it was gone. I scanned the sky for it I looked farther into the distance and could see it had moved very far away and much higher. I tried to take a picture buy my phone camera could not pick the object up. I tried to move into the moonlight but it still did not help. The pictures on my phone just seem to be black skies. I watched it for about another 2-3 minutes as it moved left and right and up and down.

We do believe in other life on other planets because we have seen crafts in the past. One night a very long time ago a triangle shaped craft flew above our house without a sound. My husband and I both witnessed it. When my Dad was alive he witnessed another craft that seemed to come in with a storm and disappear instantly. My husband noticed a craft above our home one night moving erratically in the sky that took off to the north at speeds beyond anything he has ever seen.

This is the first &quot;white dot/sphere&quot; I&apos;ve seen above this area of town. It was difficult to tell the distance this object was away from me, but I would guess it was over the very forward edge of the restricted airspace in front of the Nevada Test Site and the other military instillations located behind Sheep Mountain  Also, immediately after the light disappeared, I noticed two (airforce?) planes with very powerful strobes fly along sheep mountain towards Nellis Airforce Base.", "Strange Lights Hovering and Breaking Into Multiple Different Lights over Van Buren, ARWhile sitting at the Van Buren High School Graduation, I noticed a white light, almost a large teardrop shape, falling toward the earth very slowly.

These pieces moved in a slow arc around the sky - this was all taking place just over the football scoreboard in the endzone, so it would have been looking toward the southwest - over the Arkanas River or in that area.  This happened several times, each time, the main light broke into pieces.  These hovered, some we could see, some went behind the scoreboard and were lost to our view in the trees.

However, after seeing several videos online as well as interview clips on the History Channel, it is now my belief that I was one of many that witnessed this object or type of object. I had been outside in front of my house about five minutes when I had an urge to walk to the rear of my house. I felt like &quot;someone&quot; was back there. When I came to the backside of my house I didn&apos;t see anyone standing around, but I immediately noticed what at first appeared to be &quot;cop lights&quot; just above the horizon approximately 3-5 miles away. At first the &quot;cop lights&quot; flashed randomly from red to blue but then I noticed green and then yellow flashing as well. I went back inside to get a &quot;monocular&quot; to get a better look and also asked my girlfriend to come outside and take a look.  As I viewed the object through the monocular, I noticed it randomly switched colors (red, blue, green, yellow) and also shapes.  It first appeared like a diamond or two triangles with bottoms touching. Then the object &quot;went all white&quot; and became much larger momentarily. After about 15 seconds, the object appeared to get very small or possibly move away from me. When the object was all white, it appeared more like an oval or sphere.  The object randomly shifted between colors, size and shapes the entire time I watched through the monocular or without the monocular.  When I did use the monocular, I held it against the side of my house to ensure a steady view.  The object appeared to go from complete stillness to &quot;bouncy&quot; and back. Again, everything seemed to be random. My girlfriend seen exactly what I was seeing... whatever &quot;that&quot; was.  I myself was in the US Air Force and am certain it was not conventional aircraft of any sort that I have seen before, or since. One odd note I should add is the fact that my girlfriend has had several experiences all of her life in terms of seeing strange objects and &quot;beings&quot;.  She has had &quot;geometric patterns&quot; appear on her tongue that change in shape and appeared to be cut in to her tongue, only to vanish within a few days.  Not witnessed by myself, but several of her family members.  She also has a strange &quot;bump&quot; just under the skin on her left calve. It&apos;s been checked by a doctor (now years ago) but was considered a &quot;calcium anomaly&quot;.

We counted 12 large orange lights spaced several miles apart moving at a high rate of speed all in the exact same flight path directly south of our house moving north northwest. They made no sound and disappeared behind the clouds. It was difficult to tell how large they were but I would guess they were anywhere between a mid size aircraft and a commercial jet.

The the brighter object then dimmed it&apos;s light and headed straight up very quickly.It stopped briefly straight over where it had been then zoomed off at high speed in am easterly direction.We know how long the sighting lasted because Jay Leno was just coming on (11:30). We were still watching the activity when Conan O&apos;Brien came on one hour later.We reported the sighting to Mufon here in Vancouver and spoke about it at one of their meetings.I also wanted to see whether anyone else had seen this and put an in the Kelowna paper. I received two responses and a phone call from others who had similar experiences though not of this one.One woman married to a forest ranger saw three large triangular craft flying at night. Another man had seen what he called paisley objects on the lake.

At first it appeared to be one large V shaped object flying with nose of the V pointed to our left. The object consisted of several balls of white lights. We watched the object for several minutes in amazement trying to figure out what it was. The Portland Jetport is to the right of where we were looking. My family has lived in the house we were standing in front of for decades and I have seen thousands of planes fly over our house throughout the years, the sound when they fly over is very loud and shakes the house, people who aren&apos;t use to it would cover their ears. I could hear no sound coming from the object. There were several balls of light in the V formation, my approximate would be 7. All of a sudden one of the balls of light came out of it&apos;s position in the top of the formation and quickly flew down towards a ball that was in the lowest section, it started to zig zag around it, almost as if it was playing with it. The ball of light in the lower section came out of it&apos;s place and they both zipped around, left, right, up and down. The balls of light then went back into their exact position, then at an amazing speed they zipped to the left out of sight. This was the first and the only sighting I have ever had. I am 100 % sure that it was not a plane, but I have no idea what it was. My best guess is that it was truly from a world other then my own, or something government or military related that the public is unaware of. I feel privileged to have had this experience and am intrigued at the possibilities that our own people or something out there has such technology. It was absolutely amazing.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "Hello. I am a 37 year old female. I have seen UFO&rsquo;s two times in my life.  The first time I saw a UFO I was around 1978 or 1979. I was around age 7 to 10 years old. I honestly don&rsquo;t remember what year exactly because I have some memory loss.  I was in Piscataway, N.J. at my grandmother&rsquo;s house.  We were all together. It was my Grandmother, her boyfriend, and my aunt who was just a couple of years older than me when this incident first occurred.  My Grandmother lived on Stelton Road in Piscataway and there were lots of woody fields and a huge farm with lots of acres in her backyard. As we sat at her dining room table, outside the dining room window, we saw a bright light up in the sky. The light got closer and closer.  It looked like it was landing in the back of her house in the yard.   We jumped up from the table and were all very afraid because the light became so bright that the whole house was illuminated.  I remember us all running into the back bedrooms and the last thing I saw was a shadow of a cowboy hat (that&rsquo;s what I remember it looking like) at the bedroom window. The next day when I woke up, I had tiny holes in my t-shirt. I don&rsquo;t remember us talking about the incident the next day.  My Grandmother and her boyfriend have since passed (in the 90&rsquo;s) but my aunt and I have spoken about the incident. We don&rsquo;t know what occurred that night. We just know we saw a very massive unidentified flying object that appeared to land in the backyard that night. My aunt also remembers the tiny holes that were on my t-shirt in the morning we all awoke. We laugh about it because we just can&rsquo;t explain it but we know it happened. The second time I saw a saucer-like object in the sky while I was driving down the highway by myself. It was like a shiny glare in the sky and it moved smoothly and super fast. Then it disappeared. A third time, I was with my cousin. I was driving down Easton Avenue in Somerset, NJ and she was a passenger. We both looked up and saw the same saucer-like object way up in the sky. I said, &ldquo;Look, it looks like it&rsquo;s following us!&rdquo; My cousin and I were hung-over from partying the night before but we knew we were not seeing things. I told here no one will believe us but I told her that I&rsquo;ve seen this flying shiny thing before and I knew we were seeing a UFO. She thought the same thing. My son was visited by some type of alien/entity back in 2001. He said the little boy-like &ldquo;thing&rdquo; was walking around his play pen. My son said his eyes looked red and he frightened my son. When my son got out of his bed and ran into my room to me. I quickly woke up and shouted, &ldquo;Leave him alone!&rdquo;  I actually saw the little boy-like &ldquo;thing&rdquo; behind my son. As I sat up in the bed, the &ldquo;thing&rdquo; ran through my son and me and it just disappeared. It was so weird yet it happened. My son still talks about that incident from time to time.

As it passed over us a second one follwing a same parallel path about 40 meters difference approached and passed over us.  Unlike the first object that went over our heads, the second one was more off of the road so we got to see it more from the side.  It seemed to have a slight more of a rounding at the front and tapered slightly like a tear drop point at the rear.  I estimate that it was roughly 1 kilometer in the air. And was a small craft that could possibly hold 1-3 people if possible, or possibly its automated.  The entire object was illuminated, there was no single point of light or flashing lights, it was fairly bright and consistent all around the object making it seemingly glow.  Inside the glow it was a perfect metallic object, as if it were one complete piece, with no visible wings, tail fin, etc.  There was also about a 10-20 meter tail trailing behind the object, like a jet stream about less than half the size of the object, which re-assured my guesstimate about the object&apos;s size and distance and that it must be travelling through the atmosphere.  There was no noise from the object as it approached, went past us and beyond our visiblilty.  They were heading east directly over Thunder Bay and in the direction of Lake Superior, possibly travelling between 140 to 180 kilometers per hour.  I keep going outside to see if I can see them again.  During the time we were pulled over I kept flickering my headlights to get its attention, but it didn&apos;t work.", "It was fast.A Green circle light that moved fast and in a zigzag way.At first i thought it was a firefly but it moved so fast and was up so high in the sky.

It was traveling at and incredible rate of speed and the only reason I didn&rsquo;t think it was an asteroid or something like it, was it had one green and one white light on it. I did not see a tail of burning dust like a falling star usually has. My wife corrects me and tells me that there was a red burning tail to it. It hit the ground approximately one mile North of State highway 287 and about 4 miles East of Interstate 45. I did not hear a crash, but I did see the sky light up momentarily. It didn&rsquo;t last but about 2 to 5 seconds. I didn&rsquo;t see any emergency vehicles anywhere. I didn&rsquo;t read about it in the papers or the Internet.

My wife and I were heading out to take the kids to the dentist and while driving my wife and I (without even having to say hey look at that) saw a very shiny silver object in the sky.  My immediate answer to her was, &quot;yeah, it is an airplane.&quot;, especially considering the airport is in the same direction.   Although answering her this away I still was keeping an eye on it because it didn&apos;t appear to be moving and we had such a clear view of this as well.  I pulled over into a parking lot to get a better look and NO where could you locate this object.   We both looked every where in the sky and could not locate the object again.  We both know that on some days if an airplane is way way in the sky it can appear to come in and out, this was not way in the sky.  It was high enough to be an airplane but it was low enough to have a great view, especially on a sunny day and no clouds in the sky.  My wife does believe in these type things.  I myself am an IT professional and have been brought up in a manner not to believe in these sorts of things.

They were moving westerly and totally silent.  They then shifted to the north, and each V formation seem to dim out one by one, then the last trailing light followed and eventually went out also.I was with about 20 Germans, who all saw the same thing as I, and none of them believe it was anything but Balloons.  I do not believe you can put balloons in the night sky like that and they stay in perfect formation as they float away.

Then it disappeared with a bright flash of light.  It almost looked like it was a plane or some other object crashing towards the earth - and appeared close - almost like it was going to crash into the street ahead of us. As soon as we thought we would hear it crash - it disappeared.  Did not look like a meteor - it was way too close in the sky.Just want to confirm that others have seen something like this too or even saw this incident because it honestly freaked us out and my friend and I are very rational and objective people.

It was followed by an aircraft at distance of 1 mile behind the object. The aircraft was flying lower and to the north of the object.

I hate that way, especially coming back from Georgia, because the last leg is a highway that is very dark. Somewhere around Scottsboro along highway 72 (West) we noticed this very bright, very annoying flashing light just ahead of us. It was just behind the treeline across the highway on out left. We first thought it was far ahead of us and we would soon pass it, but after miles, and miles, it was still just ahead of us. We started wondering what it was, because it was so bright and distracting.The more we paid attention, the more we thought it was moving, just in front of us. I kept looking behind us thinking maybe it was a series of lights, but no, there was nothing behind us. I thought it might be some elaborate storm warning system, because we were headed into bad weather, though it was on the other side of the state at the time. A couple of times the treeline vanished, and I saw at least one row of horizontal lights, maybe two. At one point I thought maybe it was part of a prison tower, because it seemed to be attached to something that looked like the top of a prison tower. But if it was, it was a moving prison. I also briefly thought maybe it was reflector lights on a wire running across the road, but I&apos;d never seen them before and why were they visable from behind a tree line if that is what they were?  Finally we paid very close attention to it, and as I looked and the treeline cleared for a moment what I saw was a row of very bright lights on the bottom of what looked like an observation deck. On top of that was a very, very large, very flat platform, which seemed to be oval shaped. I said to my boyfriend &quot;I may be crazy, but that looks like a giant UFO.&quot; He kept glancing but he was driving, so he couldn&apos;t see as much as I did.By the time I realized it might be something worth taking a picture of, it had finally started to slow down and inch behind us (mind you, we were driving about 60-70 miles and hour this whole time). I took a couple of pictures, which were mostly black, and I took a bit of video, but by then it was way behind us and seemed to be fading. After that we drove into a storm with real lightning and we didn&apos;t see any more strange lights.I don&apos;t know what it was, but if what I saw was what it was, then it was a gigantic UFO. We were on Sand Mountain, which they say is where most UFO sightings in north Alabama are concentrated. It was really cool, and I wouldn&apos;t swear it was a UFO as in an &quot;alien&quot; ship, but it was something unusual.

The most accurate desription i can give on the height would be about the same height an OH-58 would fly on a recon if you have ever seen that. Though no sound or heat you could clearly feel something as it passed. It was not electrical or magnetic. It was not my nerves as i am traied to not becomefrightened at the sight of things, foreign or domestic. the tree line from my house is about 300 meters back, and to the front about 100 meters. given at its height i can most likely see it from 500-600 meters, and no extra distance going away given the close tree line.

It is hard to put a size to them, but compared to the moon, they were a lot smaller and were both the same size.I heard no sound from them, we however were driving in the car.I have never seen anything like it and my husband and I were stunned after they flew by wondering what the heck these things could have been.", "cilender shaped object in sky turned and appeared as a disk then sped off.i looked up and saw what looked like the fussel louge of an airplane, which is not unusual since i live near an airport.

I saw this BRIGHT blue object zoom across the sky, it disappeared right before it hit the tree line. At first I wasn&apos;t sure what to think of it, like maybe I was just seeing things. Then my friend said that she saw it too. We discussed other possibilities of what it could be, such as a shooting star.  It was far too big, low, and blue to be a shooting star.

It didn&apos;t move incredibly slowly, but it wasn&apos;t going super-fast, either. I would guess that from horizon to horizon it could&apos;ve spanned the sky within 3-4 minutes, maybe 5.I could tell that the object/light was very high in altitude and had no flashing lights (as a plane or helicopter would) or have a trail (as a meteor would) but slowly moved across the sky in a straight line. It made no sound I could hear, though I live in the city and street noise might possibly drown out any sound it could have made.My girlfriend was with me, and we stood outside and watched the object until it was out of sight, for approximately 2-3 minutes. The object moved from slightly SW to the NE -- as I watched it, I was facing south, and my job is east of where I live so I was able to try to triangulate a little bit of its direction. When we got into the car and headed east to my job, the object had already left our visibility, and looking for it in the sky over the +/-2 miles to work neither me nor my girlfriend were able to spot it again.I did not, like some other reports of this particular sighting on this date, see said object fly off at a high rate of speed.

I was talking with my brother on my back deck (his girlfriend was talking on a cell, but witnessed the event as well) and we were also looking at the western sky, enjoying the stars, when I noticed a exceptionally bright, white, stationary star just under the spoon of the big dipper. I thought it a little strange because I didn&apos;t remember there was a large star near the big dipper, and from what I know most air traffic is in the north and eastern part of the sky in my immediate area, I do commonly see air traffic there, and there was a few passing around at that time in the east (air traffic headed towards RDU airport I would imagine). I looked down briefly, and my brother said, &quot;I think it&apos;s moving...that&apos;s not a star&quot;, sure enough it did, and it traveled in an easterly direction at a smooth, quick pace. Whatever it was seemed to me to be at relatively high altitude.I noticed It didn&apos;t have a trail like a meteor/meteorite.I was also looking to see if it had tail lights or blinking lights, and I saw none. It traveled for a distance, and it seemed to shrink into a red light about half as bright and size... it strangely turned at an abrupt angle in the opposite direction, traveled again, then remained stationary for a few seconds, then seemed to zip out of sight like it was traveling upwards at a high rate of speed.

It was cylindrical, traveling horizontally.  It was absolutely silent, looking as if suspended from above.  The sides were covered uniformly with pipes, conduits and other mechanical devices, similar to the spaceships in Star Wars.  The ends however, were flat, circular, and appeared polished.  The whole thing was some type of dark metal. The object was narrower in the center and wider at the ends, like an hourglass, but less so.  The sun was low in the sky, to the left of the object, so the direction of travel would have been northwest. There were two small airplanes of the civil aviation type in the sky at the time. These were not fat away, maybe a mile or two directly in front of us.  I could hear the sound of their engines clearly.  The object passed between us and the airplanes, diagonally. That made it easier to estimate the size, altitude, etc. and to be certain it was silent, or very quiet.  The size was similar to a large airliner.

The lights were the color of laser pointers, twinkling from time to time, but mostly solid.  They moved very little in relation to each other, and traveled from the point they were first observed about 1/3 of the way across the clear sky.  They were moving too slowly to be jet aircraft at normal altitudes.   Although it was quiet out, there was no noise at all.   We looked at them through binoculars, but this did not bring any additional resolution.Quite suddenly, the southernmost light began to fade.  I watched it disappear through the binoculars.

At first, I thought the light was the flare from an Iridium flare, many of which I have seen before tonight.  That was my first impression, given that the illumination from the object appeared to flare up, and then begin to subside, much the way an Iridium satellite is seen to do. Then, however, perhaps 2-3 seconds after the flare subsided, the reflection flared up a second time, such that the second flare was brighter than the first.  This surprised me, since I had never seen an Iridium satellite flare more than once. Not knowing what the object was, I recorded the time, and then immediately checked the www.Heavens-Above.com website for Iridium flares, and discovered that it had, indeed, been the International Space Station that I had observed. Perhaps there are more items attached to the ISS framework that create a &ldquo;double flare&rdquo; effect, but in the dozens, or hundreds, of times that I have witnessed an overflight of the ISS, I have never observed that effect.  In fact, I have never witnessed the reflection albedo from the ISS to fluctuate, at all, until it has flown into the Earth&rsquo;s shadow. The sky was crystal clear, at the time of the sighting, so variable light overcast probably was not the cause of the variation in illumination. I will observe the ISS on subsequent nights, in order to determine whether this is a normal phenomenon.", "Over the hill to the North there were weird looking strobing lights....Phase #1:  I was sitting on the living room sofa, which faced me to the NW, looking out a double window.  There is a high hill directly behind the house.  I saw a glow at the tree line, the tops of the trees lit up.  Then a line of lights in a row, rose in an arc, maybe 9 or 10 of them.  They were orange, bright orange with a steady glow, not pulsating.  They were bigger than Venus and brighter.  Maybe like hand-held spot lights.  They illuminated the tree line. Moving not too rapid.  Moving from left to right.  The  formation slowly reveled itself. Looked like something big in that direction.  It looked like the leading edge of a solid object, with more hidden down below.  I thought, &quot;I&rsquo;ve got time (to get to the back door)&quot; and jumped up and ran to the back door.  By the time I got out there, they had slid down below the hill.   I could still see a glow.  At the top of the hill, the glow dissipated.

I saw at least three, and they were set to form triangles in groups of three.  Three with three lights each.  These were a little dimmer than the string of lights.  A real fast strobe, a series of fast flickers, then nothing, then fast flickers, then nothing.  They all strobed at the same time.  The size of the clusters, each triangle of three lights was maybe like a quarter held at arm&rsquo;s length.  Larger than a dime.

They are easily seen as I used to see many in the late 50&apos;s and early 60&apos;s during the early space race. This &quot;light&quot; was moving on a straight projectory from due east to west at an extremely high altitude. Then it turned north and made a complete 360 degree turn  and did this two times. Then a second one appeared on the same projectory and it did the same 360 degree turn once that I could see. These were very tight 360 degree turns. During the second sighting, I called my brother that lives about 6 miles from me and told him that I just saw a UFO. He went out on his back porch as I explained what I was seeing with directions, etc. By the time he got outside, he was not able to see what I had seen. However, a third one appeared on the same projectory which he did see as we remained in contact via cell phone. This one did not make a 360 degree turn as we could see. They had no blinking lights.

The hill was a steep uphill climb so I could afford to take a good look while driving uphill. I estimate it was perhaps 50,000 ft because of the type of clouds that it was travelling above. I quickly realised that it was no ordinary aeroplane because the speed it was reavelling and the length and width of the object, which at first appeared to me to be a trail but I soon realised that it was very opaque silver/white, very long, cigar shape. Fortunately I knew the road ahead lay almost exactly in line with the direction the object was travelling and that I would have a clear view of the flatland ahead once I reached the top of the hill, so I asked my passangers to get the camera phones ready. Upon reaching and traversing the crest of the hill I pulled the car over to the side of the road so that my passangers could take a steady shot. By this time the object had travelled very far ahead, I&apos;d estimate around 10 miles in a matter of a few minutes. Aware that the object would soon be passing over a Royal Air Force base and Civil Airport, I observed the object intensly and wondered if the Air Force and Airport controllers were tracking it on Radar. One of my passangers was able to capture two photographs showing the object with reasonable clarity with a wide view of the countryside. Considering that the object had travelled from directly overhead to the horizon by the time we could get cameras ready and the car stopped in a good spot, I think these photos show an accurate indication as to the size, altitude and speed of the object. It was travelling West.There is a three minute interval between the two photographs, simply because my passanger had to delete some old pictures from her phone to make room in the phones memory in order to take the second shot, but this actually helps see the path of the object if you consider the first point of sighting to be almost directly overhead and slightly to the left of both pictures. A couple of minutes after the second picture was taken the object had traversed the entire sky and was gone.", "We saw the object on the horizon of Mingus Mountain.  The light was very bright and then pulsated. It became very bright and then go out.  It would pulsate again and then go out again.

I could see it through the bare limbs.  It looked like a giant cleary marble, but it glowed like a swimming pool does at night when the lights are on inside the pool.  It was fluid-looking, like lighted water.  It was perfectly round and appeared to be much bigger than my car.  On the bottom of the craft, were 3 red lights all in a row that appeared to be spinning left-to-right, but not really flashing. I could tell they were spinning though. I had slowed my car down when I was coming out of a curve and first saw the very bright white ligh ahead and to the right of the road.  It wasn&apos;t supposed to be there.  The area was an old homesite, but the house had burned down years earlier.  At first I thought it might be that someone had decided to build another house there and had had a security (yard) light put up, but I could tell that the light was way too big to be a security light, even before I saw the object up close.  When I got parallel to the light, I stopped my car and just stared at it.  It was maybe 30 yards from the country road, Old Sandy Hook Road, I was travelling on. It was stationary, but the red lights were spinning on the bottom.  The white moon-shaped light looked exactly like swimming pool water when someone walks in the shallow part at night and the lights of the pool are reflected in the gentle waves.  It was beautiful, but I was overwhelmed.  I was afraid to get out of my car, but I just sat in my car in the road and stared at the object until I noticed a truck coming toward me.  The road is not very wide, so I put my car in gear and went forward slowly as the truck came my way. What made this even more strange was that when I rounded another curve a few yards ahead and was headed to the left, I saw the same exact object on the right side of the road ahead of me. There is only woods and one house between where I first saw the object and the second place I saw it.  There is no road someone could have used to perhaps pull a baloon or something from where I first saw it to the second place I saw it.   I kept trying to think of something logical for the light to be, but it was like nothing I had ever seen before.  It hovered over trees at the back side of a small field people use to keep a few cows in - not a  big field.  It just hovered there, just like it did earlier.  Now I was really scared, but I couldn&apos;t help myself.  I stopped my car and rolled my windows down, so I could see better. I heard nothing.   I was still afraid to get out, and I kept thinking how  people who might come down the road would think I was crazy, if they saw me stopped in the middle of the road. I turned my head to face ahead of me to see if another vehicle was coming, and  I don&apos;t know if I really saw this or not, but I could swear that a light was over my car and shining on the road all around me.  Now I was very frightened, but I looked back to the right where the object had been, and it was gone.  Another vehicle was meeting me at that moment, so I put my car in gear and left.

It looked like a silver disc,  is it possible someone was playing a hoax with some kind of flying silver disc. yes.

The lighting did not continue across the sky, it went straight down after hitting this object.  the object looked to be a circular long object.  The object was a mile or two away at the point of impact.  It moved across the sky faster than a plane and as light as a feather.  It looked as though this object was slowly declining out of the sky.  It was a neon yellow glowing haze/aura/light after the lighting hit it.  It was just at the lower level of the cloud line(Few thousand feet).  As it passed directly over my head it made no sound at all.  At this point there was no thunder or rain to dampen the sound of a plane.  Several minutes after the object had passed a plane had flown by at a similar level and not directly over my head, and it made normal airplane noise.

And it was either really big, or really really close. And it just stayed flying around in the same general area for a long time, five or ten minutes. I know helicopters don&apos;t do that and if they did, they would have a searchlight looking for something. This thing looked like it was just having fun flying around as if it was joyriding. And if it were a helicopter it would make that continuous droning helicopter sound. I think this thing was actually really close because I did hear it make some noise every now and then, depending on if it was flying towards me or away or if it was flying flat or on its side. And it definitely did not sound like a helicopter. It made this sort of high pitched buzzing sound. Sort of like those toy planes, but a little different.When I first saw it, I was actually walking back to my dorm hall on the UC Irvine campus. Judging by the area where it stayed flying for the ten minutes or so that I saw it, I know I couldn&rsquo;t have been the only one to have seen it.

I was pretty sure it was Venus, astronomy is a hobby of mine and I can recognize alot of objects in the sky.  I said to my brother, I don&apos;t think Venus is out after sunset in the summer, what do you think?  He says he doesn&apos;t believe it would be out either.  We stare at it for a couple minutes more when all of a sudden, as if it were shrinking, it disappears.  We both looked at eachother in disbelief, &quot;did that just happen&quot;?  The manner in which this light disappeared was too weird, it couldn&apos;t have been a flare, it was in the sky for too long, and the light&apos;s intensity remained constant.  It was straight out of a UFO tv show, this thing went from being the brightest object in the sky, to completely gone in about 2 seconds.

This morning around 9am, in overcast weather I was waiting to dragged the infield of Glenden Park&apos;s rookie ball diamond because my partner in the other trackter was air-rating it.  I was parked in the outfield and I noticed a very fast moving red dot in the sky, I followed it for about 90 degrees of travel and the red light grew bigger and changed into a blue flicker/flame.  I ran to alert my partner about this fire in the sky but was unable to take my eyes of it or get their attention over their vechile.  The light turned and began swirling the clouds in opposite directions and then two wings appeared with bright yellow slits.  It may not be wings because the clouds were moving so intensely, unlike anything I have ever seen and thus were blocking the middle of the UFO.  However,  the object moved closer and I observed the yellow slits to be vents sucking in the clouds, or atleast the cause of the cloud distruption.  It moved through the sky towards me unlike any thing possible, did not make a sound, moved downward slightly then dissapeared.  I ran and stopped my co-worker&apos;s progress and as they disembarked their trackter, the UFO appeared seemingly above us, very large for only brief second or two before dissapearing.  I drew it&apos;s picture and wrote down what occured immediatley on the back of my vechile checklist for daily inspections.  I radio-ed my boss to tell him what conspired and all 45 city employees think I am lying, or saw something that wasn&apos;t what I described.  It was a brief enouncter but it was the most interesting, intense, and scariest moment of my life.  To give the exact description the blue flame / flickering light was on top in the middle of the oval craft, and I could only see the bright yellow vents sucking up or pushing away all the clouds.  The turbelance from the vents made it impossible to distingu! ish the what the middle and majority of the craft looked like.  I believe that the two wings are not two wings but one long line of bright yellow vents, and like I said earlier the clouds were moving in a way I thought not possible.", "bright light pretending to be a star in big dipperI was reading over some of the sightings and was stunned when i read the report from 4/10/08 (surprise). So I decided I should report an almost identical sighting that occured while I was camping in Oregon.I was visiting  a friend there that told me to stand in front of him and he pointed at the big dipper specifically the star in the upper left corner that begins the handle portion of the dipper. We were camping inside of a dormant volcano so  we were up high enough to have a panoramic view of the big dipper was lying just above the horizon with the handle portion on the left in the sky.  He was talking to me for a minute or so and suddenly  it was like a very bright star was superimposed over the star in the upper left corner of the cup portion of the big dipper. This light began to drift slowly through the big dipper and it crossed over the star in the bottom left of the cup portion.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

Does a moving star exist or it&rsquo;s just my perception that there is a moving star and I perceived it as a moving star. That is how I was taught in my school days. Was it a satellite? This question seems more of logical to me. What do you say?   I was looking at the sky. Then suddenly a star (my perception) come to the partition of the sky I was looking at and then it was moving horizontally, parallel to the ground. It looked bright somewhat like an extra star with a bit more of brightness. It moved straight, parallel and horizontal if the partition is considered as a view plane. I even prayed what I wanted my life to be, looking at it because in Nepal we have a belief if you see a shooting star and wish for something then it gets fulfilled though it was not a falling star. I have seen falling star seven times in duration of 10 minutes approx. I think 3-4 months before and approximately the same time as today. About the shape, I think practically it didn&rsquo;t had a shape but if I have to be specific then I would choose to say it was like star, a big point in the graph. I could have easily slept rather to research on internet to share what I saw today. But I choose to wake up still and its 4:45 am now.

The object was not twinkling which made me believe it was perhaps a planet, the object was extremely bright for an astronomical object and the light was of a white/blue color. While I looked at the object, trying to discern what it could be, the light was extinguished, It seemed to me as if some kind of object had come in front of the light, obscuring it. Though it occurred quickly, it seemed as if a dark circular  object roughly the same size as the light moved over it, causing the light to be unseen. The night was very clear and cloudless, I looked in the location the light had been and nothing in the air was present that could have blocked it out. Over the next half hour,  looked in the same location hoping that it was merely a cloud that passed by abd that the object would return  to being visible.

The event took place one night as I looked at the sky. I guess I was about 10 years old, I was on our front porch by myself and I spotted a satellite or so I thought. It did not look any different from all the others I had seen except for the fact that it changed course. I distinctly remember watching as this spec of light approached another spec of light which I assume was a star or planet. I realized of course that the satellite is circling the earth and would pass in front of this other spec of light. THAT DID NOT HAPPEN. The spec of light I thought was a satellite went around the other spec of light. It made a perfect half circle around the planet or star and continued on its original path. My mother was near the door and I called for her to see it. She got to the door in time to see it finishing it&apos;s half circle. Both the star or planet, and what I thought was a satellite seemed to be about the same size. So this UFO had to be about the same size as the planet or star. Also it was moving at about the same speed as a satellite would move across the sky. Given it was on the same plane as the planet or star it had to be moving at an incredible rate of speed to appear to be moving at the same speed as a satellite circling the earth.

I was in my dorm room on the third floor which faces Parking Lot 5, when I heard the same sound that I had heard a week and a half prior coming from the UFO. Again it sounded similar to that of a toy plane, but I think it&rsquo;s buzz is a little bit higher pitched than a toy plane. I looked out of my window and there it was, the UFO outlined with blue lights, flying closer to my housing community. I ran outside, this time determined to get a video of it, but when I went outside, I realized that I wasn&rsquo;t wearing my glasses so it just looked like a small thin line of blurry blue lights. So I ran back up to my room, grabbed my glasses, and ran back outside. I could see it clearly now, flying overhead like last time, in what seemed like the direction of the 405 freeway. I ran towards the parking lot so that I could get a better video of it, but unfortunately, all that my video camera was able to pick up was a spot of blue light. There were other students in the parking lot also. There were a couple of guys by their car, one of them I heard saying to his friend, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a UFO, it has to be.&rdquo; After all, it was in plain sight, flying fairly low to the ground, probably no higher than one of those privately owned propeller planes that I see a lot of flying around Irvine. I&rsquo;ve read other UFO reports from people who have seen them near the UC Irvine campus and it seems like there are two common sightings: one has blue lights and the other has white lights. From my dorm room, as well as when I saw it without my glasses, it looked like it had blue lights. But when I got a closer look in the parking lot, it seemed to have white lights. Maybe the lights look different depending on how close you are. But the lights themselves looked slightly different this time; t! hey didn &rsquo;t necessarily look like clean rectangles that outlined the sides like last time, instead they seemed to have an edge, sort of like a cross between circles and triangles, that outlined the edge. And there seemed to be some sort of a flickering light underneath, within its circular shape that flickered every now and then. It stayed flying in the same place for about ten minutes, flying at different angles as well as hovering in place for a few seconds at one point. I also saw a helicopter that seemed to be flying towards its direction. After a few minutes, I ran to another spot near the parking lot to hopefully get a better quality video of it but a few seconds after I got there, it slowly started flying away behind the trees and apartments and disappeared from my sight. There were another couple of guys in the parking lot who obviously saw it. One of them was waiting in the parking lot while his friend ran across the street when there were no cars coming and tried to run up the hill where the apartments are located to see where it was going. I doubt he was able to locate where it had gone because he came back a couple minutes later looking a little disappointed; so was I that I couldn&rsquo;t get a better video of it.", "circle cluster of bright lights change to star like cluster and disappears!In the north sky on my drive to work after lunch I saw a circle cluster of 10 bright lights that were smaller than the larger, brighter object below the cluster.

We were both in the seventh grade at the time.  My brother, who&rsquo;s a jokester, was sitting on the rail of our back porch talking to us through the screen door.  All of a sudden he looked up into the still sunny sky and said, &ldquo;Look, flying saucers!&rdquo;  My friend dropped her dish towel onto the counter and dashed out the door to take a look.  Being my brother was always horsing around, I didn&rsquo;t believe him and told my friend not to believe him either.  Well she was out the door already, and when she looked up she shouted back to me, &ldquo;Yeah, come look, flying saucers, for real!&rdquo;  I rushed out the door, which took about 5 seconds to do, and looked up into the sky and saw two saucer shaped objects, hovering above our house.  They looked to be about 30-35 feet above us. There were no wings or tail extended like an airplane or helicopter.  There were no noises or sounds that we could hear.  It was gray in color with one red and one pink light blinking from its underside.  I quickly ran through our little house, from the back porch, through the kitchen, the dining room, and into the living room where my mother was.  I shouted for her to come and see the &ldquo;flying saucers&rdquo;, and ran back out to the back porch.  In about 5 seconds of getting there, the two objects silently lifted into the sky and zipped out of sight in a matter of a second or so!

One Friday summer night in June, we ate dinner and spent a relaxing evening playing cards and watching TV at my wife&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s house across town. Very late, probably around one am, we drove back to my parents&rsquo; home near the city limits. Just as we approached, a bright light three blocks away attracted our attention. This being the neighborhood where I had grown up, I assumed the floodlight was from an Edison power crew working on a large transformer that sat in a fenced-off corner of Congress Street and Owendale and located at one end of land owed by the school district. Since we were still wide awake, we continued on to investigate. To our astonishment, there  was no  Edison truck. Instead, the floodlight came from directly above the treetops. Its light source was a circular-shaped craft outlined by pulsating colored lights and hovering silently perhaps thirty feet or so over the power station. I remember shouting to my son asleep in  the back  seat and  trying to wake him. (He was only four and remembers  little of it  today.)  Certainly aware that the three occupants of a VW beetle posed no threat, the craft slowly lifted above treetop level and silently accelerated about a quarter mile over the trees  lining the road when it abruptly stopped, almost as though it  waited for us to catch up.  Of course I tried. When I drew near, the craft raced another quarter mile or so and again stopped just above tree level. It repeated this strange &ldquo;catch us if you can&rsquo;&rsquo; maneuver a  final time. Then suddenly it rose. I remember jumping out of  the car  and watching as the craft  accelerated and merged with  the stars. The entire encounter was over in probably two or three minutes. We hurried home, burst into my  sleeping parents&rsquo; bedroom, awakened them, and  shared our experience. My Mom believed us; my dad, probably not.

The head of the meteor or whatever it was seemed larger than any shooting star I have ever seen.  I waited for the Impact sound but there was none.  It actually was big enough to cause a little fear because , if it was far away it may have been quite large. Since there was no sound it may have all burned up or landed so far away that I couldn&apos;t hear the impact sound. ERROR ON PREVIOUS FILING -SAME INCIDENT This is an EDIT to previous report because of an error I made in the direction that  I was traveling. I said I was going East which was incorrect.I actually was TRAVELING WEST on University Blvd. in Wheaton Md  towards Bethesda Md. so the Meteor or whatever it was , was probably traveling in an arc between ENE and ESE and NOT Northwest as I previously stated.When I saw it, the initial point of the FIREBALL was at 75 degrees up from the horizon and arcing downward with a long tail.((NUFORC Note:  I spoke with this witness, and he sounded to be quite serious-minded.  I suspect that he is an excellent witness.

The lights were green, blue, and red, but I do not remember which order they flashed in.  They flashed only once, then disappeared.  They seemed very close - maybe twenty yards away from me.

From a distance, I saw a large red glowing light near my apartment.As I got closer, I thought it was actually a new sign over the local convient store.  When I got under the large glowing light, I realized for the first time it was not supported by any pole.  I could not figure out how store could do that. The light made no sound and did not move.  I moved away from the store to look for some form of support.  It was not more than 10-20 feet above the store.   I was the only one out at that time.  As I was watching the light, it finally dawned on me that it was not supported and in fact it was flying on its own.  A guy in a truck came around the corner and pulled over to see it as well.  I asked him to observe independently and not speak to me.  We would exchange phone numbers and write our own description of what we saw.  We would get in touch with each other the next day and go to the authorities.  He agreed.  As we both stood there, the light without any noise moved laterally from the store directly over both of us. I could not see any structure of any type.  Just a bright red light.  I picked up a rock to see if there was any structure there but I could not reach it by throwing the rock.  It moved laterally back over the store and then back over us.  Then in a flash it was gone through the universe leaving a bright red streak of light at a slight angle up.  It never made a sound of any type.  The guy got in his truck and refused to give me his number.  He said he was way to spooked to ever want to talk about this again.  When I got to my apartment, I told my roommate about what I had seen.  He said that that there had been sightings all night and people calling in on the radio talk shows. The next day in the Denton papers, the FAA said that they were using weather balloons and they were all accounted for and nothing else was in the sky that night.The story died right there.  I know there is no balloon that can hover without moving, put out a blinding red light like that, move laterally and then shoot through the sky at the speed of light. I have never reported this to any publication of any kind since the guy took off.Recently almost 34 years later in Stephenville, Texas there were multiple sightings and many of the witness who said they saw what they believed to be UFOs.  They were interviewed on Larry King and one description was exactly what I saw.

I noticed a flash of white light, similar in size, and duration to that of an airplane landing light.  Unlike landing lights, however, there was only one light flashing.  A second or two later there was another flash of the white light and I saw that it had traveled further than a conventional aircraft could have.  The light continued to travel West to East for a few more seconds, with the flash of light remaining consistent.  Then, whatever it was turned in what must have been an incredibly small radius (between flashes)and began to travel in the opposite direction. I watched it as it now moved silently from East to West until I lost sight of it beyond a ridge. The entire event took place in about one minute but I continued to watch for another half an hour, hoping (big time) that it would change directions and come back again.

Approximately 9:30 PM, after passing Groom Lake Road, my sister saw an object in the sky, south of us. I pulled over the side of the highway and quickly exited the car. 20-25 miles south of us, over some mountains, we saw an unknown craft fluttering around with the dexterity of a moth. This craft was at least the size of a two-story house (maybe larger, it is hard to judge size in the desert), and had two strobing lights, one green, one red. It was not a jet, airplane, or helicopter, as it fluttered around the sky like a butterfly. It would alternate directions immediately, dropping and rising 50 feet instantaneously. We observed the UFO for about 2 minutes before it sank below the mountains.Three possibilities immediately entered my mind regarding the UFO: 1. It was an alien spacecraft piloted by aliens.2. It was an alien spacecraft piloted by military personnel.3. It was an experimental aircraft reverse engineered utilizing alien technology piloted by military personnel. Five minutes later, the UFO appeared again. It hovered in the air, as if the pilots were skittish--somewhat afraid to be where they were. This sighting was even more exciting as we all were able to fully observe the UFO, its rapid movements making it impossible that this was a man-made craft. After another two minutes, the UFO sank below the mountains. Adrenaline pumping, we surveyed our surroundings, spotting stationary headlights behind us on the highway, about a mile or two away. This light did not move. After five minutes, we became nervous and decided to investigate. We drove back and saw a white SUV with government plates speed off. Relieved to not find Leatherface or any other deranged cannibal hillbillies in rusty pickup trucks, we decided to drive back to our observation point (approximately 26 miles southeast of the Lil Ale Inn). 5-10 minutes passed without any sign of the UFO. It was starting to get late, as I live 2 &frac12; hours away in Las Vegas, so I was ready to leave when the UFO hovered in the air once again. This time we all noticed an incredible sight: the mountain range to our left was being illuminated on the other side by a powerful light source intermittently, as if the Area 51 base was trying to communicate with the UFO with a sophisticated visual version of Morse code. The mountains were silhouetted in light. We were all silent, awestruck at the possibilities. This new sighting made me realize what was happening:  The Area 51 base was attempting to communicate with an alien spacecraft utilizing light signals. Why else would they utilize an enormous light source in such a manner? Every time the craft came into view, the light source would illuminate the mountains in an intermittent fashion. When the craft lowered, the light source would stop. It almost seemed as if the lights somehow reassured the UFO to not fly away. We could not tell if the UFO ever landed or not, as the mountain range blocked our view of the ground and Area 51. We stayed another 15 minutes, observing the UFO twice more. The lights from the base strobed even more powerful as the UFO fluttered around. It was obvious that we were observing something important, beyond our understanding. Was this the first time that this communication has taken place, or has this been going on years or decades and they are trying to refine their methods of communication? So many questions swirled around my mind, though the overwhelming feeling was one of awe and excitement. There is not a doubt in my mind that I witnessed an alien spacecraft. I plan on going back and camping out on a mountain overlooking the restricted zone boundary, and packing a video camera, telescope, and binoculars!  Overall, we observed the UFO for over a half hour, 5 sightings in all, about 2 minutes at a time. I was not drunk or high, nor was my wife or sister. I have completed 190 credits hours in college courses, my wife has a Master&rsquo;s degree, and my sister attends George Washington University.  We are all in agreement that we have witnessed a UFO.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

As discussed with the NUFORC, the altitude of the craft could still be estimated at 100-130 meters.  But, the main point of the estimate is that the craft was VERY close and VERY low.

My window was open in my bedroom on the first floor of my house, facing towards the backyard.  I had abruptly awoken to a loud humming sound coming from outside.  After a few seconds, I noticed a blue light that seemed to be coming from my open window.  At first, it was very faint and hardly noticeable; but after the course of a few minutes (three to five), the blue light had become so bright that it covered everything in my field of vision.  I tried to go and get my parents, but I was paralyzed, either out of shock from the event or from an unknown force.  All of the sudden, I felt a presence in the room.  At first I was scared, but then I felt a strong reassurance that the presence was not there to harm me. Then, with an overwhelming flash of white light, the buzzing sound stopped and the blue light disappeared.  After this, I was able to move, and went to the windows to see what had happened.  I looked out into the lawn, and everything looked eerily still.  The trees weren&rsquo;t moving, the grass wasn&rsquo;t waving, and there wasn&rsquo;t a single ripple in the pool.

I also have 20/20 vision and don&rsquo;t wear glasses or contact lenses.  It was broad daylight and I was driving in commuter traffic westbound on I43 around 5:24 pm.  I didn&rsquo;t feel any &ldquo;creepy feelings&rdquo; or strange compulsions to make mountains out of mashed potatoes.  This is how it happened:  I saw a helicopter hovering in the air over the town of Mukwonago, Wisconsin.  It looked strange because the helicopter was similar to a traffic helicopter, but had no logos or markings on it.  As this area is quasi-rural, this was out of place and I was curious.  I looked farther into the sky in the direction the helicopter was pointed and saw what looked like the round end of a marshmallow in the sky.  It was white and seemed to have a dimple in the middle of it.  After about two seconds it left, shooting directly out into the atmosphere.

These vehicles were not birds, not balloons, airplanes, not swamp gas, not temperature inversions, not kites, not anything but saucer-shaped vehicles. There could be no way we could be mistaken as everything was mid-day clear close view. My eyes happened to concentrate on the under rim of the saucers I saw a dark brown colored rim on the underside of the saucers of perhaps 2 feet in width. The vehicles otherwise were approximately the color of aluminum, I saw 3 hemispheric undercarriages spaced circularly at 120 degrees apart. I saw portholes. My girl friend&apos;s vision happened to concentrate on the top most portion and she saw yellow light in the port holes. They flew past us at perhaps 350 miles per hour and we had them in view maybe 6 seconds in all. They were less than 1/4 mile from us at the closest point. Based on the angle subtended by the vehicles and my estimate of the distance to them, I would make an educated guess that their sizes were about 150 feet in diameter each and perhaps 20 feet in height not counting the height of their undercarriages. They flew in the direction of the San Diego Airport and seemed to be totally unconcerned at being seen or if it was a danger to them. They appeared to be their own masters. I phoned the San Diego Airport, the! Miramar Naval Station and informed them as well as the local police. The police told me they had not received any calls thus far. Miramar Naval Station recorded my phone conversation but would not answer as to whether there were any other witnesses. After this encounter, my friend and I found a book in the library called &quot;Flying Saucers and Outer Space&quot;, written maybe in 1955, On one page there was a drawing of a flying saucer   As soon as we saw it, we both said to each other &quot;that is just what we saw&quot;. Mind you, prior to this, I and my friend had thought that those who said they saw flying saucers were seeing things by mass hallucinations, and gave these reports no credence at all. And neither of us had read a book at all on this subject. My girl friend became very frightened at this incident, and I, foolishly wished they would have just stopped and taken me aboard for a ride. But, having worked as a Mechanical Engineer in the Space industry for 20 years, and being well up on every flying vehicle known to man, for one thing I know of no vehicle now or even contemplated, that can fly without a very noisy engine to power it. If there was a noiseless engine it would have been put to very good use a long time ago, for example on the very expensive Concord Aircraft, which was only allowed to fly over uninhabited areas because of the incredibly loud noise it made. From this fact and my general feelings about this I must conclude (the U.S. government and any nay-sayers not withstanding) that these vehicles are of a very very advanced stage of technology and that they are not of this earth.((name deleted))", "Bright aqua light seen hovering then moving at high speed not more than 100 feet above ground level.Extremely bright aqua-colored light appeared to hover over wheat fields 2.5 miles north of HWY12 and just west of Middle Waitsburg Rd in area where there are no buildings or roads. Thought possibly a helicopter, although no noise was heard. After about 1 minute the light disappeared then reappeared almost instantly about 1 mile over to the west by southwest.

It was as if someone was shining them to look inside my window. They were around the top part of my window near the roof. There are no traffic lights in my residential neighborhood. The lights wobbled as if someone was walking with a flashlight.  Outside my bedroom window is my deck which is on the second floor and no one can access without a ladder. The lights wobbled and then went away. I thought it was just a reflection of something inside the house. Then it happened again and I awoke my dog to go out onto the deck with me to see if anyone was there. Nobody was. So I came back inside and went into my bedroom and it happened again. About 5 seconds each time. My dog saw it too and his ears went up. I live overlooking Puget Sound and off in the distance I saw an aircraft flying south. I called 911 to report and they said they didn&apos;t have any other calls and they confirmed that we have no flights leaving our airport at that time. But it could have been a medivac helicopter at the local hospital so maybe that is not even related to my experience. Anyway, that&apos;s it. It was really eerie and there was no sound accompanied with the lights and nobody on the street or anywhere around my house when I went out to the deck to look.", "It was huge, quite, and it made the earth vibrate.Our encounter was on a late summer night in SW Missouri 1987. Some friends had gotten to gather to hangout with a buddy of ours on leave from the air force. We went to a place called &ldquo;end-of-the-road&rdquo; it was located east of town. It was the old highway where they had torn down the bridge that crossed the valley and train tracks. We had built a bonfire and were drinking some beers. We had several cars and trucks parked around. It was about 11:00 pm when &ldquo;Jack&rdquo; said, do you feel that? It must be a train coming down the tracks. Then &ldquo;Paul&rdquo; said, train my ass look at that! He was pointing to the sky. In the sky was a huge rectangular object about the size of two football fields with a bank of what looked to be lighted windows. It was just hovering over the valley everyone was just in amazement. Then it just flew very fast to the east&hellip;like warp speed on star trek. Our friend from the air force &ldquo;Travis&rdquo; started rattling off all kinds of plane names and numbers. Another friend &ldquo;Joey&rdquo; who&rsquo;s dad was a corporate jet pilot. Started telling stories about things his dad had seen over the years flying&hellip;then Joey suggested that it came from the deep old mining pits that were all around the area. How could it just appear? He said. I asked Travis what it was. He said maybe something experimental from the old Fort Crowder base. Then he said, &ldquo;I have never seen anything in the sky that big, let alone hover with out moving&rdquo;. We all just kept speculating. It did not make sound however; we all felt the earth vibrate. It was a bright moon so we all saw the silhouette. Very rectangular &ldquo;straight edged&rdquo; and very big. The total number of people who witnessed the UFO was seven however; the three girls from Granby said they did not see anything. To this day if I see any of my old friends in passing and say &ldquo;end-of-the-road&rdquo;, they freak and start saying, &ldquo;what was that huge thing in the sky&rdquo;.", "Black Sphere observed flying low over town in broad daylightI witnessed a UFO flying low over Siler City, NC at noon today,.Sat May 3, 2008. (Report written at 3:18 pm) The sighting lasted almost 5 minutes. The UFO was a solid BLACK Sphere about the size of a small car, flying about 40 feet above the tree and building line, heading northeast across the shopping areas, as if it travelled up Raleigh St.  I only noticed it because I was waiting for my husband to finish shopping at the car parts store. I was sitting in the van watching traffic go by and it appeared almost infront of me above the trees, I got a really good look at it. I watched it slowly go along, it avoided the cell phone tower by darting around it but then maintained its course and altitude. Once it was over the Hwy 421 it went straight up into a cloud at about a 90 degree angle. I watched it for a pretty long time. When it was infront of me it was OBVIOUSLY a sphere and radiated an outer circle of energy that was bright, and pulsing energy. Quite a distinct contrast of the black sphere against the bright white of a cloud as it passed by.I ruled out birds, I ruled out a balloon (It avoided the cell tower and maintained an altitude) It was truly unusual", "2 nearly vertical contrails seen.I had finished shopping and was sitting on the hood of my friends&apos; car waiting for him and noticed two contrails in the southeast.

Did not seem to be normal debris entering the atmosphere.  We did not notice it until it was straight above us.  We had no doubt about the significance of this sighting.  It was very unusual because of the slower speed, how bright it was and the absence of a trail.

It occurred during their childhood in rural Neshoba County, Mississippi.  Both are Air Force veterans and solid citizens.  I have absolutely no reason to doubt their word.According to the observers (who are twin boys), they were about seven or eight years old, and out of school for the summer.  The rural mail carrier delivered the mail to their home somewhat near the end of his route, and usually arrived after 3:00 p.m.  Their home was located approximately 100 yards up a gravel driveway from the main roadway, also a gravel road at the time.  The twins heard the mailman approach the mailbox, stop, and then accelerate off to the next home down the road.  They asked their mother if they could go down to the mailbox and get the mail.  She allowed them to go.They walked the 100 yards or so down to the mailbox, retrieved the mail and headed back towards the house.  When they were approximately half way up the drive (50 yards from their home), my great-aunt began yelling for them to &quot;run, run!&quot; in an urgent tone.  They ran towards her.  When they arrived at the front porch of their home, my great-aunt pointed towards the woodline on the other side of a field approximately 4-500 yards from their home.Silently hovering over the woodline was a very large silvery disk, perhaps 100-200 feet or larger in circumference.  They observed the disk hover for approximately another four or five minutes.  It then took off at a very high rate of speed, accelerating as it gained in altitude.  It was out of sight in only a few seconds, and was entirely silent.My cousins told me that they were in awe of the object but, being children, they quickly resumed playing and had only the vaguest memory of both the object and the event for many years.  While remeniscing at a Thanksgiving dinner many years later (in the mid-1990s), my great-aunt questioned them both to see if they remembered the event.  They both recalled the event and had virtually identical recollections.  An older brother who was a test engineer at the Nevada Test Site until his retirement also recalled that the story was related to him shortly after it happened in the early 1950s.I am not aware of any other witnesses, nor am I aware of any graphic images such as photos, movies, etc., that exist of the incident.

My first thought was &quot;What is the sun doing up at midnight?&quot;  As the ridiculousness of this thought hit me, I sat up and put on my glasses. As I focused on the object it slowly descended behind the ridge top; a smaller whitish-blue light at the top of the object flashed once (like a strobe light) before it disappeared.It&apos;s hard to say how large the object actually was, but the ridge summit is about one-half mile from my house, and the object looked somewhat like the size of the sun as it rises or sets.

We watched it as it paralled us for 15 - 20 minutes.  It resembled molten metal and seemed at times to drip fire.  It would dip down below the trees, but then it would reappear within seconds. I first thought it must be someone in a hanglider, and I looked hard for the tell-tale sign of someone underneath the orange object that was shaped somewhat like a sail. I thought the bright orange color must be a reflectiton of the sun, which was getting lower in the sky, but the object wasn&apos;t just the color of fire.  It looked like it was fire, only with a shape. I had thought about stopping the car, but my daughter, not yet 10-years old, was afraid and urged me not to stop.  However, I did drive very slowly and couldn&apos;t stop myself from looking at the odd object.  After we crossed the river, the highway veered slightly to the right and went up a hill.  It was at this area that the object stopped paralleling us and appeared directly in front of us over the road.  I had been puzzled and amazed before, but now I was afraid.  I checked behind me and saw no one, so I stopped my car in the middle of the highway  Then something happened I will never forget.

When it tilted there was no more trailing light from the object,  Upon tilting the object was a large glowing disc shaped object.  To be that large, it was probably a beam ship or mother ship (factoring the distance which could only be guessed at and the size of the disc).  Immediately after tilting on its side, it dematerialized or went to faster than the eye could see or something because after tilting and being clearly visiable as a disc on its side (glowing top or bottom towards me), it disappeared.

The time was about 10-15 minutes before our scheduled landing time of 7:52 PM, which would make it around 7:30-7:45 PM. We were flying over land that was spotted with some bodies of water. I was sitting on a window seat on the left side of the plane so I assume I was looking south. Here is a picture I found on the net that is similar to the view I had:  http://www.factionfive.com/blight/uploaded_images/DSC02804-771617.JPG. I would guess we were about 10,000 feet high, but perhaps someone more knowledgeable can estimate the height given the information above. I was admiring the view when I noticed a light that was noticeably brighter than the other city lights coming from an object above a small body of water (like a small lake).  The shape appeared to be a sphere but I can&apos;t be sure as it was far away.  It was unusual enough to keep my attention. The light was a bright yellowish white but seemed to change to a bluish white and did not blink. It was moving very slowly so at first I thought it could be a helicopter. After observing it for about 30 seconds I felt it was not a helicopter and was definitely not a plane. What happened next is why I think it is worth reporting as a UFO; the object started to accelerate at a geometric rate. It quickly sped up and flew up towards the plane and passed below and in front of us in about 2-3 seconds. If I had to guess, I would say the object was 15,000 feet away when I first saw it over the lake and it came within 2000 feet of the plane when it passed under and front of my view. I may have the absolute distances wrong but the relative distance (2000:15000) is about correct.  The point is the object appeared to accelerate from almost nothing to beyond 1000 mph in about 2 seconds.  It happened so quickly and I was in disbelief by what I saw. I looked around at the other passengers hoping that someone else saw it but no one appeared to have. I recall a red glow on the lower half of the object but I am not confident about this particular detail (this happened over 3 months ago) but the rest I am confident of what I saw. I have never reported a UFO before. I would like to know if anyone else saw this.", "Star in broad daylightWhile working on the Tohono O&apos;oddam Reservation, I observed a star like light in broad daylight directly overhead. My first impression was that it was a weather balloon, but it remained overhead for almost an hour with little descernable motion. I pondered whether it was a distant supernova, but have heard nothing over the astronomy news. It looked to be above the troposphere. I say this only as a former meteorologist. There is the slight chance it was a passing asteriod, which I have heard rumors of, but am not sure it was visible during the day. The little motion I observed was in a NNE direction by no more than 5 degrees for duration of sighting. Eventually, I had to get back to surveying the area, and had to step in a building for an hour or so. The light was not visible when I tried to reaquire it an hour later. My partner observed the same anomoly, but thought nothing of it. We have not mentioned it since. Local military air traffic showed no interest in it, either. I watched numerous flights depart the Air Force base only to practice formations and usual touch and go&apos;s. I have released countless weather balloons and tracked their paths across the sky. Never have I observed one shoot straight up, nor remain relatively motionless for an hour. Jet streams and upper level winds usually take the balloon out of sight, or the balloon pops when reaching high altitude. I do not think it was a UFO (ET), a star, nor a balloon. Stars move west. This object drifted no more than 5 degrees NNE in an hour. Balloons pop or move rapidly to the east after reaching altitudes of 30,000ft and up. A near Earth asteriod is my best guess.", "High Altitude Flying Abnormally blinking objectLast night 5/29/08 I was in the backyard doing some homework. I decided to look at the stars for a while, it was a clear night. Suddenly one of the stars began to move at a very very high altitude.

It mimicked a star. While staring I got a feeling of wellbeing all around me and I got goose bumps. I kept my eye on it and tried to follow as far as I could have when a low flying plane came by and distracted me. I could not find it again but I knew what I saw didn&rsquo;t blink like a plane because the lights on a plane do not go off for 5 seconds at a time, they are constantly blinking.", "star like, zig zag flightI watched as a fast moving star sailed through the sky, then, as I questioned with friends over what it could be, it quickly changed directions in a zig zag motion and  disappeared behind a skyscraper.", "5 bright silver objects assuming the points of a 5 pointed star.  10-15% from directly overhead.

I saw a shiny, saucer-shaped object sitting in the sky.

But as I kept my focus one of them moved to the right moving north. Not far or not fast it didn&apos;t move very far and stopped and became bright and about 3x its previous size. Then it was moving away from our direction to the east but at a fast rate to where we could not see it anymore! It definitely went out of the atmosphere. As I was looking at it when I thought it was a star as it moved I told my friend do you see that. But I did not take my eyes off it.

We were heading home toward I 85 in Cummings I believe the road was named 365 back then. It was a two lane back road. It was a very dark clear night. Driving around 55 mph. I notice my three children were looking out the back of my van and I could not see behind me. I asked them what they were doing and they said Mommy we are kind of scared there is something following us it is a bright white light. I asked how long it has been following us? They said shortly after we got out side of town where there was no lights. I looked and seen what they were talking about and I slowed down to about 20 miles mph. It did get closer quickly and it was following us. This road was a back road and we only seen maybe two cars pass by.  The kids stared screaming Mom it is getting closer I looked and it was. I started speeding up to about 55 mph it did to I went 70 mph well it did two. I noticed that the oval shape light was moving in and out in between trees and an unbelievable amount of speed. I knew I was about 30 miles from the interstate I85. I speed up to 80 mph and it speed up to still weaving in between the trees. It scared the scrap out of me. Being chase and not knowing what in the world this craft was. Kids were scared and crying by this time. I increase my speed to 95 mph it did to. Now it is by this time to close and still doing the zigzag through the trees. I was to scared to slow down and scared of going to fast. I saw a light tower ahead and I knew we were getting closer to the interstate. It was almost as time just froze in place a deer just jumped in front of the van and I don&rsquo;t know why but I hit the head light button and turned the head lights off and the deer eyes locked into my eyes and it jumped really high and continued to the woods when it landed I had just hit my brakes at that time but not enough to even come close to stop just an attempt to but the deer was on the side of the road in perfect condit! ion and looking at us like we were crazy.  I then saw a car on coming going toward the light it had no more passed my and it slammed on breaks and stopped the car half on the road and other half off the road they got out with doors left open and they were heading for the ditch. I had hit my brakes during this and slowed way down. I think because we were so close to the interstate and lots of lights and activity it retreated and disappeared within a matter of seconds. I stopped and the car that those people that had passed me stood up with their hand in the air pointing at the object. It disappeared. I have never felt so much relief in my life and a since of calmness came about the children and I. Weird it was actually chasing us. Those people got back in their cars and continued going in that direction. I will say I have never been down that road again! I have never experienced anything like that in my whole life and I am now 50.

When the children came up to me I told them to ask they did and all three at the same time all chimed in telling them the same things I had just told them. The look on their faces was priceless. I was glad that the children were with me but at the same time I wished they hadn&rsquo;t been with me.

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw something moving from right to left..which would have been exactly in a southerly direction.Naturally, automatically i tried to see what it was and soon found a black, boomerang shaped object moving, very steadily across the sky. It had no lights and no visible features and disappeared out of sight, in a very weird kind of fading manner. It is like it flickered out. It was completely silent. The size is very hard to estimate. Since it was black I could not judge the distance or the size. My BEST estimate would be about the length of a football field from end to end. It was moving very straight. My best guess is that it would have been flying directly over the St Johns River, right on the eastern shore, moving southward. Im a few locks from the river, on University blvd W., between San Jose blvd and Powers avenue. A few days later, I went online to see if anything had ever been talked about.

The other thing, the most significant was this website: www.cassiopaea.org/cass/boom.htm I imagine it is a coincidence that I was staring at Cassiopaea just prior to this since I stare at constellations all the time and it was the only one visible in that direction at that time of night due to the trees on that side of my yard. But...it strikes me as odd, that I REMEMBER having been staring at that specific constellation and secondly of course, that the only time in my life I have ever seen anything like this (a UFO) was immediately upon turning away from looking at it.Please, if you can, read what that website says about contact from the constellation.

And I saw across the street in a vacant lot a gold and orange spherical object pulsating and hovering inches above the ground.  I would estimate possibly 15 feet or more in height with a matching width.After observing this for a few seconds movement coming from behind and between the houses brought my attention to 4 figures walking toward the object, human like in stature but a bit thinner, the distinguishing features that caught my eye were the helmets or head gear worn by the figures along with what looked like black wetsuits. the helmets were similar to our astronauts head gear with a single large tinted visor, only they appeared to be more form fitting closer to the head. the other feature was what appeared to be a breathing apparatus at the front that gave the figures an appearance of having heads shaped like that of a doberman pincher.one of the figures looked up and I quickly retreated back inside the window, I dont recall anything after that other then waking up the next morning and peering out the window the next morning,and of course by that time they had departed. This still sends chills down my spine when I think about it and it happened 34 years ago when I was only 12 years old.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

We were approaching at an upward slant since were climbing the hill outside corona, but when we got to the top we realized there was not a bridge over I-40 there.  As we reached the crest and started down we could see the lights heading south along a ridge line till they went out of sight.  As we got closer to the town of Corona, we passed by a vehicle stopped along side west I-40 and a man standing outside his car{looked like a VW wagon} looking down south watching the lights.

Coming home from church about 7 in the evening we were coming down Triplett  Street in the city and pulled up under a stop light that Griffith Avenue butted into. As we were waiting for an arrow to turn left, I looked up straight under the light and saw what I thought was a Hot Air Balloon. I contained a circle of fire that seemed to be about 10 to 12 feet wide . But then I realized that  jets appeared at differing places around it.That caused doubting on my part. Look at the balloon I said to the rest of the family. Everyone looked up and then to our amazement it shot to the horizon in a split second across the Ohio River far into the state of Indiana. The second incident of a mysterious flying object was observed between Orlando and Sebastion Florida about 11 PM September 2007. The object was first seen with two fire-like exhausts going across the black autumn sky. Many cars pulled off on the shoulder to see the strange rolling fiery &ldquo;&gt;&rdquo; shaped exhaust roiling horizontally across the night sky. From our vantage point it appeared to be 10 to 12 feet wide at its widest point. It flew over the swampy area and then suddenly came to an abrupt stop. It was then that we were able to detect a huge bell shaped object with one light in the top of the tallest area. The bottom of the had a light at each corner. These were not bright lights but appear to be much like looking through a round glass behind which was a florescent light, illuminating a room inside. After observing the still floating object for about 45 minutes all the cars began to pull away as we did.

I&apos;ve always heard stories and seen video&apos;s but seeing it for myself was an entirely different experience. We were driving to San Francisco and we had just passed a power plant and looking over rolling hills. The sky was a clear blue, no clouds on a bright afternoon. I was looking out the window and into the sky, I saw something shinny which I thought might be the sun reflecting on it, but it was far too bright and then I thought it was a plane because of the shape but it had no wings, so I was confused, before I could say anything, and in the blink of an eye it disappeared. Again I stared in shock and searched the sky, knowing a plane couldn&apos;t move that fast to get out of my line of sight in the blink of an eye. So then I realized what I had just seen.

It was a fairly warm night with a few scattered clouds in the sky.  The moon seemed to be very bright and since we live way out in the country no traffic was on the road. We were discussing one of the movies when my wife said, &quot;Look at that, what in the world is that?&quot;I should add at this time that I am a licensed Pilot with both fixed and rotor wing tickets along with an A &amp; P Mechanics License.  I have worked in the aviation field since my 2nd tour of Vietnam in 1969 where I was a Door Gunner and later promoted to Crew Chief on UH-1H Huey Helicopters.  My wife has worked at the airport for over 25 years in the main terminal.  We both have 4 year degrees and very good vision.  We are not quick to jump to conclusions about things we see or hear but this did catch our attention pretty fast.In answer to her question I had no idea at all of what the aircraft could be.  It was dull black with lights in several places around the aircraft that seemed to be windows.  There was a purple beacon in the center of the bottom but no position lights or anti collision lights anywhere at all that we could see.  I thought for a moment that it might be a B-2 Bomber but then I realized that the aircraft was making no noise at all and after &quot;zooming&quot; up to us it stopped right over our vehicle.  Our windows were rolled down and the moon roof was open as the night felt so good. About this time we turned into our private drive and made it up to our house which is about &frac14; mile from the main road.  This was around 23:20 or so as I remember, my wife agrees with the times that I am putting into this report.  The next thing that either of us remembers was being in the car, it was running but my wife was in the driver&rsquo;s seat and I was in the passengers!  Since I am 6&rsquo;5&rdquo; and she is 5&rsquo;7&rdquo; this posed a problem for me in that my knees were killing me from being forced into the dash. We closed the windows, the moon roof and turned off all the lights and the radio.  After shutting down the car and going into the house we noticed the time, according to our atomic clock, (which is supposedly in tune with the big clock in Colorado), that it was now 02:24 hours????  Where did the time go??  Neither my wife nor I remember anything what so ever after parking the car at our house.  We drove straight home from our friends who live about a mile away from us.  As I stated before we were not drinking nor were we under any influence that would make us see things that weren&rsquo;t there and we certainly were not in bad enough shape to spend that long in her car with my knees pushed through the dash board!  From what my wife and I remember the aircraft was totally silent, no noise or sound what so ever.  It was triangular in shape, very dull black in color from what we could see, with a purple colored beacon type light at the bottom center with lights in various places around it as if they were cabin windows.  We never saw anyone, we never heard any sounds, we do not remember what happened to the time that we lost, why we were in different positions in the car and why we were sitting outside our house with all of the windows to include the moon roof open?  I did wake up with a headache and my wife felt bad enough to stay in bed for most of the next day. We hope that this report helps you in some way.

It was around 10:30pm when my mother, brother and I had just gotten home from an event. We lived on a horse shoe street which was somewhat surrounded by tall trees (50 feet plus). We had just pulled in the drive way and as we were getting out of the car my mother says &quot;What is that?&quot; and as plain as day hovering about these tall trees was a U.F.O. My brother says that&rsquo;s a flying saucer. There is no doubt to what we are seeing. This is visible no more than 200 feet away. This saucer length had to be at least 6-8 maybe more diesels long all lined up together. I was amazed at what I was seeing. I just could not believe my own eyes. This saucer hovered over these trees for 5-10min. It had several white lights around the outer part. After 5-10min it began to rise slowly and I mean slowly and with in a few seconds it took off at an angle leaving just a tracer of its path and it was gone. I can close my eyes today and see it all over. I will NEVER forget. I look to the sky all the time hoping to see one again. Also, I myself have experience what I believe was an alien encounter. I believe this occurred after the sighting not sure of the date/time but there was light outside. I was sitting in my bed reading a book and my back is to the bed room entrance.

I would testify to this in a court of law before God. Myself, Philip Burke, and Wesley Jinks, all eagle scouts and college students, witnessed strikingly similar events.I won the poker game and we stepped outside so Phil could smoke a cigarette. Phil was smoking under the porch by the basement sliding door. Wesley was walking back from his car after getting his wallet so he could pay up for his poker loss and was turning the southeast corner of the house when this incident began. I was completely sober because the antibiotics I&rsquo;m taking react violently with alcohol. It was between 2:55 and 3:00 AM, December 24th, 2006. I was centered on the east edge of my back patio off the basement. I was looking almost directly up at the northeast sky at maybe a 75 degree angle, attempting to look for the stars. It was evenly overcast that night with no rain and very little wind, about 40 degrees F and relatively calm outside. Very low level clouds in even formation meant that no stars could be seen. All three of us encountered two distinct identical waves of energy that streaked the sky with associated noise, light, and perceptible electric and magnetic energy unlike anything we had ever seen, heard or felt in our experience.I consider myself to have a sharp perceptional awareness and to be in touch with my senses. I was once missed by a lightning strike by 10 feet in a rainstorm and felt incredibly jolted, but this experience shocked or jolted me electrically ten times more than this previous lightning incident. I could tell the pulse was also very magnetic in nature, having had an MRI less than two months ago, and several in the past two years. I was mid sentence and went instantly silent when I was frozen by a sudden blast of energy coming from the sky. The blast originated in the west-northwest sky and moved east-southeast, crossing the entire sky from horizon to horizon in maybe two seconds, no idea as to altitude. There was initially no light associated with this blast, only pure energy. I could feel this energy. It coursed through my body. It felt like a concentrated pulse of electric and magnetic energy. This wave of energy that hit my body felt like the rush from jets doing a low altitude fly-by at an air show, only instead of wind, it was a burst of electric and magnetic energy that grew gradually, drastically spiked, then trailed off. As this pulse moved directly over my head it seemed to convey my entire body with it in the direction of its path. It was strongest at this point. I was frozen still in fear and my upper body wavered east-southeast as if I were getting pushed and pulled at the same time, only nothing physically touched me except energy. I moved my foot to keep myself from being pushed over, otherwise I feel as if I would have been knocked down.As this pulse approached, the associated noise quickly turned from a low drone or buzz to a tinny screech that was deafeningly loud for a fraction of a second then returned to a low drone. It was louder than anything I&rsquo;ve ever heard for that brief fraction of a second when it seemed to pass overhead. I covered my ears but kept my eyes wide open. As this pulse approached and the drone got louder, the sky filled with an ambiance of alternating green and blue waves that seemed to radiate linearly and at short regular intervals out from the path of travel of this pulse. The waves lit the overcast sky more and more brightly during the pulse&rsquo;s rapid approach, like they were being projected on the clouds from above the cloud ceiling. The brightness approached the brightness of day but everything around me had an eerie blue-green cast. An instant after the noise got unbearable, immediately as it began to subside, the entire sky filled with an array of every color in the visible spectrum for a brief instant, brighter than anything I have ever seen in the atmosphere, including the light of day at high noon. At this point I was facing east, looking up at a 45 degree angle. It seemed as if the pulse just passed. The sky was splotched with every color in the spectrum shining on the clouds in an instant dazzling array, predominately oranges and reds. It seemed as if a 3D electric matrix of visible fine lightning-like electricity filled the sky and approached from the east, went over my head. This matrix of many hundreds of tiny electric bolts, blue green in color, may have entered the lightning rods of my house. This is unclear because my eyes were still recovering from the brightness of the flash. The previous blue green waves mentioned may have lasted two seconds and grown in intensity, but this rainbow colored flash with the electrical matrix lasted maybe a quarter of a second. The power in the house then went off completely with no associated surge or fade. It just cut out then came back on about a second later. ! The neig hbor&rsquo;s floodlight remained on. All was calm and quiet for a second or two and my fear caused me to begin to turn towards the house to seek cover as I still looked at the sky.I then remembered Wesley was out front and I stayed outside to see if he saw anything. As he was approaching from the southeast corner of the house, maybe 75 feet away, ALL OF WHAT I HAVE RECOLLECTED THUS FAR WAS REPEATED IDENTICALLY, only we were paying closer attention to the sky now, so it seemed more extreme. I&rsquo;m uncertain whether it was or not. Both sets of pulses, flashes, buzzes, and power outages occurred in maybe ten or twelve seconds total. During the hour following this incident my ears hurt as if I had been at a rock concert that lasted for a week. My eyes hurt like I just walked out of a pitch black cave and stared at the sun. The cable TV and internet did not work until the next day. Once I regained my footing after the first blast, I felt like I was in instant shock, not from disbelief but from the actual energy inside me. I felt like I was filled to the brim with free electrons. My heart rate instantaneously spiked to its maximum and stayed there for quite some time. My body did sort of a hormonal dump, not quite like going into shock, but similar. It felt wonderful and terrible, as I imagine trying crack cocaine for the first time would be. These feelings gradually normalized over the course of two hours.Immediately after we came inside following the second pulse, we all confirmed something very, very weird just happened. I insisted no one speak of it and we all write separate personal accounts. Before we started writing, I ventured back outside and gazed at the sky for a couple minutes to find out if I could see anything else. The once thick cloud cover had opened to a strip of clear sky. This strip of clear sky was bordered by parallel lines of cloud cover on each side. The strip of clear sky appeared exactly where I sensed the two blasts had traveled horizontally through the sky from west northwest to east southeast. It looked as if the strip was opened by parting winds in opposite directions in the atmosphere. It stretched from horizon to horizon. I noticed Phil had dropped a lit cigarette on the ground. As I gathered paper I felt like I was on a mild dose of ten different drugs at once and my heart rate would not move from its peak. Wesley agreed to write an account, but Phil was ghost white and looked like he was about to have a heart attack. He noticed the cable TV signal had been lost (it worked fine before this incident) and opted for bed instead.Wesley and I did not speak to each other at all as we wrote, and only when we both finished did the results appear incredibly similar in every detail. While writing, I tried to relax and slow my racing pulse. As I did this, I experienced a euphoric pain free sensation originating in my spine and neck. I felt like I was five years old physically, except my heart ached like I was 80. As I wrote from maybe 3:10 AM to 4:30 AM this euphoric feeling gradually shifted from my spine to my muscles where I experienced major muscle relaxation. It seemed as if the electricity left me in waves starting at my core that rapidly moved to the surface. Each wave lasted about four seconds, and there must have been hundreds of them. As these hundreds of individual waves of electricity made it to the skin, I would get the strongest goosebumps I&rsquo;ve ever had and my hair would stand on end, noticeably on my arms. The feeling of muscle relaxation progressed to the point where I collapsed with my arms and chest on the table for about ten minutes where I could not write.I was motionless, simply enjoying the feeling when I was suddenly overcome by a strange migraine centered immediately behind my right ear near the surface of the skin. It was intense and piercing, and caused me to pick myself up, no longer experiencing any positive feeling symptoms. This migraine was very short lived and disappeared completely after only a couple of minutes. I have no history of headaches and have been routinely staying awake until 2-4 AM for about a month straight, so I felt no undue fatigue during any of this whole experience. The headache was enough to convince me I should go to bed. I tried to think about other things and eventually fell asleep. I slept through the night and woke up the next day with a sunburn on my face and hands, with redness and mild pain. My medication makes me very sensitive to UV radiation and I have been avoiding the sun completely. I ate breakfast, but could not keep it down. The cable TV came back on suddenly at about noon.

I would say i was about 2 miles from this event when i notices a helicopter hovering above the convoy suddenly break away which i found very odd,so i kept this in view when from no where a matalic blue object appeared. At first i thought it to be a large bunch of ballons&apos; but on refocusing my binoculars i could make out a cone shaped matalic blue object. This object was in the flight path for heathrow which flys over the city of westminster! The object appeared to come from an easterly direction heading west, the speed i could not guess correctly. As i was observing this another helicopter flew accross my building heading for the object. The objeect was below cloud leve at the time, the sky had broken cloud but other than that it was clear with some sun shine. The object then begane to rise verticle in to the cloud i managed to take a couple of pictures but they are blured due to the distane i was observing from.After seeing this i rang the mod and left a voice mail message after following the instructions given.", "large triangular craft  with 5 lights1 a red blinking light,hovering until i arrived right next to it and slowly dissappearedThis event took place on April 21, 2008. My buddy was taking me home that night it was about 11:30 pm driving down highway 70 between Raleigh and Durham. And coming around the bend there is a straight shot of about 2 miles of road to the intersection of page rd. and highway 70, so as soon as we go around this bend I see two really bright lights all the way down at the intersection that were noticeably brighter than any of the other lights around the area. And immediately my friend says &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a plane man&rdquo; and I automatically agreed with him thinking it has to be&hellip; no way you know? As we got about half way down the road we noticed it hasn&rsquo;t moved at all, so the next thing my friend says is that it has to be power line stand with lights or something and my reaction was were about to find out we are coming up on it now, we pass the power lines on the road which has no lights at all on it and then we pass about 300 feet of tall trees blocking the view and as we pulled up next to this craft immediately three other lights were now visible one of which was a blinking red light. It was a big black triangular object hovering completely stationary at least as long as 2 city buses together. It was only about 50 to 100 ft. over the trees, no sound completely silent no shine what so ever. I could see the angles of the craft through the light and could tell it was a three dimensional triangle about as tall as one story of a house. As soon as we stopped the car after taking a right on page rd. the craft started to move slowly away as if it had seen that we figured out what it was or as if there was some sort of intelligence looking back at us just steady slow cruising seemed to gain altitude and in a matter of seconds was totally gone, the lights we had seen two miles away had disappeared in a few seconds. See the thing is I got such a good look at this thing it is unbelievable, much less did I even believe in the phenomena but to be in the right place right time to even come in visual contact with one! blows m y mind. It looked like to me it was just sitting there watching the airport that has planes flying in and out all day but as it moved away I could tell that the blinking red light was on the back left corner cause of the direction of the leading point. I want to add that I have never been more scared in my life really my eyes were watering from shock I guess and I had goose bumps all over the place all night because of it. And other than that this is as far as I can go with it because its impossible to pursue further and half the people you actually tell your story to think you&rsquo;re out of your mind but I don&rsquo;t care we know exactly what we saw.And the reson i filled this out now i because it took my a while to be able to look at this site because of no internet.", "Stars in Baton shape floated from Southwest to the NorthIt was around 22:40 on June 08 2008.  My wife her friend and I were in the back yard.  We were just sitting around and looking at the sky.  I noticed first what looked like two stars that stayed equally apart in the south western part of the sky.  It looked as if two stars simply had been sitting in the sky and suddenly drifted toward the north.  Both stars stayed the exact same length from each other even when they turned in the drift toward the north.  The &quot;stars&quot; seemed to dim a little as they drifted.  I know for a fact it was not an airplane.  It was too far up and it would have been huge.  It was as if a baton was floating in space.  A big baton with no center just the two bright ends.   *       *(1)  * *(2)   *(3)    *", "1953  Estes Park, Colorado  cigar shaped craft floating above pine trees on a ranchMy family has shared the following information with very few people in fear of being thought completely crazy. My dad was a rancher, my mom a housewife, my brother and I students.  Our personal experience with an UFO was in Estes Park, Colorado, somewhere around 1952-1957 (truthfully, I am not sure of the date), but I was around 8-10 years old. We lived on a small ranch on South St. Verain Rd, about 3 miles out of the town of Estes.  It was in the evening, it was dark outside.  My mom was in bed with the mumps, my brother was laying on his bed reading.  My dad and I were in the kitchen doing dishes from dinner.  My brother&rsquo;s bed sat along the south wall with the foot of the bed next to a window looking south out to our horse pasture.  All of us a sudden, my brother, approximately age 13-15, started screaming for us to come.  We all ran into his bedroom and saw an extremely bright white light coming through his bedroom window from an aircraft floating above the tall pine trees.  It came from a ship, for want of a better word, that looked like the fuselage of a large airplane but there were no wings. The aircraft was about the size of a smallish to medium size commercial aircraft.  It looked to be metallic silver and there was absolutely no sound coming to us from the open windows.  The lack of sound is the one thing that has stayed in my mind all these years.  I&rsquo;m not sure how long we stood there and stared at it--it did not move at all.  Then, suddenly, it moved upward--we could then see a glow kind of like a lit cigar but no flames coming from the back, still no sound.  After it reached a certain altitude, it went toward Twin Sisters Mountain and then continued on through a gap in the mountains in the general direction of Boulder/Denver, Colorado.  I talked with my brother recently to refresh what we remember.  He said that the fire lookout people stationed on top of Twin Sisters also reported it and that the Rocky Mountain Newspaper reported that the nearby Air Force Base sent airplanes up after it was reported in the Boulder/Denver area.  He remembers reading that the planes could not keep up with the UFO and lost sight of the craft.  My mom called the Police Chief in Estes Park, and his only comment was, &quot;Don&rsquo;t tell anyone what you saw.&quot;   She did tell our neighbors to the northwest of us.  They seemed to believe us but didn&rsquo;t say much at all.  About 3 years later, we moved to Longmont, Colorado. One night after we were there a few months, our Estes Park neighbor lady called us and said she had seen the same thing that night.  She had picked up her daughter from a school dance and was driving back out to the country area we lived in when her headlights hit an object crossing the road in front of her.  (This was pretty deserted country at that time).  She said the description we had given her about our UFO fit this one exactly.  She seemed very upset and scared when talking about her experience.  I do not know if she reported it to the police or not.  If you have any information of other sightings, that fits the area of time period or in this area, we would be most interested in hearing about it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

We were heading home to our hotel while on a Christmas vacation. My husband was well ahead of us and although we screamed to the top of our lungs and jumped up and down to get his attention, did not believe us and never turned around to see it.  The &ldquo;saucer&rdquo; was very bright white, had many windows all the way around it, was very silent and  came from behind the building, hovered over us and the building and then proceeded to go very quickly back up and disappear. We were more excited than frightened, but it was also rather alarming because we had never seen a flying object move like that in terms of silence and speed.  It was very bright and made of a solid material.   The windows did have light in them, but we did not see any objects or living creatures inside the windows.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Airplanes are very common in this area but what caught my attention was the number of them. You usually see only one or two but  never in the same area. What made me curious was particular groups of these aircraft with red and green flashing lights appearing to be flying in formation in groups of threes. I also noticed Several larger aircraft with the same red and green lights and two larger white lights in the back as they flew over me at very high speeds. These planes were obviously not UFO&rsquo;s but while I was observing these planes I noticed a star like object hovering much lower than the other planes and traveling at a  faster speed. Occasionally the object would slow down a bit and appeared to wobble in a short circle and speed back up again. I observed this object for about ten minutes until it disappeared behind some trees. I then made several phone calls to friends in the area telling them what I saw.I proceeded to walk home when I noticed several more star like objects move higher in the sky. I then noticed one of the larger planes flying towards one of them at a high speed. The object then appeared to fly much higher in the sky until I couldn&rsquo;t see it. I then saw a short white streak across the sky moving extremely fast and disappeared. I continued to observe several more of these objects and more airplanes  circling in the same area.I got home and woke up my father who came outside and witnessed the same events. I also contacted a neighbor who also witnessed several of the objects streaking across the sky. Several of my friends saw the planes flying around in the circular pattern but did not see the star like objects. Everyone who witnessed where kind of concerned and frightened at the events taking place. After a while I couldn&rsquo;t see any more objects but the planes continued to circle the area. I hope that this small group of people were not the only ones to witness these events. We tried to film the objects and planes on a cell phone camera but couldn&rsquo;t see them in the night sky.", "orange glow seen in NE skyWitnessed an oval shaped orange glow about 33 degrees from flat terrain in the NE sky.  The object was stationary.", "Rectangular UFO being followed by military B52 aircraft.June 15, 2008  UFO Report   Around 16:30 hours while lying in the shade near our pool and looking up at a CAVU sky I observed a silver/white rectangular shape at an estimated altitude of 30,000 feet.  The rectangle was emitting two rather short jet trails which came from the rear two corners of the rectangle.There was a soft jet exhaust sound.  The speed was comparable to that of a commercial jet- liner...and the shape was clearly rectangular with a L/W ratio of about 6 to 8.  There were no wings visible and there was no frontal streamlining.  The shape of the bottom was truly rectangular.  Its course was south by south-west.I watched the shape cross the open sky for about 7 seconds until it passed behind the tree tops.  In doing so there were bright glints of sunlight bouncing off part of the surface.  It looked like there were only some small surfaces or points on the structure that reflected the light...as the entire shape was not reflecting light at that time.  I then lost sight of the craft.Approximately 5 to 7 seconds after I lost visual with the craft...there appeared a military type jet which was following the rectangular craft.  This was a B52 type craft emitting four jet trails of more usual length.  The engines were mounted out on the wings as the jet trails did not come from the rear of the fuselage as in civilian craft.  The wings and horizontal tail surfaces were clearly visible and were of the standard rear sweeping design.  The wing span of the military jet was approximately three times the width of the rectangular craft...and I would estimate that they were at the same altitude.As for the observer...I am white male, age 55, a licensed private pilot, with current medical that does not require corrective lenses.  I am a mechanical engineer by profession.  I do not take any medications, and alcohol was not an issue.  I am in great health, have never had any mental issues...nor have I ever sighted/reported anything like this before.Regards.", "Iridescent blue light passes over farmer at tree top level on a summer night in the early 60sListening to your aged guests this evening (Jeff Rense show 06/10/08), I was drawn to recall a UFO sighting told to me by former mayor in these parts - Bedford, Ontario Canada - a few years back. The gentleman passed a year or so after he shared his story with me. To many in this area the gentleman was known as a war hero. He&apos;d been awarded the Croix de Guerre. I was at the old gent&apos;s home to listen ti his youthful recollections. It was after one such story telling event I asked, &quot;Hey, have you ever seen anything strange in the skies in these parts?&quot; His jovial demeanor gave way to a serious look. His face contorted, scrunched - if you will - then a work-swollen hand covered and rubbed his entire face. He took a deep breath and paused. He looked over his right shoulder out the window toward the north field of his farm. &quot;Out there,&quot; he nodded, &quot;I saw something once.&quot; His hands rested on his cane, his eyes squinted seeming to draw the event into closer focus. &quot;Why would you ask me that?&quot; His gaze shifted to my eyes. &quot;I don&apos;t know. I guess I&apos;ve always held an interest in strange things . . . just wanted to know if you&apos;ve ever seen anything.&quot;  As his story unfolded he told me it was a few years after he&apos;d gotten the farm - he purchased it in 1957 with help from the DVA. As I recall, he told me some of his cows had failed to return to the barn this evening. He was concerned because some of them were with calf and he felt that perhaps a calf had been injured and the cow (s) would not leave it. He decided to walk into the field and search his 400+ acres - all of it if need be. He recalled walking north into the moon-lit night. He&apos;d walked for about 15 minutes barking &quot;Co-Boss!&quot; He&apos;d stop from time to time to listen, said he&apos;d wipe his forehead with a hanky because it was a warm, humid night. He&apos;d continue. He said he&apos;d walked for 15 minutes or so in the manner described above, and had paused to listen and look around. He said while looking around he noticed a bright light coming out of the north east. He said it was flying in a line that would cross in front of him, it was low just over tree-top level. He listened for the sound of an engine. As he listened and the object closed he noticed the light was bluish in color. When I asked him what type of blue he said it was the type of blue one sees when looking at an arc-welder&apos;s flash. He stood there listening intently for an engine, but there was no sound. He said the object passed almost over him, but remained slightly to his front with, again, not a sound to be heard. His curiosity kept his eyes fixed on the object until it became obscured by the tree line to the south west. After he lost sight of it his curiosity shifted to fear. I asked him what he did then. He said, &quot;I wasn&apos;t long getting back to the house!&quot; He said he watched the thing for a good 20/30 seconds. He said he had no idea what it was. I asked him why he was scared. He said because it hadn&apos;t made a sound and he&apos;d never seen anything like it. He said it had what looked like a fuzzy glow around it - blue. I suspect the fuzzy look may have been enhanced by the humidity of that night. Interestingly, he said he was paid a visit by a couple &quot;G-men&quot; (his word, not mine) a week or two afterward. They said they were there to check out his property for some minerals. He let them onto his property then let them wander about. Upon their return he asked them if they&apos;d found anything. I interrupted, &quot;What did they find?&quot; He answered, &quot;I&apos;m not sure, but the one guy said it made his Geiger counter sing.&quot; I have done some research on the minerals in this area and there is indeed uranium here. I can&apos;t say the arrival of the G-men played any part of the old gent&apos;s sighting - he&apos;d not told anyone at that time about it. I verily feel his account of this incident was exactly as he experienced it. He was dead serious and uneasy recalling it - something (the uneasiness) I&apos;d not seen him project in my 5 years of knowing him.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.

On the horizon I saw a silver cigar shaped object that I believed was a plane...my partner did not see it.   It was very far in the distance.   It went behind a small puffy cloud, came out the other side and then disappeared right as I was looking at it.   I informed my partner and he basically said I was seeing things.  So I convinced myself it was just a plane. About 3 or 4 minutes later, I looked up and saw a brownish object in the shape of a cigar or boomerang moving slowly directly over the highway and yet very high in the sky.  I started pointing at it telling my partner that it was likely a plane.   Mind you it was directly over the highway.  He did not see it again.   As I was watching it, it just vanished.

This object did not display ANY sort of a tell-tale sign of any know aircraft to our American skies (i.e. no blinking lights, no red or green lights, nothing). The object was not moving very quickly, but at a steady pace across the night sky  I quickly ran inside to get my wife to witness this event. She in turn came out to the yard and also observed the light as I have described. The object took about a minute to cross the sky above us, so it was not even moving as fast as the planes that do cross our skies daily. As we both watched, hoping that this object would display SOMETHING to let us know that it was man made, we observed the object become a bit brighter in the sky, and then with the blink of an eye, it was gone. We both turned and looked at each other in disbelief, and both of us said almost simultaneously, &ldquo;It made no sound.&rdquo; As we were watching the object go across the sky, I even made a small comment out loud: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hear any engines. If it&rsquo;s a plane, we should be able to hear the sound of the engines.&rdquo; There was NO SOUND. My wife was a bit shocked and perplexed, as she has not had any &ldquo;encounters&rdquo; that she has ever told me of.

PD))I reported this with Mufon. I will use the exact content as in that report:  Long Description of Sighting Report My husband and I noticed an extremely bright flickering object in the western sky last night. We have seen this on occasion, and assumed at the time it was a star. Last night I looked out the window to see if the sky was still clear (we have been pounded by rain in the Midwest lately). I noticed two flickering objects in the western sky, and I grabbed the binoculars to see if they were planes. They did not move like the planes we see over our home, which have a different light pattern, and typically move quicker, either heading to or from the airport. By the time we grabbed the binoculars, we were only observing one object. The other object had moved out of our sight. It looked fairly stationary, so that&apos;s why I didn&apos;t think it was a plane to begin with, but line of sight maybe created an illusion. I grabbed my Sony 20x Optical/800x digital zoom 8MM video camera. I had to put it on a tripod to keep it steady as you will get extremely jerky movement trying to zoom in on distant objects with digital zoom. (very sensitive to the slightest camera movement.) I used the Night Shot Plus option (infrared) on the camera to record. I taped about 40 minutes. During this time I had to readjust the camera several times as the object would move out of frame once I had a steady focus on it. I captured the video this morning an up loadable digital file. I edited out most of the jerky movements caused by me trying to refocus and reposition the object in the camera frame. (There still are some on the video and they are obvious quick up and down movements.) I do have some steady video clips of the object in frame and you can see the object moving left to right out of frame on its own. I put the clips together in one file. I guess this could be an extremely bright star but I do not know enough about celestial objects and how quickly they should move out of frame based on our planet&apos;s rotation. The object also gives off a rotation of colors. Video clip is loaded up in the Mufon database if you want to see it.", "Bright star like object moves across sky in strange patterns 3:30 am in edmonton.It was in the early morning that me and a friend decided to take a stroll down to a nearby public park to talk and star gaze. The park was an open field with many trees lining the border. The sky was still dark with a clear view of the stars. While viewing the stars, we noticed a very large bright light, slightly larger then a satellite, and its altitude was much higher then that of a plane. This &quot;light&quot; began to move from its position in the sky downwards, at about a 45 degree angle, with a significant speed. This object made abrupt quick movements as though it was shaking.   It would occasionally speed up, then slow down. It continued this pattern until it was almost directly above us, and we noted that it was not a plane. It was silent, and every so often a very small tail (ray, or spark) would be visible upon it. The &quot;light&quot; seemed to have a reddish glow emitting off of it every so often. After passing over us, it switched direction and began to hover downwards, slower than before. After watching it for a while longer, it then vanished.

As it moved closer it went farther up.  As it continued heading toward the south east, the bright white light began to dim as it went higher up, the glow changed from white to bright red.  It then disappeared for and one could not find it, but then, it appeared again, but very dim, barely visible, continuing southeast.  The movement was zig zag, there was no noise.

She speaks quite eloquently about her sighting, and she will have the other two living witnesses submit reports, as well.  PD))The year was 1967. I was 32 years old. I was driving out Montevallo Road, going from the mall to my home. My ten year old son, my nine year old son and my thirteen year old stepson were with me. I was driving a convertible and the top was down.  It was dusk, I don&apos;t know the exact time.All of a sudden we looked up, I do not know why, and saw, hovering above the trees on the right side of the street, a huge craft.  It was oval in shape with a smaller dome on top.  Around this smaller dome was a row of windows and there were lights in the windows.  I heard a soft whirring sound, smooth and barely perceptible.  It stayed there for five minutes or so and then zoomed off to the west with a speed that was incomprehensible. I pulled off on a side street and pulled over to the curb and parked the car.  The boys and I were all stunned.  I asked them to tell me what they had seen.  We each spoke in turn and we all saw the same thing. At that time my husband owned a large company in Birmingham and any negative or questionable activity was a threat to his reputation so I told the boys that we would tell their dad when we got home and then we must never talk about it again.  We could not risk losing customers.  The people in Birmingham were peculiar in some ways and it was better to keep quiet.  We did tell my husband when we got home and then we never talked about it again for many years. A few years ago I began to tell some of my close friends about it.  As you get older you worry less and less about what other people might think and I wanted to share my experience.  My son who was ten at the time has passed away but I asked my son who was nine at the time if he remembered that everning and he said, &quot;Oh, yes.&quot;  I cautioned them so much he has not talked about it much but he still remembers it exactly the way I do. My husband died many years ago and I have lost touch with his children but I am sure his son, who was thirteen at the time, still remembers.  You cannot forget because it changes everything you ever thought ab out the world you live in.  I loved the experience and would love to see another one but realize I probably never will.  It was a beautiful ship and so far advanced from anything we have on this planet.  The material it was made of reminded me of one of those globes you see over a hall light, a glass or plastic globe that allows the light to shine through.  The ship had a yellowish, or golden glow, as if it was lit behind the material it was made of.  The lights in the window were brighter than the soft glow of the ship itself.  I don&apos;t know how big it was, it seemed quite large though not as large as a football field.  But I am not good at judging distances so I don&apos;t know how high it was but it seemed rather close, though not directly  above the trees. I am 73  now and did want to make some official report before it is too late.  I don&apos;t know if this is the right place to do it but I will continue to search websites in regard to this.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))", "Larg triangle seen in the sky early in the morning.At around 6:30 A.M. i woke up early with my dog to take him out.  I got into the yard and my dog started going to the bathroom.  I saw some thing high in the sky. It was hard to see how high it was but it was about level with the clouds.  It looked triangular with very bright lights at each point.  It was much larger than a plane or helicopter.  There was no sound apearing to be coming from the object.It stayed in the sky for about 30 seconds before quikly turning into a haze and disapering into the west.", "Very close and very vividMy Son Daughter and myself was at the Springfield Drive in Theater. The object appeared above the screen of the Theater and set there like they were maybe just checking it out. It was round and smaller at the bottom with a red light on it. The center revolved and had a number of windows in it with light coming through the windows. like standing outside a house at night and looking in but seeing nothing but the light. As the center revolved on one side was several smaller windows and on the other side was longer windows, There was no noise coming from the thing. My daughter started crying wondering if it was the end of the world.It hovered for awhile and then just took off real fast. It was gone a few minutes then reappeared, it didn&apos;t stay long the second time, it hovered a few minutes then shot off in the very same diection that it had gone the first time. I asked the people in the car next to me if they were seeing what I was and the man said he didn&apos;t have any idea what we were all seein. We left the theater right after that along with most of the other cars. I went to my sisters and called the City Police dept. they said they had  numerous reports. The next day I called the police back to see if they had anymore info on it, and they told me they had not received any repoets the night before. I cannot tell you forsure the time or the year for sure I do know it was in the summer time and between the years between 1972 and 1977. Because I know where we were living in this paticular house between those years and we were living there when we saw it.My daughter has passeed away but she remembered it quit accurately untill that time. My son is now 42 years old and he and I still have the very same memory.We don&apos;t talk about it much because people think we are nuts.", "I saw a bright light that didn&apos;t look like anything I have seen ever before.I was driving home from university when I saw in the sky a bright light. It turned a blue colour and shot off extremely fast.

I just looked out my window and saw a buncha cop cars, un-marked and marked, it looked like they just served a warrant, it could&apos;ve been the police helicopter but then again, never seen the police helicopter with a light formation of that sort, and I&apos;ve seen my police helicopter a lot, I wouldn&apos;t lie about this too. This is the best info I can give you..", "Disk Sighted Over Surry Nuclear Power Station, Surry Co., VAAt about 12:20 pm, 19 May 2008, I observed what appeared to be a large, metallic disk hovering very near the Surry Nuclear Power Station. (This is a little more than hour from the time of this writing, so the memory is still fresh and vivid).I was on my bicycle riding east on the Colonial Parkway (James City County) when I spotted an object over the James River, moving from east to west at a very slow speed. At first I thought it may have been a kite because it was a very windy day (the winds were gusting out of the SW at 20-30mph) and people do come out and fly their kites from the beaches when the winds are good. But when I came to an open spot in the road unobstructed by trees I stopped to get a better look and decided it was much too large to be a kite. It is a about a mile across the channel to the Surry Station and what I saw appeared to be very near the station&rsquo;s twin domes and it must have been at least as large as they are, and perhaps larger. Besides that the object was moving very slowly against the wind, left to right from my vantage point, and its upper surface caught the sunlight and reflected like a sheet of aluminum foil. Its underside was dark. Then I thought that it might be an advertising balloon or dirigible, but the shape did not seem right. This was definitely a flattened disk. And, because it was so windy it did not seem like a good day to take a blimp up. (And, with security so high these days it does not seem logical that anyone would be permitted to get that close to power station. I have seen military helicopters on training missions over the river, but even they keep a wide berth from the power plant.)  I have eliminated the possibility of helicopters and small aircraft because, as I say, this object was hovering/drifting and appeared to be making a very leisurely circuit of the power plant. I walked down to water&rsquo;s edge to see if I could get a better look, but without binoculars I couldn&rsquo;t make out any other useful details. I watched it like this for a good 15-20 minutes. In that time it completely circled the station, moving against the wind. It appeared to correct its angle at times, very slowly rocking up and down.I then decided to hurry home, grab my binoculars and camera and see if I might get a better look. It took me about ten minutes to bike home from there and another fifteen to get back on the Parkway by car. But, by the time I returned to my original position the object was gone. I drove a few miles down the Parkway hoping that it might have drifted elsewhere, but the sky was empty except for a few white clouds. Now, I wish I had stayed until it left. It would have been interesting to see which way it went.((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF THIS REPORT))Response To So-Called Explanations Of Previous SightingI am responding to Mr. ((name deleted)) &quot;explanation&quot; of what I saw on the 19th of May 2008.His statement that there is a blimp factory on the NC/VA border is patently false. There is a company with an office in Durham, NC, called Flairships that leases out aerial advertising blimps to various companies, but they did not have any blimps in the air over SE Virginia on the day in question. I contacted other companies that utilize airships (including Goodyear and MetLife), and none of them had a blimp within 200 miles of the James River on that day.  Having seen advertising blimps on various occasions over the years, I can assure you that this was not a blimp. I had a close-up view of it under ideal conditions. What I saw had no writing of any kind on its sides.  Nor did it have a crew cabin on its belly, a tail assembly, or motors or any other protuberances from its surface. The craft I saw was perfectly smooth and silent.  It was also in the range of 300-400 feet long. Even the largest advertising blimps in use today are only about 200 feet long. And they, like the Goodyear blimp, have the company logo prominently displayed on their hull.  Otherwise, what&rsquo;s the use of having an advertising blimp?   The idea that a blimp might have been blown from north to south by a southwest wind is laughable.  If anything, it would have been blown towards Williamsburg, not away from it. As I said before, the craft I saw moved strongly INTO the wind and was not at its mercy.  And, with all of the empty real estate it could possibly encounter along the river, it chose to stop just opposite a nuclear power station?  That, in itself, is telling.I called the Jamestown airport (which is less than a mile from my house) two hours after my sighting, and the fellow in charge assured me that there was nothing even remotely like a blimp in the air that day. Unfortunately, the local airport does not use radar, so he couldn&rsquo;t tell me just what may have been flying over the river at noon that day.The &ldquo;very highly restricted military intelligence community/base&rdquo; he refers to must be Camp Peary, aka &ldquo;The Swamp.&rdquo; This is the well-known CIA training base on the York River. It lies on the other side of Williamsburg about 5 miles from where I made my sighting. Having lived here for the past 15 years, I too have heard tales of remotely piloted vehicles like the Predator drone flying over the base and the nearby York River. But they are never seen over the historic areas or the James River. I know what a Predator looks like, and with its sleek body, long wings and bulbous nose, it was the complete opposite of what I saw. I suspect you could pack twenty Predators inside of what I saw.Having seen this alien craft up close (at first from less than half a mile away) and then at a distance of about three miles, I am absolutely certain that it was not a helicopter, &ldquo;military item&rdquo; (whatever that means), or small airplane. I spent 6 years in the Navy and believe my eyesight is still good enough to distinguish helicopters, Ospreys, and fixed winged aircraft from the absolutely unique craft I witnessed. And the idea that I&rsquo;d mistake an ultralight for a 300 feet long craft leaves me speechless. I have seen ultralights fly over directly my house while out doing yard work, and I&rsquo;d know their shape anywhere. Besides, they make as much noise as a flying lawnmower. What I saw was silent.In summation, I&rsquo;d like to add that I&rsquo;ve attempted to get in contact with Mr. Ebersole, as he so obligingly left his phone number, bur he has so far refused to return my calls. All I know of him is that he lives in Virginia Beach, about 60 miles from the sighting area, which, by the way, is home to Oceana NAS. Just up the peninsula a few miles is Langley AFB, a first response base which is tasked to defend US airspace in the event of hostile activity (such as 9/11). This part of Virginia is home to at least a half dozen very sensitive military bases.I am speculating here, but I suspect that the idea that an alien craft could literally &ldquo;stroll&rdquo; past these bases, at midday, right over the heads of millions of people, and not be detected, much less confronted, and then loiter next to a nuclear power station, is something that no one in the armed forces or the intelligence community is willing to admit to. There also appears to be a coordinated effort to discredit valid sightings.((e-address deleted))((END ADDENDUM))", "2 dim lights at night, flying fast in formation, then independently in small arcs; then chased each other in a small circle.Date: March 29, 2008, Saturday (the night of the Earth Hour) Time: 10:15 PM (+-5 minutes) Place: Argyle Mall parking lot (Clarke Rd. at Dundas St.), London, Ontario, Canada  Brief Description  Two dim orangish-white lights in close proximity, flying low (around 3,000 ft??) and fast, at first in formation, and then independently, in small arcs; all the while remaining in proximity to each other. Before the lights disappeared in the distance, they had &quot;chased&quot; each other rapidly in a small circle. The entire &quot;performance&quot; resembled a bravado-fuelled airshow, with rapid manoeuvres and (nearly?) silent engines. The event lasted 4 or 5 seconds during which the objects traversed one-third of the sky. Although there were brief and faint sounds (a vibrating rumble and a wooshing noise) associated with the phenomenon, they may have been coincidental. Full Description  After shopping at Wal-mart, I was walking through the Argyle Mall parking lot when a movement in the clear night sky induced me to look up. West of where I stood, some 50 degrees up in the sky, I saw two steady (non-flashing) orangish-white lights (the size of an average star, but noticeably dimmer) in proximity to each other, moving fast in formation in the southwesterly direction. I assumed this was an airliner with lights on both ends of its wings. The &quot;aircraft&quot; appeared to be flying very low, because the lights were moving very fast and the distance between them was rather large. (If I extended my arm, the length of my index finger would approximate the apparent distance between the lights. For what it&apos;s worth, I&apos;d speculate that the altitude couldn&apos;t have been higher than 3,000 ft.)  When the lights simultaneously veered away from each other in symmetrical arcs, it became obvious that they were two separate objects that had been moving in formation. The objects then performed some playful airshow-style acrobatics (lots of rapid turns in different directions) at high speeds, all the while continuing in the southwesterly direction. Before they disappeared in the distance, the lights had performed a spectacular manoeuvre: for at least one second they were &quot;chasing&quot; each other in a small circle (perhaps 5 degrees in diameter), as if they were attached to the blades of a rotating propeller. The revolution was so rapid (at least two rotations per second) that it drew a distinct circle of light against the night sky. (It&apos;s possible that what looked like circular motions from a distance were actually coordinated corkscrew motions along the axis of the southwesterly trajectory the lights were following.) The entire experience lasted only 4 to 5 seconds, during which the objects managed to traverse at least one-third of the sky (this indicates considerable speed). Although there were other people nearby at the time, I doubt anyone else noticed this brief and low-key phenomenon. What struck me about the quality of the motion of the objects was the speed and peculiar fluidity and smoothness with which they changed directions. The thought that came to my mind was: they behave like living creatures, not aircrafts -- the motion somehow reminded me of bats in flight or fish swimming in water. The final circular manoeuvre brought to mind mosquitoes or flies swarming around. I&apos;ve never seen airplanes performing such swift and tight acrobatics. While I detected some strange faint sounds coinciding with the sighting, I can&apos;t be sure they were emitted by the objects, as opposed to, say, cars. When I first noticed the lights, I heard a brief (one second) and low, vibrating rumble, and then, a few seconds later, as the objects were moving further away, a brief (less than two seconds), soft wooshing sound. I&apos;m positive I heard no ordinary aircraft noises from propeller or jet engines. (The event took place after 10 PM when traffic noise in the area was at low intensity -- it shouldn&apos;t have drowned down the sound of planes flying so low.) The absence of normal aircraft sounds seems inconsistent with the most likely mundane explanation of my experience -- that the lights marked low-flying (and improperly lit) fighter jets on a night mission. Had the objects been such aircrafts, they should have produced audible and unmistakeable jet-engine drones. (I&apos;m not aware of an acoustic stealth technology that&apos;s this effective.)  It may be relevant to note, however, that the Argyle Mall parking lot, where I had the sighting, is located only 3 km southwest from the London (Ontario) International Airport, and that, assuming they&apos;d been following a roughly straight path even before I noticed them, the objects were coming from the general direction of the airport.", "A fireball swooped down over my friends and mines heads (50ft up) and ascended into the horizon opposite the one it came from.I walked down to my friends house late at night. I had not noticed it until briefly after I noticed my friend was waiting for me in his driveway. It was apparant that the ufo had been coming closer and descending for quite some time. While directly above us only a few seconds after the initial sighting, I could see that it was indeed burning bright like the sun, with no external source of energy attatched to it, unless the ring of light around it had something to do with it. My rushed to wake his dad up, by the time he made it outside it was half-way to looking like a star over the horizon, however he stared in awe, stating that it was the 3rd he had seen. It never made even the slightest sound. I took a photo with my cell phone but it looks like a streak of light.", "Who Would Have Thought Looking At The Stars... Would Turn Into A Night I Will Never Be Able To Forget!!!I was looking in the sky yesterday night to say there weren&apos;t very many stars out.. The sky is very clear usually. When i looked up i happened to notice this very bright light.. It was a little bigger then the regular size of star. I asked my boyfriend what  it was, because i have never seen anything move that fast. For a second i thought it was a shooting star, it was NO SHOOTING STAR! He thought at first that it was a airplane but there was no blinking lights or anything to show it was a airplane..Besides it was doing triple speed of a airplane. We were on the way to Store to pick up cigarettes for a friend.. After i noticed it it began moving faster and staying above us.. When we stopped to look up at time i stopped in one spot and looked like it was hovering over us. Then when we started to walk it moves again which ever direction we moved it would hover above us.We walked very fast back to our friends house. My Boyfriend told his two friends to look.. When we got back out side it finlly moved from above the house almost and was going the opposite direction from where i first noticed it. Not even two minutes we were all looking at it, it then disspeared into the sky. I sat inside my friends house, scared out of mind. I didn&apos;t know what to do!! I never believed in other life forms or anything.. I don&apos;t believe in ghosts and i am not supersicious. After about half a hour we went back outside to go get my friend her cigarettes for the second time. We weren&apos;t more then half way there and i had seen these three bright stars in the sky.. I told my boyfriend again about something in the sky. There were 3 perfectly spaced apart bright lights, that weren&apos;t there before when we were outside.. I couldn&apos;t have been mistaken either because.. Like i had said before there weren&apos;t very many stars out and i am very observant. I didn&apos;t really think anything of it then i realized if it was o&apos;rein&apos;s belt or anything i wouldn&apos;t know because i was never into that kinda of stuff in school. i can honestl! y say i  have never seen that low to the ground stars before. But the fact it wasn&apos;t there before really didn&apos;t honestly scare me.. Considering what we just had seen not even a hour prior to that. We decided to go back again.. To scared to even walk our 5 minute walk to grab cigarettes... We got back inside and told my boyfriends two friends to come see this for themselves.. My boyfriends one friend is very smart when it come to stuff like this so we had asked him about it. The odd thing was the lights weren&apos;t the same color when we got out side they were an almost a green color as silly as that sounds.. After a few minutes they kept like moving a bit.. Almost like doing a VERY slow circular motion. Not even 5 minutes after that they faded away completely. My friends that were in the house came out and they thought we crazy because they didn&apos;t see anything.. They kept making jokes and thinking we were crazy.. But four of us had seen these objects.. And i can&apos;t even explain to people how scared and how weird that was. I used to hear stories about people seeing flying saucers and thinking they were crazy and it was like a myth.. But i can honestly say, i never thought i would have saw anything like that in a million years. I was also talking to my boyfriend on the phone today and he had told me he was talking to his friend.. And his friend also had said that last night he had seen these weird bright lights in the sky. I have nothing else really to say besides the fact i never want to experience something like that again for as long as i live.. I really hope this is helpful!", "A large, fiery white ball of light shot quickly across the sky towards the ground.I was in the car at the time of the incident.

All my windows were down and so I know it made no sound.  It was dull dark gray and black, shaped like a triangle, much thicker in the center, even though the wing was also thick, with 2 or 3 dim colored lights along the edge (that I was able to see) and appeared very large as it was so close to me. It probably was at least 20 to 30 feet across. I saw it, from the right-hand upper corner of my windshield, just as it was passing me so I only saw it for a few seconds.

Because the stars are so bright, and because sometimes you can see a satellite, I always glance up at the sky when I am out at night.   What I saw tonight was the first time I have seen something I could not explain.  It was a large, bright, white light, flying from West to East in a somewhat wavy pattern. (Not a ruler-straight line)  There were no flashing lights to the side as you would see with an aircraft, nor was there ANY SOUND even though it was flying about the same height or a little lower as a small plane would fly. My sisters-in-law were getting into there car. I called out to have them look at the odd light too.  We watched it for about 45 seconds trying to figure out what we were observing, before one of my sister-in-laws ran inside to get my husband. My  daughter went in at that time also.  My other sister-in-law reached into her purse to get out her digital camera.  As she turned it on, and pointed it towards the sky, the light hesitated, and seemed to hover. Before she could focus and take a picture, it shot off directly towards the South/East, straight up, and disappeared within 3-4 seconds.  My husband made it outside to find me shaken up and nothing to see.  It was gone.I reported the incident to our local police, who directed me to the county police. They took a phone report, and offered to send a car out.  Since there was absolutely nothing for them to see, I didn&rsquo;t think that was truly necessary. They called St. Louis Lambert airport, but was told they don&rsquo;t track radar this far from the airport routinely.  I was directed to call our small, local airport tomorrow morning to see if anything was indicated on radar.  The sergeant I spoke to also mentioned it may have been a stealth fighter. I don&apos;t know if I buy that, because at the low altitude, it really seems like we would have heard or saw something besides the bright light.One more unusual occurrence was with our dog.  Anytime we are outside, he is right by us, trying to get us to pet him or play with him. Usually he is jumping up at us. During this time, he ran into our garage and was acting skittish, and trying to get inside our house.  Really strange behavior!

PD))", "Multiple Daytime sighting of silver spheresI was  home on leave from the U.S. Navy between May 6-12, 1977.  While home near Kinder, Louisiana, I went and met a couple of friends that were fishing in an irrigation canal about a mile North of town on Green Oak Road around 4:00 PM in the afternoon.  My friends were in a boat fishing about 100 yards from the road as I started walking down the canal levy to meet them. About half way to them, my friends started yelling like crazy for me to look up in the sky.  They were pointing in the sky to the North of the canal, but I was unable to see anything because of trees growing nearby. I yelled back and ask what it was, and they were yelling that it was a UFO!   At that time, I started running toward them and looking through the trees for an opening.  As I neared my friends, I saw the object in the sky that had them all excited.  It appeared to be a perfectly round silver sphere glowing against the cloudless blue afternoon sky.  Again I asked my friends what it was, and again they said it was a UFO as they paddled to the bank and told me to get in the boat to have a better look at the object. As we paddled away from the bank and sat in the middle of the canal watching the object for a few minutes, it appeared to be getting somewhat closer like maybe it was drifting toward us slightly.  I thought that possibly it could have been a weather balloon at that point, except for the fact that it was perfectly round and not long like a weather balloon and the silver glow of the object seemed far more intense that any weather balloon that I have ever seen reflecting the sun. The object became very stationary again and appeared to be the size of a quarter held at arms length. Without any reference to the size of the object, I was unable to determine if it was the size of a basketball and was just above the grown pine trees, or if it was a mile across and two miles away.  At its closest most stationary point, I remember remarking to my friends that there was something larger and transparent behind the glowing sphere in the sky.  It was difficult to see, but there appeared to be a much larger transparent possibly saucer shaped object on top of the sphere.  You could see the sky through the larger object, but you also see the outline of the larger shape above it as if you were looking through a clear glass object. About five minutes into the sighting, a smaller very intense red ball of light appeared at the bottom on the silver sphere that looked very much like a lit road flair without any smoke coming off of it. Very slowly the intense red ball of light started to lower from the silver sphere and appeared to be held in position by a very fine dark line in the sky. The much smaller intense red ball lowered a distance about four times the diameter of the larger silver sphere and then stopped in the sky and remained stationary as the dark line that appeared to be lowering the object appeared to turn into ashes and fall from the sky. The lowering of the red object took 1-2 minutes. Over the period of the next five minutes, the smaller red ball of light started expanding and collapsing in size getting lighter in color as it expanded and redder as it collapsed. Each time the red ball of light expanded and collapsed it remained larger each time and lighter in color until it was finally identical in size and color of the larger silver sphere in which the much smaller ball of light descended from. Now the identical silver spheres of light sat stationary one above the other for another five minutes. After five minutes, suddenly both spheres moved far across the sky to the West so fast that the eye was unable to see the movement. The objects were simply here and then all of sudden they were sitting far across the sky at a dead stop with a fine dark line in the sky from where each object was sitting connecting to were each object now sat. Again, the fine dark lines in the sky appeared to turn to ashes and fall from the sky in a couple of seconds. Both objects repeated these rapid unseen to the eye movements 4-5 times over the next five minutes leaving the fine dark line each time they moved back and forth widely from the East and West across the sky. Each time both objects stayed perfectly spaced one above the other.After five minutes of unbelievable and unseen movement and instant stops that lasted about a minute each, one sphere darted quickly out of sight behind the trees to the North and the other quickly cleared the Eastern horizon in approximately two seconds. At least this time they were moving slow enough to actually see them move across the sky.During the entire 20 minutes or so that we observed the object(s) moving or sitting stationary in the sky there were no noise whatsoever heard form them.After both objects left the area, we quickly loaded up the boat and headed toward the home of one my friends in the boat that lived two miles North of our location. Upon pulling up at my friends house, his younger brothers and sister came running up to the truck all yelling &ldquo;daddy saw a UFO, daddy saw a UFO&rdquo;. My friend said, &ldquo;let me do the talking&rdquo; and then asked his dad what he saw. His dad said, &ldquo;that he had saw a UFO straight above his property for nearly ten minutes and that it sprayed spider webs every time it moved.&rdquo; When asked what he meant about it spraying spider webs, he said &ldquo;every time it moved it sprayed spider webs that fell on his property and completely covered his ten acre pasture so that it looked like it was totally covered by white frost&rdquo;. He said that he tried to gather the spider webs up in his hands and it would melt in his hands as soon as it touched the skin. By the time we had made it to my friends home all of the &ldquo;spider webs&rdquo; had melted off of the ten acre pasture.I then headed to town (Kinder, LA) to see if anyone in town had seen the &ldquo;UFO&rdquo;. I met nearly a dozen different people shortly thereafter that I knew and they all asked, &ldquo;did you see the UFO&rdquo; before I would even have a chance to ask them. With so many people seeing the UFO, I figured that it had to be on the evening news so I headed home to watch it. Nothing was mentioned during the newscast, but at the start of the weather the weatherman announced that 200 people had called the TV station (KPLC) and reported seeing a UFO between Kinder and Oakdale, LA (a distance of 30 miles). However, the weatherman then announced that it was not a UFO. He stated that the National Weather Service had called the station and said that it was only a &ldquo;special weather balloon that was equipped with rockets&rdquo;.Two days after the above sighting while riding with my brother on Hwy 165 South of Kinder. My brother ran his brand new Ford LTD II off the road, jumped out of the car and unto the hood yelling, &ldquo;I saw it, I saw it&rdquo;.  Thinking he had nutted up, I ask him, &ldquo;you saw what&rdquo;. He said that he had just seen one of the silver spheres on the East side of the highway and that it had crashed into the rice field between the 3rd and 4th levy (maybe 100 yards)  from the road. He then attempted to enter the field, but I persuaded him not to enter the field as it was planted with young rice about 6 inches high and flooded with water. I assured him that if the object had crashed, we would have been able to see it from the road. I asked him if he had seen any water or mud come up from the ground when it crashed and he said, &ldquo;actually it did not look like it crashed, it looked like it went into the ground&rdquo;.I was just wondering if anyone else had seen a &ldquo;weather balloon&rdquo; that could move across the sky in excess of 30,000 mph and stop and go in an instant without making any noise.

PD))", "Nighttime multiple-witness sighting of a large black triangle on Highway 25 near Ware Shoals, SC.I was visiting my parents in Greenwood, S.C. over Thanksgiving. The Friday after the holiday, the three of us drove to the nearest city, Greenville, to do some Christmas shopping and to see a movie. Greenwood is a small city in a rural part of Upstate South Carolina, and the part of Highway 25 we were on is fairly isolated. There are a few homes here and there, but not a lot of development. Consequently, the road is quiet and on a clear night like the one in question, the stars are clearly visible. Around 10:30 or 11 p.m., I pointed out to my dad that the star on the horizon was particularly clear and beautiful, and he looked and said that while it was very pretty, he thought it was a planet because it looked too bright and large to be a star. My mom said that whatever it was, it looked awfully weird. The closer we got, the stranger it looked. I suggested that it might be a cell phone tower, and my dad disagreed, because the light on a cell phone tower would be red, and this light was white, like a star. That&apos;s when I realized that the object had changed positions in the sky. It had moved from the right side of the sky -- the passenger side, based on my position in the car -- to the left side of the sky, and it was definitely getting larger and closer. It&apos;s difficult for me to estimate how many miles we drove until it was directly overhead, but curiosity got the better of us in the little town of Ware Shoals, which is about 20 miles from Greenwood. My dad pulled into the median in front of the Burger King and he and I got out of the car and looked up. A large triangular craft slowly floated over us. Size in feet is hard for me to estimate and it&apos;s been a little while since this happened. I don&apos;t want my memory to inflate the measurement, but it was definitely larger than your average low-flying plane. If the sun had been out, it would have cast a shadow that would have covered me, my dad and his SUV. If I had put my hands above my head to blot it out of my vision, I couldn&apos;t have done it. The craft was black and shaped like an equilateral triangle with rounded corners. There were bluish-white lights at each corner and a red light on each of the three sides between the bluish-white lights. It didn&apos;t make any sound at all and it floated at an even pace right over the tops of the pine trees. It seemed to be so close to the tops of the trees that I thought it might brush them as it passed over. I know very little about military aircraft, but I looked up photos of stealth planes later to see if I could find what we saw. It wasn&apos;t a B-2, I&apos;m sure of it, because B-2s have a W-shape in the back and what we saw was a solid triangle. It wasn&apos;t a Nighthawk either. Both of those planes are too angular. I&apos;m absolutely certain the corners of the triangle were rounded. When it passed over -- it didn&apos;t shoot off at Warp 9 or anything, it just floated over the trees and out of sight -- my dad and I got back in the car. Less than a minute elapsed between the time we stopped the car and the time we got back in. I asked him what we had just seen and he said he didn&apos;t know, which surprised me because he&apos;s always been interested in military technology. We didn&apos;t talk much until we got home. We haven&apos;t discussed it since. Recently, I described the sighting to my boyfriend&apos;s father, a retired engineer who developed the engines for the B-2 and the F-117. He said that what I was describing did not match the description of any of our known stealth aircraft. I am a graduate of Clemson University and I hold a Bachelor of Arts in communication. At the time of the sighting, I worked as a newspaper reporter. I am now employed at an advertising agency as a copywriter. My father holds a Bachelor of Science in business and is a retired executive of a multinational agricultural biotechnology corporation.

They were traveling at a high rate of speed in that they were out of sight before I could turn my head to see for myself.

Then it started to move north slowly (maybe 2 or 3 minute duration).  I think it blinked a few times before fading completely.Then I noticed another traveling a lot faster from west to east but was only able to watch it for several seconds before that one dimmed and faded.I looked hard to see if this was a refection from the sun off of a couple of planes, but I could see nothing at all in the exact area after they faded.I did notice after the second light faded, further east, my eyes caught a black/dark object in the sky with no lights on and it was cigar shaped.  Could have been a plane but I didn&apos;t hear any noise from it or see lights.All these objects seemed to be very high up but I am not a good judge of distance.I didn&apos;t think much of it with all the hoaxes around but it certainly was entertaining for the time being.

Being a curious person I set my clock to wake up so I could witness this celestial event. I went outside that morning and within a few minutes I did see some heavenly body streak across the sky. Just before I was about to go back inside to bed, I saw something else that I&apos;ve never seen the likes of before or since. In the not too distant night sky I saw a disc shaped object floating slowly towards me. It was very brightly colored (the lights alternated red, blue, green and orange in a circular pattern around the object). I was transfixed by this sight as it inched towards our house. Over the next twenty minutes it floated closer and closer to the yard where I was standing. After about ten minutes of observation it was clear to me that this object was approaching and would soon be directly over head. I would estimate the disc at about 400-500ft in diameter and flying about 500-750ft in the air. There were times when it appeared to come to a dead stop and simply hover, then begin floating slowly closer. The flickering alternating colorful lights were the most striking thing about it and I remember wondering what government technology could produce such an object. At about the 20 minute mark in the sighting, the object was nearly directly over my head and I remember a strong fear coming over me. I was afraid of being spotted by this craft and went back inside the house. From various windows inside I continued to watch the object as it flew over the front of the house and I ended up in my bedroom watching it pass over the back yard. The object never made a sound. There were a bunch of trees behind the house a few hundred yards away; once the object glided over those trees it appeared to descend further. I watched it hover just above those trees for another 10 minutes or so before it ascended and quickly! flew ou t of sight. No airplane, weather balloon, or helicopter that I know of could account for that sighting. I will never forget what I saw that night and I have come to believe that others have seen the same thing as well.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I was about a mile away from the object and the first thing I noticed were bright lights in the sky. My first reaction was wondering why an aircraft would be flying so low near a city, from the distance I was at I couldn&apos;t tell the colors of the lights but I was also confused about why the lights of this aircraft were so bright, much brighter than airplane lights would be. As I got closer I could see it more clearly, I could see that there were bright lights on either end of something, at that point I wasn&apos;t close enough to tell the body of the aircraft, and the lights had a large light pink color in the middle with green, blue, purple, and yellow lights on the side that were not as large as the pinkish light, both ends had identical lights of equal size and brightness. The lights were flashing in a strange pattern that made no sense to me. The lights seemed to flashing in a nonsensical way, the lights were also very bright with very rich hues. As we were coming up to it we were looking straight on at it so I couldn&apos;t see a third light from our first vantage point, but I could see faint light coming down from the middle of the object.When we got close to it we could see that it was hovering, not exactly over the freeway but to the left of it a little bit, since I was in the driver seat I got a better look at it than the passenger did. The craft was moving very slowly and was hovering effortlessly, it didn&apos;t seem to have a destination, and it was moving slightly higher in the sky and to the left, but more so it seemed that it was just surveying things. The way it moved seemed very effortless and moved in a diagonal motion while going up. It was about 30 stories high above us and had it been flying in a city it would have ran into buildings. We drove under the object and this is when I looked up at it and saw perfectly that it was a large triangle with a dark circle underneath it and the lights on every corner of it. The color of the entire craft was grayish and the black circle stood out in contrast to it. The lights were equally large and bright with the same colors on each corner. The music in the car was off and the windows were down and we listened to see if we could hear any sound coming from it, but there was nothing, had it been a plane or a helicopter flying that low it would have been very loud, but there was no sound radiating from this. Everything about it was unlike anything I had ever seen, and the colors were strange hues that they were very hard to define. At the point when we drove under it we were leaving Bellevue and entering Kirkland and as we drove past it and away from it, it was still flying in relatively the same spot, give or take a few yards.", "Fireball misty teardrop shape fell behind a tree lineLocation East Coast of United States Cumberland County N.J. at 10:27 pm eastern standard time I observed a fireball in the sky about the size &frac14; the size of a full moon.

As I drove past the normal line of trees that eventually led to a slight clearing on the left side of the road, and ultimately revealed a lake, I noticed bright lights in the sky that caught my attention. I was traveling rather slowly as I was in no hurry to get home so when I focused my attention on the lights I was able to pull off to the right without any problem. From this vantage point I was able to witness the object in the sky and it appeared to be quite large, triangular in shape, and black. It had large lights on it&rsquo;s underside, at least three white and one red. It also had one small blinking light. It hovered over the lake making no sounds discernible from my car. It moved with a pivoting action as it reached the shores of each part of the lake and It moved in the direction of each corner as if it had no designated front. It traveled slowly and at no time did I see it accelerate beyond that constant speed. Motivated by curiosity I decided to go to higher location on another nearby road that overlooked lake.

But while looking at the object I noticed there was no trail behind, I also saw that within the yellow glow that there was a very distinct disk shaped craft with a darker center (very solid looking).  I only observed it for about one to one and a half seconds max.The object appeared to stop, or rapidly slow down, at one point in midflight, (for a mille second) and continue its flight at the same rate of speed, maybe around 100,000mph.  I observed it flying at an altitude of 400-500 ft., moving silently, no noise at all , traveling in a straight path from the SSE towards the NNW.  I estimated its size to be about 250ft across. In the time I saw the object it appeared to clear about 30-50 miles (within 1-1.5 sec.).Unfortunately neither my friend, who was searching for his phone, nor the bum in the park could confirm my sighting, to my knowledge I am the only person who had seen the object.I am a custodian with the Pittsburgh Public Schools, a very &quot;normal&quot; person.

I looked out of the window, near the center of Houston, TX, looking to the east, and saw a light that looked somewhat like a blinking star. As I looked, it seemed to have different colors as it blinked. I also noticed that it didn&apos;t look hazy as if it were blinking from clouds passing by. My brother and my girlfriend came out, saw the same thing, but we all thought it could possibly be an airplane.After about 5 min or so, the light was still in the same place in the sky, not seeming to get closer or further away. It looked extremely far away (remember, I compared it to a star at first, so I&apos;d say it was some miles away). We got some very cheap binoculars and looked at it again. At that point, all 4 of us that were there all saw the same thing.The light was moving around very fast, not seeming to be traveling anywhere, but just dancing around all different patterns in the same vicinity. The light was also not just red and green, but all different colors, constantly changing. I noticed that while I was watching, 2 planes flew by, about 3 min apart from each other, but they didn&apos;t go anywhere near the object or even in its direction.

I was with my friend and had a sudden impulse to go lay outside in the back yard with some binoculars to look at the stars. We took a blanket and were laying down for a few minutes when something at lightening speed zipped above us no more than 20 feet in a north to south direction. It seemed like a small object but it appeared and was gone within half a second, it almost seemed like a rocket. We were both saw and heard it and almost discounted it until we realized shared details of what we experienced. We heard a faint &apos;whizzing&apos; sound as it zipped overhead. The second experience was much more profound and happened a few minutes later. As we discussed the first incident, we noticed about 7-9 lights coming from the south towards the north. There were unlike any lights I have ever seen, they weren&apos;t bright, somewhat hazy. At first I thought it was a flock of birds but then I realized there was no flapping, and that I wouldn&apos;t see birds so clearly at this hour and at that altitude. Suddenly the lights took a V SHAPE formation as it passed above us in total silence.That was the most shocking part. It seemed like a giant triangle gliding silently at the edge of the clouds, it seemed quite large. I grabbed my binoculars and looked at it and saw that the lights had a strange geometric shape to them that were identical in each light. (I created an image file that I can email with this submission) I couldn&apos;t tell if it was one UFO with 9 lights or 9 lights in a V formation. All we could do was keep exclaiming &apos;oh my god what is that?&apos; over and over as we watched it disppear on the north horizon.

I happened to wake up shortly after midnight and observed through a west-facing window, a very odd single bright rapidly-flashing white light in the distance above the trees. At first the light appeared stationary, almost like a firework then it moved to the southeast.  The flashing was noticeably quick and in a pattern, not like a typical plane.  I woke up my husband who also saw the light through a south-facing window.  The color of the light changed from white to a brunt reddish color.  The light was moving at an unremarkable speed when it changed directions and accelerated upward to the northwest out of view. The window was open but there was no sound associated with the activity.

I looked at it, and noticed a red flash come from it. I stopped in the middle of the road, and watched the light but it wasn&apos;t moving. I was about to just start driving again when the red light started flashing again. I thought the only normal thing that it could be was a helicopter above the lake, so I kicked it to the lake to see if it was a helicopter. Helicopters have been known to land down at the lake to life flight a wreck victim from the bridge, so I knew how loud a helicopter would be so I lowered my window to see if I could hear something, but there was no sound. I crossed the bridge,(Neil&apos;s Bridge) and stared at what looked like a skinny long object with two long blue lights in the middle and a red light at one end and a white light a the other. I stopped on the side of the road when I was across the bridge, and watched the lights just sit about a hundred feet above the lake. I climbed out the widow to look over the roof of the car, and it flew off over the trees in the direction I had come from.Tullahoma! I then drove back towards town, but I could only see lights off in the distance. There were about four sets of red and white lights going across the sky, so I have no idea what I saw. I can only assume it was something from the air base that is about thirty miles from my house. I don&apos;t believe in aliens, so I believe it was something man made. Probably an experimental aircraft.

This is the second sighting she has witnessed in the Newtown Square area. She is an excellent observer. I was on the phone with her during the time it happened. It was around 9:30 pm to be exact. Looking due south she observed the thin cloud layer being parted at a high rate of speed. She tells me that the object itself looks football shaped from her vantage point and it was translucent like a frosted glass. She could make out the dark sky through it but could see enough of the object to see it was there. It was moving twice the speed of a commercial jet liner. It was cutting the clouds until she could no longer see it. For the record, her first sighting was much more dramatic than this one. I was at work and she called me very scared from inside our parked car behind the apartment complex (same area from which she saw this recent one). She told me she just saw a UFO. The object was literally in town. Newtown Square is about a 40 minute drive from Philly&apos;s edge. Pike&apos;s (or major streets) run away from the metropolitan area in a grid (somewhat). West Chester Pike links outside Philly to West Chester, PA. So it&apos;s a pretty well travelled road even early in the morning. This is why it&apos;s a wonder that this craft would make itself so apparent. The obect was seen (my guess) about a football field away from where she was. Nothing blocked her sight of it. It was about 3 am and she was watching the dog in the back yard. The back yard consists of a parking lot for tenants and a grass area that runs up to a fence. Standing on the egde of the grass looking towards the south the lights of the object caught her eye. She said it may have come from overhead, it was travelling east and slowed down over the town and descended perhaps half of a football field and hovered over the top of a bank that sits on an intersection in town. The underside of the object was lit up from the sulphur street lights but since cloud coverage was so low, the street light bounced back down and slightly lit the top of the craft up as well. It was egg shaped and possibly a white to off-white color because of the way the light lit it up. There were two sets of rotating lights that were possibly around the entire vehicle. One set(row) was on the bottom and one(row) was towards the top. She says that from what she could see of the craft there were four lights visible in each row, whether the lights went all the way around the craft, she didn&apos;t know. The lights looked as if they were pulsing in patterns counterclockwise around the object? That&apos;s assuming the lights went all the way around it. She says the object hovered there for 15 to 20 seconds then moved behind ! some tre es. At that point she jumped into our car with the dog and locked the doors until she could calm down (which took some time) and then fled back into the apartment. That&apos;s when she called me to report her sighting. This happened last February &apos;07.", "red shapes shooting across the skyI witnessed four spherical shapes come towards me slowly, then shoot away.

At this time we grabbed a pair of binoculars but it still looked just like a very bright blue spot. Also, it wasn&apos;t always a constant light. It would pulsate, sometimes very brightly. When it started moving again, it was moving fast and due south until we lost sight of it.", "3 different objects in th sky Norwalk.CAAt 18:20 My wife and I were swimming in the pool and I caught a shining object in the sky east direction.

Our vision was restored with in seconds. The object was not seen then. And about 5 to 8 minutes another object passed by about 400 to 600 feet away and about 7 stories high. It was flying low and close that it shocked us. We were startled and confused. The object that was flying low and it was a donut/oval shape with a dent or a donut hole shape middle. It was wobbling  and flying in a straight line. The object was a satin silver metallic with a slight change in color at bottom. It was flying at around 15mph from south to north. And about a size of a SUV or bigger. It was 18:35 when that happened and then we could not find it in the sky. About 5 minutes later we both saw the same shining wobbling object in the sky again. The first one we&apos;ve seen wobbling and shining going east and gaining altitude. And again it disappeared. I got out of the pool and ran to see where it was and was not found. The low flying object was hovering in flight and wobbling . It was wobbling in a way like a top. But like if it was wobbling on an axis. My wife saw a red glow below the object.

Easter Standard Time on May 24th I looked out my window and saw a strange light flashing in the sky. I went outside to get a better view and what I saw was a bright flashing light that was not moving but hovering quietly. It began flashing blue lights and it flashed them in sequences. It would flash a light every second for three seconds and at the third second count it would hold for a longer period of time become very bright and then dim away for a few seconds before starting again. It then seemed to turn and move up and to the left. It stayed in that place and continued blinking and then it would seem to go far away and then appear again. I ruled out any chance of it being a star or an aircraft and after doing this and moving quickly to different positions it stopped completely and went out of sight. My neighbor looked at it and also saw it.

F. Bay in high atmosphere, momentarily stationaryOn Sunday June 8, 2008 my friend and I had just gotten out of a local museum, and were lying in the grass in Union Square (downtown San Francisco) from about 4-5:15 pm soaking up some sun. As we were lying there chatting, I noticed what I first thought were balloons (or a balloon) directly up into the sky close to the position of the moon.  After watching it for about five minutes wondering what it was, I determined that it wasn&rsquo;t moving around like balloons might on a windy day at high altitude (it&rsquo;s been fairly windy in S.F. these past few weeks), and it was also too close to be a star or planet.   I finally pointed it out to my friend, and he also suggested it was a balloon. As we continued chatting, the object slowly began to pick up slight velocity drifting towards the horizon (towards the south), away from the position of the moon.  After about 10 minutes of drifting, the object appeared to look like a hyphen (it looked like a ball before), and I pointed this out to my friend.  Eventually we lost track of the object, and kept on with our conversation. A few minutes later, I again looked back up towards the moon, and the object (or another object) reappeared to the location where we saw the first object.  I again pointed it out to my friend, and we both thought it was odd that earlier it had slowly drifted towards the south, and was now instantly right back where it started.  We left shortly after, not thinking too much about the whole thing. The reason why I am posting this is because this morning on the news there was a short segment on an object that was observed (by whom I don&rsquo;t know) Sunday afternoon over San Francisco Bay, and the news clip featured a video of the same object that we had seen.  The segment didn&rsquo;t say much about what the object was, just that the F.A.A. had taken notice.  I am assuming many people had seen it if it had been featured on the Monday morning news, and was described on the news to have moved from above one city to another. From my own observations, I can describe the object as white (non-metallic), not emitting light, larger than the size of Jupiter or Venus in the night sky, and fairly circular (upon our first observation).  The object appeared stationary at first (the object did NOT get smaller as a balloon would upon rising), but later drifted across the sky (faster than planets and stars appear to move at night, but much slower than man-made satellites move).  The object did not appear to change change size as it moved away, but did appear to look more liner as it drifted away.  It was definitely not an airplane (it was close enough so that we could resolve its outlines and determine a circular shape from our perspective), and looked very solid. The whole experience did not seem very normal, and I am greatly wondering how many other people saw it, and what it may have been.", "Loring AFB 1975 SightingLoring A.F.B.http://www.nicap.org/ncp/ncp-loringafb.htm   I was the Air Force Officer (rank of Captain and B-52 Aircraft Commander) in charge in the Command Post at the 42nd Bomb Wing at Loring A.F.B the first night of this sighting.  Many of the details of the night have been forgotten, but I haven&rsquo;t forgotten that it happened.  I do remember being on duty and receiving a call from Security and was told that there was a bright white light hovering over the primary entrance to the base.   Many of the typical calls that we received could be handled with the use of a binder full of checklist.  That way the Wing Staff wouldn&rsquo;t have to be disturbed in the evening and could be briefed in the morning.  It didn&rsquo;t take too long to realize that we didn&rsquo;t have a checklist that applied to the information being given to us during this call.  We were told that the bright white light was stationary and there was no engine noise.  I promptly notified the Wing Commander and he appeared at the Command Post in a very short amount of time.  These sightings went on for many of the following nights that I worked.  Many of the following nights the Command Post would have the usual two Controllers plus several of the Wing Staff members.  One night as I was getting off my work shift we received a call that another sighting had been made.  We were not able to see these sighting ourselves because there were no windows in the Command Post.  The Wing Commander asked me to take his Staff Car and take the Helicopter Pilot to his aircraft.  That was the first sighting that I actually made of this bright white light.   It appeared to be hovering over the runway from where I was standing but this also could have put it over the weapons storage area.  I dropped off the Helicopter Pilot and watched him takeoff towards the object that we had been watching.   I saw it leave very rapidly as he approached it.  It left so rapidly that it almost would appear that it had simply turned its light off.  That is not what happened because I could detect a very rapid motion from a standstill.  This accelerat! ion was faster than any that I had ever seen before or since.  I know there was much effort during the days that followed to try and gather information about possible landing sites in the area.  Airports were checked for transient aircraft landings and fuel purchases.   Fields and wide riverbeds were also considered.  No information was ever collected that I am aware of that would verify that this was just some kind of aircraft/balloon/helicopter/hoax as we know it.  Needless to say, I only had and needed access to information that pertained to the performance of my job as a Command Post Controller.  I can say that as far as I know, this sighting remained Unidentified, it was Flying and it was an Object.  So, I can refer to this as a UFO but I can&rsquo;t make any conclusion of its origin/destination/intentions.   I believe that Approach Control was able to track the object with radar as I recall.   I can&rsquo;t confirm much of the other information that I have read but I do know what took place where I was working.   It was a very impressive sighting and would be quite hard to believe unless you were there and saw it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

The reason why I can be sure of this, was due to the time of year.  The end of the first week &amp; beginning of the second week of August is the time of year when we get a lot of &apos;shooting stars&apos;  My girlfiend &amp; I drove from Longueil, (just south of Montreal) to Bromont, approx 45 minutes east of Montreal, to get away from the light pollution, so we could see the shooting stars better. We were parked near Mont Shefford, a small ski hill.  While watching the sky for shooting stars, we observed a formation type craft. There were several sections to it, however, it was a completely connected structure. It was large, about the 3/4 size of a football field.  It moved slowly across the sky (unknown in what direction).  There was no sound, complete silence. There were no bright lights on the object, however the object was brighter than the night sky, so I would say it was dimly lit. (I do not know if I should answer below if there were lights on it or not)  It is difficult to determine the distance from the ground to the object.  Minimum 2500 feet, probably more. Our initial reaction was that we were looking at the the International Space Station. That was the only logical explanation we could come up with.  This theory was dismissed by a speaker at the Dow Planetarium in Montreal when we asked him if it was possible to see the Space Station from the ground.  We described the object to him, and he quizzicaly looked at us.  It was as if he knew what we had seen, but he would not elaborate on it. Note:  I am in the process of moving.

The facility is on the high ground about a mile from the road.I noticed a bright shaft of light above this facility. I thought at first it might be a helicopter inspecting the transformers. The light was extremely bright and well defined. There was no sound.I then realized that it was too wide for a normal spotlight - possible 100 feet wide.The light then acted in a manner not possible with our technology. Still bright with well defined boundaries it began to slowly withdraw upward.  The object that it was withdrawing into was not visible.Light in our technology is either on or off. A light beam as we know it cannot slowly withdraw. The light boundaries were too well defined to be a natural phenomenon.

Increasing in brightness, with red / purple strobe light, appearing and disappearingI was on lunch break during the night shift when a friend pointed a light in the west/north sky that resembled a star. He said he noticed it about half a month ago, in the same spot in the sky.  He also said several people in the city have been talking about it. Looking toward the sky, I saw a faint star that became brighter until it was a very bright white light above the horizon, but not as high to be a plane. The size seemed to increase, but that may only be because the brightest increased.  The the light disappeared. Within the half hour, the light continued to appear and disappear several times. On its reappearance, it was accompanied by a red light that appeared to be revolving around the white light. And there also appeared to be a purple-ish light. It was like stobe lights. When we went outside again for break, two hour later, the lights could be seen again, white bright and reddish and purple, appearing and disappearing.  The location of the lights moved slightly more north in the sky. Later this date at 23:30 est, I checked the sky and saw only the bright white light.

I had only driven a few hundred yards when I noticed a very bright white light off in the horizon, north east of my car.  At first I didn&apos;t think anything of it, assuming it was  some kind of airplane tower or something of that sort. After a few moments I started to notice that whatever this thing was had not one bright light but three lights and was starting to move in my direction. It took a second for me to realize that it wasn&apos;t anything I had ever seen before! The only thing that I could think of was to get some kind of footage of this object. I pulled my car to the shoulder of the road and as I did so I noticed two other cars  on the opposite side of the highway do the same thing. One of the persons got out of their car while the other remained inside theirs. I sat in complete astonishment that this was actually happening as the object glided toward the ground at my car. It traveled the distance from the horizon to above my car so fast I didn&apos;t even have time to blink! I watched as this now quite visible equilateral triangle (with a semi-circle cut out in the back) flew a matter of 10 to 15 feet above my car.  The object must have been about twice as long and twice as wide as my car and emitted no sound but had three lights on the bottom,  one in each corner of the triangle. The lights seemed to be streaming down like strobe lights until it banked onto its side. When it did this, I got a clear view of the bottom and noticed that the lights were about the size of a dinner plate. That&apos;s when I got out of my car and grabbed my cell phone to try to shoot some footage of it. Just as I found the video recorder on my phone and started recording, the object moved  over the trees and shot out of view in a south western direction.

I pushed away the curtains to let some light in. I decided to take a look outside.  When I was looking down the street, something caught my eye.  In the corner of my eye, there was a white dot.  I looked up into the sky to see a figure floating above.  At first I thought was a plane or blimp, but then I made out its shape.  It was very odd looking. It was in the shape of a mailbox.  Its main color was white. Even though the figure was far away, it was pretty big.  From how far away it was, it was about the shape of a labrador retreiver.  But if it was close up, it would be bigger than that.two thin black lines went across it and made an X on the flying object.  The thin X overlapped a cross shape on the object with two thick red lines. It went at the same speed as a plane, but then it swerved sharply to the left.  It passed by my window after two minutes.

These objects were observed with the naked eye. Their initial appearance is a star in the sky; however, I viewed what appeared to be flashing lights which were red, yellow and blue. It appeared in a pattern of blue, yellow, and red. At first, I figured they were helicopters. After viewing these objects evening after evening, I used a low end set of binoculars to view these objects. I viewed serpentine shaped structures moving like a serpent. A program recently played on the history channel &quot;UFO Hunters&quot; played an episode of a video recording of a similar structure filmed by a local resident. One must realize I had never viewed the program until after my observations of two to three months. I have used a method using reference points in regards to the objects which proved to be moving, but not in the traditional sense of UFO&apos;s. I am not for sure if it is an aircraft or living organism. I have reently purchased a telescope and have viewed these objects. These objects are pie shaped which is evenly segmented into an estimated 10+/+ slices. The color is opaque with which has the appearance of electrical flashes and the three light spectrums are viewed. It appears to be spinning. They do not move rapidly across the sky (appearance of yellow stars on first observation, then one can view the three flashing colors if paying attention)), but sometimes move out of the telescope fixed and locked position. I must adjust the telescope fixed and locked settings to re~obtain the object in the viewing lens. This supports the object is moving. The objects can move vertical or horizontal and are there for up to 4 to 6 hours. There is always very active chemtrail activity; however, my chembusters have provided me views of the objects while the skies are complete haze around my vicinity.

I was sitting in the front next to the driver and another passenger a young woman (around 26 yrs old) was sitting behind me at the back-seat. As we were crossing that highway I saw a motionless light-ball in front of us about 200-250 high and about 200 meters ahead. Let me point something here: Since a similar sighting of a couple of years earlier, I keep gazing in the sky when I&rsquo;m in a car with someone. It was about the same timing but for a longer time, me and my brother were stuck in heavy traffic between Carantina and Dora when we noticed two still orangey Light-balls ahead of us in traffic about 250-300 meters above the horizon but looked much farther, about a km or a little less. We pointed and some people in close-by cars noticed them too. We kept guessing if it could possibly be artificial lighting over a high building or a road light but it sure wasn&rsquo;t. The pair were too high above the horizon and after a while one moved towards the other and they started moving up and down and left and right in short sharp swift manner which exclude the possibility of a normal helicopter, they were too fast and froze too quickly when they stopped. Let me get back now this late sighting of last year, here it was motionless and grabbed my attention and excitement clearly so I showed it to the driver and then the girl at the back, they were both amazed by the strange nature of a frozen motionless glittering fire ball in the sky, it looked small but appeared like a ball not a point and felt too close. By the time the taxi driver had the chance to pull over on the right side of the highway we became exactly underneath it. The three of us got our heads out of the windows and looked at it from beneath. I remember the girl sayi! ng &ldquo;we&rsquo;r e exactly under it now, please move forward before something falls down on us!&rdquo;. My best guess is that it was 200-300 meters above us now, looked 2x larger than before, fiery orange to yellow light sphere. The second the driver stepped on the gas and moved forward it gradually but rapidly darted straight towards the opposite way we were heading and that is towards Ras-Beirut (Hamra) gaining ultra speed. I kept my head out and my eyes pointed at the thing, as it first accelerated when the car was about to move, it started glittering and then as it gained speed it started blinking more, as it sped very fast reaching probably the shoreline over &ldquo;Manara&rdquo; it blinked faintly and disappeared. The time it took from acceleration to disappearance is no more than 4 seconds. The three of us were startled with what we saw and guessed that it might be some advanced Israeli unmanned reconnaissance droid which I doubt it because why does it shine so bright if it&rsquo;s supposed to be sneaking discretely for sound or image?

It was a very dark night, few clouds in the sky.  He saw the lights first and so saw them a bit before pointing them out to me.  I recall the lights being higher up than a jet would fly but moving very quickly across the sky.  I remember thinking that there was no way that an object that high up could be moving that fast - at least a man made object.  The lights were perhaps as bright as one of the planets (Mars or Jupitor). I recall - all these years later the three objects (lights) moving as a triad together across the heavens.  After a few minutes (maybe three) they stopped at the zenith of the sky and stayed there just a moment.  Then one zoomed off at a very high rate of speed (no way it could have been a man made craft)in one direction; seconds later a second one went off in a different direction; and then seconds later the third went off in another direction.  I remember looking us looking at each other and saying - did we really just see that?  Since then, I&apos;ve been an avowed UFO believer.  We had not been drinking or using drugs.  The following is what my friend remembers - it is not prompted except to ask him what he recalled. The best I can remember, I think it was during the summer of 1976.  I have pictures of you visiting in my photo album, in storage, of that trip.   I could dig them out and see at least what month and year it may have taken place.  I believe that was the summer my grandparents were adding on the new kitchen to the old green house.We were riding bikes up and down Ranch Road 1120 between Leakey and Rio Frio.   It was about 9:30 at night.  We had stopped briefly to rest.We both looked up at the stars.  A few minutes later, I saw a bright light come from the west, another from the east and another from the north.  They were probably (wild ass guess) 15,000 miles up.What caught my attention was that they were coming at a high rate of speed from the three directions. They all came to a point and then came to a complete stop together (from our perspective).  After about 60 seconds, they suddenly shot off into different directions at a high rate of speed.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

My first encounter with the aliens took placed several years ago.  They took me to their galaxy that had 5 suns and several planets, which I was able to see from their spaceship.  Since our galaxy only has one sun, I was astonished to see so many suns in just one galaxy.  I don&rsquo;t recall ever getting out of the spaceship; the whole trip was just like a &ldquo;tour&rdquo; through the universe.  They were green aliens, very short, not with the usual configuration depicted in Roswell, NM.  Their heads were wide, mostly by the cheeks area and they were very nice to me. My most recent encounter was with just one alien.  This one had pink skin and came-up in a small gray color spaceship.  His head had a light bulb shape and he was skinny.  He told me via mind communication that it was time for me to go with them for good.

He said he saw it disappear and reappear multiple times. He also saw it moving quickly in different directions. The entire time it was an orange light.

I&apos;m located in the Mission Hills, and noticed a very loud noise, assuming it to be an aircraft.However, it did not fly over as usual, and considering we have no airport I was perplexed. I looked out the window and assumed that it was a helicopter of some sort. However, the flight pattern and speed was unlike any helicopter, and I fail to understand why a helicopter would be in near barren hills.The aircraft made several rounds, rather than concentrating a search if it was for a search, and upon closer direct inspection it had no helicopter blades and thus was not a helicopter. However, it did have the ability to levitate. The craft was in sight for around 20 minutes, circling around a few times and eventually leaving. I do have some video off of my camera phone that I can provide. If you could provide an explanation, it would be appreciated, but as far as I am concerned, I cannot explain what I saw. This occurred at about 12:30am tonight in Fremont. There was two bright lights, one on front and back, and a bluish light.Thanks.", "light that sits stationary and moves erraticllybackground fairly clear, no real cloud cover.  the light just seems to move in swaying motions up and down, side to side.  have been referencing it&apos;s location from stationary objects just to try to make sure that it is really moving.  woke my wife and she said it seem to be moving as well.  just really weird.((NUFORC Note:  Probably a star or planet, we suspect.

I was 16 years old at the time and was walking along the edge of a soybean field with my trusty .22 rifle squirrel hunting. I heard a very loud high pitched buzzing sound (like a cicada in the trees--which it may have been) but then everything was silent--even the birds. I looked up over my shoulder and saw a silver sphere just hovering about 300 feet above the ground and 1/4 mile away. It just stayed there. I thought, &quot;hey look, a weather balloon.&quot; but there wasn&apos;t anything hanging from the bottom. Not a weather balloon. No gondola, so it also wasn&apos;t a hot air balloon either. It was just there hovering silently. Here&apos;s where I acted like a typical teenager. The .22 had a scope on it, so I looked at the sphere through the scope--looked like a shiny silver ball. I decided, &quot;what the heck&quot; I squeezed off a shot thinking if it was a balloon, I would be able to retrieve it. It hovered for a few seconds more then slowly drifted up and out of sight. There were cumulus clouds in the sky that day and the sphere was going along the edge of them rising in a slightly erratic fashion. But I was able to keep it in sight while it rose due to the contrast of the white clouds. The thing that still makes me wonder to this day is how readily I accepted what I saw and how I felt no alarm((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

It&apos;s coloration was divided in half, the front half being red/orange and the back half blue. It was glowing like neon. I was driving about 55 mph at the time. The object hovered for about ten to fifteen seconds before rapidly flew forward and out of sight in less than a second. I stopped at the first gas station and called the Sherrif&apos;s office to report the sighting. All that was said to me was that they had several calls already, and that my sighting would be noted. I have only told a few people about this over the years, but saw a show about UFO&apos;s on television recently, and thought I might as well make this report.", "The craft moved too much to be an airplane and it made certain moves that make it not man made.Well, frist of all I&apos;d like o say that I&apos;m very scared because ever since April the 1st of the year 2005, I saw what looked to me to be an alien craft, since that day i keep seeing it over and over every year on the same day exept for this day. Well, this time i was smart enough to call over my sisters to have some witnesses. This is how it happened i had come home from school and i went to go check on the dogs that we have, well the moment i went out there i felt has if something was wathching me and i loocked up and saw a small object preety high up in the air i was suprised and i started to think its gotta be an airplane or a ballon or something and then i started to remember about what happened one year ago and two years ago on the same day. It acted almost the same has the one from last time. It moved around pretty fast and it keept going back and forth, thn after probably 5 minutes i called my sisters and told them look i see it agian look come before it leaves. when they came they were like i dont see anything?? And then they looked closely and one by ione started seing the object. But then something more strange happened we saw one appear alomost alkl of a sudden they looked like they were close to each other aligned but then one would go ahead of the other, it was creepy and scary cause we started thinking that maybe more would appear and would see us. The object seemed silvernad round or oval shaped i couldn&apos;t figure it out cause ti was so high up in the air. Now one thing is for sure this were not an aircraft because aircraft or airplanes cannot go back and forth or make a turn in mid air, a ballon would leave out of sight, and another thing that day wasnt so windy at all, it was mostly clear. All i can say is i cant explain what i saw and i am always going to keep that question in my mind till i fnd answers.", "Slow moving odd shaped object flying on hitt lane in goodlettsville, tnI was driving down Hitt lane heading towards Old Dickerson Pike. Upon Turning onto the road from Brick Church Pike, my passenger and I witnessed a slow moving craft just above the tree line. At first, it seemed as if it was car headlights on top of a hill (there is a hill that you are facing as soon as you turn onto Hitt lane from brick church pike). As i drove closer to the hill, it turns beside it with a tree line to the right(in the direction that i was moving). The lights i saw ontop of the hill had moved down the hill towards me. I looked up out of my driver side window, and i saw an odly shaped craft that was moving slower that me, it seemed, in the opposite direction. My window was down and the radio was not turned on. This said, i heard no noise personally. Again, this object with lights was not shaped like anything that i have wittnessed. It was only 50 feet (at most) above my head. The best way that i can describe this is a craft with rounded backward wings. it had a spade like tail. I wish i could draw something on this description to help. It was not like my normal idea of what a space ship would look like. The most important aspect to make me believe that it was something Unidentified is the fact that it was only above the tree line, Moving extemely slow (i think slower than 40 mph), and most of all, it made no noise. (even a helicopter would have been loud at that altitude). To be honest, it freaked me out a bit. So, i didn&apos;t stick around to see which way it went. But It headed towards brick church pike when i drove off. I don&apos;t remember the exact date, but i know it was between saint patrick&apos;s day and the end of march.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

What caught my attention was a bright light up and southward, I said &ldquo;wow that sure is a big bright star&rdquo; after looking at it about 2-3 seconds it started moving south for about 3-4 seconds then it stopped for 1-2 seconds then started moving again for about 2-3 seconds then stopped again for 1-2 seconds,  at that time I was right outside the door so I rushed in to grab my binoculars, because that was just weird, which took about 3 seconds, when I came back out and looked at it was still moving south for about 4-5 seconds then got dim real quick and disappeared.

We keep up to date on these sightings and talk about the subject often.  Earlier in the evening, we had discussed what took place at the Surry powerplant just a week or two ago.During the early morning of June 3rd, 2008, My friend and I were out in the street observing what we believed to be either Venus or Jupiter (I can&apos;t remember which) in the South-Western sky through my telescope.  After observing for a short while, we began to joke around and just look at the stars.A few minutes later my friend alerted me to the sky directly overhead, where there was a faint moving object.  Upon inspection with my 10x50 binoculars, I was able to observe the object move smoothly across the sky, and then fade away.  It appeared to be very high, and shone like a dim star.  We have witnessed these objects in the past.  We decided to lay on the ground and look at the sky to see if anything else happened.We were both looking at the same area in the sky when a bright, but focused flash of light occurred, which we both observed.  I quickly inspected the area with my binoculars just in time to observe another object, this one a little brighter than the last.  It also faded away after a short period of around 20 seconds.  A few minutes later there was another flash in the same area of the sky (to the North East), but this time I was not able to observe an object.A short time later, we witnessed what I can only describe as a &quot;skipping&quot; bright light flashing across the sky.  The light flashed brightly for a moment while moving extremely fast across the sky.  It was not a meteorite, as the object flashed, and then flashed again further along its path, and then flashed 3 more times as it flew further away (from the southwest to the northeast).  It was at this point that my friend&apos;s brother (just inside the house nearby) called to see what we were doing outside.  We told him of the situation, and he came out quickly.No activity was present for a while, so we again observed Venus/Jupiter.  After a few minutes, I had a very strange urge to look at the sky.  I looked up to the north almost directly overhead and witnessed a bright spherical object, as bright as the brighter stars in the sky, moving to the south.  I observed it in the binoculars.  All 3 of us observed it as it crossed overhead.  At the moment it was nearly above us, the object&apos;s light increased greatly in intensity, at least 2 or 3 fold, until it was the brightest star in the sky, and then dimmed back out.  It was around for the longest duration of all of the objects, 30 seconds or more.  My friend and I were almost ecstatic at the sighting, as we had been waiting for something like this for quite a while.My friends and I are active observers of the sky.  We often sit out at night and watch for phenomena like these.  We have never witnessed anything like what we saw this evening.  We have witnessed a few faint objects before, but nothing conclusive.  These objects were unlike any others that we have seen in the night sky.  Interestingly enough, we often go out to the Colonial Parkway across from the Surry Powerplant to lay on the grass and observe the sky (we have witnessed objects in the sky there, but nothing like what was reported recently).  After the events of late, the sky is sure to get more attention around here.I hope this report proves interesting.  I will be keeping my eyes out for any new developments.  It seems that things are increasing in intensity here.  I appreciate this site greatly.  Thank you for maintaining it.", "Strange glowing redish orange light hovering over 88th Avenue in Tinley Park, ILAfter reading an article in the local Tinley Park newspaper and viewing an NBC Dateline TV story on UFO&apos;s, I have decided to report an incident that I also witnessed in Tinley Park.  I live in Tinley Park in the vicinity of 173rd and 88th Ave.  My house and the glass patio doors face 88th Ave. While watching a Chicago White Sox world series game back in October, 2005,  I noticed a dull and pulsating redish orange glowing light coming in through the glass patio doors.  At first I thought it might be a police car giving someone a traffic ticket or a fire truck that parked on the street, but I heard no sound, it was quit eerie  After about 6 minutes or so I looked out the patio doors, but could not see any police car or fire truck, and the light was still there and seemed to cover the entire block.  The light pulsated slowly and the view of the street seemed a little misty or foggy.  I next heard a low sounding buzzing or humming and about one minute later the light was gone.  It did appear that the light was moving very slowly to the southwest before it vanished.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Last night, June 14, 2008, My Husband and I saw two red &ldquo;balls of light&rdquo;.        I stepped outside at approximately 11:00 P.M. and immediately noticed two red lights in the sky where there aren&rsquo;t usually any.        From where we are, they appeared to be over Elko, Nevada,  to the East and South of the Airport.    We have often watched incoming airplanes at night and they appear to stay in nearly the same place for long periods although they are coming closer.    Their white lights just seem to gradually get larger.    The red lights never seemed to get larger or smaller as we watched.       When I hold my hand sideways, they were about 3 fingers high &ldquo;over&rdquo; the town.     Size  close to my smallest fingernail with arm outstretched.      I hollered at my husband to come see,  and we watched for awhile. We each went back inside several times to get the binoculars and to locate the scope,  and to get the camcorder and such.     ( One of us watching the lights while the other was inside).      The camcorder&rsquo;s battery was completely dead.     I tried to get a photo with the cell phone , but that didn&rsquo;t work either.      The lights stayed stationary for probably 16 minutes or so.     We also turned on the C.B. radio to see if any  truckers traveling on Interstate 80 were talking about them.  (nothing).     The last time that I went inside, the lights left while my husband watched.      He said that they appeared to go slowly higher and then towards the South East and out of sight.     I was only inside about a minute,  so they were not moving real slow.   I have watched airplanes leaving that stayed in sight for an hour or more.     I looked at the clock  and wrote  down the time at that point.  It was 11:16 P.M. Pacific time.            We had seen flares on the night of February 21, 2008, about 90 miles North of Elko.   The flares were orange, and there were 8 or 9 sonic booms as some fighter jets shot something out of the sky.       Something lit up brigh! tly behi nd a cloud, and it was &ldquo;daylight&rdquo; momentarily.    (We were driving on the highway and had pulled over to watch).      There is an airbase close by that area of Idaho, so it could have been some sort of training drill.      Our faces, particularly our eyes, were puffy, red and sore the next day. (My eyes stayed swollen for over a month).   We looked as though we had a sunburn, but without the usual outline of our sunglasses.     That same day,  Feb. 21,  early in the morning,  Wells, Nevada (50 miles East of Elko) had a 6.0 Earthquake.     The flares on the  night of Feb. 21, drifted downwards and Westerly and they sort of glowingly flickered like flares do.     The red lights on June 14 were different than those. We can&rsquo;t rule out some sort of celebration for flag day (however, NOT fireworks).    Maybe two VERY large, lighted, anchored balloons?      There is also a  NOAA station here.      Do the weather balloons have large red lights and get released at night?      Would they stay stationary for so long?       We don&rsquo;t know.     We have watched weather balloons being released before,  but in the daytime,  and they moved off rather quickly.         I read where you mentioned the space shuttle and International Space Station.     Maybe that&rsquo;s what it was.    Well, anyway, that&rsquo;s it for now.      We wanted to report it so as to validate if someone else reports the same thing.

The driver of the van we were in saw the UFO and said, &quot;That is why people believe in UFO&apos;s&quot; and then said, &quot;Look at that!&quot; Three of us saw the saucer to shaped UFO that filled the saddle between two mountains to the West. The fourth passenger is visually impaired and could not see the UFO. The UFO was up off the ground about 100 feet. It was the shape of two symmetrical wide shaped saucers with a small (1/3rd the size of the top side of the saucer) top hat looking top. The sides of the top were vertical and the very top was circular and flat. The coloration was a shade of silver that looked liked machined steel in coloration. There were no other visible markings, windows, lights, or anything else that wwere observable. It was daylight and the sun was shinning down on the top. On the bottom the UFO was dark but distinct against the skyline. The size of the UFO had to be very large. I am guessing the size of a WWII battleship but perhaps it was smaller. It filled the center of the saddle of two mountains about two miles away. The driver continued driving while we were trying to figure out what to do. We drove for about a minute with the UFO still in sight and we all began to pull out cell phone cameras. We pulled over and got out of the van but the UFO had moved North about ten miles away in one moment and stopped slightly above the horizon. By the time we took pictures it had moved again only slightly more Easterly direction and another ten miles or so away. The UFO was small but distinctive on the horizon about twenty miles away but could not be distinguished on my cell phone pictures. I would have made a report of something sooner if I had a good picture of this daylight sighting of a UFO but with all of the news about UFO&apos;s in West Texas, I thought it might be a good thing to report. I looked all over the internet to see if any of the pictures of UFO&apos;s matched the one we saw but none were the exact symmetrical shape or the top was rounded top where this UFO&rsquo;s very top was flat. I hope that reporting this helps. There was a tornado near Fort Davis on April 29, 2007. I doubt this is UFO related but I thought I would report it as well.", "Object seen over Harrington, WA on June 13, 2008Friday, June 13, 2008.  At approximately 11:10 PM Pacific Daylight Time, I saw a sub-orbital object traveling in a south to north trajectory. I first saw the object as it came into my peripheral vision as I was looking at the moon which was quite bright. The object passed to what was the east of the moon from my point of view and traveled towards a bright star just to the north of the moon. It traveled towards a smaller, less brilliant star located just west of, and below the brighter star and continued on this course for a distance that put it in line with another dim star whereupon it began to accelerate very rapidly. It continued to accelerate, and passed between the inner star of the handle of the big dipper, and the bottom star that forms&rsquo; the corner star of the bottom of the cup of the big dipper. As it passed through the intersection of the stars in the big dipper it accelerated fast enough that I lost sight of it. It was of a consistent size, speed and course trajectory before it accelerated and I lost sight of it. From the time I first saw it to the time I lost sight of it was approximately 45 seconds.((NUFORC Note:  This witness is well known to NUFORC.  He has over four decades experience in aviation, and considerable experience in the military.  A highly qualified witness, in our opinion.

It was being held outdoors on the football field with the audience facing west, toward the Front Range of the Rockies.  The morning was sunny with a very clear blue sky and a few scattered clouds, surprising since just two days earlier an unusual mile-wide tornado hit in nearby Windsor, CO and Friday had heavy thunderstorms throughout the area.During the speeches portion of the ceremony  I watched a Twin Otter skydiver jump plane climb out of Longmont Airport about a mile and a half north of the graduation location.  Within less than 10 minutes the aircraft climbed to over 12,000 ft. and I observed seven jumpers as tiny dots freefall from the aircraft and open their chutes about 2,000 feet above the airfield.  I watched as they manuvered their very colorful chutes as they descended until they drifted out of sight below buildings in the distance.The recitation of the name of graduates and the handing out of diplomas took quite some time as there were over 200 graduates.  During the hour long process the Twin Otter returned to Longmont Muni and picked up another load and climbed out again for another jump run.  At about 11:20 am as it made its high altitude pass over the airport I watched for the jumpers.  I saw one small dot exit the airplane and looked for more jumpers since they are hard to see initially at such altitude.  As I scanned the sky I spotted two more dots lower than the first one I saw.  I assumed they were also jumpers and I watched them for the deployment of the their chutes.As I watched the two dots, which looked identical to each other with white and dark markings, I realized they were not dropping but moving sideways at 3 to 4 thousand feet above the ground.  My thought was they were gliding in freefall, but as I continued to watch them they were moving further west, away from the airport drop zone.  Maybe they were birds I thought as they moved in relationship to one another, but no wings or flapping were evident.  I pointed them out to my 21 year old son seated next to me and asked what he thought they were.  As we continued to watch, it was clear they were not descending but moving further and further to the west, directly into the very brisk wind that morning.  At one point they maneuvered very close to each other, then apart again.  These two dots continue west toward the mountains and twice near the end, before they were lost to our vision due to distance, they turned and we each saw a glint of sunlight off of them.At this point we don&apos;t know what they were.  Obviously not jumpers, unless they had some special flying suit, but they moved several miles west and we never saw any chutes, plus they were in the air too long to be in any kind of free fall.  They could not have been birds due to the speed they were moving which appeared to be greater than 60 mph horizontally, and the metallic glint of sunlight from both of them in the distance does not occur with birds.As a pilot of both fixed wing and helicopters with 40 years of experience, I did not recognize them as any conventional aircraft.  There was no real discernible shape other than just a dot, as a jumper would appear in free fall, yet they moved independent of one another but continuously in the same direction, never more than about 500 feet apart, but sometimes closer. We watched for about 20 or 30 seconds until they disappeared in the distance.  I know these were not birds or waterfowl, due to the speed and lack of any wings.  Additionally ducks or geese will fly in tight formation to conserve energy and these were moving all about.Without any logical explanation of what these two items were, I can only call them a pair of true un-indentified flying objects.", "Bright white light viewed in Hubbard county going faster then satellite&apos;swell between 11:30 and 12:30 we saw a white light going faster then a satellite.

I was just fifteen years old at the time. Here is my terrifying experience! My twin brother was in the hospital which was located only a few blocks from my home. My aunt who lived across the street from me at the time wanted me to go with her so that she wouldn&apos;t be alone. My aunt was deaf so she didn&apos;t feel comfortable going by herself. We arrived at the hospital about 7:15pm. My aunt and I visited my brother for about 1-1/2 hours. At about 8:45pm when the sun was just about down we were on our way back home when all of the sudden something caught my eye in the northern sky. I looked up and saw two huge lights. The object was about 400-500 feet up in the air and as it started to pass over us I notice that it looked like an old World War II airplane. It was not what it appeared to be. First, there was no noise at all. It also seemed to be floating across the sky very slowly. It was NOT a blimp! If this was an airplane I surely would have heard something and if the airplane was flying that low it certainly would be moving much faster then the speed it was moving.When I seen this and realized this object was not what it appeared to be I became so frightened. I have never been so scared in my life before then or since. Anyway, I looked down because I didn&apos;t want to see this thing anymore. I grabbed my aunt&apos;s hand and tried to run, but she would not run. I couldn&apos;t leave her behind so I just held on to her hand tight and held my breath because I just knew we were going to be picked up by this craft. After what seemed forever I looked up and the object was gone. My aunt and I made it home alright and I told my family what happened, but they thought I was just seeing things. As far as my aunt goes, she didn&apos;t run because she couldn&apos;t hear and what she seen was an airplane to her although she did say that it seemed strange that it was moving so slow. She was also puzzled.After this happened I always closed my curtains in my bedroom and tried to stay inside when dusk came. I always felt that they would come back for me. I know this sounds crazy, but this event did happen.Thank you for letting me share my unforgettable experience with you.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Outside there were three bright orange lights to the west and seemed to all be travelling southwest at a constant speed. I spent about 3 minutes getting my video camera, then got a single lens binocular. Not much detail could be seen except the color, and they appeared to be moving southwest but also at an up angle as they were getting dimmer. There was another bright star near them so it seemed possible that this was already something very far away.

At first, there was one object that was oblong in shape with a like fiery pale halo of yellow and an oblong center toward the &ldquo;front&rdquo; of the object that was more orange.  It seemed very large and low.  No blinking lights appeared and it vanished off into the distance after a few minutes.  It never paused.  About ten - fifteen minutes later, two more objects that seemed smaller (and maybe higher) but with the same description appeared.  They seemed to be together but did not always remain side by side.  There were more than 15 people that saw the same event, that I am aware of.  I believe the direction of travel was somewhat North to South. There was no apparent movement other than their direction of travel.

We finished cleaning the fish at the fish cleaning station near what they refer to as the &ldquo;primitive campground&rdquo; and we were leaving the park driving west when my husband and I both noticed two bright lights off to the right side (north) of our vehicle, they resembled headlights on a car and the were both pointing straight towards the park that we had just left (east, the opposite direction we were driving at the time of the sighting), up above the trees at approximately at 150-200 feet into the air.  We looked at each other and said, &ldquo;What the hell is that?&rdquo; And both agreed that we had no idea, but we knew it wasn&rsquo;t an airplane or a helicopter because it was too low and it was just sort of hovering there.  He said to me, &ldquo;Get out your cell phone and take a picture!&rdquo;  So, I proceeded to get out my phone and I was starting to shake because it wasn&rsquo;t very far above the trees and who knows what might happen&mdash; all I could envision was this thing changing direction and pointing its lights at our vehicle.  I rolled down the electric window on our vehicle, but before I could point my camera phone and get the picture, it lifted into what looked like either a very, very low cloud or a type of haze or dry ice looking puff.  There wasn&rsquo;t any sound coming from this object at all, it was like dead silence. We could see the light within this cloud formation sort of glowing, but we kept on driving because he knew that I was scared and I think he was too.  I kept trying to look back at the location as we hit the main highway and headed home driving south on Mehaffey Bridge Road, but I couldn&rsquo;t see anything from that point on, not even the glow.(We both agreed that we would take a lie detector test if nobody believed us.  It was very bizarre.)", "We were surrounded by these UFOs.This occurrence happened in April of 1964 when I was 9 years old.  My parents and I were driving to an auction sale on a rural road outside of Bancroft, Michigan.  All of the sudden, my father pointed and remarked that we had a &quot;red light&quot; ahead of us and it was traveling at the same speed as were we.  I noticed that another red light was on the passenger side of our vehicle and then my mother noticed another on the driver&apos;s side of the vehicle.  All of these lights were keeping exact pace with our vehicle.  My father speeded up and the lights did, too.  He then slowed down to a crawl and the light did, too.  We all got scared and my father turned around at the nearest crossroad and we proceeded to drive back toward home.  The red lights stayed with us until we turned into our driveway and then shot straight up into the sky and disappeared.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

He called other higher ranking officers and chiefs to the upper bridge to observe. Though long ago, I still remember it as at about 30,000-40,000 feet altitude, and changed direction very rapidly. It moved about 3-10 degrees as viewed from sea level. As a lower rank enlisted person, I was not informed of what measures took place. It seems there was rumor or speculation that jets were scrambled from Hawaii to check it out. Not a great distance for tactical fighters to fly.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Nothing out of the ordinary but then I noticed a white object zig zagging back and forth behind the jet, moving in and out of the contrail. If I had to guess at the distance behind the jet, it would have been about a few thousand feet to as little as a few hundred. The object would suddenly increase in speed and catch up to the jet almost then back off, all the while zig zagging. It would move as far away as several thousand feet out of the contrail on either side of it as well. Then the object appeared to enter the contrail and move straight toward the jet. You could see the clouds/contrail actually be distorted by the object. This went on until I could no longer see the jet or the object and could only barely make out the contrail. It&apos;s  a bright sunny day (not a single cloud in the sky) so it made it hard to see as it got further away. I was to the point of being concerned that the object was going to catch and run into the jet. I&apos;m in a location that sees countless jets fly over during the day as they move out from atlanta to the northeast. I frequently can look up in the sky and see 8 or 10 of them at any given time but I have never seen anything like this.

It looked to be falling somewhere over the haymarket, possibly a bit north west from that area. The angle in which it was falling I would have to say was between a 20-30degree decline.

I live in northern Indiana in a town between South Bend and Elkhart.  Although it is close to town we live in an area where there is not a lot of city light, or other things like that.  The night sky is very clear and visible every evening, obviously unless it is cloudy, but anyways.  My background is that I have a small computer business, married, have two little boys a degree in computer science and am an amateur pilot who flies a lot in a Cessna 172 that my father-in-law owns, so I&rsquo;m not sure that I believe in UFO&rsquo;s or anything like that, but I know I have never seen anything like what I saw last night.I was outside watering flower pots at approx. 22:00, so it was completely dark.  There wasn&apos;t anyone outside but me and it was completely quiet except for crickets and birds, etc.  I happened to just be looking over at my neighbor&rsquo;s deck which was in a south-west direction from where I was standing.  I saw a reddish-orange oval float up over the top of the trees.  We have many very large old trees in our area, so I am guessing the oval was between 75-100 feet off the ground because of the distance it looked to be above the treetops.  It looked almost like there was a candle in the middle of it, but it did not flicker about 20-30 yards away.  It hovered for a few seconds then started moving slowly to the east.  It didn&rsquo;t look to be that large, but I couldn&rsquo;t really tell about the size of it because I wasn&rsquo;t sure how close it was or its size because of the glowing kind of haze around it.The object moved very slowly but steadily for a little ways and I thought it might be a balloon, but there was some variable light winds and it was not bouncing around at all, so I kind of dismissed that.  It also seemed to be moving in too straight a direction to be a balloon, but I don&rsquo;t know.  It was also strange and it might be paranoia, but I was sure that when it passed over the thick area of trees behind my neighbors home (that was only about 20 yards from where I was standing) that all of the noises of crickets and bugs and birds completely stopped.  You can always here the bugs and birds and other animals, day and night in our back yards because there are lots of trees and a large ravine behind our houses, so there are lots of animals, bugs, birds, etc.  The object then seemed to pick up speed as it moved to the east and I could see the light and shape very clearly for a another minute or so at least.  There was a full or mostly full moon in the background so the object stood out even more.  It then just disappeared from view completely after that and that was the end of it. I&rsquo;m kind of confused and not sure what it was, but maybe someone else saw something or knows what it was, but it wasn&rsquo;t anything I have ever seen before.

It appeared to be white or silver or to be illuminating very bright light from within (very bright, not the way any secret object would appear).We stopped, I took off my sunglasses and shielded my eyes from the sun with my hand. (The object was sitting stationary for the first four to five minutes we watched) At that time a jet with an exhaust trail crossed between us and the object. The object for a moment disappeared on the other side of the jet&apos;s trail of smoky exhaust. After the exhaust trail drifted away, we saw that the round and bright stationary object was still there and remained still.We sat down on the trail at that point to watch closely, to take in every detail. I looked around at the many people playing at the park just ahead of us up the trail to see if they were looking at it, but none were. I stopped a joger who passed us at that time. He didn&apos;t even look up, but dismissivly said planes can look all kinds of ways in the sky, and kept on jogging.Then, (and this is about four or five minutes after the initial sighting) the object started moving toward the east. I lost sight of it as it crossed nearly directly between the the sun and us. As it got further east we once again could see it. I called someone on my cell phone in an attempt to document the sighting. The person I called lives near by and could have video tapped it, but they were not home. It continued moving eastward and growing smaller in size as it was leaving. At that time another joger past whom I stopped and asked if he wanted to see something weird in the sky. He said he did so I pointed it out to him. He did see it before it disappeared, but it was much smaller by then, but still very bright. I told him it was almost gone. He commented that he could see it and that it was weird because it was so small and far away but was still bright, he thought it was unusual. But he didn&apos;t even see the the weird stuff I saw.It left our sight about six to eight minutes after the first view of it.

The funny thing was I didnt really care that much at the time but as the years go by I realize I saw something amazing. The first one happened in the fields outside of Cody on the Powell highway. A friend and I were driving back into Cody from Powell at around 10-11 pm. We were coming into town and all of a sudden a  bright set of two orange lights slowly lifted out of one of the fields off to the right of the highway.  They were obviously attached to some sort of craft and possibly the light from some sort of engine, similar to a helicopter taking off but it moved slower at first and than faster , it slowly rose up out of the field and shot into the sky gaining speed as it ascended. We were quite close , maybe within a mile of the object.  It was dark outside so I could not tell what shape the object was but it definitely had a solid mass to it. I would estimate the size to be about the size of a small to medium sized aircraft , perhaps 50 feet across. It had two orange lights that almost appeared to be rocket engines but not exactly. I could clearly see a huge cloud of thick exhaust coming from the object as it moved into the sky, illuminated by its own orange glowing &ldquo;engines&rdquo;. It was far to big to be a fireworks device or anything like that. It moved up in an arc but it rose up slowly , not really like a rocket, more like a helicopter. We were in a car and did not stop but we heard no noise which a helicopter that close would certainly have made.   The other strange thing about this is anyone from Cody knows this is only about a mile from the airport up on the hill. If this was a conventional aircraft why would it take off from a hayfield and not the airport, which was only a mile away?  I can not remember the exact date , I would guess this was April or May. The next sighting was about 8 months later in January. I lived in Wapiti and was driving home from Cody at night. It was eerie and very quiet that night and snowing lightly. As I was driving past the Buffalo Bill Reservoir. I noticed an extremely bright white light to the left of me in the sky maybe about 500 feet in the air directly over the reservoir. This time I stopped my car because I thought it was a helicopter with a search light looking for something in the water. I turned off my engine and stepped out of my car. To my amazement it was dead quiet outside and not a soul was around. Very spooky. I watched the light shining down through the snow and it was mesmerizing. It was a brilliant white , just like a very bright searchlight.  I watched it for a few minutes and then something even weirder happened. As I watched it it slowly faded out like someone turned down a dimmer switch and at PRECISIELY the same time another white light faded on about a mile away toward the dam. The two lights were unmistakably connected somehow because  exactly as one faded out the other came on, almost like the object just teleported to another location a mile away. I suspect it was two different objects that were coordinating their signals. . This actually scared me and I got in my car and left. I never heard a single sound at all. It was absolutely quiet. The lights never moved at all , they stayed hovering in the same spots the whole time. I have since talked to friends and two other people I know have seen similar things over the same reservoir.", "I would never have thought I would have so amazed by an object in small town USA in the middle of the night.I was dropping my sister in law off at home (which was on a golf course), when we exited the car we noticed this very large object to our left with brightly colored lights hovering over a tree.  We just stood staring at it for at least 20 minutes, I think we said a few things about what it could not have been and decided it must be a UFO, after about 20 minutes I told her to go and get her mom and I would watch the object.  It remained in the same place making no noise as it had been the entire time, when I heard the back door realizing they coming out I yelled it was there while turning towards thier direction and as I turned back towards the object it was gone.  No noise and no evidence it had even been there.  My sister in law and I tried to explain to my mother in law what we had seen and she tried to explain it away.  My sister in law and I discussed it in private many times after that and knew it could not have been a plane for many reasons, the lights were all wrong in color and a plane could not have held the same position for that period of time, not to mention the closeness to the tree, a helicoptor would defeinately have way to much noise and not have the lights.  These lights were bright red, yellow, and green.  The brighness of the lights are what held our amazement for so long.

At first, I thought perhaps it was a storm brewing and the sound was a result of the wind blowing through the trees.  As the sound continued, I got up to investigate.  I walked into the living room and opened the sliding doors to the lanai.  I was amazed to learn that there was, in fact, zero wind.Perplexed, I returned to bed and tried to sleep.  The droning sound seemed to fade away.  Then the sound began to increase, getting much louder than before.  In fact, it was loud enough to awaken my wife.  She was alarmed and asked me what the strange noise was.  I told her it&apos;s been going on for some time, but that I would check it out.  I got out of bed, put on my robe, and walked through the bedroom door into the living/dining room area.  As I stepped through the doorway, a very bright pulsing  blue/white light came through the dining room windows.  It was bright an pulsing and quite frankly scared me.  I put my hand up to my eyes and backed into the bedroom.  My intent was to dial 911, but as quickly as the lights came, they stopped and the droning sound began to fade away.

As it passed directly over I could make out some detail to its shape, it had three raised ribs on each half of the boomerang, and was golden in color.  It must have been moving at tremendous speed, because it didn&apos;t take 3 minutes to pass from horizon to horizon.  I knew it was moving very fast, from watching many B-36s flying out of Offutt Air Force base over our home in Kansas. My brother is now deceased.

I thought it was a helicopter but it did not appear to be moving.  It was a dull matte grey color and looked like two inverted contact lenses with a little turret on top, with a large round blue/white light on one side.  Whatever way the object was moving was the way the light faced. A vehicle was stopped on the other side of the road with 3 occupants in it, watching the object.  1 female and 1 male were standing up in the bed of the truck and 1 male was standing on the dash of the driver&rsquo;s side.  I pulled over, opened my car window and turned my vehicle off to see if I could hear anything.   I was about 60 feet from that vehicle, and sat and watched it for a while.   One of the males yelled over to me if I saw that, I answered yeah, that&apos;s why I stopped.  They asked what it was and I said I didn&apos;t know.

I looked to my right, out the window, and thought it was my imagination at first, or a reflection on the window, but then I realized that there were these three blueish-white lights moving pretty slowly across the sky. From what I know about the orientation of my house, they were moving southwest to northeast. They were way lower in the sky than a normal plane would have been, and weren&apos;t blinking or anything. At frist I thought that they were three separate lights, but then I saw the silhouette-like triangular form, and it seemed like they had to be all part of one object. There&apos;s a lot of cloud cover tonight, so they must have been flying below the clouds. I didn&apos;t hear any noise or anything. I could easily have missed them/ it if I hadn&apos;t caught it out of the corner of my eye. I&apos;m pretty creeped out by this.

Curious I drove out to his location and he then pointed out what he was seeing.The object in the sky was bright and blinking many different colors. When it was not blinking it blended into the sky like a star. After about 3 min. of watching this object it now had started moving up, down, right, left and diagonal. He had told me it was moving earlier also. After looking at it for 10 min. I stoped looking at it so my eyes would adjust and I would know it was not just an optical elusion. We then looked around in the sky to see if there was others. There was 3 total. They would light up very bright then get dim. They would move in all sorts of directions. They also had something in common with each other, they all blinked many different colors, they moved in weird ways and 2 of them stayed inbetween 2 stars. The other was the most active and got very bright then dim. The object also moved in every direction and fast.The object started out about 50 degrees up from the ground. It would then drop to about 25-30 degrees then back up. That&apos;s not it. After awhile I had though my eyes were playing tricks on me until a plane that was flying at the same altitude and directly towards the object came about. It seemed to effect the object. The plane stayed at the same speed and altitude. As the plane got closer the object started lighting up like a strobe light of colors and shot straight at the plane. It then bobbed up and down. After the plane passed it then moved up to about 60 degrees in the sky.The objects went on lighting up for about 2 and a half hours till&apos; we needed to go home. I have never seen anything like this in my life. I know what a plane looks like in the sky and also a satilite. This was not either one. There was 8 people total that seen this in our town. 6 that were with us. My boyfriend, boyfriend&apos;s mother, his 2 of his best friends, my brother and me. The other two were passing us in the road and stopped to see what we were doing. One was the ensurance agent for our town and his son. It almost made me sick when I seen these objects.

We started star gazing to pass the time.  Looking for shapes and I pointed out Orion to the kids.  By vision maybe 3 inches above the screen, (facing NE) there was a triangle of what appeared to be just stars, but between two of the stars was another that was fading in and out.  Thought it was cool and pointed it out to the girls.  About that time the previews started and we quit paying attention to anything else.  The previews run about 15 minutes and the screen goes dark again before the feature starts.  Looked up to see if the one fading in and out was still there, and the triangle of stars I was using to coordinate the position were gone as well.  This time of year the stars rise in the sky, i looked above and to both sides, they were simply gone.  I dont know the exact date, about 2 weeks after the news in phoenix went nuts about the return of the phoenix lights.

Getting off topic sorry.I dont know much that much about space other than i love to watch the night sky.  I know what different satellites look like passing in the sky. These too are not found to simply be sitting still fading in and out, they travel in the sky.  I have no idea what i saw.  Like i said it was just interesting due to short time following the &quot;Deer Valley Lights&quot; &quot;Return of the Phoenix lights&quot; or whatever they are calling it now.This type of thing fascinates me, I have always held an interest in this field, though  never really have done anything about it.I have heard many stories from family that are absolutely out of this world &quot;no pun intended&quot; things that i was not a witness too, but know the witnesses to be honest, most of them anyway.  Things that my family has seen that cant be explained away.  But the reason i have been looking at these sights the last few weeks was to see if anyone else had seen what i saw, or espescially if they had seen what happened to it, where did it go, how did it vanish.After seeing reports from phoenix near the same timeline, i decided to go ahead and report this.Email given is my work email, and phone is home # Basically evenings or weekends((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

When we watched, there where a few seconds where there was nothing, then lights, some brighter then others, dancing, spinning, and shooting across the sky.  Many stopped and changed directions, shooting up, down and all around. We stood there for about 15-20 min, they where there still where dancing.

Today I spoke to a friend who said that there have been reports of possible ufo&apos;s in the past month, but we both laughed. I looked it up on my computer just now and read that what I saw was also reported 2 weeks ago. maybe there is somthing to it so I am writing you today.

At first, I thought it was a promotion balloon then I thought it was a balloon from someone because maybe someone was buying a balloon for Mothers Day&apos;s, but it was still like it was observing something. As I stopped at a red light at 53rd street, I stuck my head to look at it. It was white with a black glass top. I was looking at it during the red light when suddenly it started acending upward and made a curve shape turn and didn&apos;t see it anymore. That&apos;s what I saw.

The lights formed what I consider an isosceles triangle.  They disappeared in opposite order in which they appeared, within about 3 seconds.  This was neat, odd, but conclusive for me. We traveled another 4 or 5 miles and again, 8-10 more orange lights appeared randomly spaced to the right side of the highway, this time appearing closer to the tree line.  After about 4 seconds they disappear.  By this time, we are consumed with speculation as to what could be making these lights. We traveled less than 2 miles further, and again 8-10 orange lights appeared randomly spaced, and within less than a second they literally moved into a formation of two parallel, perpendicular rows.  I was driving, and could not witness as much as my son, who said it/they, moved into a triangular formation and disappeared again in about 4 seconds.  This is when it became apparent to me, this was real.  We are nervous and anxious to get home, since we are alone in the middle of nowhere. We traveled another 3-4 miles, when the lights appeared again, but this time below the tree line, literally hovering about 20-30 feet above an open field.  This thing is less than 50 yards away from my car, and we can now see it. The very bright orange lights encompass the perimeter of the vessel that is hovering at an angle and slowly rotating counter-clockwise, illuminating the undercarriage which was a dark gray metallic.  My son witnessed a second vessel hovering above the one described, but said that one did not have lights. We did not stop or even slow down, but we continued to see it until we had driven out of viewing range. This last sighting lasted for about 12 seconds. I did not report this to local authorizes.", "Saucer shaped aircraft taking off. Unbelievable acceleration. A bluish neon round light (glow) underneath the aircraft.I was not aware there was a site like this or I would have reported this earlier.I was working the night shift in Kotzebue, Alaska.  I don&apos;t remember the exact date of my sighting but to the best of my recollection it was in October of 2002 at about 5:30 in the morning.  My work was such that I had to spend time outside. There was some snow on the ground, but I don&apos;t think it was more that a couple of inches. Looking out to the north of Kotzebue, I noticed a saucer shaped aircraft take off from about I would guess 1 to 3 miles north of Kotzebue. It was dark but with a partial moon I was able to discern the outline of a saucer shaped aircraft.  It took off at about an 80 to 85 degree angle. It started up relatively slowly but when it was perhaps 500 or so feet in the air, it accelerated very quickly. The whole sighting was over within 10 seconds or so.  That is how fast it was. It accelerated so quickly it was out of sight within about 10 seconds.  The interesting thing was the neon bluish round glow (plasma)that was underneath the aircraft.  Probably about a quarter the diameter of the entire saucer. I assume this was some kind of exhaust mechanism.  You would think I would have heard a noise as this aircraft took off but there was no noise. Complete silence. Again a very unusual neon bluish light, plasma (glow) underneath the aircraft which I assume was some kind of exhaust mechanism or what propelled the aircraft. After I saw this I called the police station in Kotzebue and asked if they had also seen something.  No, he said that he had not seen anything.  I think they had only one patrolman on duty as Kotzebue is a very small town and he was probably watching TV.  When my boss came in at 8:00 that morning I also told him what I saw.  He had been in Alaska several years and said other sightings had been made in Alaska over the years. Now that I look back I wish that I had gone north of Kotzebue and looked for any signs that the aircraft may have left in the snow.  I also wish I had called the air force down in Anchorage or Fairbanks to see if they had seen anything on their radar b! ut I did n&apos;t. All I can say is this really happened.  I never really gave much thought to UFOs before this incident as I didn&apos;t believe in them.  But this one incident changed my views completely. I now know without a doubt that there are aliens visiting our planet and they are far superior to us technologically. Again, the speed of this saucer was unbelievable. And whatever they are using to propell their spacecraft is not like anything we have.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

There was a large very colorful  looking star over that area, but it was high in the sky. While watching it, it moved quit quickly about an 1--to the right and stopped . I watched it for about 45 min. hoping it would move again, I did not want to take my eyes off of it in fear it would disappear. Ran inside to get my camera, a sony 5 meg.

I did have a very bright star. I enlarged it, and cropped twice, and got a very odd looking and very colorful v shaped something. There are very separate colors, blues, silver, yellow, green, and violet ball looking thing. It is not very clear, but it was enlarged, and against a black night sky. I&rsquo;m not really sure what to do, somebody should see it who knows photography , this is really a strange shape, like holding up the peace sign with your fingers and bending them in a little, not a solid v shape, you can see the sky between your fingers, best I could for what it looks like.

After just a few seconds I realized this object was not anything I&apos;d seen based on the intense colors being emitted in a pattern or loop and also how it was moving.I feel the object was more round than anything else; the color behavior held my attention greatly.Please let me know if anyone else reported a sighting on this date or any other over this area I will email a picture of my viewpoint and where the u.f.o. was exactly.P.S.

It was in the afternoon and I should have put 17:00 for the time instead of 5:00.It was in the afternoon and my friends and I were outside visiting and just enjoying the beautiful day.  One of us noticed a very bright white metallic low in the sky, but above the light poles.  We all just stood and stared at it and tried to make sense of it.  We thought it had to be a weather satellite gathering data.  It was shaped like a cigar and had four small red and green lights, positioned on its &quot;corners,&quot; one above and to the left, one above and to the right, one below and to the left, and one below and to the right.  These small lights would take turns darting out for a few seconds and then reposition themselves by the bright white metallic cigar shaped object.  The larger object was metallic, but it looked unlike any metal we had ever seen.  It was so bright. We watched as all four of the small colored lights repositioned themselves at the same time beside the cigar shaped object, and then what happened next made us decide it could not be something from the earth.  It shot up and away at a 45 degree angle at an unbelievable speed.  It was there one moment, and then it was gone. We saw this in broad daylight, and it is as clear in my mind today as it was that day in the spring of &apos;77.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

I saw a boomerang shaped object than just hung in the sky very far away.  Did not seem to make any strong movements at first.  Hung there for about 5 minutes (or 5 minutes from the time I first spotted it). Then it started to either shift its shape or turn and appear as a string-like object.  It continued to do this for a few minutes against a blue sky.  It would get smaller and start to fade away as if moving far away or becoming invisible.  There were planes flying and it appeared to be a lot higher up than them (from my perspective). It looked similar to if you were to take a piece of string and put underwater- just floating there slowly shifting (I assume it was very large even though it was far away.  It faded away, then moments later a ball appeared, &apos;flew&apos; around for several seconds (going one direction stopping abruptly then shooting off in another) then faded into a blue sky.

I was standing facing east (sun was behind me) walking home from a park with my baby and 3 neighborhood kids (range in age from 8 to 5).  The sky was perfectly blue- not a single cloud.  I looked at the sky and pointed and asked the kids &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;  One of the girls said it looks like the &ldquo;Big Dipper&rdquo; (only it had more &ldquo;stars&rdquo; in it).  I realized then that even though it looked like stars in the night sky they started shifting and moving around slightly, while still staying in the same area.  I knew that it wasn&rsquo;t stars &ndash; they were UFO&rsquo;s.  There was a main ship (white) that never really moved- it was the largest (comparable to seeing a planet in the night sky &ndash; maybe a little bigger).  There were multiple ships with this main one- they would disappear/vanish and then reappear.  They would change color- from white to red to green.  Mostly, the small ships looked like white dots &ndash; there were many of them.  At one point, I counted 8 &ndash; but, there were as many as 15+.   Airplanes passed the area (flying below the UFO&rsquo;s) several times.  I KNOW these objects were not planes.  About 10 minutes went by and they were still in view; I took 4 pictures with my Blackberry camera but nothing really turned out because they were so small.  As we began walking home, we looked up at the sky again- maybe a minute or two went by &ndash; and all the UFO&rsquo;s were gone.

The object was viewed with the naked eye and only a hyper-blue white was eminating from the underside of the object. When viewed through 8x21 binoculars the object appeared to have red and white lights at each of the 3 corners in addition to the hyper-blue type light coming from the underside. The blue light would get brighter and dimmer but the red and white lights remained constant.  The object hovered for at least the 30 minutes that it was viewed with very little movement. When fixing a position and then viewing the oject in comparison to the fixed point the object remained at approximately the same location with very little movement.

Out of the corner of my eye I noticed what appeared to be a bright off white light moving from south north east at a very slow rate of speed. I had to lean my head back for a moment as the object appeared nearly right over the top of my head. It made no noise, and travelled very slowly and silently for about a minute and a half, and suddenly, rapidly accelerated at speeds I could not identify with any other aircraft I have ever seen manuver before, due east directly above the tree line. At that point, startled, I ran into the house and woke my mother from a dead sleep to validate the peculiar object. We both proceeded outside to which we witnessed it move back and forth, up and down, changing in brightness, and at times what appeared even to be in shape for several minutes. There was extensive cloud cover on the horizon above the tree line, and enough overcast to create a haze over the ret of the objects in the sky, however this peticular object remained extremely vibrant. I then proceeded to go to my computer and check my online star charts on Worldwide Telescope for the current time and date while my mother stayed outside and observed its odd behavior. Nothing celestial even matched the intensity or positioning of this object. Note: I am an avid astronomer of over 8 years, fluent with many of the night sky&apos;s celestial content. Towards the end of the sighting I called the mufon hotline and reported the object as both my mother and I observed it... it later faded out, either disappearing, or moving behind cloud cover... and seemed to independently illuminate the clouds as it left from view.

I was four years old. I don&rsquo;t know why I remember this but I do. It was at night and my family and I was doing what families do watch television. Suddenly, the lights went out and I guess there was a noise or something outside because we all headed out of the house. There was something in the sky swirling around with illuminated lights which were multi-colored lights. It (the object) had no form. After looking at it for, what I can&rsquo;t remember, a while the air around me felt thick, as if I were under water because I felt like I was moving in slow motion. I also remember my uncle standing in front of me but not moving or speaking. It seemed as though he was frozen in time; I kept pulling at his shirt trying to get his attention but he didn&rsquo;t move. The next thing I remember is touching some kind of machine with lights all around it and it was very cold. From what I can gather now thinking back it seemed to me to be a probe of some kind. Now, the funny thing about this whole thing is I thought that I was dreaming, except for this one thing, I wasn&rsquo;t. I say that because years later when speaking to a few of my family members we all had the same experience. They remembered exactly what I did and perhaps a little more.

A third time yelled LOOK and one of the firefighters saw the craft as it flew out of sight. He said that he saw it as it flew away but thought it looked like a feather. He could not explain how it was flying in a straight line. The craft was hard to see against the clear blue sky and flying at a high rate of speed. There was no sound or was there any cloud that followed the craft. It is my estimation that the craft flew about 20 miles in 15 seconds.

I acknowledged the moon, which was rising between two trees and was 40 degrees above the horizon, but then I noticed a very bright object almost directly overhead.  It was very bright, as bright as the moon, and was approximately 80 degrees above the horizon.  As I looked at it, I noticed it did not seem to be moving at all.  Also, it did not seem round-it looked rectangular in shape though it was very small and distant.  I&rsquo;ve seen the space shuttle in the sky and, to me it looked like that kind of object-something definitely in our orbit, however, it wasn&rsquo;t moving. I pointed it out to my mother who acknowledged seeing it and asked her to keep an eye out for it as I went inside, dropped off grocery bags and rounded up my binoculars.  This took about 3 minutes.  When I came back out it was still there and still very bright.  I gazed at it some more with the binoculars and also gazed at the moon.  I also gave the glass to my mother who also took a look.  This went on for about 5 more minutes. As we were talking about it I got distracted and looked down at the dog who was running around the yard.  I turned around and looked up again, and it had completely disappeared.  Within a span of about 7 to 10 seconds, it was nowhere to be found. I couldn&rsquo;t believe my eyes.

Then, coz I was still waiting and wanted to fill in my time with something, I turned on the video camera. When I did this, I saw a black dot on the viewing screen; it was moving around a bit like it was floating, similar to the way a balloon would float if it had found an area of sky of equal pressures. But when I looked at the sky where this black dot was on the viewing screen, I couldn&apos;t see it. It was obviously there, I could see it on the viewing screen. But I couldn&apos;t see it with my eyes. I triple checked between the viewing screen and the sky! I could only see it through the viewing screen. Also, I could see it rotating spherically along every axis as if it were an inflatable beach ball hovering above an air vent; the type you see in Techniquest, and its shape was changing from spherical (round) to slightly oblong (squeezed round) and back again, as it rotated (the image while recording was much clearer than the recorded image which has been pixelated). I zoomed in next which was the obvious next step, and I wondered if it would do anything a bit strange. It moved from one point to another in such a way that cancelled out the possibility of it being a balloon. You can see from the slow motion video that the object arcs to the left and down, creating a circular motion before moving up and right, coming to rest in another place. Then after it bobs around for a bit, it creates exactly the same arcing circular motion as before but in the opposite direction, zooming away from that place to another off screen. Can you see it coming back onto the screen as I&apos;m getting out of the van? I didn&apos;t even see it zooming away the first time as my mate was distracting me asking me something, and I was looking away from the screen. I&apos;m just so glad I got that shot!

I asked him to stop the car so we can all observe the glowing light.  The light was too bright to be an airplane spotlight.  It was also traveling too slowly to be an airplane.  Then I thought what if it&apos;s a helicopter, but I then ruled that out because it looked like it was only about 500-600 feet in the air and I did not hear any sounds that would resemble the sound of a helicopter.  I got out of the car just to see if I could hear anything, but the only thing I heard was an unusual very faint mechanical/electronic sound, but I could not confirm this sound was coming from the object.  It was also too fast to be a hot air balloon.  It slowly passed us and continued heading eastbound in the sky.  It was then out of our view because of the trees.

I went home and everything seemed normal until i went outside for a cigarette around 12:30 AM Thursday, June 19th.  I noticed out of the corner of my eye a quick flash of light.When I looked up, I saw an EXTREMELY faint light moving in very erratic patterns at an unbelievably fast speed.  Basically, it was zig-zagging in all different directions at a brightness and speed that made it hardly even noticeable. I went to go wake up my little brother and show him. He said he saw it too, but didn&apos;t give it much thought and went back to bed.I sat out there and watched for a bit longer until I noticed that the zooming, zig-zagging lights were EVERYWHERE. They weren&apos;t birds, nor shooting stars or airplanes or jets.  This is unlike anything I have ever seen before.  I went upstairs to film this happening on an old video camera that we have had since the 90&apos;s.  The camera did a very poor job picking up anything too strange because of how dark it was outside, the age of the camera, and the faintness of the lights. To make sure I wasn&apos;t going crazy, I called one of my friends to come over and watch the sky with me and he agreed. I got in my car to go pick him up.We got back to my house about ten minutes later, and this is when the weird stuff started happening.  Instantly, I noticed that there were more stars out than there were before I left.  I looked up and I saw one of them hovering, moving in very small circles.  This was not some star obscured by clouds as skeptics may say.  This thing was moving.  THEN we noticed that the moving light began shooting out other lights.  When they would shoot out, a very small trail of vapour was seen behind them but only for a second.  After a while, we noticed some patterns.  The lights really only moved when they shot out other lights (except of course those faint &quot;zooming zig-zaggers&quot; which went on all night).Also, we noticed just how many lights formed triangle shapes in the sky.  Most noticeably were three very bright lights which seemed to be directly above my house which formed an almost perfect triangle.  We continued to watch this amazing display until about 2:30 AM until my friend wanted me to give him a ride home. I dropped him off and came back ten minutes later.  Well, I ended up staying awake and watching the sky until about 5:30 AM because i was so mesmerized and frankly, a little scared.  The same things happened until I went to bed. As a sidenote, I should aslo mention that police ad ambulance sirens could be hear literally ALL NIGHT LONG.  there were non-stop sirens going on for at least 4 hours straight. I don&apos;t know if this has to do with anything, though.I woke up very tired and sore in the neck (probably from staring up all night) around 7:00 AM because I had class to go to at 8 AM.  As I was driving to school, I couldn&apos;t help but notice that the &quot;zoomers&quot; were still there!  Well I went on through the rest of the day until I had to go to work at 2:00 PM.  I had told only one specific co-worker about the whole situation last night because everyone else would just laugh at me.  We waited until it was dark (probably around 10 PM) when I dragged him out of the warehouse that we work at to come outside and see for himself.I pointed out to him one of the clearly moving lights, but he just denied it.  He said it didn&apos;t look like it was moving at all. I got kind of upset, but he told me to just go home that night and film the sky because the camera wont play tricks on you like your eyes might.  So I did again, around 11:30 PM when I got off work.  I had a half an hours worth of tape but I only filmed maybe ten minutes of footage. The triangular star formations were still there, and I saw a very fast vapor streak in the sky which seemed to come down straight to Earth about 20 miles away.  After about five minutes (which seemed like an eternity) I started getting really nervous, paranoid, and itchy.  I felt like I was being watched. I couldn&apos;t do it any more. I was feeling so weird, I just ran inside and reluctantly went to bed.I woke up today (Friday, June 20th) feeling just fine.  I haven&apos;t even bothered to look up at the sky yet.

Except we first saw the object just above the tree line and it started to move upward.I would estimate that the object was about 10,000 feet up.  We watched a regular passenger jet fly right by it (but it looked as though the plane was at a different altitude).  So we continued to watch this object.  It moved higher very slowly.  It would sometimes stop and hover, then start moving up again.  No noise at all.  Then we witnessed a second UFO pass directly under the first object.  It was in the shape of a rod, cigar, or a surf board.  It was reddish-brown in color.  It streaked right below the first object to the east at a high rate of speed.One son managed to find a pair of binoculars and looked at the first object in detail.  All he could see was that one side was brighter than the other.  One side looked speckled or blotched.  I don&apos;t know perhaps this could have been from the sun reflecting off of the object.Then one of my sons thought he saw what he described to be a puff of smoke coming from the bottom of the first glowing round object.

My friend and I were out of our car on Whitney Portal Rd, looking at stars, when my friend spotted the object to the east (toward US-395 (Main St)).  The object was silent, not moving very quickly and appeared to be about 150-200 feet above the ground, and approximately 50-60 ft in length, 20-30 ft deep and about 10-15 ft thick (all estimates).  When first spotted, the object appeared to become semi-transluscent and then solid, and throughout the observation, appeared very very dim.  It slowly glided behind some trees, and when we went to the other side of the trees, it was no longer there.  We went back the next night (same time and location) but did not see anything.", "Noted star like object moving in relation to a telephone pole. It was moving in a westerly direction.

It then seemed to disappear behind something again, though there were no clouds in the sky.In short, it came out from behind nothing, stopped on a dime, and then proceeded on it&rsquo;s path and went back to behind nothing again&hellip;  My friend and I both saw it, looked at each other, jumped up and ran to our tent.

Lying on our hammock, looking up, we noticed a light that appeared to be a bright satellite, but not moving in an orbit like direction.  Instead, the light, the brightest in the sky, was moving in different patterns, linear and in a zigzag motion.  A couple of times it moved in a clock, and counter-clockwise circular motion. The light appeared to change color from time to time.  Fixing our eyes on nearby stars, the distance of the object was vividly increasing and decreasing its distance to those stars.", "I was getting onto the highway by exit 15 in Southbury CT, when I thought I saw an air-balloon or a blimp in the distance. When I got a little past exit 13 I saw an object to my right over Lake Zoar. It was just above the trees. It moved in my direction, and was infront of my car. It looked exactly like a rocket ship, except it was not as long and thin. It was on the shorter, wider , with no wings, and no visible engine. It looked to be made out of metal, and the bottom almost resembled glass. It was &quot;floating&quot; with the top pointed to the left, and changed it&apos;s direction into an upright position. It made no noise at all, even though it was so close to the ground. It almost looked like it was barley in movement. It had 3 objects on the bottom of it, just like a rocket. If anything like this has ever been seen please let me know, because I feel like I am going crazy.", "To bright, to smooth, but mostly to fastI was standing alone, on some railroad tracks simply looking up into the skies, noticing how many stars I could see compared to other nights.  The two nights prior to this night I had been noticing that there were becoming more and more stars each night.  This night, as im standing there, many airplanes begin to fly over head.  In total time of about 7 minutes, there were 6 planes.  Two where coming on my left, flying strait from east to west.  Four planes were flying directly over me, two of them clearing way up in the air, while the other two clearly flying low.  All planes were identifiable by their lights, the two four high ones making a small triangle with three lights, one white, and two blinking red and green.  Even the lower ones were noticeable with about 4 white lights in a line and a blinking red light I could only assume at the tail.  As they entered my airspace, I could hear the low planes, same as they left my airspace.As the first low plane passed directly over me, I noticed a newer &quot;thing&quot; just as low.  It had 4 white lights but these lights were to bright to be that of a plane and not quite bright enough to look as the stars did.  The lights almost made a shape of an &quot;L&quot; with the top two pretty much directly in formation, the third a little more to the right and out of formation and the fourth a little more out of the formation of the third.  Again I was looking at the first low plane that was just beginning to leave my airspace and took note of the sound it was making.  This L one however made no sound, speed was a little bit faster than those of the planes I was noticing but also, I did take reference of how smooth it seemed to go.  Of course it was night and to dark to truly see the smoothness in its ride, but I couldn&apos;t help but think and wonder about &quot;smooth&quot;.So a second low craft is coming over me, and I turn my direction to where I noticed the L thing and as a joke tempting more &quot;stars&quot; as I called this L thing, to fly.  That&apos;s when I see this single white light cruising through the air.  Now this Single, was as bright as a star.  Just as quiet as the L,  but was moving at a speed that was incredible.  This Single, with its speed, could definitely be described as moving really smooth.  Some say it might have been a shooting star, and I&apos;ll go along with it, but it was going to slow to be what I think I&apos;ve seen as a shooting star, but way to fast to be any aircraft I&apos;ve ever seen flying.  What really caught me was as it cruised I could see two stars that were directly in its path.  That natural humanistic thing to do was worry about a collision, due to the angle of which it was being seen.  But I kid you not, as they crossed paths, they became one, and as the Single would leave each of the two stars, I did take note that when right next to each other, they looked identical.  Both in size, shape, and brightness.  It was really quite inspiring to see something like this, that I could not explain, but still could not jump to any conclusions.  If this sounds familiar, please contact me.", "Another troubling episode that has been even harder to explain when considering aspects of the Kicksburg ((sic--Kecksburg)), Pennslyvania UFO Sighting.I want you to understand that the date of this FireBall streaming across the treeline from my position facing toward Hartford in the south and to the existing river coming from the northeastern sector of the state from the other side of the forest just outside Enfield, Connecticut was the exact path this Orb took heading in a northeastern direction. It appeared as I said as if the sun itself had fallen from the sky because of its massive size and the circular diameter of the sphere, it made no sound and nor was there a sound previous to its appearance to indicate a major explosion of some magnitude coming from that region of the countryside, it appeared as though it was approximately 10 miles or so from the street we lived on that ran parallel to the trajectory of the object in question and that of the river on the other side of the forest, it was heading in a north, northeasterly direction after I reviewing my homes position to that of Hartford and the river that passed along side of Enfield and headed directly toward the Hartford vicinity, the Smith Family lived directly behind our house on the next block, the Zimmermans a few more streets over from them, if my bearings are correct. The silence of such a huge sphere ROLLING across the tree tops and emitting whipping flames from upon its surface gave you the feeling that the core of this object was solid while its surface was entirely engulfed in a all encompassing mass of burning gases and surface material, no wind, not a whisper of the massive flight of this globe of fire could be heard, no crash, no explosion, its as if it was headed toward the coastline and gravity had no effect on its elevation as it traveled the distance from which I was could visually detect and remain captivated by its enormous size and silence as it moved through the evening sky to a destination I had no indication wwas close by.   I&apos;d like to mention yet another personal experience, that wasn&apos;t so personal when you consider all the news at the time that was generated in the Community of Great Falls, Montana shortly after the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II. It was months later and I had contacted a local priest from Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Great Falls . This priest has since been removed from active service with the general public, he has suffered a stroke on the left side of his body and his memory isn&apos;t exactly what it use to be. In the early 1980&apos;s, maybe around May of 1982, during that late spring month my wife and I was awakened by a glowing light from the back yard of our home that was hovering over our very large weeping willow tree. The air was still and the sounds in the distance echoed as if you were inside a tunnel.  Across the alley, on the next block at 2606-5th Avenue South a police car was parked in the middle of the street looking directly into our backyard, the sound of breaking glass could be heard for a very brief second from that location, the whole area of the neighborhood was as if it were in a vacuum.  Above our tree was a cloud that resembled a Maltesse Cross, its four triangular shaped inner arms were of a stewing blackness that could only be understood from the depths outside our planets atmosphere. The other portions of that Maltesse Cross between the cross figure itself was pure white and just as luminous as the light of a full moon on a clear night, even that of a bright florescent blub. It hummed as though discharging a message or extracting a source of matter that had called it forth in the midnight hour.   This experience has vanished from most all records in the area after a military investigator came to the area and researched the sighting that many residents of Great Falls had reported to the Great Falls Tribune and to Military officials at Malmstrom AFB the days following its appearances, this phenomenon occurred during a period when I was employed for about a 6 month period as a supervisior at a local Sambo&apos;s Restraurant. The incident was centered at 2605-6th Avenue South in Great Falls , Montana. These kinds of personal experiences for some reason attach themselves to the psychi of those individuals and never let go, who wouldn&apos;t feel a special bond to these events that defy logic according to investigators that remain true to their integrity? This is yet another unexplained event that now appears to be totally erased from the record books because of government involvement. The priest I mentioned earlier is in a housing facility run by the church for aging priests in Great Falls . This priest was contacted by me the morning of that Maltesse Cross had hovered over our tree. I spoke with Father Herinko a number of times about this event and told him that for some reason or another I was certain that Light would remain in the area for three more days and could be spotted above in the evening sky&apos;s canopy in its original shape in a northwest trajectory as a group of distinguished cloud formations resembling that Maltesse Cross or wheel with spokes; you think that during that time satillites would have detected this formation, maybe the military did! I expect the Great Falls Tribune that had front page coverage of this event from so many callers would still have information on this case in question, I think they do, but find it very difficult to locate. That priest after that event was over was removed from his position at Our Lady of Lourdes Church and placed in a small church about 30 miles out of town on Highway 200, I believe the town was Fort Shaw that serves about 150 perishioners. I found that stra! nge seei ng he was only in his earlier fifties and was the priest in charge of not only the church services, but the grade school it operated in the community of Great Falls . Well, that night of the Maltesse Cross incident I told my wife as we stood 30 feet from that tree looking up at the swirling mass of black ink and that extremely white soft halo that divided the two prominent features into very distinct patterns that I should go and venture up to the tree and climb-up and see what if anything would occur... she ruled against it and seemed only interested in going back into the house and finishing her sleep. The police car was still parked in the middle of the street watching the figure with, I suspect, much interest. I imagine the police report was sanitized, as well in this actual case of multiple sightings that week, it shouldn&apos;t have been. Maybe you can further investigate and inform me as to what your findings were! Another aspect of this event which was discussed with the priest was the Montana State License Plate on my Vehicle, &quot; Sacrum&quot;. I had mailed one of these license plates to Pope John Paul II with a note that his life was in immediate mortal danger, that was 7 days from the attempt on his life where he was shot and a bullet struck his sacrum bone, go figure... I had never written a letter like that to anyone before, quite a coincidence, I had never communicated with the church prior to this event, but I did have an undeniable urge to get personalized license plates earlier that year... it was a plate that caused some interest with local officals, I retired that license plate after that incident. I was mostly consumed with getting my wife pregnant, my doctor told me forget it after numerous visits to his office... around 9 months after the Maltesse Cross incident we had a son... in 1983. His eyes were as if oriental, that&apos;s always puzzled me a bit. He&apos;s a good son, he works two jobs, has graduated from college with 3 degrees in business, I feel I&apos;m very blessed to have him. It&apos;s funny how life e! volves, it&apos;s amazing the mysteries that sometimes make those blessings seem all the more important in our own particular lives. If you find the information concerning this event in Great Falls during that time frame drop me a line, at the time I failed to document this important event in my life seeing it was all over the news at the get go.((initials deleted))", "Meteor objects leading toward formation of triangle lights.While driving to a local softball game near 9 PM CDT my friend and I saw what looked like a large and small meteor streaking across the sky, very high in the sky.  As we continued to drive and follow the object we noticed an array of triangle shaped lights off in the distance...almost to where the meteor like object was heading.  As the meteor objects faded into the distance, toward the horizon, the triangle formation of lights scattered very quickly in random like directions.  As I turned onto a street heading toward the direction of the lights in the sky they were gone and the whole thing was over.  We later, after the softball game, were listening to a local Chicago radio station, 96.3 FM, and heard people call into the station and tell the DJ (on air) that they had seen the lights or UFO&apos;s as well.  This occurred between 8:45-9PM on Friday July 11th, 2008 near the town of Lansing, IL.", "The object looked like a star until I noticed it was moving. The object also outshined every star in the sky!The object appeared to be a star until I noticed that it was slowly drifting. Questioning what I am seeing I compared it to other nearby stars, but the object not only outshined the all the stars in the sky, it was also the largest in sight. The object was glowing like a star, but the color was different. The object was located near the horizon. The morning glare near the horizon blocked out all the stars near it exept for the object. That led me to believe that whatever this thing is, its not a star because the morning glare would of blocked it out. Immediately I ran into my room, picked up the camera, ran back outside and recorded the object on tape. At the rate the object was moving, it would of taken more than a couple of hours for it to leave my range of sight. I repeatedly watched the footage for the past three months trying to find a reasonable explination only to be left with questions. I also tried to recreate the incident at a later date using the largest and brightest star in the sky. I was unable to duplicate the incident because the star was obviously stationary. So finally, I decided to report the incident.", "triangle ufo with red lights on each end, round edges, carnival ride noiseI forgot the exact date, it&apos;s somewhere around the end of June 2007 and start of July 2007. I was over at my cousins house and it was around 9-10 p.m. when I was swimming in his pool. I started to hear a whooshing noise, kinda like a carnival ride. When I turned to where the noise was coming from I saw a big triangle shaped object hovering over the trailers. That&apos;s when I ran inside my cousin&apos;s trailer and called him out. By the time he came out the UFO was over his house. It was about 400 feet over his house and had red lights on each end, with round edges. We watched it for a couple seconds and it went away behind a tree, we didn&apos;t see it after that. It was a grayish black color. We called our parents out when I called my cousin, but they didn&apos;t want to see it because they thought we were lying and were watching TV. Me and my cousin never told anybody but our friends and family. Nobody believes us except for my brother.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

What I am sure of is myself, brother, mother and father were standing in our front yard in Mt Washington, Maryland, and we saw this craft slowly drifting across in front of us about 300 feet away and 300 feet up.  It was not an airplane, helicopter, glider, balloon, inflated object (hoax) or anything we have ever seen.  It reminded me now of the Jefferson airplane blimp if you ever seen that on their album or poster.  It sort of looked like a cross between a box kite and balloon but was not either of those at all. It was close enough that I remember seeing the operator of this craft staring at us, as it drifted by.  Time seemed to stand still and it also seemed as though we were under the control of the operator of this craft--very, very strange indeed.  I think about this often and would love some answers. I have other experiences which have happened later on in my life which really make it seem as though I&rsquo;ve been abducted several times.

Anyway I left my office here and traveled west on Rt.40 to turn around and head east towards Dunkin Donuts. While sitting in the left turn lane I had the feeling of being watched (my hair on the back of my neck was standing up) so I paused at the intersection and looked upward into the sky. There it was off to my left, a solid white, extremely bright circle with a slightly smaller bright circle of light off to the right connected by a line of bright whiteness again.  It looked like a dumbbell sort of. I looked down at the road to refocus my eyes and rubbed them for 3-5 seconds and looked up again and it was still there.  I have never ever seen anything like this.  No one else was around or on the roadway.  I am not sure if this was one ship or two connected together.  I was terrified and drove off making my U-turn and heading down to Dunkin Donuts.  I did not observe any other aircraft in the area and the object(s) blacked out the background.  They were just slightly smaller than the size of a water bottle cap held at arms length.  To my eye they were about the size of my thumb at arms length.  I would estimate the altitude of the object(s) to be anywhere from 1000 ft. to 10,000 ft. It was difficult to tell.

Me and my wife where on the porch looking at the clouds when we saw a silver cylinder in a vertical position moving at a steady speed, steady path, from east to west. We saw it for about 30 seconds until the view was blocked by the woods. The object looked like a thick, big, metal Pringles can. It did not make any noise and it was not afected by the strong storm winds. I am guessing it was about 1,000 feet from the ground, it did not touch the clouds. The other weird thing that happened was that when it was getting out of our view for about 5 seconds it looked like a vertical bow, like a bow tie.

My wife and I were heading back home from shopping.  As we were driving North on Seaboard lane.  We stopped for a red light at the intersection of Seaboard and Mallory station road.  I then noticed a large cigarish shaped object in the sky not moving.  It was a semi cloudy day with very blue sky, the object appeared to be sort of a dull silver.  We see planes circling in this area quite often awaiting clearance at the Nashville international airport.  I think planes circle in at around 10,000 ft or so.  This object was large, it was longer and fatter than a Boeing 737 and no wings.  At one point as I watch it and was tying to point out to my wife wear it was I actually thought a plane was going to hit it.  The Plane turned out to be above it, as the plane flew behind it heading north, north east direction.  It was hard for my wife to see it because it was dull silver and blended well in the sky with clouds. We then turned West onto Mallory station road.  I had lost sight of it now.  We then turned North again onto Franklin road.  We proceeded to the intersection of Franklin road and Moores lane.  It was here that I was able to then again see the same object.  Again I tried to point it out to my wife, its was then that she saw a different one east a few miles away in the sky.  Once she was able to see that one, her eyes were now trained and she saw the same one I was looking at back at the intersection of Seaboard and Mallory station rd.  Both object were similar in shape and color, one appear smaller but I think it was a distance thing.  If I were to hold a dime as arms length I would be able to cover the larger one up with half of the dime.

There is a road side park about 30 miles out of Ft. Stockton, we had just gone past there.  It was 12 midnight and raining off and on, and thats when we saw it, off in a canyon, about a mile away facing west.  It was a huge dome, the color of a black light, and you could see movement in it.  This dome was the size of a football field, and it was making a crackling sound, like electricity  I was out of the truck and standing by the fence when I realized that you could only see it when the moon was out from behind the clouds.  It was cloudy and misting rain, but I wanted to go see what it was, but everyone else was freaking: they said they were leaving without me ,even though it was my truck.

I know you know where this is going, ha ha. Too big to be a radio tower, and stationary, so not an airplane. I, of course, used these two anchors of logic to dissuade me from what I thought I was actually seeing, but it was when I made out a chassis that my foot hit the brake and I slowed to a crawl.... it was wobbling... I started screeching all kinds of disbelieving profanities and I KNOW someone else saw it because as I was swerving off the road I saw another car wandering off to the side of the road as well, and they quickly passed. It was triangular, dark and metallic, very sleek and smooth, with three white lights at each vertex and a concave red light, and it seemed blurry because the darn thing was wobbling a bit. I forced myself to look at the road and was surprised to find an unnatural glow around myself and the car, and as it grew brighter, I brought my eyes upward and caught it above my windshield and I craned my neck and promptly began to panic because the craft was now above my car, silent, higher up in the air but still too close for comfort, 500 feet perhaps....

It was moving about as fast as a jet would in the sky, but the fact that it had no blinking lights and was just one bright object moving across the sky made me think more that it was a Ufo.

It couldn&apos;t be a comet because it would have had a trail of debree. Definetly no meteor just by observation. It was about the size of a quarter if you held it in your hand. So I assume this object was in outer space. The object&apos;s direction was from northwest to south east. I lost track of it because it went out of my viewing range.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

They set in the sky at the same position for approximatly 30 mins.  They started to move in different directions.

It looked like it was the same brightness, speed and height as the first light.It ended up just disappearing.

The two lights that were close together separated, and the entire formation became more like a &quot;normal&quot; triangle. It was clear that the three lights were separate and not part of the same object. Next, one light went on farther ahead of the other two lights. The two close lights were in such a position as the bunch was almost in a line. The farthest light then slowly &quot;burnt out,&quot; then the middle one, and finally the last one.

But I just read one or two events at www.nuforc.org/ that talk about going up in the sky so I&apos;ll repeat what happened to me here. This was a strange night a strange weekend. I was at a busy event and I was being attacked psychically by a &quot;friend&quot; while at this event.  There&apos;s a lot of detail around that but it just distorts the event of going into the sky. Friday night was very strange.  The strangest night of my life. I was in my hotel room with a magazine, painting my nails, watching tv, listening to the radio and smoking a cigarette.  Unwinding after a day of being a vendor to a large crowd. A small form about the size of the &quot;friend&quot; I was meeting at this event appeared in my room.  It stood at the left foot of the bed.  It was invisible but I could see it somehow - the outline of it. I wasn&apos;t afraid.  I was passive.  A correct reaction would be to get the blankety-blank thing out of my room. Instead I kept on doing what I was doing, sometimes looking over at the thing. I went to bed with that thing still standing there. I was aware that it was creepy to go to sleep with that thing watching me. But that&apos;s what I did.  I went to sleep.  Immediately.  But  I really wasn&apos;t sleeping. Right away, I was with my &quot;friend&quot; in a cave with a fire. That &quot;friend&quot; was doing something with the fire, it was somehow negative to me.  I didn&apos;t really know why I was down there. Something intervened.  I flew into the clouds in the thunderstorm right above this hotel i was staying at.  I remember passing through.  And there was an allowance to let me through the thunderstorm. It was their given protection to let me through.  I remember seeing the whirling clouds up close. Then I hurled out to space.  Sometimes we were in a spaceship, sometimes not.  They really didn&apos;t let me see them.  I was aware that one was male and one was female.  There were more at times.  We were inside the spaceship looking out or actually out in whatever environment we were in.  It was all very natural, very comfortable.  I loved them, they loved me.  it&apos;s like we knew each other all my life. These were not my grandparents come to meet me.  They were something else from up there, way up there. They took me all over the place.  It was fun and marvelous.  I let myself forget alot because it was too much. I remember going to this giant, golden lit building.  It was huge.  It was like giants lived there.  I was facing a giant door.  I looked left and right down these giant empty hallways.  I was unafraid.  They were with me.  I couldn&apos;t see them. The ones I was with said &quot;You are here because you can pray like that&quot;.  I understood that if i prayed, i could get through the giant doors I was standing in front of. i closed my eyes and prayed.  i prayed so hard i put myself in a trance.  i became a white light radiating love energy.  there was another white light with me. i stayed in this state of being in a trance and being a white light for both nights - friday and saturday - all night in my &quot;sleep&quot;.    They brought me up there so I would be safe from the attack happening to me. it was weird waking up each morning.  i would wake directly from being a white light.  as soon as i woke up, i was wide awake and i would think &quot;how can i be this wide awake since I&apos;ve just been up all night?&quot;  on sunday night in my hotel room, i was afraid to sleep because i didn&apos;t understand what had happened the two nights before.  i understood that with my &quot;friend&quot; gone, i was safe.  but still i refused to sleep and finally slept at daylight. i had a difficult reaction from the attack and from what i seen out there when i was up in the universe.  i had more than panoramic vision, it was like all around my head vision at certain points.  i couldn&apos;t look at the sky for a while. i was constantly dreaming about the sky.  one time i dreamt i was showing the sky my artwork.  i was in utter blackness in deep space.  they really liked my artwork.  it  didn&apos;t feel like a dream, it is a memory. then i realized i was putting my self in a trance in my sleep as i had the sensation of rocking back and forth in spirit form.  praying and rocking can induce trance. they let me know when they are overhead.  i get a really strong sensation from them. it&apos;s really nice.  they really like me.  one time, something came really strong but i told them i was afraid so they stopped. it really changed me, this experience.  i am alot more psychic, i always have been but now i tend to have psychic experiences with others more often. someone seen me walking, running around while my body slept (at the same time, i was dreaming i was doing exactly what they seen me doing),  i seen a ufo with my dad a few years later, me and my dog seen a small lighted circle in the yard last year, we also heard a dog bark in the small room we were in where there was no other dog and then this year in may i seen a big green line in the sky created by something traveling north to south.((NUFORC Note:  One of many reports from same source.

At a certain point, I noticed that a few clouds which had been disbursed and were not overlapping, finally became quite tightly knit together.

All of a sudden, from this grouping of clouds which were intertwined came a beam of light in the shape of a tube/cone starting from the sky projected onto what seemed to be Ft. Lauderdale and this beam took the shape of a cone beam.  Larger at the bottom.  This lasted for about 2 seconds and retracted.  It did not just disappear, it retracted.

It was glowing orange and seemed like it was flickering like a fire would, it made no sound, and moved slowly. I don&rsquo;t remember if we watched it till it disappeared or just went back to bed, but we watched it for some minutes.The next night I was curious as to whether or not it would re-appear and so I went out about the same time. I again saw the same phenomenon out over the ocean, once again it was a flickering orange glow. I went into the house and informed my wife, stepson, and stepdaughter that it was back, they all came out to watch it. We couldn&rsquo;t tell if it was moving or not, this time it was some distance from us, and so was perhaps brighter than the previous nights object. After a few minutes it faded from view.The next night I again went outside about the same time to see if it would re-appear. It didn&rsquo;t, but I saw airplanes from the near Boston airport, fireworks that people were setting off, campfires on the shore, and distant lightning from a storm. None of these were what we saw, but what the objects most closely resembled were the campfires, except, of course, the objects we sighted were in the sky.I have never seen anything like this before, nor have I ever had an interest in &lsquo;ufos&rdquo;, since seeing these objects I spoke to locals who couldn&rsquo;t tell me what they were, and I also searched on internet to identify them. I was surprised to see numerous reportings of  similar objects, including the report here from Mackey on July 4th in Indiana, I have also seen videos of similar objects. I had never heard of such objects prior to our sightings.", "Pearl like object seen hovering over Englewood, Colorado7/13/08    6:30pm  Place:  Englewood, Colorado  Witnesses: myself, my husband and our two children ages 9 &amp; 6  Our family was playing kickball in a park in downtown Englewood.  My 9 yr old daughter pointed out an object hovering over the city.  If we looked straight up it was just a little to the East about 10 degrees from high noon.  It looked like a reddish silver pearl. Twice it looked like it was flashing brown and silver.  It hovered in the same spot for about 20 minutes.  After looking away and then back again I noticed that it almost looked like a disk with a tail pointing east kinda like a stingray.  All of us agreed it was emanating disks of brownish exhaust.   The exhaust disks were puffing out of the center of it the entire time.  Several times during our sighting commercial airliners would fly past it but it never moved.  After our 20 minutes of rest our family resumed our kickball game.  Both my husband and I looked up to find it but it had disappeared.", "My Husband (driving),  our nine year old daughter,  two small sons and I were driving South on St. Rd. 15 on a return trip from Goshen Indiana at around10:20 P.M.  We were about 2 miles from Warsaw, Indiana when I noticed 2 objects off to the Southwest  that  were spaced much farther apart than the lights on an airplane wing.  These lights were round and were moving Southwest on a very clear night.  My Husband dismissed them as air planes due to the proximity of the local airport.  I talked him into turning down a side road to the West in the direction of the 2 orange lights.   Approximately 3/4 of a mile down this road we saw another object lower to the tree line to our Southwest. This object, the same as the first two appeared as a round, orange  complete circle moving / hovering South.  We turned South and then back to the West and found a clearing with a wide view of the horizon.  It was around 11P.M.  With the car off we sat in the entrance of a field facing to the South.  Within 5 minutes we were witnesses to an amazing display of these objects.  First a cluster of 2 appeared,  stationary to the South and then disappeared, one appeared just to the East, two reappeared again and then three more to the West of the other three for a total of six round orange objects in the Southwestern sky.  It seemed as though the objects were communicating to one another.  All the objects were stationary at this time of our observation. At this point a small panic ensued in our car and we left the area amazed, excited and feeling our world as a much smaller place.", "corrected date of Hutt ufo..hi, i reported this sighting a few days ago, but used the wrong month day layout we use down here. it was a few weeks ago about June 2nd.To add I haven&apos;t seen any other reports in local news etc. but it was going fairly fast and quite low. The v shape was tight and a bit irregular, the orbs seemed to jostle.Could only think of a group of geese or ducks being lit by cars and street lights, but have never seen that before with bright red/amber.Not much else can add, my friend isn&apos;t sure what it was as only glimpsed while driving after i noticed it. It was at times briefly obscured while driving and was gone by the time we got up on the bridge with a good view north up the valley. Could be similar to the well known here Kaikoura lights in 1977.

The object was observed from the area of 3180 south 600 west, New Palestine and appeared about 35 degrees above the horizon straight west of our location towards Indianapolis.  This thing according to our best guess was many thousands of feet in the air and didn&rsquo;t move or make a sound for over forty-five minutes.  The two attached pictures were taken with a digital camera with a 12X zoom lens an about fifteen minutes apart and yet it didn&rsquo;t change its orientation the entire time.

One of us noticed a craft in the sky. It was note worthy because, instead of the craft emitting &quot;smoke&quot; from its tail end, it emitted the smoke from its front, and then followed that smoke. Two other craft in the vicinity were behaving the same way.We assume to this day that it was military experimental craft.  My dad is convinced that they were airplanes, and that&apos;s how my brother and I interpreted the craft at that time. Thinking back, perhaps we processed these as airplanes only because we had no other exemplar to choose from.  I&apos;d say that the craft were definitely the size of military airplanes, and they moved at a similar speed as airplanes, but I can&apos;t say that I know that they had wings like an airplane.  I assume they did have wings, only because we didn&apos;t make a mental note that they looked any different than airplanes.  The crafts were unlike average airplanes in that they seemed to communicate with each other in a unique way, spitting out these pillars of smoke and then randomly following them.  I don&apos;t remember their formation as this was 10 years ago.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Then it began moving around and changing directions real fast.It was triangular shaped with white lights all around it and one red light. The lights were blinking or rotating. There appeared to be other smaller crafts darting toward it and then they would turn sharply and go in the opposite direction. And the large triangular craft would sort of chase after them. Either the smaller crafts were shooting at the larger one or vise a versa. But you could see smoke trails  all around it from what looked like missiles.I went in the house and told my step-dad and he came outside too with his binoculars. We counted at least six of the larger crafts all around the sky.We could see what looked like laser lights shooting all around it, then it looked almost like fireworks. Then I saw something out of the corner of my eye and had to take a double look. Above the trees and the house next door was a ball of fire falling slowly to the ground but it almost looked like a big balloon drifting down real slow. I yelled at my step-dad to look, we stood there watching it trying to figure out what it was. It was real close and it looked like it was landing in the back yard across the street. I tried to follow it but lost it. I know it must be in the close area.", "Birght, yellowish-orange, cigar shaped object over Sunset Ave./ Business 64 exit in Rocky mount, NC.My experience happened in 1999. October or November of 1999 to be exact. I never reported it before because I never really told anyone about it before. I thought people would think I was crazy for claiming I saw a UFO. To this day, even though I saw one, and I know what I saw, I don&apos;t believe anyone when they say they&apos;ve seen one. That being said, here is my experience.I was living in Raleigh, North Carolina. My job was in Rocky Mount, North Carolina NE of Raleigh. This night I was driving to Rocky Mount to stay at my parents house because I had to wake up really early the next morning. Since I was going to be in town a friend and I decided to get some dinner. I was driving to the restaurant on highway 64 going east. I had just passed the Nashville exit when I saw a long, thin yellowish-orange light just above the tree line. It was insanely bright and perfectly still in the air. It looked to be about three or four football fields long. Maybe even longer. I seemed to be about 10 miles from it so I knew this thing was huge. I watched it as I drove down the highway occasionally losing it behind some trees as the highway curved. The whole I was watching this thing and driving, I ran down a list of things it could possibly be. The list included a blimp, which it couldn&apos;t have been because it was too big and perfectly still, it wasn&apos;t the hospital that I was going to be passing because it was to high in the air and the hospital is the tallest building in Rocky Mount but not that tall, and I was absolutely certain it wasn&apos;t a plane. It was to big, to bright, and motionless.The last time I lost it behind some trees was the last time I saw it. I must have had my view of it blocked for 10 or 15 seconds maximum, but when the part of the sky it was in came into view again it was gone. I would have seen it fly away but didn&apos;t. In a matter of seconds I was under where it was floating on a clear sky so I would have seen it if it was still there but turned the lights off.I pulled over at the exit, again, pretty much right underneath where it was. I was looking up and noticed to small, fast moving planes flying in from the SE. These were obviously fighter jets flying in formation from, I am assuming, Cherry Point, which is an Air Force base SE of Rocky Mount. The two jets circled, in formation, pretty much in the same spot the object was and flew away, back toward the SE.I rolled my window up, put the car in gear, went to dinner and haven&apos;t spoken much of it since.", "Strange objects spotted in photoI did not actually see the objects first-hand. I was testing out the &quot;landscape&quot; function on my camera using the backyard on 8/21/2006.  I took three photos. One at 13:35:20, another at 13:35:33, and the final photo at 13:35:58.  After about a year of being stored on my computer I was finally going to delete them but upon zooming in I discovered two strange dark objects that upon further inspection resembled disks.  The last photo taken in the set was the only photo to have the objects in it, ruling out my original thought that there was just debris on the lens.  Also, one of the objects in the photo seems to have a trail behind it, perhaps indicating that it was moving at a high speed when the photo was taken.", "we were walking in the evening a saw what we first thought was a hot air ballon on fire. We watched it remain in the same spot for abouWe saw what we first thought was a hot air balloon on fire in the skies just east of RAF St Athan and Cardiff Wales Int Airport over Wenvoe, as we watched it it looked like something on fire and was fairly motionless, our initial thought was that it was a hot air balloon flaring up or on fire.  The object then started moving at a fairly fast pace (like an aeroplanes speed) from West to east over Cardiff.  As we watched it we discussed what it could be.  It wasn&apos;t a balloon as it was moving to fast, and was traveling along a horizontal plane.  We thought it couldn&apos;t be a plane or something on fire as it it wasn&apos;t losing any height.  We watched the object for about 5 minutes as it disappeared into cloud to the east.  All the time it flared bright orange, like it was on fire, and kept a constant speed(about that of a commercial airliner) and trajectory until it disappeared into cloud cover.We discussed what we had seen during the evening and checked on the internet when we returned home to see if any planes had been reported crashed.On googling &quot;fireball Cardiff&quot; we were astounded to find reports of the South Wales Police reporting a similar incidence a month earlier.This matter was reported to South Wales Police in August 2nd 2008  My Tag watch is now stopped at 21:41 pm!", "Eccentric shaped object flying over my homeI was a roughly rectangular object with 6 &quot;extensions&quot; flying over my home and videotaped it.

I thought that it was a satellite crossing the sky when I first noticed it. It moved from left to right but then became brighter and brighter until it was as bright as a bright star.  I then thought that it might be a meteorite that was heading directly towards me.  The light then went dim again and seemed to be either traveling away from me into space or just faded out until it was just a pin prick of light and then I could not see it any more.  It only traveled about one inch from left to right. The sky was very clear.  I have never seen anything like this.  Did anyone else see it?", "Low flying sphere of light?A sphere shaped object was traveling southward coming from the vicinity of Toronto at an estimated altitude of 50-100Km.  This was not an airplane, there were no wing, or tail lights.  The object was traveling at a slow rate of speed(200-300Kph)for about 2 minutes changing from gold/orange to white/blue.  The object proceeded to the east on a short, steady(from north to east it made a subtle 90 degree turn)arc for approximately 1 minute on a wavering trajectory, light changed to red, then flickered, and looked as though it had dematerialized, ending the sighting.  All the while there was NO SOUND coming from this object.My wife was also a witness to this event. I have seen this happen twice at night and once during the day over the last 2 months.  I have seen many satellites in the past, most of the satellites I see are traveling in a straight line in the sky, this object was very different in the way that it traveled, and was much much brighter then most satellites.  The object was much larger then most satellites, and it had a magnitude twice, maybe even three times the luminosity of Jupiter.  If anybody has any information on what this could be it would definitely be appreciated.

I was with an owner of a major telephone company, as well as an heir to an oil and gas fortune. We were the only ones to see them.  There were other people near us but they did not see them.  We were visiting a retired navy ship captain at his home that was built on the top of a very tall hill south of the Fort Davis mountains in west Texas.  I, along with the two others with me, was at the property line ofthis home, away from the lights of the house.  We were playing with a very expensive pair of night vision binoculars the retired captain had.  We were using them to see the incredible number of stars that were overhead.  These stars were invisible to the naked eye and when we used the binoculars you could se tons of other stars and satelites.  Then I saw it.  One of the &quot;stars&quot; directly overhead began moving in random directions, back and forth.  It had been stationary the entire time we were looking up ad then it started moving tens of degrees across the sky in mere seconds.  It moved in a random mode for several minutes. I handed the night sight binoculars to the phone company owner and the oil and gas man.  We all saw it.  By the time we got everyone out of the house, it was gone.  I saw it take off in what would have been tens of thousands of miles per hour.  It could start and stop and maneuver in ways that no engines I have ever heard of could.  It was extremely high in orbit.  I thought it was another satellite until it began making its sharp turns and starts and stops.", "Bright light behind a haze changed from white-ish yellow to blue colors.I was sitting on my front porch looking down at the ground in deep thought when a bright light in the sky straight ahead of me caught my attention. The light was very bright white-ish yellow as if it were a street light. I could not see an exact shape as this light seemed to be behind a haze. Within 3 seconds of looking up at the light it switched to a medium blue color then bright blue-ish white and then back to the medium blue color. As soon as the light started to change to the blue color it took off in the sky heading north and disappeared within 3-4 seconds. There was no sound as this happened. I would like to point out that the light was not in the sky when I first stepped out onto my porch. I would also like to point out that I live not too far from Offutt AFB &amp; I see airplanes pass over my house all the time. This was not an airplane.

Was about 7:30 pm and my brother and i were going into the local woods behind our apartment for whatever reason i dont remember. We played hide and seek in the early dark and such, but i vividly remember that night there being a dark colored helicopter in the field we usually play paintball. There was also two more things stuck partially in ground. Planes do not just get &quot;stuck&quot; in the ground. (i knew this because my father was a b-52 tail gunner and we spent a lot of time around planes and military bases) We were just kids so we wanted a closer look at everything. We both told each other that we could never tell dad about this. We walked very slowly and sometimes crawled in the dark field and got about 20 meters from the helicopter which i now recognize as a russian hind. Very dark almost leather appearance to it. only one marking on the body read S^6 ( the chevron was the otherway around but in the same position, kind of like the military uses for friendly identification) There were about 8 men on the scene and it was weird because even though the helicopter was still &quot;idling&quot; we could hear them talk about logistics of getting &quot;them&quot; back to base. We almost ran away after a few minutes because we were afraid we would not be able to come up with an excuse for being out late, but then something strange happened. A glowing wand or something was used by one of the men to ignite or charge a small box type thing on the outside of the craft. It was then apparent they were connected and not just three diffent things. It began to rumble the ground like a deep bass sine wave would from a subwoofer or earthquake. It then became translucent and lost physical shape but the dirt still defined its outline somewhat. It was to the best of my childhood knowledge, the size of three small busses like the special kids rode to school in. Very angular and connected by bars of the same material as the craft in a diamond shape. It had a grayish appearance like an old winnebago, but then again it was dark so i d! ont know for sure. I remember crying with my brother because were more scared that we would be found as people walked away from the craft and toward the chopper. About three or four minutes had passed and we were locked onto each other while they people from the helicopter tried to raise the craft from the earth and get it airborne.(i assume) the rest is kind of hazy, but i do remember talking to some one after the craft had been hoisted or lifted off the ground. Some one said that nothing is more important than not tellng anyone ever-or something i don&apos;t really know. I don&apos;t remember ever going home or ever seeing my brother after that. of course i know where he is now but we don&apos;t talk. I&apos;m not sure what the hell happened but i have a very good memory last i checked and whatever happened to us just isn&apos;t there. I did write everything down the next day in school and i hid it behind a piece of broken drywall in the basement of a library i used to go to.Ever sinnce then i cant remember ever going back there again. 12 years have gone by and for some strange reason i decided to visit the library and get a book for my studies opposed to getting the info from the web and it hit me. I had never returned to the basement. I did find the same piece of broken drywall however i did not find the paper i left as a kid. Someone knows and so it is not secret anymore. I wish to disclose what i know in hopes someone remembers seeing something in the field behind franklin knoll apartments in pottstown/stowe area. I have visited my neighbors and some remember just the rumble of &quot;cars&quot; or heavy machinery at about 8 o clock. I know what i saw and it wasn&apos;t normal. I can&apos;t believe that no one else saw anything as there were at least 20 apartments facing that field, and still are. I went to the field last week for shits and giggles but a grim reality set in as i approached the &quot;site&quot;. there were electrical hazard signs for a local power tranformer all over the place. There is now a large grounding field for a power substation where it! all hap pened. But heres the catch. Theres no power. I am an aspiring electrical engineer. I saw no means of power transmission to this &quot;field&quot;. It is just there. If it weren&apos;t for the damned barbed wire i would go further in and investigate but the fence is pretty seriously guarded by barbs and triple lock out devices common to the electrical trade. i have searched construction maps and electrical manuals far and wide but nothing was &quot;built&quot; in that area according to record. Then why is it there? I believe something weird happened not just in my memory. Go and look for yourself. Touch the fences and listen to the false hertzian waves generated by a loudspeaker within the electrical device inside the electrical looking breaker boxes and switching devices. It is all bullshit. The field had been plowed over and construction of the grounding field was made to cover up evidence im sure. feel free to breach the fence i assure you it is not charged like the signs say it is. I also assure you that all those boxes and wires have never had so much as a single volt passed through them, it&apos;s all fake. There is a nuclear power plant visible from limerick pa from the very spot. That power unbeknownst to locals is being sent to an electrical power grid for texas. Not to stowe.

As I got closer I noticed that the light was on the front of what appeared to be a triangular shaped object.  It did not appear to be moving.  My best GUESStimate was that it was about 50-75 feet in the air.  As I drove underneath the object I saw two green lights and one red light, all of which were blinking as opposed to the one in front (the orange one) which was not blinking.

I&apos;m guessing other people were looking out and wondering why a helicopter was flying about and making so much noise at this time of the night and especially in a huge area of land that is mostly residential zone (off of the Bothell Everett Highway/164th St). The helicopter finally flew away after 15 minutes towards the direction of where the Bothell Everett Highway would be.Now, there is a FEMA/Army Reserve base near Bothell. My first thought was troops doing training exercises with helicopters. However, why over a residential area and why circle a specific area for ~15 minutes? What did the repeating flash of the white light mean? My next thought was the traffic or weatherman or something. The 11 o&apos;clock news was almost finished though and in my opinion I don&apos;t think you could&apos;ve seen I-5 or I-405 from where the helicopter was.Probably nothing?  Just thought it may be of interest.", "Strange object in the sky on top of ManhattanI was sitting in my car when I noticed a strange object high in the sky standing still.

This was about 11:15 pm when we spotted a light in the sky.  As we watched it was traveling south to north and was on a parallel path with the earth.  As it got closer, we were able to see that is was actually a ball of fire, orange in color with red center traveling at a rapid speed (guess of 40 mph) at about the height of a helicopter flying, but with absolutely no sound or smoke trail.  As it passed our position we noticed another bright object following behind, on the exact same path as the first.  This also appeared to be a ball of fire, except it was not as contained as the first one.  When it got even with us, we noticed that the object was looser in form and we could actually see embers falling from the object.  I was concerned of possible fire since it was over a hay field.  They both continued on north northeast until out of site.  I would say the object appeared to be the size of a mid-size car, and it was about 50 yards from us.  The objects looked like what I would think space debris would be like but these two objects were not falling from the sky.  They were on a distinct path.", "I saw a silent orange/red pulsing light move across the sky slowly, hover, change color twice, and disgorge a smaller pulsing light.I was working the Saturday night shift at the bar when a friend from the restaurant next door ran in and said that there was a ufo outside. He said he had seen the ufo for the last 4 nights. I was skeptical, but followed him out to the parking lot. In the sky to the southwest was a hazy ember-colored light moving slowly to the east. The light pulsed evey two seconds and was about the size of a pea held at arm&apos;s length. Two other restaurant workers joined us. We remained mostly silent in order to try to hear the object- at no point did we hear any sound. I tried to sight it on my camera phone but could not pick it up. After about a minute, the object turned white for about two seconds and then resumed its initial color. The light did not illuminate any structure such as wings or a gondola and never blinked. There was a fairly uniform overcast at about 2-3000 feet and at no point was the light obscured by the clouds. After moving east for a few minutes the object decelerated and hovered. At this point I called my wife and told her to look south. The light moved slightly to the north and then turned white again. A soon as it had turned white, a smaller orange/red evenly pulsing light dropped from the white light and descended at an even rate until it disappeared from view behind the treeline. About half a second after the small light disengaged from the larger one, the larger one vanished.", "Large gray domed disc that was perfectly still and made no noise 2460 feet away and 500 feet high.On or about June 17th, 2008 I was driving home at about 12:00 hours.

It was perfectly still and made no noise what so ever.It was hovering just to the east of the Mesquite air port and remained in place for about two minutes. It then departed to the north and within one to two minutes was completely out of sight. It was the most incredible thing that I have ever seen. According to a map, it was about 2460 feet away. From my point of vision it was about two inches long and one-half inch high. There is no way in this world that I could have mistaken it for any thing else. The color was gray and reminded me of the color of a side walk. Note: I returned to the location and took a photo of the location and direction of the craft.

On or about 1700 to 1900 (I am guessing on time) on a clear day just before twilite some time in the fall of 1974 I observed a sphere moving at an incredible speed.  There were some clouds but mostly blue sky.  It had no tail, no smoke, and no fire so I knew it was not from earth.  I had no depth perseption so I could only guess on its size.  I could tell it was not a plane.  A plane would be like a snail compared to this object.  The object was like a gold/polished bronze color when it shines in the sun.  I heard the voive of Yahweh as I was watching the sphere and  He spoke to me and said in Spanish, &quot;Mira lo que yo hago&quot;. Translated: Look at what I do! I never believed in UFOs and frankly I thought they were diabolic in nature.  As time when on,  I wondered why this incident was never reported in the media.  I forgot the incident until I saw a program on TV called UFO Files: 1970s.  That reawoke in me the desire to investigate the matter.  The program described an incident were a UFO crashed with a plane in Mexico and I knew it was the same object I observed in Puerto Rico.  The object was caught on radar by the U.S. starting in the Gulf of Mexico so I figured it had just passed by Puerto Rico and Florida.  It had to be the same one. I hope I made some sense of this.

I was unloading the few remaining items from the truck. My little dog jumped out of the truck and ran to some nearby garbage cans, I assumed she saw a cat. I just happened to look up to admire the clear, starry night sky. Almost directly above me was a huge, dark triangular shape. It had three lights, one in each corner. I was terrified.

This was not a huge surprise as I was the only one facing north.The sky was still quite light to the northwest and there were small scattered high clouds in the sky. From what I remember the light appeared to be well in front of the clouds, so I do not think it was a meteor. I have never seen a meteor at dusk. If it was a meteor, it was perhaps the brightest one that I have ever seen and it had a greenish tint to it. I would say it had a magnitude of brightness perhaps 5 times as bright as Mars when it is the closest to earth.I watch the Seattle skyline when I go out for walks in the evenings and am familiar with the flight patterns and the lights on the helicopters and airplanes flying above Seattle.

The local time was 10:01 PM (when I first started observing) and the event spanned until 10:10. The object was a pulsating, star-like object that stayed within about 5 degrees south east of epsilon-Cygnus or Gienah. What first struck me was the brightness, near that of Deneb at its peak, but falling to darkness within a few seconds. It repeated this behavior many times. The other aspect was the color, a brilliant blue.  This was observed from central Escondido, California - near 33 deg 7&apos; minutes north, -117 deg 3 min west.So the obvious issue was the elimination of possibilities. First, the object did not travel in a straight line and did not appear to be moving at a velocity for orbital motion, so it certainly didn&apos;t seem to be a satellite.  Second it nearly hovered at some points, not characteristic of an aircraft.  Considering the time duration it was no meteor.  The color and therefore the color temperature, would match a very high temperature object, above 10,000 K.  Not a common object near the Earth.  It did move in the sky, so it wasn&apos;t a distant astronomical object. It didn&apos;t seem to progress like a balloon, but that is &quot;up in the air&quot;. It was no &quot;Chinese lantern&quot; with that intense blue color.  There was no sound. It was too long in duration for an Iridium flash, and was too blue.  So it could have been a high altitude UAV or other test aircraft with a bizarre blue light. It might have been a balloon with a similar light.  It was certainly a mystery and I wondered if it had been observed by others.I am an engineer and amateur astronomer and have been observing the sky for many years.  It was also observed by my wife.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he sounds to us to be an exceptionally qualified, and capable, witness.

It also seemed to move slowly up and down and left to right in a series of right angle patterns. The object was surrounded by stationary helicopters in a rectangular formation (they were easy to see with their red blinking lights and were not airliners heading to Dulles or National airports which we&apos;ve seen before). A few times at least one or two helicopters moved closer to the object at which time it would decrease its glow. I grabbed my camcorder and recorded between 10 to 15 minutes of footage, first by hand from the bedroom window, then using a steady tripod outside in our cul-de-sac. When I zoomed in the object was distinctly diamond shaped with pulsating light moving across the object in a circular motion (white, red, yellow, and greenish). The light was not sequential as if a series of lights were being lit but more like a morphing prism of blended light colors rolling into each other. I&apos;ve never seen anything like this in the six or more years I&apos;ve lived at this address (or anywhere else for that matter) and we routinely see jets, helicopters, and even the occasional blimp overhead as we live about 5 miles north of the Quantico Marine Base and 10 miles south of Fort Belvoir. We also live along the flight paths of Reagan National and Dulles International airports. So, we have a pretty good idea of what normally appears in the sky around our home which is why this just stood out as something very unusual. As for the weather conditions, other than being a bit humid, the sky was crystal clear and the moon was clearly visible behind me to the southeast as I filmed the object which was northeast of our house. Other stars and aircraft (including the previously mentioned helicopters) were also clearly visible and easy to distinguish from the glowing diamond-shaped object in question. As for my background, I work for a major university in Washington, DC with a long career in media and public affairs. My wife and I have a fairly decent knowledge of the night sky and the various aircraft in the area and frequently observe meteor showers, shooting stars when they are forecast for our area (not too mention extended viewings of the Hale-Bopp Comet when we lived in North Carolina) which really made this object all that more unusual to us.", "Something awakened me.

I had always wanted to see a UFO and there it was before my eyes. I couldn&apos;t believe it. It passed us and then we really started searching the sky. After 15 minutes, we saw two more. These looked triangular shaped by the way the lights were fixed. They were a little far but the aircraft were very close to one another. After about 20 minutes then, we kept searching the sky and we did indeed see two real airplanes and that was that. I had to go inside and my uncle decided to go home. As soon as I got into my room, my uncle called me and told me to look out the window. Indeed there it was again. One more triangular shaped aircraft. My uncle tried following it but he lost track due to keeping his eyes both on the road and the craft. When he got home (took him 5 minutes), he saw one above his house and he called out my grandma who saw it. She said it was impossible to be an airplane because it flew so low and had way too many blinking lights. It was about 11:40 and my uncle saw one more above the St. Peter and Paul church. We believe this one was one of the many we had seen before. My uncle we! nt in ba ck inside his house due to a skunk being outside and he looked outside his window and saw one more.

As it passed, it made a &quot;whizzing&quot; sound, but really seemed to be cutting through the air.  It almost looked like a meteor, but it was traveling at an extremely slow speed, very low to the ground.  Indian Lake is not that large of a lake and the ball took about 60 seconds to cross the sky.  It was in the air so long that I had time to unpack my camera, remove the lense and snap a shot.  It did not fade out of before going beyond the horizon and my line of sight.

This light was in the shape of a boomerang. It was not a cluster of lights, but one solid light in the shape of a boomerang. The light was a bright yellow. At the tail ends of the boomerang shape the light faded out. It was slowing moving south. The object was moving so slow and so smooth at first I could not tell if it was actually moving or not. However it kept on traveling and soon was crossing over the highway. Then the object changed shape into a small dot. It looked just like a star, yet kept on moving. Then the object changed back to the boomerang shaped and kept on moving south, very slowly and smoothly, unlike any plane or helicopter I have ever seen. The the object/light, still in direct line of sight slowly faded out. It was NOT as if the object got smaller and smaller until you could not see if because it was getting farther. It never changed size, but the light slowly faded out. There was another car in front of me on the freeway, and we were both originally doing about 80 mph, yet we both slowed down to about 50.

Gore and I had an argument with my parents. I left the house to cool off outside in the backyard. I was facing north at the time and it was night. We live in a populated neighborhood so there were rooftops obstructing a clear view of the horizon. I was standing there looking at the sky and I had to do a double-take because something strange seemed to just appear out of nowhere.There were 7 orbs in a V pattern (the V on its side) gliding downwards from the sky. I didn&apos;t see anything but orbs, no body, no ship, just orbs flying in a specific pattern.Each orb were striped and tri-colored: blue, yellow, pink&apos;ish red. It was closer than any plane I have ever seen and it was dead silent. I felt an intense feeling of bewilderment and even fear. It was nothing like I had ever seen before. My dad then came out of the house but as I was calling for him to come see, the orbs had already &quot;disappeared&quot; behind the rooftops.", "The other night me and my friend went camping in my backyard, and we were just relaxing and having a good time.  It was around 12:30 A.M or something around that and i had to go to the bathroom.  So i went outside to go.  I was on my way back into the tent when i heard a humming sound, so i looked up thinking it was just the helicopter that passes over my neighborhood at night.  I focused my vision because i couldn&apos;t really tell what it was and it was a really bright light that was shaped like a saucer. I called my friend out and so he came out and saw it and we both freaked because it was going really fast and it was flying lower than a helicopter would. So i went back in the tent and posted a bulletin on myspace talking about the alien but only one person believed me.  So then we started to text each other.  I didn&apos;t hear back from her for like an hour or so and she texted me saying that she was looking out her window and that she saw the same exact thing that i described up in the first paragraph and it was heading in the same direction that i said so we both started freaking out about it but i eventually went to bed.

I noticed an orange ball of light and said &ldquo;Hey, what is that&rdquo;? My wife and brother turned to see the OBOL (Orange ball of light) just as it was fading away. It was in the NE sky just above tree level but couldn&rsquo;t tell how far away it was. We talked about it for a few minutes and we saw more lights. They didn&rsquo;t move they would just fade in and stay on for about 5 -7 seconds then fade out. My wife called in to our 19 yr old son and his girlfriend and told them to come out and take a look. They both came out and we saw a set of two lights. One came on then the second. Once the second had reached its peak in brightness the first one faded out then the second faded. I said that it looked like it was only a mile or so away and I was going to drive in that direction to see what I could see. As I got over by Wainwright middle school my wife yelled into the cell phone that there was another one. I put my head between the steering wheel and the windshield of the car and it was directly above me. That one actually had a secondary light that split way from the original ball. Just before I left the house my son was getting his video camera and caught a few sets of lights on his digital video camera. He got a series of three lights just behind the tree line and the light that was over my car. The video shows the second OBOL splitting off the first one. The light I saw above my car would have bigger than my car if it had been on the ground.   I was directly under that one. There were about 6 different sets of lights that night. Some had only one, some had two and a few had three. There were 5 witnesses for the 23rd of July 2008. We saw tiny white non flashing pin lights flying all over the area where we had seen the OBOL. After we had seen the first two lights my Brother-in-law said &ldquo;Look at that little white light flying after that airliner. He&rsquo;s going to hit it!!!&rdquo; It flew VERY fast and caught up with the airliner and fl! ew just above it until it was out of the area then peeled back and SHOT towards the east where it had came from. The very last light we had seen (I was back home by now) there we two pin point white lights closing in on the OBOL from both sides and when it disappeared the two tiny white lights shot straight up into the air nearly colliding and shot towards the north. In total there were about 4 pin lights while this was all going on. The OBOL showed up every 4-5 minutes in different areas in the NE sky. It was 22:40 when we saw the last one and went in to see if there was anything on the news.On July 24th my wife and I had to work the next morning so she went to bed and told me to wake her if I had seen anything. Right on time 22:30 the first one showed up. I ran inside got my wife and this time my daughter was home and I had her come out on the deck to watch. The lights looked the same but were in a different pattern. This time there we several lights coming on at the same time in different parts of the NE sky. On both nights if all lights would have been on they would have formed a perfect horizontal line spanning about a 5-7 mile stretch. My wife called my mother who lives in Clarkshill and her and my brother went outside and saw them. The next day I called my friend who is a police officer and he said he saw them too and had no idea what they were. So on this night we had 5 witnesses in three different parts of the county who saw them.

So, my friend and I put our thumbs up to compare how big this thing was that the radio person saw. Immediately after we put our thumbs in the air, we see a ball of light zip through the sky for a few seconds. The light was of a blue or green tint. It flew below the clouds very fast and was not a plane. The light did not move in a straight motion either, it went straight, then bumped to the left and curved, then continued to go straight. We concluded that it couldn&rsquo;t have been a shooting star or anything of that matter because it did not move in a straight line.", "Sighting in San FranciscoSitting in a park in San Francisco, we saw one light show up in the sky. Looked like a yellowish star but more clear. Then two more showed up creating a triangle. It held there for a second then shot across east bound and disappeared.

The fire works had ended and we started to gather our belongings, when someone said look and they were pointing to the sky.In the sky you could see objects that where flying south to north with four lights on each object.  The lights appeared to be moving on the object in a circular motion.  The color of lights would vary from Red, Blue, Green and White, but on each object the color of the light would always stay the same. If it was Red it would remain red.  I believe there were about 30 objects that went past us. They just kept coming and coming.  The objects would fly close together and in groups then just disappear.  I can&rsquo;t believe planes can fly that close together and that many flying at a time.  It was the strangest sighting I have ever seen.  I grabbed my sister-in-law.  It freaked us out.We had a group of 14 people on the beach with us, but there where a lot of people around us, remember the fire works had just ended.

A metallic sheen caught my eye, and I looked to my right to see a relatively small object (maybe 2 feet to 5 feet in diameter?) flying toward me from the south.  I immediately knew it was something unusual, as it was moving in a strange way&mdash;&ldquo;sliding&rdquo; on its axis back and forth, back and forth, like a rocking chair&mdash;in very precise intervals.  And it did this even as it cruised silently from due south to due north with a straight, level, unwavering trajectory and pace.  My first thought was that it was a child&rsquo;s Mylar balloon, but when it flew directly in front of me, perhaps only 200 feet in front of me and maybe just 100 feet above the ground, I got a very good look at it, and it seemed much more solid than a balloon.  Also, it moved very deliberately, consistently, and not entirely in alignment with the wind (which, I checked online afterward, was about 10mph from the south/southwest).  I can&rsquo;t completely rule out the possibility that it actually was a balloon, but I don&rsquo;t think that it was. When I got a good look at its shape, it seemed like an oddly flattened, concave oval, with a slight depression in the center that was colored flat white, while the back side of the object was colored cerulean blue.  There was also some part of it, perhaps the sides, that were metallic silver and reflecting sunlight very brightly every time it rocked.  It was this bright, shining glint that initially caught my attention, and it&rsquo;s also what enabled me to get up from the picnic table, walk around a building and some trees, and continue watching the object on its smooth, straight, northerly trajectory until it disappeared behind a distant tree-line about a mile away.  (The whole sighting lasted maybe 2 minutes.)  I&rsquo;ve had an abiding interest in UFOs since the early 90s, and I think I may have seen one near Seattle in 1995.  But even though I regularly watch the skies whenever I&rsquo;m outside, this is the first thing I&rsquo;ve seen since 1995 that I simply couldn&rsquo;t figure out.

It had been like this for a couple of days.We have a 3 year old daughter, who was getting a cold and had a bit of a temperature.  Combined with the heat, she wasn&apos;t particularly happy.  My wife was upstairs with her and I was in the living room downstairs.  The lights were all off, and I was sitting in my recliner listening to a podcast on my laptop.  The windows were open at the other end of the room, and next to me the patio doors were also open, in order to let a breeze blow through.The patio doors lead out to decking in our back yard.  I can also see the front of the garage, which has a motion activated light on it.  (This tends to go off when people walk past, or sometimes when cars go by.  It&apos;s quite sensitive.)  Just as my wife came back into the room at 10.20pm, there was an extremely loud roaring noise outside.  The garage light came on (which may have been coincidental) and I saw the object flash over the garage, from the direction of the house (ie from &apos;above&apos; me), and disappear.I went out to the decking as quickly as I could but it was nowhere to be seen.I will give the best description I can.  Imagine a dumbbell (two balls joined by a cylinder).  Imagine that the two balls were flattened discs, with black centres.  The bar joining the two discs had a bright white light on it.  The two discs reminded me of turbojet fans, but this may have been suggestion caused by the noise.  From the light in the middle the object seemed to be made of a shiny metal.I only saw it for about 1-2 seconds, it moved very fast.  It looked about the size of a small car, but I have no way of judging how high up it was.  My wife heard the roar but didn&apos;t see the object, as she was too far away from the patio doors.I have seen several UFO&apos;s before.  These have been a silver disc flying next to Concorde (at age 12, an din broad daylight), a blue light hovering over some woods at night (age 13-14) and a rotating triangle with a light at each corner at night from a car (also at appx age 13-14).

my mate s caravan trailer at the end of the site and the site was located in the country style invironment i mean it was covered with fields and trees and canals so i knew i could get better view because my street had lots of light so it was hard to look up even though u could see the stars it would be better in darker place to see more clearly anyway even though it was late i knocked on his caravan door i remember he s dad saying whos that because i was outside in dark anyway his caravan door opens right up and i say because i know what i can see so i wasnt worried about how late it is even though it must of been beetween nine at night to about ten thirty that was late to me i didnt want to knock but i could still see these things high up faintly, so i thought they would want to see so anyway they look up and i had to show them because the object were hard to see with naked eye but i had no problem an d now me my mate his dad are all outside there caravan looking up from iver towards uxbridge area at what i can describe as looking just like normal stars i mean they were same size, same brighness, just like a star but fainter but there were three or four wen my mum and dad and me saw them first down our street but now because of the darkness and quiest u could look and study them bettter and there was now 8 or nine and they seemed so high up they looked like stars but i knew they was not because they were flying i presume really fast, well faster than any plane because it would take a plane 2mins to turn, at the speeds these objects were moving they could fly inall different directions but these did circle rings aroun each other then u could see couple more apear outa nowhere it was scary because ive never seen object realy high up i mean they were probably on the edje of atmosphere thinking we couldnt see but they kept flying in rings circles and all sorts of flight movement mostly ciculer paterns similer to olypic ring logo shape they were definately not aeroplaines because no flasing light plus u cant have a ! 14 or so plaines do circles and hoops im sure airlines will not alow that where as these object movedand sort like stars but wen u looked closer and studied u think they look like something out of starwars film u know like the fighter spaceships small in size than the big battle ships it looked like those but really far far away im not meaning to be funny there, that just happens to be best descibe my ufo experience when they went in circle or upside loops they did have like tail of what a football would leav behind it u saw someone hit hit fast u see slight fainty effect behind it, all this happened on a winters night of 1989 in berkshire area.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I could see it was indeed an orb from a distance before it went out of sight.After several minutes I texted my radio dispatcher by way of the computer and asked if there were any calls for a meteor or lights in the sky.

I walked south from my home two blocks to a local park.  There was next to no daylight left at this time, just a dusky orange in the west horizon. Just before entering the park, I observed two jets high overhead, I always have a look at jets when I hear them just because they interest me.  This night I also observed Venus, low in the southeast sky, maybe 10 to 20 degrees from the horizon.  The sky was completely cloudless and there was no wind, a perfect night.About twenty to thirty yards after I strolled into the park I looked to the south sky about 40 degrees up and I saw a very bright, white light.  I would say its size was 3 to 4 times the size of Venus (of which I could compare as it was in the sky that night also).  The light reminded me of magnesium burning, that king of intensity, but not so much that it would hurt your eyes.  It appeared to me to move in my general direction (northwards) with a slight turning motion, again very bright and very white. This lasted for maybe 5 seconds before it looks that it turned sharply westward, once it did that its light lost all intensity and appeared then to be a very faint white light.  It was not long (again maybe 5 seconds) before I could not see it at all.  Its motion throughout this observation struck me as craft like.  I have observed stars, planets, aircraft, meteors and comets in the skies before.  This object was truly unique.On a side note, my brother is camping at a nearby lake (40-50 miles away).

There were approximately 8-12 large red lights in a perfect horizontal line, just above the tree line.  We live on a ridge top so I had almost a 360 degree panoramic view of the sky.I did not notice a body of the aircraft, however but couldn&rsquo;t stop saying &ldquo;oh my goodness, you guys come look at this.&rdquo;  Everyone was busy unloading stuff out of the car and it felt like I was talking to myself.  My daughter, 8, came next to me and said, &ldquo;Mama, what is that?&rdquo;  There was another line of approximately 5 to 6 lights to the left of the larger set of lights, which were at almost a 35 degree angle.At the very moment I finally said, &ldquo;oh my goodness, it is a ufo,&rdquo;  while pretty much jumping up and down in disbelief, the two streams of lights merged together into one and completely disappeared into thin air.  There was no turning around, no smoke from a jet, no noise at all.  I said, &ldquo;Did anyone see that, did anyone see that?&rdquo;  My sister in law said she saw the very end of the lights merge together and disappear.  Now, it was dusk and light enough for me to see a body of whatever it was that I saw, but I did not see that.  However, when we went into the house I asked my daughter to draw what she saw.  She is incredibly gifted with art, and has definitely never been exposed to talk of nor seen any movies with ufos.  She had no preconceived perception of what a ufo is&hellip;  She drew exactly what I saw with oblong shapes around the lights.  I don&rsquo;t know why she saw a body around the lights, but she did.  It sounds absolutely crazy, but I think children can sometimes connect with what adults cannot.  Perhaps I was so numb from the lights that I couldn&rsquo;t comprehend the body of an aircraft type object.  I don&rsquo;t know.Stranger yet, I called the police department because I wanted to know if anyone else had sighted this.  They said no and just as I was hanging up the telephone, two US Army jets hovered over the area where I saw the unidentified objects.  It was obvious they were looking for something.  When they couldn&rsquo;t or didn&rsquo;t see what perhaps appeared on radar (I don&rsquo;t know how they would know this was there and where it was, etc.) they turned their jets around and faced our home.For a moment, I tried to tell myself this was what I previously saw, however it was much different.  The lights I saw in perspective to being on the ground and standing, where comparable to the size of car headlights.  This is how large they were in the sky.  On top of that, when the jets left, they were extremely loud.  It is very clear when jets hover&hellip;the object I saw did not make a single sound.  It disappeared into thin air &ndash; in a matter of a second or so it was completely gone.I froze, and cried, in disbelief with my daughter at my side.  My family was relatively upset they didn&rsquo;t get to see what I saw.  My sister in law was pretty frightened, and said, &ldquo;I am going to pretend I didn&rsquo;t&rsquo; see what I just saw.&rdquo;  I said, &ldquo;I hope this is just the beginning.&rdquo;  My daughter said, &ldquo;Mama, what is a ufo?&rdquo;  My story may be crazy, seem unreal, I don&rsquo;t know what it sounds like. I have never researched ufo&rsquo;s but I tell you, once it got into my brain, I tried every way possible to discredit what I saw, and I know that is EXACTLY what I saw.", "Two lights flashing back and forth, moving in unison across the sky. No visible solid object could be seen between them.Saw two reddish-white lights about 30deg. above horizon moving together in the same direction, from south to north. The lights were flashing in an alternating pattern in rhythm back and forth, one in the front then one in the back, in the direction of movement. The distance between the lights, well over the length of a football field, suggest the aircraft was close by, but was unable to see the body of craft due to ground lights and there were no sounds of planes nearby. There were no other lights in the vicinity of the object besides the two flashing back and forth in unison. At first I thought the flashing lights were from extremely tall transmitter towers halfway across town, but since they were moving slowly from south to north in unison it couldn&apos;t have been those.", "sighting over lake areaMy son often comes home late at night because of work. Several times he has told me that he sees a &ldquo;UFO&rdquo; in the sky. Well, last night he dragged me outside to look. I have to admit I was intrigued. As we looked to the south sky you can plainly see a very bright light, this light has rays from it (you can see blue rays if you look closely). This light will stay in one place and then move to any side or up and down quickly. There is no sound heard. It does not move at a constant pace as an aircraft would- instead it just sits and then moves randomly. My son also witnessed it move rapidly one night at a diagonal angle straight toward the lake near where we live and disappear. This appears many nights near our home. We live in the Bixby/Leonard area.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It appeared tilted at an angle.  There was a pin of light blinking every few seconds that was at a small distance from it,  but seemed to be moving with it.   It seemed to be moving extremely slow like it was suspended in air.  We lost sight of it after about 4 minutes.

At first I thought it was an ember from the mortar shells but its trajectory was as straight as an arrow and was unaffected by the winds aloft. It continued from my first notice for at least 10 to 15 seconds into the high atmosphere and then the light went out. I know this could be dismissed as an ember but it didn&apos;t behave like any ember I have witnessed in the past.

One evening, we decided to go down to a pier near the water which seemed to be a popular destination.  When we arrived, there were many other people around the aream probably 100 other people or so.  We walked down the pier to the water and, as we neared the end, we suddenly saw a VERY large object (much larger than a football field  it seemed to cover the sky) moving very slowly at a low altitude.  In fact, it was so low and so large, I can remember flinching and ducking because I was afraid that it was going to strike the large suspension bridge to our left.  The object was completely silent - almost like a vaccum of no noise - and I did not see any type of trail or emission coming from it.  We both quickly looked around wondering if anyone else was witnessing what we saw, but no one else seemed to see it.  Every other person present was carrying on as if nothing were happening.  I can distinctly remember being extremely confused and somewhat frustrated that no one else was seeing what we saw. That is where my memory ends.  The situation is the same for my friend.  This event transpired some eight years ago, and she and I have conversed about it several times since.  We cannot remember what happened to the object, where it went, how we got back to our car, or even how we got back to our hotel.  We woke up in our hotel the next morning and continued our trip Washington D.C..  We were both very confused and somewhat scared of the incident.  We laughed about it to a degree, as young people will do, but we have recently spoken of our concealed fear and confusion about the sudden loss of memory.  Neither my friend nor I had been drinking or taking illegal drugs on this trip or in any period of time immediately prior to or subsequent of it.  We are both college-educated, working professionals with families. Both of our memories of the actual event are exactly alike.  We both saw an extremely large, black object with many small lights (or what appeared to be lights).  The object was so large that it covered most of the sky and it was flying at less than 300 feet (my best estimate).  It is difficult for me to state the exact shape of the object because it was so large.  However, it was rounded on the front end (the end that was moving toward the bridge), so I assumed it was either circular or oval in shape.  I was fearful of it for the brief period of time I saw it, but now, looking back, I&rsquo;m very curious to know what it was and what happened to us after we witnessed it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))", "This event took place on Wrightsville Beach which is a barrier island near Wilmington, NC. My wife and I were stargazing on a beautiful clear night when we spotted a red triangle flying almost straight above us, running silently and parallel to the shoreline. It was softly and evenly glowing red all over and it was about the shape of a classic paper airplane, longer than it was wide. It would have been about as long as your pinky nail is wide held at arms length. It might have been at 15 thousand feet above us-only a rough guess and it seemed to be going about 300 miles per hour. We watched it fly smoothly out of sight in maybe 40 seconds.I was shocked and fascinated to see something so strange but my wife thought it was just some kind of military plane. At that time I believed there could not be such things as ET craft, decided she must be right about it being a plane and mostly forgot about it. I always felt that was quite an under reaction on her part. I trust my own judgment now and I just wanted to share my sighting with other people in the hope they will come forward to tell their stories.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))", "I think my sighting as a child may have something to do with my current abilitiesThis is the first time I&apos;m telling anyone outside of my family about what I saw when I was a child. I&apos;ve always been scared to, but now I&apos;m ready to learn more about it because I&apos;ve lately been experiencing abnormal things in my adult life and want to explore further. I just don&apos;t know where to start and something tells me to start here. When I was about 11 or 12 I woke up from a deep sleep to go to the bathroom. My bedroom was in the front of the house with a big window facing the front yard. We lived outside of town in a housing development so it was pretty secluded but we had neighbors. As I was coming out of the bathroom across the hall, I could see a VERY bright light shining through my window and through my room out into the hallway. I remember walking very slowly, robotically, towards my room. I thought maybe there was a car in the driveway with their brights on and thats when I remember looking at the clock. It was 3:30 am. I neared the window and thats when I remember this heavy feeling come over me. I was totally frozen where I stood. This giant object was hovering over our front yard. We had a couple trees in the yard but it was somehow clearing them but the object was also kind of transparent. I could see the house across the street through the object. I remember it was triangular with curved corners, not pointy. Underneath, in each &quot;corner&quot;, was one large light and in between each big light were straight lines of smaller lights. There was a small circle of lights in the very middle too on the bottom. I could also tell from my angle that the top of it was slightly elevated. Not a lot, just a little curve at the top. Like a VERY short pyramid but again, not pointed at the top but curved. I don&apos;t remember any colors or colored lights. No sound either. I remember thinking that was odd that this wasn&apos;t waking anyone else up and thats when I looked at the clock again and it was 3:30. I had been standing there for a half hour just staring at this thing. I don&apos;t remember it feeling ! like a h alf hour though. I snapped out of my trance and bolted for my parents room. My mom would not get up but I forced my dad out of bed to come look out my window. By the time we got to my window, it was gone. Since then, I have seen pictures in books of the EXACT thing I saw. I also have read where there were similar sightings around the same time in the midwest too. That made me feel not so crazy and I&apos;ve just kind of let it go. I have never seen anything like this since nor have I told anyone outside my family. Who of course don&apos;t believe me. They only make fun of me.  I am almost 30 now and have recently been feeling strange &quot;vibes&quot; as I call them. Ever since I was little I sometimes knew when things would happen or could guess things about people. I always have chalked it up to just being lucky. My sister and her husband recently told us they were pregnant and I knew it was a boy almost as soon as they told us. I told my other sister that I know its a boy. She asked me how I knew. If our other sister had told me first and I said no, just that I knew. I don&apos;t know how I knew, I just did. Yesterday, she called me and said our other sister had told her about my &quot;vibe&quot; and asked how I knew that. I again explained that sometimes I just know things like that. I realize its a 50 50 chance, but I can&apos;t remember a time I&apos;ve ever been wrong. What are the odds of that? Anyways, she did confirm that it is in fact a boy. This same sister has, in her childhood, had odd experiences too. She had a dream about a Christmas present that she hadn&apos;t received yet. The next day she got that exact same doll. Same name and clothing and everything. She also has an uncanny memory. She is the only other person in my family with unusual abilities that I know of. Its not like I&apos;m psychic or anything. I don&apos;t see dead people or things like that. I can&apos;t explain it. I just know certain things. I have certain dreams of things that haven&apos;t happened yet. I just don&apos;t know what that means and want help figuring it out. I can&apos;t help but won! der if m y childhood &quot;sighting&quot; might have something to do with all of this. Its always been something I&apos;ve wondered about. Anything you could do to help would be appreciated.

At first I just thought it was an aircraft due to the fact that there was a large blinking red light, which appeared to be in the center. As it drew nearer I thought that there were an extremely large number of lights around the blinking red light which was larger than any light I&rsquo;ve seen on aircraft that I&rsquo;ve observed flying over. Then I thought, it&rsquo;s most likely one of those sky crane helicopters that&rsquo;s been used in our area lately battling the fires that has ravaged the surrounding mountains to the east. The next thing to go through my mind was do they have whisper mode, because there was no sound at all. All of these thoughts went through my mind at the same time as I tried to rationalize what I was seeing. Then I ran into my house grabbed my camera ran back outside to see the object make a graceful turn to the right at which time I pointed my camera up and took one picture. Thinking I hadn&rsquo;t captured anything because it was dark I lowered my camera while watching the object head north, still hearing no sound. I went back inside and told my wife what I had just seen and then I looked at the photo I had taken. To my surprise I had captured a group of twelve lights surrounding the larger red light. Also, due to the fact that it was a longer exposure it had formed trails, with three of the trails making the exact same pattern in the sky, which I noticed after I put it up on my computer. The other thing that I noticed about the red light is, to me it appears to be closer to the left side as it makes its turn. I have no idea as to what it was whether it was a group of lights in formation or lights fixed on an aircraft.", "Daylight object passes by moon and makes random movements.It was approx. 8:45 A.M. on the day of June 24th 2008 while I was at work I had walked outside and noticed that the moon was still up fairly high in the sky, still lit very well. I noticed a small object bright white in color, oval shaped, heading in a northwesterly direction. After a few seconds passing by the moon it turned to a directly north heading. It then proceeded on this path for several minutes stopping and starting in its movements. I used the edge of the building to get some kind of reference that the object had actually stopped in mid flight. It seemed to wobble at times when it would start to move then stop again. I kept using the side of the building the entire time to make sure what I was seeing was actually true. I honestly don&rsquo;t know what I saw but it was unlike anything I have ever seen before.

Then there were several more that even met up and went almost in circles before disappearing. Lastly, we even saw one meet another, then both go in the same direction with one following the other. They were definitely not plane, or helicopters due to the amount of them, lack of noise, and the strange flight behavior. It lasted roughly 30 minutes, and I would&apos;ve watched longer, but I was getting tired. I wanted to film it, but my small video camera would not have captured it very well due to the dark night and they were pretty high up in the air.

There were five objects that were stationary in the sky in somewhat of a hexagonal pattern that possessed flashing lights that were not of the same frequency as regular planes. I had grabbed my binoculars to take a better look, considering they were at a distance, and discovered they were in rotation around the objects. After observing these objects and noticing other aircraft circling them (airplanes-not airliners) for approximately an hour, five to seven disc shaped objects flew directly overhead and disappeared to the north. The way these objects were maneuvering I had never seen before and they moved so fast as compared to the planes that it was entirely obvious they weren&rsquo;t the norm.

The way I got up on the couch I was sitting facing his windows.  All of a sudden I saw that the yard was illuminated with white light as if their was a emergency vehicle outside.  I then got up to look out the window and was frozen to see a saucer like craft with lights going all the way around it in a circle.  It moved very slow just above the tree tops.  I would say about 2 to 3 stories up, I could have thrown a baseball and hit it.  No sound was being made and I watch not able to move as it went down the road.

I was on the lawn of a mountain resort in north central Washington state, having a telephone conversation with my brother.  The area was being prepared for a corporate dinner by the hotel staff.  The jet passed 1000-2000 feet over the hotel at high speed in a northerly direction and began a near vertical climb.  The jet had vapor trails off its wing-tips and behind it. Just as it began its climb I saw a circular/oval shaped object above the jet at about a 75&deg;.  At first I thought the oval object was just slightly larger than the jet but then realized at the speed it was going I couldn&rsquo;t tell how far in front of the jet it was. It was climbing much faster than the jet and seemed to accelerate at an impossible rate until it disappeared in the blue sky. Both the jet and the object seemed to be the same light color in the bright sunlight. I did not see any markings on the Jet or the oval object. The jet climbed to 20,000 to 25,000 feet before leveling off in a westerly direction. I only heard the sound of one jet, I could not discern any noise whatsoever from the oval object.As soon as I saw the oval object I yelled at my wife who was close by in the swimming pool area. Her view was blocked by trees and she could not see the jet or the other object. There were three women close to me who had the same view as I did. I asked one of the women if she saw it too and she said she saw it but she did not know what she saw. I asked her if she saw any wings on the object and she said she did not.  A waiter appeared and I described what I had seen to him. He said that he had seen things like that before in this location and had assumed the jets were practicing with some kind of remote controlled aircraft. I told him that the object had no wings and travelled at an impossible speed for any known aircraft.  He seemed nonplussed.The entire time this took place I was in cell phone contact with my brother so he heard the events unfold as they happened.  This is a photo of my location when I heard the jet approaching. these pictures were taken shortly after the event.You can see the weather conditions were mostly sunny at the time. The temperature was in the low 80&rsquo;s.I have a lot of experience around military aircraft at air shows around the country,  I am very familiar with military aircraft sounds and maneuvers, I am used to working very close to operational military aircraft of all size and description.  I spoke with a friend of mine who was a fighter pilot and described my experience.  He said that if the military was training in that area it would be a restricted air space which he doubted it was. I checked online and saw that it was listed as MOA (Military Operations Area) temporarily through August 4.I believe this is the type of aircraft I saw and about the same color.  This photo has been flipped horizontally and rotated to a vertical aspect.

I NEEDED TO CONFIRM WITH MY FRIENDS WHAT TIME IT WAS WHEN I CHECKED MY WATCH.  &quot;B&quot; CONFIRMED THAT IT WAS 03:27, NOT 02:27.  OTHERWISE, I HAVE NOT DISCUSSED THE SIGHTING WITH HER.  SORRY FOR THE ERROR.  ~Sc&apos;Eric  [State College, PA -- approx. 2008.07.19+03:27]  A hot, muggy night.  I was with 3 friends:  A, B and B&apos;s 14 yr-old nephew E.  We had decided to visit the Penn State golf course to cool off in the sprinklers.  The sprinklers were not running, so we just laid in the grass and looked at the few stars we could see through the haze. At approximately 02:27, near the zenith, I saw something move that made me do a double-take.  Something about the way it moved was incongruous.  About the same time I said, &quot;Whoa, what was that?&quot;, then B chimed in with something similar.  We lay watching as two white lights (which appeared to be connected) moved from approximatley West to East (left to right, across our field of vision).  We all saw it moving, but I&apos;m not sure how long it took A and E to lock onto it after we pointed it out.  We watched as it traveled eastward (perhaps northeastward) from the zenith toward the constellation of Cassiopaea. One of the first things we noticed was that there was a light on each end, one leading the other.  This contrasts what most would expect to see: 2 lights moving parallel to one another, as the lights on a winged aircraft.  I recall they were not much larger or different in intensity than the surrounding stars.  I also recall that as they passed over the background of stars, they seemed relatively close to Earth, perhaps within Earth orbit or closer, though I cannot qualify what gives me that impression.  They definitely seem closer than the communications satellites I&apos;ve seen pass over since I was a kid.  I did not think to observe whether any of the background stars were &quot;blotted out&quot; in the space between the two lights. As we watched, the lights began to change configuration.  B was the first to notice, exclaiming how they appeared to be moving closer together.  I remember commenting that the configuration shift seemed consistent with the notion that the lights were part of a larger craft and that craft was rotating (in an anti-clockwise fashion).  Additionally, the &quot;object&quot; appeared to be rotating in multiple planes--hence the lights moving closer together.  In about the width of 2 fists (held at arms length) the alleged object had rotated a full ninety-degrees and continued doing so as it traversed the sky toward Cassiopaea.  It was at this point that I began realising (out loud) what subconsciously made me focus on the object: the fact that the lights were moving in a way that was completely inconsistent with the likes of traditional aircraft.  (And, in retrospect, I would also like to point out that the haze and general cloud-cover would seem to preclude the notion that we were observing an orbiting satellite, as we could barely see the stars themselves.)  The two lights started out approximately one or two finger-widths apart (at arms-length)--their widest configuration.  I specifically kept looking for, but found no evidence of, a third light-source which may have formed a triangle. Once the object entered the Cassiopaea, I lost it.  B was able to track it about a minute longer before it disappeared into the haze.  In all the entire duration of the observation was about 1 to 1.5 minutes (for me) and about 2 minutes for B and A.  I never thought to ask E about his observations.", "I started out seeing about 6 very bright lights.They were not moving, they always stay in that one spot.No definite shape.They are there all the time, started early last year 2007.Then when all of the sightings of Stephenville, TX were going on in 2007,They disappeared when the Stephenville incident was over they showed back up.I see them every night in the SE part of the sky from my back porch.", "object in back groung.I was taking a picture of 1 of my customers and didn&apos;t realize what was in picture untill I had it developed.", "It was red orange big and went up slowly.IT was a red orange big oval shaped craft with light around the out side and hovered very slowly went up slowly and vanished.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Please look at them and tell me what you think.  If you zoom in on the object you can tell it is clearly not a star, and it wasn&apos;t moving so it wasn&apos;t a plane or helicopter or balloon.

At the time listed above, I saw what resembled a very large meteor (but was not a meteor or space shuttle) traveling from north to south, as you look from the west at a downward angle of appx. 40 degrees.  The total visible path of the object was around 8 inches with your hand held at arm&apos;s length, though the visible light trail was around 2 inches long and 1 inch wide.  It lasted around 4 seconds, and had a very visible color tint, which I saw as green, but could have been a trick played by my eyes, since it was, after all, nighttime, and I had been looking at a television.  I fetched my DSLR and telephoto lens, but nothing ever showed up again.  Please continue reading, as I will tell you the results of my foot search.(The movie was &quot;Swing Kids&quot; not a sci-fi movie or anything at all!  This rules out any influence from the movie making me &quot;want&quot; to see something.)  I have seen meteors lasting for over 8 seconds, and shuttles re-entering the atmosphere, and this resembled them, except that it seemed much, much closer.  The dimensions of said trail are seen above.  I estimated, based upon the horizon, trees, etc. that the object was 1.8 to 3 miles away.Later that evening, I wondered if the object could have been a plane crashing in the area, and decided to go search.  I pulled out my GPS, marked 3.5 miles, and set out.  I trespassed for hours, and the only civilization I observed was a large oil well complex, with a small metal building.  I got the number to the oil company, and after a little asking around, I found that they do not have any aircraft in our area.  Therefore, I have not resolved what I may have seen.I don&apos;t believe in ailens, there were no &quot;substances&quot; in use, either!  In addition, I called the attention of my mother and brother to the object by saying, LOOK, LOOK!

The entire school witnessed this event, including teachers and administrators est at 700 people.  Why this concerns me is that I had an Uncle that lived on Opa Locka Blvd at that time.  He could not get home for lunch from work via his normal route because the roads were blocked and detours were set up.  He saw something but would never talk about it to me.  All that he may have talked to have since passed.  The way I remember what happened is that the UFO actually landed.

It was a large metallic object that just hovered for over 30 minutesOn Monday, July 7th, I was moving into my dad&apos;s house, as I was putting stuff into my room my dad yelled for me and my brother to come outside and look at something.  As we came outside to see what he was talking about he pointed.  We all just stared, trying to figure out what it was.  My first thought, by the weird shape it was, is that it was a kite. It was just hovering, then I realized there was very little wind (pretty much none), so I ran inside to grab the camera so we could get a better look.  After trying to get a good look at it, we realized it was too far away for a good picture of it, so my brother ran inside to grab the binoculars. When he was grabbing the binoculars we went into the back to have a better view, without the house in the view. My brother came outside with them and all of us were looking through them in disbelief. We noticed one of our neighbors that lived on the other side of the pond was out fishing, which is a teacher from our community, and asked him if he had noticed it. He responded by saying &quot;yes, but what is it?&quot; He observed for a few minutes then went inside. I suggested calling a news station to report it but they would probably think we are nuts, so we called the local police station to ask if anyone has reported a strange aircraft in the sky. They had told us no and to call the F.F.A., we didn&apos;t want to go that far but proceeded to call the local airport, but there was no answer. My dad ended up taking a couple of picture of it to see what we could get out of it. As it started to get dark we had noticed it had changed directions a little and started to shift. When it started to disappear my brother and dad went to go chase after it down one road running east and west and I went to another road a mile away running the same direction so we could try to keep it in eyes sight but it was gone. The funny thing is, is that this was during the daylight, plains were flying lower than it was hovering, and there was nothing in the paper or the news about it. I wou! ldn&apos;t sa y i wasn&apos;t a believer, but I was a skeptic on things such as U.F.O.s and now seeing what I had saw,and then seeing pictures that had been taken and downloaded on the computer it was obvious the shape it was, was like nothing I had ever seen before, it was extremely quiet, there was no motors or propellers. The best two ways I can describe it, is that one way it looked like a fighter jet nose, then behind where the cockpit would be, it was twisted, then the wings, of whatever it was, was almost in a v shape but not quite, it looked like a piece of metal was crunched up and it came out to be in a crumpled but smooth v shape. It is so hard to explain. The other way I can describe it, it looked like a goose flying, but 10,000 times larger and it definitely appeared to be metallic and had straight lines.

I spent a weekend on a beach called Ein Geidi which is a reaort on the Dead Sea. We were sleeping on the beach, just as we got into our sleeping bags, we could see in the sky an object moving from right to left, and slowly up and down. We stood up and watched this object, which was quite far in the sky over the dead sea for about ten minutes. We were transfixed on this object as it stopped suddenly, then shot off at great pace. I can&apos;t remember the shape. As we sat down and talked about our experience, two jets flew from behind us up over the Dead Sea towards the object and into Jordan airspace.

She lived about 15 yards right beside of where our clubhouse was at. My brother said that the object stopped when I was knocking on her door. When she walked outside my next to oldet brother said it shot off so fast that he only caught a glimpse of it. My neighbor was saying &quot;where at, where at!&quot; I told her that she just missed it. I didn&apos;t see the object stop when I knocked on the door, because I was to focused on trying to get my neighbor to come see it.

It was still light out (sea blue sky).After taking the initial photo I checked it in the review screen (digital camera)and saw that there was an object in the picture that did not appear to have been in the sky at the time I took the picture, or afterwards, when I checked the sky. I took 4 more photos and the craft is present in 3 of the shots. In the remaining 2 there is a cloud that seems to have &quot;absorbed&quot; the craft. Upon enlarging the photos and examining the details, I found that this almost perfectly circular cloud was present to the lower right of the craft in all of the photos that had the craft in them. Upon examining the photos in the order they were taken, in the first three, the craft seems to have moved in a v pattern in the sky. Then in the fourth the cloud becomes prominent and the craft is gone. This is more evident in the fifth shot, where the cloud is seen very prominently at the top of the photo as if it was rising upwards. The following night I took more photographs of the same area and although I did in fact capture this cloud once again, the same craft does not appear to have been present at that time. Although two smaller objects, that were present in the 7/7/08 shots, were in fact visible and were photographed on this day as well. I did visibly see in the sky, which did not move in conjunction with regular star patterns. Upon enlargement of the 7/7/08 photos, what may be the most clear view of an unknown craft can be seen. It appears to have changed its alignment in all three photos.In one it appears to be two diamond shaped objects that are connected at some center point. There is a light on each side (almost as if a flame exhaust) that obscures detail of the craft and it is a brilliant white in the center with a almost electric blue peaking at the top and at the bottom. In the second photograph, the vessel is more prominent and appears to be more like two Isosceles triangles on the sides connected by a tube or cone like center. The lighting on the craft is more of a greenish white on both sides at what would be the base of the triangles, which escalates into a definite electric blue at the tips. the center seems to be reflecting the light from the sides. the final photo (which is actually the second) gives the clearest view of all. It would appear to be two side propulsion elements attached to a main structure in the center. The sides appear to be shaped like the front of a clothes iron with the exact detail of the center is definitely rounded in some way, but is obscured somewhat by the light emanating from the sides. The entire craft has a green glow to it, that seems to come from two dome like elements atop the side structures. They glow the color of a green GE &quot;party bulb&quot;and have an electric blue &quot;aura&quot; above them. i would like to include a website where the pictures have been posted as well as a video I am in the process of making with closeup shots of the craft, however to keep anonymity, I obviously can not. I will check this site more closely to see if there is some way I can link the site to this site or have the link posted. I have over 1000 photographs of the same area and am diligently examining all them ( I have already found additional images that may contain a similar, or the same object and/or its lighting track.) This is absolutely not lens glare a reflective surface or any other such camera &quot;tricks&quot; that are frequently attributed to such photos. The photos were all taken at 100 ISO which would have required the objects to be remaining relatively still (or moving very slow) due to the shutter speed. Photographs of airplanes moving through the air taken at this setting, will appear as a streak of light in the sky. I have your e-mail and will submit some photos to add to this report after they have been properly processed.", "silent, V shaped object with reddish-orange glimmering light at the bottom of the V moving NE to SW.Flew from the northeast to southwest about 11:00 PM, then turned directly south and made an abrupt turn west. Not a right angle, but a very tight turn. Bright, almost throbbing orange-reddish glimmering light. I was watching TV and noticed the odd light out the window, I went to look, at first thought it was an airplane on fire, my wife and I went outside and watched it for about five minutes as it made it&apos;s way from the northeast, turn south then go west. It wasn&apos;t moving very fast at all, but steadily progressing. When it made its turn, it was near enough that we would have heard if it was a plane, but there was no sound. Do to the high cloud ceiling, we could also then see the shape against the clouds, looked somewhat like an upright &quot;V&quot;, the ends pointing upward and the glimmering light at the bottom. And by glimmering, it was kind of throbbing, but with no certain pattern, that&apos;s why I first thought it was a plane on fire. The airport is to the west, but it wasn&apos;t following the line the planes normally do and passed by to the south of Indianapolis International Airport. I host an internet message board pertaining to automobile racing and I asked if anyone else in the Indy area had seen it. Many people were still outside at the time veiwing fireworks. I had 2 responses on the message board from people in the Indy area that had witnessed the same object and both had the same reaction I had.I work in the insurance industry and my wife is a registered nurse.", "Power surge that effected the whole block and the car electronicsAfter fireworks, around 10:45PM, there was a power surge that occured atleast in my block that I know of. Seems like it effected the whole block as the street lights went out too and it took a while before they flickered back on. The whole block was dark for a few seconds. I didn&apos;t think too much of it till the next morning when I went out and got in my car. All of my car settings had been reset to factory defaults. I own two later model BMWs. I got curious and went to the other one to see if something effected that one too, found out to be the same exact issue in the other one also!! Everything in it was also reset to default factory settings, like stereo, gps and other settings. Even the seat memories had been lost, in both cars.I almost want to think that it had to do with the power surge that had occured the night of July 4th 2008. It was too much of a coincidence to ignore. Not sure what caused the surge and what did it have to do with the cars as they are not part of the grid. So something other than the grid may have caused all of this.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

The craft flew in our direction for about 7 or 8 seconds growing larger and then banked sharply to its right, bearing South.  As it turned, it gained altitude and speed.  Best guess of altitude was between 2,000 to 5,000 feet.  Speed at the turn was between 400 and 600 knots.  Speed as the craft rose out of the turn and disappeared increased to well over 1,500 knots and kept increasing as the craft disappeared.We live in Ventura next to the Oxnard airport (very small, local airport) and are also in the flight path of LAX for large jets going to Europe.  We see many passenger planes at night at about 20,000 feet.  Being an avid sky-watcher and novice astronomer I am very well aware of altitude and speed of objects in the sky.  I feel VERY confident of my estimate of altitude and speed.  I have never seen anything in my life move this fast and accellerate so rapidly.  Utterly astonishing! The craft made absolutely no sound and was very low and very close.  It was bright orange with no blinking lights, only a very bright glow.  As it grew closer, before it turned it seemd to be a diamond shape.  Upon turning, the craft left a small aura behind it that dissipated almost instantly.  It was not a lingering contrail like an airplane would leave.  Instead, it looked like vapor coming off the object from such an immediate change in direction and speed (air compression leading to vapor).", "Small single light the size of a small star moved at a moderate speed very high up then glowed very very brightly and dimmed quicklyI witnessed this in the western part of Brampton, Ontario, Canada at 03:20 hrs.  I was looking up into the sky &ndash; as I often do &ndash; and noticed a small light moving at a steady rate overhead.  It seemed to be very high up and I thought it may have been a satellite &ndash; as I have seen these on many occasions.  I watched as it maintained a steady movement across the sky from the southeast to the southwest.It appeared &ndash; in size &ndash; to be the same as the smallest surrounding stars and equally as faint/bright.  As it got most of the way across the sky, it suddenly got brighter and brighter and brighter until it was almost as bright as Venus &ndash; which was in the western sky some distance away.  It was almost as if it was a satellite that entered the atmosphere and burned-up.  It dimmed rather quickly from it&apos;s brightest point and there was a hazy blue-white glow in the sky where the sighting ended.  My eyes were temporarily affected by the brightness &ndash; I couldn&apos;t see as well in the dark for several seconds &ndash; this is how bright it glowed.  If I had to describe it, it reminded me of burning magnesium &ndash; something I witnessed several years ago in high school chemistry class.I don&apos;t know what this was but I am certain it was not an airplane.  It could have been an object which burned up in the atmosphere.  It was far far far to slow to have been a meteor.

It was very bright and different from any color of the fireworks. I asked my husband, who is an airplane mechanic, if he knew what it could be .He could not identify the object. It was red in color and approached quickly. As it passed overhead, it started to disappear behind some low clouds, but we could see that it had no blinking lights and it pulsed slightly.It retained it&apos;s round shape. It moved to the west, over the trees and out of our vision.I looked back tword the east and saw another identical object following the same path. We watched it go overhead and disappear in the clouds. There was no sound from the object.Looking East again, we could see 3 more red orbs in the distance. One was closer than the other two.

They appeared to be relatively low compared to seeing a commercial airliner at night.  Although it is hard to judge vertical distance at night we estimate these objects to be below 10,000 feet.One observer works in Forest Fire Management and has significant experience dealing with aircraft as a helicopter management officer.The orange glow was constant and steady and as the first and third objects passed overhead the light diminished and disappeared.  The second object approached and when it was directly overhead it appeared to change direction and shoot straight up then disappeared.

It was a clear night and I was at home after finishing some work.  I went out onto my 2nd floor terrace for a cigarette and noticed it was a starry  night.  While looking at the stars I noticed a strange shaped object in  the sky.  Under the impression it was a satellite I turned off all the lights in my house fast (there were only two on on the 2nd floor so it didn&rsquo;t take long) now in total darkness the object was still visible.  I live in the country so it is very quiet and dark.  The object was moving across the sky in a north-westerly direction.The object was emitting a yellow-orange pulsating glow and was the size of the moon.  It was at around 20000  feet  off the ground.   Having seen many satellites before I realised this was of foreign origin.  It was at too low an altitude to be a commercial plane and the wrong colour lights were there.After about one minuet the object passed my house and was no longer visible.

It was lightening to the South West.  I had just got out of Crandall when I saw some lightening and immediately followed by a turquoise flash of light near the ground several miles off.  It looked like the lightening may have hit a transformer.A few minutes later I saw the flash again in the same spot.  It was very bright and lit up the sky like lightening but it emanated from the ground.  It flashed like a fast strobe for about a second.  It had the look of a search light or a focused beam of light where you can see the path the light takes through the air, but it was in a wide arc.As I got closer to Seagoville I could see it better and it looked like it was coming from the ground somewhere between 175 and I45.  The light flashed the turquoise light and I was close enough now that I could see pink light mixed in.It was so bright that it lit everything up in the turquoise color, like how lightening gives everything a blue tint.I&rsquo;m not sure if something was exploding or if it was firecrackers (it would have had to been an insane amount if it was), or some kind of show going on in a field.  It could very well likely be something mundane.

I would like to think that this is just some crazy hoax. I have 6 cats, two dogs, and live in a rural area. Our property is 1-1/4 acre deep. We live in a desert area and have some natural growth (sage, yucca, Joshua trees, etc) along one back corner of our yard. We left it for privacy reasons. There is an electrical pole in that particular corner, as well, but situated in the lot behind us. The lot behind us has no home on it. It&rsquo;s one of the few vacant lots in our neighborhood, and is full of natural growth. I stayed up late the night before last. Yesterday morning I woke up at 5:15 am to my favorite bunk buddy (cat) digging at my face. He does this on occasion and it is usually an annoyance that lasts for a few seconds, until I get him to lie down, so that I can resume sleep. Yesterday morning he kept doing this nonstop until I finally just decided to get up. I walked out to my kitchen, fixed a cup of coffee and lit a cigarette. It is on rare occasion that I get up this early, as I am not a morning person, I like to go outside and take in the morning sunrise. Something about sunrise is just so peaceful to me. Well, yesterday morning was just kind of eerie, I felt a slight headache coming on, as I started to head out the front door, but then decided to go out into my courtyard instead. I have a table and chairs out there where I can sit.  The sky was kind of eerie, without any sunshine. It was more like an overcast morning, but without the clouds. As I stood, looking at the back of my yard I saw some bright red flashing lights in the back corner of my yard, lots of them covering about a six sq. foot area, through the overgrowth and underbrush. I thought perhaps it&rsquo;s a fire truck or something, or an ambulance. But what would an ambulance or fire truck be doing in a vacant property. I started walking toward the back of the property to the lights. He lights were obviously on the outside of my fence, by an electrical pole. I started thinking maybe someone is getting ready to do some electrical work, but why 5:30 in the morning? The closer I got (My property runs deep.) the more I could hear rustling in the bushes. Then I saw my two dogs, one was running back and forth along the back fence sniffing, but not barking. The other dog was sniffing around outside the bushes. I yelled for both of them and neither of them acknowledged my call. They never even looked at me. This was very much out of character for both of them. I frantically started yelling for them, as they suddenly got interested in what was going on behind the bushes. I didn&rsquo;t want them trailing in because I had no idea what or who was rustling in the bushes. Both dogs headed into the bushes right away. My two dogs running up behind me, from the front of the property, smiling, tails wagging as usual distracted my attention. I looked back in front of me and everything disappeared, as though nothing was there. No red lights, no dogs on my side of the fence, nothing. I don&rsquo;t know if anyone else has had an experience like this before, but I would sure like to know about it. I know that I am a sane human being. I know that I was not dreaming. Incidentally my headache lasted almost all day long. I don&rsquo;t drink, and do not do drugs. If anyone else has had anything like this happen, please list it because this is really bugging me. I was never afraid during the episode; except for thinking my dogs were about to get involved with something or someone in the bushes. Afterwards, I was a little confused, and reluctant to tell even my husband.", "two dim lights following too closely to be satellites or airplanes...We were looking at the sky to the North, because the stars were out and it was pretty. We noticed two dim white lights following each other at a speed a little faster than a satellite. They were traveling from the South to the North, and following each other too closely to actually be satellites... and definitley not airplanes. We watched them pass for 3 to 5 minutes, and then the trees blocked our view. They stayed on a straight path, no variation, no changes in speed.", "Star-like craft over Phoenix Arizona inthe daytime.The date I have provided is approximate only because I witnessed these craft on a daily basis for over two weeks. I already have numerous sighting statements on record at MUFON that I made daily during the sighting period. My first sighting of the star-like craft was made in the afternoon here in Phoenix while I was outside on a break. I was looking up at a jetliner that was cruising overhead out of Sky Harbor International airport and I noticed what appeared to be a star shining directly over my head at about 2PM in the afternoon. I was perplexed as to why I would be able to see a star in the middle of the day when suddenly the &apos;star&apos; started to move very slowly and then stop. I watched it make these manuevers for about 6 minutes but my break was almost over and I had to go back inside to work - however, I thought that I just had to figure out what it was I was looking at. It was so far up that I figured it must be at about a 60 thousand foot level or so. It started moving again and then it just &apos;popped&apos; out of existence altogether ! I was freaking out at that point. I began to deliberately look up at the sky for the duration of my breaks and lunches and sure enough, every single day I saw these star-like craft just appear out of nowhere and for the most part they would just move across the sky until they were no longer in my range of sight, but the thing that really got to me was the FACT that they would just suddenly appear out of nowhere. About the 3rd day of my seeing these things, I watched a total of 5 of these things appear from the same part of the sky and then move off into different directions until I could no longer see them. On one occasion I watched two disc shaped craft fly over our building at about a 20 thousand foot level and fly side-by-side from west to east at a very fast rate of speed and disappear off in the horizon over Scottsdale Arizona. I would have to estimate that they were flying at around 2000+ miles per hour because of how quickly they traversed the sky. No sound at all came from any of these craft at any time. I did on 2 different occasions have other employees outside with me that watched the UFO&apos;s with me so I at least had witnesses to verify what I was seeing. I don&apos;t know what I saw other than the fact that these craft made moves and achieved flight speeds that exceed any known aircraft that I have ever witnessed in my lifetime. Phoenix is has a major air force base to the west called LUKE AFB and it wouldn&apos;t surprise me to find out that they have been tracking these craft yet they will never admit it.

I immediately turned on a northerly cross street to pursue the object which appeared to be a a very low elevation (40 to 50 feet). and climbing steadily.

I could not tell how far away it was but I knew it wasn&rsquo;t close by the way the trees were passing between it and I. I drove to the other side of the bridge and turned around to get a better look but the object was not there. I drove to the other side of the bridge and turned around again and when I came to the same location to look for the object again it was not there but there was another object farther away and at a higher elevation. I pulled over and looked through my binoculars and it appeared to be shaped similar to a dark cigar but with a distinct bulge towards one end. As I was trying to fine focus on the object it &ldquo;disappeared&rdquo; or faded out.  It did not move in any direction, or go behind clouds (there weren&rsquo;t any), it just faded out.

My girlfriend&rsquo;s son (13 yrs. old) and I (44 yrs. old) were facing northeast, talking. Our friend (35 yrs. old) was in the pool, facing northeast, talking to my girlfriend who was facing the rest of us, southwest.  It was about 9:30pm or 10pm.  This was July 18th.My girlfriends son and I were facing my girlfriend and our other friend who were in the pool.  The pool is surrounded by condos and palm trees.  As we were all talking, I saw a neon glowing, oblong object &quot;fall&quot; from about 500 feet or less at a 45 degree angle, right over the building and palm trees, from right to left. The object was about 50 yards away from us. It disappeared behind the building.  Two of the others saw the same thing, except for them, it started out as a red object that turned green.  I thought I saw yellow inside the green and a black dot inside the yellow.The funny thing is, there wasn&rsquo;t a trail behind this object and it didn&rsquo;t make any noise coming down and didn&rsquo;t seem to crash into anything.  The size was very hard to determine.  It could have been the size of a basketball or it could have been the size of a small car.Nothing went up in the sky, like a flare. No sound was heard from it. No sparks.  Just a closed looped, oblong shaped, red, then green/yellow/black object.We weren&rsquo;t drinking or anything else. No missile testing. Three of us saw it.  I&rsquo;ve never seen a &ldquo;u.f.o.&rdquo; before, neither had the others.", "Stealth flying craft were not developed until many years later.June 1963 Naha Air Base, Okinawa, Japan.During my tour of duty at Naha Air Base, Okinawa, sky watching for aircraft arrivals and departures became a favorite pastime. On one clear night, my Airman buddy ((name deleted)) and I raised our binoculars scanning the skies for aircraft. From experience, we could accurately identify most aircraft.Standing on the second floor sundeck of our barracks, we had an unobstructed view of the runway and skies over the air base. Although we sky-watched for over an hour we saw nothing. Nearing ten o&rsquo;clock, we became bored, so we opted for stargazing. Frank had much knowledge about the regions of the stars in our galaxy. He had just begun pointing out a few of the more common constellations when it happened. Something strange appeared out of the corner of his left eye. It was a UFO.&ldquo;Look! What the hell is that?&rdquo; Frank yelled. &ldquo;Marty do you see that?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yeah Frank, I see it. Holy mackerel, what is it?&rdquo; Scared and grateful for Frank&rsquo;s presence, my first instincts told me to get the hell away from there. However, despite my tendency to panic and run, I had a strange and intense compulsion to keep on watching. At the same time, I was ready to bolt back into the barracks for cover.It looked like nothing we had ever seen before. I positioned my binoculars for a better look. We did not use the term &ldquo;UFO&rdquo; at that point, but we knew the craft we saw did not match anything in the Air Force&rsquo;s aircraft inventory. We saw a large, slow-moving disk traveling in a steady northerly direction--right smack over our base.We did not see the usual flashing navigation lights or red and green wing-tip lights.  All pilots who fly at night must have their aircraft&rsquo;s navigation lights turned on.It was not just an unusual cloud formation, flares or a weather balloon. In the Air Force, working as communications specialists at control towers and around busy flight lines, Frank and I became knowledgeable about most types of aircraft in the military inventory.It traveled at an estimated speed of one hundred knots. The craft held a steady altitude of three or four thousand feet. It had a diameter of about seventy-five feet. We saw no antennae, dome, windows or markings. It was silent and produced no engine noise. Having a disk shape, it looked as flat as a quarter.  The craft&rsquo;s outer surface appeared smooth, constructed of a dull, yet reflective metallic material. Its outer edges appeared razor thin.&quot;If it turns toward us, I&rsquo;m out of here,&quot; I said shaking all over.&quot;Me too,&quot; Frank agreed.Our fear level started to dwindle once we realized that it continued moving away from us. To afford us a better view, we climbed up the building&rsquo;s fire ladder to gain access to the roof. First up the ladder, I hesitated at the top of the ladder and peered out to see if it was safe to advance.&ldquo;Hold it Frank!&rdquo; I said stopping to look and be sure the craft had not made a turn toward us. Since it continued moving away&mdash;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go Frank!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s still heading north.&rdquo; I had an eerie feeling that we were about to place ourselves in a vulnerable position on the roof. However, seeing it continued to move farther away from us, our first fear that alien creatures might spot us subsided. Raising my binoculars again, I noticed that it had reflected a noticeable degree of light coming from Naha City, found a few miles to the north of our base. We watched it until it faded away out of sight. The entire sighting lasted for about two and one-half minutes.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to tell someone,&rdquo; Frank said.After scrambling down the fire ladder, we sprinted to a staircase leading to the first floor. We reached the C.Q. or Charge of Quarters room to use the barracks phone. We had to tell someone in authority. By then, Frank had begun to hyperventilate. I told him to sit down in a chair and stay calm while I called the base control tower operator. From frequent visits to the control tower for communications equipment issues, I intuitively remembered and dialed the correct number.&ldquo;Tower&mdash;Airman First-Class Bernard speaking.&rdquo; His voice had a calming effect on me. I knew Airman Bernard by his first name, George. Since he occupied the same barracks as we did--ate in the same mess hall and from my many visits to the tower for communications repairs, he knew me as well.&ldquo;George,&quot; I said, trying to catch my breath. &ldquo;This is Marty from the Communications Squadron.&rdquo; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t put a call in for any problems,&rdquo; George said. &ldquo;How are you? Wait a minute&mdash;let me turn off the phone recorder.&rdquo; His first impression was that my call was for something unrelated to tower business--perhaps it referred to a question about stereo equipment&mdash;one of his favorite hobbies.&ldquo;No George,&rdquo; I suggested. &ldquo;You better leave it on for this.&rdquo; &ldquo;So, this is official business huh,&rdquo; he commented with an official sounding tone of voice. &ldquo;All right, I turned it back on. What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; &ldquo;Did you see it?&rdquo; I asked.&ldquo;See what?&rdquo; he replied.&ldquo;That huge disk-shaped object that flew over the airstrip just two minutes ago.&rdquo; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see anything. Are you sure?&rdquo; he asked.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure George. Frank saw it too. We watched it from the roof of the barracks.&rdquo; After I described what we saw, Bernard paused for a few seconds considering his next action.&ldquo;That&rsquo;s weird,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Hold on while I check with the radar center.&rdquo; Waiting for Bernard&rsquo;s report, I noticed that Frank had calmed down while he listened to my conversation with the tower. The minutes seemed like hours. We were dripping wet since the temperature inside barracks was at least ninety degrees and the humidity at ninety-eight percent.My imagination went into overdrive as I waited for Bernard to come back on the line. I thought that at any moment we would hear the roar of afterburners from our F-102 jet fighters as they went scrambling into the sky in pursuit of whatever it was that we reported. Perhaps the Base Commander would come on the line to ask us for more details about the sighting. We might soon hear the shrill of the base&rsquo;s alert sirens followed by the sight of speeding trucks carrying frantic troops to their battle positions.Instead, Tower Controller Bernard came back on the line. &ldquo;Airmen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I hate to tell you this, but the radar people have had no contacts for over an hour.&rdquo; &ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; I yelled. &ldquo;Did you check with Kadena Center?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes I did,&rdquo; Bernard said, &ldquo;and the Army NIKE site too. They also said they had no recent radar contacts.&rdquo; His response was shocking to say the least. Controller Bernard suggested that we file an Unidentified Aircraft Report.Heads shaking back and forth, &ldquo;Thanks anyway,&rdquo; we told him.We decided--how could we file a report on something we saw without physical evidence to back it up? We understood we would have needed at least radar reports, photographs, or more eyewitnesses.We never did file that report. We hoped we would hear others talk about spotting it too, but no one ever came forward. For weeks, I spent my free time watching the night sky and hoping for another sighting. I even bought a Nikon 8mm camera. I carried it with me wherever I went&mdash;just in case.My hopes of seeing it again began to fade after several weeks. However, just as I started to think the earlier sighting was just a onetime fly-by, I saw it again.Returning to my barracks from a second shift tour at the Communications Center, I decided to relax for a while. I sat in a chair on the second floor outside landing. Propping my feet up onto a railing, I began reminiscing about the first sighting. Since I was alone, the thought scared the hell out of me.Just before 1:00 a.m. I was about to call it a night when it reappeared. A craft similar to the type Frank and I saw one month earlier.In an instant, my mind switched from a relaxed state to one of &ldquo;fight or flight.&rdquo; My body froze and my adrenaline level skyrocketed. My hair hackled. My heart raced. I could not move my legs. My camera&mdash;I left it in my room.In my mind, I calculated the best course of action. There I was, sitting alone in the dark outside my barracks with no one else around, except--what? Common sense soon prevailed. No light beams were shooting down at me from the craft. It became clear that it took no notice of me and was moving northward away from my position. Thank God.After a few seconds, my brain regained control of my body and I was able to move my legs. I stood and took the next logical step, I ran like hell. Sprinting down the long hallway to the center of the barracks to get to the stairs, I thought it best not to look back. I did not. Reaching the stairway, I made it down the thirteen steps to the first floor in three or four leaps. At the bottom, I turned and ran straight to the C.Q. office phone.The Charge of Quarters had been dozing at his desk when I grabbed the phone to report the sighting to the control tower.Airman Bernard answered on the first ring. &ldquo;Tower, Airman Bernard here.&rdquo; &ldquo;George, this is Marty from the Communications Squadron. I just saw it again!&rdquo; I explained. I was nearly out of breath and spoke with a nervous stutter. &ldquo;It looked the same as the last one.&rdquo; Bernard must have heard me breathing heavily and sensed that I was anxious. He told me to be calm, relax and tell him what I had seen.I recounted the event as it happened. He put me on hold as he checked with three different radar sites scanning the island&rsquo;s airspace.The C.Q. awoke hearing my conversation with the tower controller. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;You look as though you just saw a ghost.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, not a ghost,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain later.&rdquo; After what seemed like hours, Bernard came back on the line. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had no radar contacts for two hours,&rdquo; he said.Again, he advised me to fill out an Unidentified Aircraft Report. I did not bother. For the second time, I declined. I felt that no one would believe me without proof.I thought if only I had brought my camera with me.", "White orb sighting over Corvallis Oregon moving slowly from west to east.On the night of July 30th I was waiting for my girlfriend to show up at her new apartment on Grove Street in Corvallis.  I was laying on the hood of my pickup watching the sky.  After about 5 minutes of waiting I became bored and jumped down off the hood and just happened to glance in a northern direction toward OSU.  I noticed a very bright white light that appeared to be very high moving very slowly from west to east. The light was white with a sort of reddish/orangeish hue around the edges, and it was shaped like an orb.  I watched it for almost 30 seconds and it then it just got dimmer until it vanished.  I talked to a buddy of mine and he thinks it could of been just a meteor, that could explain how it got gradually dimmer and then vanished.Also of note about 5 minutes after this occurred I was watching the sky in the general direction that it disappeared and I noticed what looked like an object with orange lights rotating around it, heading south at a high rate of speed.  I lost sight of this one as it flew behind a tree and I only saw it for about 3 seconds.  I will admit I was pretty excited at this point and this could have been an airplane, especially since there was an airport in its general direction of travel and it was fairly low.One more thing a light aircraft, looked like a twin engine Cessna, passed from south to north about 3 minutes before my initial sighting of the orb.", "Three UFO&apos;s cat fight then fly offmy father was rambling one day about something he told me before late about 10pm and i would gaze at the stars alot cause i was told an uncle of mine used to do this all the time, i thought i was seeing a satalite slowly moving cause i sometimes watch them but then another light looking like a star or satalite moved to it then another came out and it was 3 star looking things slowly moving and sometimes shooting at but around eachother like a cat fight, i mean it was sometimes like that kitten letting its play partner see it is getting ready to creep it like a play attack then launches at him they roll a bit and separate and pause, after a few times of doing that they separated and shot out different directions and disapeared.

After the flash I saw a large, wide trail streaking towards the southwest.  The trail was yellowish in color, with green towards the leading edge.  After the flash and trail disappeared, there were two parallel gray streaks which lasted for several seconds.  It didn&rsquo;t look like any meteor or fireball I have ever seen, maybe space debris re-entering?  It looked more like some type of exhaust trail or plume from a missile.  I checked the local paper and the internet for any other reports, all I could locate was the following entry in an astronomy message board. Maybe someone can identify what TV station the person is talking about.Object crashed by Ca. border last night.Just heard on the news that an object was observed, looking much like a meteor, but changing directions, then hit the ground.

We pulled the car over after watching it a bit longer but by the time we got out the car to get a better look (within less than 10 seconds) it had disappeared.", "Five Intense Beams of LightThere was some lightning still in the area following a storm two hours earlier. Shortly after 11:00 p.m., I heard a deep buzzing sound outside similar to the noise a faulty electrical transformer makes. I looked to the west which would have been the northwest corner of 156th and Meredith St. in the northwest corner of Urbandale, a western suburb of Des Moines, IA. Each time a heard a buzzing, the western sky lit up. Thinking it was a transformer, I wasn&rsquo;t alarmed. I kept watching but was then startled to see five intensely bright blue-white beams of lights shooting up from the ground into the air to form a fan of about five degrees in span. The lights were fixed relative to each. The lights went out, then back on again. Then the whole light array fanned to the south and disappeared. When I looked to the south, I saw a faint orange glow as if a tree was on fire, but then that glow faded. There was no further sound. Inspection of the area from the car the next day revealed no transformers in the area. The farmer&rsquo;s field showed no visible signs of disturbance from the road. The electricity went out the next day for about two hours. We were told there had been a &quot;public accident&quot; that had caused an electrical failure.

As I passed the Hamburg Street exit (Exit 5), I noticed a peculiar light arrangement to my right approximately 1.5~2 miles away.  The lights were in a vertical alignment, like what you would see if a commercial jet banked 90-degrees.   At the very top was a pulsating white light (not flashing).  Below that were two blue lights.  Much further below (50 to 100 feet) the blue lights was a single red light. As I followed it moving away, it seemed to be a shape like a vertical cigar. It caught my attention and I tried to keep it in view.  I but it disappeared behind some taller buildings in the city to the North.  I then drove around another mile to the Church Street exit (Exit 7).  While exiting the thruway, I saw the same light pattern over my left shoulder.  This time, it was much larger and the light pattern was now 30-degrees from horizontal.  The craft was heading southeast towards Lake Erie and was travelling without making any detectable noise.  If it were a commercial jet, it would definitely have been very audible at the low altitude it appeared to be flying. The exit I was on is off of an elevated section of the thruway so I quickly descended to a point where my view of the craft was blocked by the thruway. I raced to get to a location where I would have a clear view over Lake Erie.  I reached an opening about 20-seconds later, but to my dismay, the craft could not be found. In the close up view (2nd sighting), the red light was bright and not flashing.  The blue lights now appeared to be more of a blue glow like from some type of propulsion system.  I would compare it to the blue lights on the rear of the starship destroyer in the movie Star Wars.

A Solid Black Craft.....On the 9th of March, 1995, around 3 PM, I was sitting in the kitchen of my home drinking coffee and savouring the impressive view of the north shore mountains that border the city of Vancouver.Suddenly my attention was drawn to a triangular formation of three dark objects slowly approaching from a valley in the distance. Taking somewhere between 5 - 10 minutes to approach my location. As they did, two of the objects moved away to the east along the mountain range, the third coming to a halt almost directly in front of where I had now relocated myself on the verandah.I rememberd a camera in the house that had a telephoto lens so I ran in and got it and proceeded to note further details through the lens. In the clear blue sky the black craft had 2 distinct &quot;bumps&quot; on the upper surface, and though apparently stationary, was clearly rotating.It was so black no shadows on the craft at all. Not only was I awestruck , but also scared, though not quite sure why. At this point the UFO appeared to be the size of a dollar coin (Loony) held at arm&apos;s length. At no time during the lengthy observation did the craft reflect light from the brilliant sunshine. It was later assumed that as the object was visually just below the height of the distant snowline, then its altitude could have been around 3000 feet or less. No accompanying sound was heard.Suddenly realizing additional witnesses were close by, I called out to them and I was joined by 5 others. This group watched the craft through binoculars. It wasn&apos;t until the object began to move away to the west did I realize that the camera was not empty and had only 1 picture to take left on it!! Trying to time a profile shot befor it got too far ..being unaware that all three UFOs were within the view finder I snapped a shot of it and when I got the photo back I could see all 3 in the shot.The total observation of this sighting was approximately 45 minutes..", "Charting a UFO and identifying its points of originPeter Davenport,    I want you to understand that the date of this FireBall  streaming across the treeline from my position facing toward Hartford in the southwest and to the river that was running from the northwest southward from the other side of the forest on the outshirts of Enfield, Connecticut is exact the path this Orb took. It appeared as I said as if the sun itself had fallen from the sky because of its massive size and the circular diameter of the sphere, it made no sound and nor was there a sound previous to its appearance to indicate a major explosion of some magnitude coming from that region of the countryside, it appeared as though it was approximately 10 miles or so from the street we lived on that ran parallel to the trajectory of the object in question and that of the river the other side of the forest itself, it was heading in a north, northeasterly direction after reviewing my homes position to that of Hartford and the River that divided us, the Smith Family lived directly behind our house on the next block, the Zimmerman family a few more streets over from them. The silence of such a huge sphere ROLLING across the tree tops and emitting whipping flames from upon its surface gave you the feeling that the core of this object was solid while its surface was entirely engulfed in a all encompassing mass of burning gases and surface material, no wind, not a whisper of the massive flight of this globe of fire could be heard as it passed, no crash, no explosion, its as if it was headed toward the coastline and gravity had no effect on its elevation as it traveled the distance from which I was could visually detect and remain captivated by its enormous size and silence as it moved through the evening sky to a destination I had no indication would be anywhere close by as it disappeared in the evening sky.I&apos;d like to mention yet another personal experience, that wasn&apos;t so personal when you consider all the news at the time that was generated in the Community of Great Falls, Montana shortly after the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II. It was months later and I had contacted a local priest from Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Great Falls. This priest has since been removed from active service with the general public, he has suffered a stroke on the left side of his body and his memory isn&apos;t exactly what it use to be. In the early 1980&apos;s, maybe around May of 1982, during that late spring month my wife and I was awakened by a glowing light from the back yard of our home that was hovering over our very large weeping willow tree, it was as if it had landed and was gathering information or discharging a genetic message. The air was still and the sounds in the distance echoed as if you were inside a tunnel. Across the alley, on the next block... 2606-5th Avenue South a police car was parked in the middle of the street looking directly into our backyard, the sound of breaking glass could be heard for a very brief second from that location, the whole area of the neighborhood was as if it were in a vacuum and echoed each sound as if you could detect a pin drop from down the street, the engine on the patrol car was silent and there was no other vehicle traffic that could be detected in the general area that was mobile, only the flashing lights of a police car setting in the middle of the road out back and it remained throughout the night. Above our tree was a cloud that resembled a Maltesse Cross, its four triangular shaped inner arms were of a stewing blackness that could only be understood from the depths outside our planets atmosphere, this is what&apos;s really particularly curious in relationship to the Enfield Connecticut incident where a report of a 4 pointed cross was reported earlier in the Kecksburg, Pennsylvania incident which I believe is one and the same in more ways than one! Very interesting coinci! dence in deed!!!    The other portions of that Maltesse Cross between the cross figure itself was pure white and just as luminous as the light of a full moon on a clear night, even that of a bright florescent blub. It hummed as though vibrating as though it was discharging a message or extracting a source of matter that had called it forth in that midnight hour. Maybe from beneath the earth at the roots of that tree a line of communication was being established with the earth itself and its inhabitants, maybe it was answering a question that&apos;s fimilar to us all.This experience has vanished from most all records in the area after a military investigator came to the area and researched the sighting that many residents of Great Falls had reported to the Great Falls Tribune and to Military officials at Malmstrom AFB the days following its appearances, this phenomenon occurred during a period when I was employed for about a 6 month period as a supervisior at a local Sambo&apos;s Restraurant. The incident was centered at 2605-6th Avenue South in Great Falls , Montana . I still own the property there, for some reason I still feel attached after that experience, who wouldn&apos;t feel such a bond? This is yet another unexplained event that now appears to be totally erased from the record books because of government involvement. The priest I mentioned earlier is in a housing facility run by the church for aging priests in Great Falls . This priest was contacted by me the morning of that Maltesse Cross had hovered over our tree. I spoke with Father Hersinko a number of times about this event and told him that for some reason or another I was certain that Light would remain in the area for three more days and could be spotted above in the evening sky&apos;s canopy in its original shape in a northwest trajectory as a group of distinguished cloud formations resembling that Maltesse Cross or wheel with spokes; you think that during that time satillites would have detected this formation, maybe the military did! I expect the Great Falls Tribune that had front page coverage of this event from so many callers would still have information on this case in question, I think they do, but find it very difficult to locate. That priest after that event was over was removed from his position at Our Lady of Lourdes Church and placed in a small church about 30 miles out of town on Highway 200, I believe the town was Fort Shaw that serves about 150 perishioners. I found that strange seeing he was only in his earlier fifties and was the priest in charge of not only the church services, but the grade scho! ol it op erated in the community of Great Falls . Well, that night of the Maltesse Cross incident I told my wife as we stood 30 feet from that tree looking up at the swirling mass of black ink and that extremely white soft halo that divided the two prominent features into very distinct patterns that I should go and venture up to the tree and climb-up and see what if anything would occur... she ruled against it and seemed only interested in going back into the house and finishing her sleep. The police car was still parked in the middle of the street watching the figure with, I suspect, much interest. I imagine the police report was sanitized, as well in this actual case of multiple sightings that week, it shouldn&apos;t have been. Maybe you can further investigate and inform me as to what your findings were! Another aspect of this event which was discussed with the priest was the Montana State License Plate on my Vehicle, &quot; Sacrum&quot;. I had mailed one of these license plates to Pope John Paul II with a note that his life was in immediate mortal danger, that was 7 days from the attempt on his life where he was shot and a bullet struck his sacrum bone, go figure... I had never written a letter like that to anyone before, quite a coincidence, I had never communicated with the church prior to this event, but I did have an undeniable urge to get personalized license plates earlier that year... it was a plate that caused some interest with local officals, I retired that license plate after that incident. I was mostly consumed with getting my wife pregnant, my doctor told me forget it after numerous visits to his office... around 9 months after the Maltesse Cross incident we had a son... in 1983. His eyes were as if oriental, that&apos;s always puzzled me a bit. He&apos;s a good son, he works two jobs, has graduated from college with 3 degrees in business, I feel I&apos;m very blessed to have him. It&apos;s funny how life evolves, it&apos;s amazing the mysteries that sometimes make those blessings seem all the more important in our own particular lives! . If you find the information concerning this event in Great Falls during that time frame drop me a line, at the time I failed to document this important event in my life seeing it was all over the news at the get go. Just one other note of interest a symbol, an image was conveyed, through this 1982 incident, an image I suppose as ridiculous as it might seem I will forward to Peter Davenport at his e-mail address: &lt;director@ufocenter.com&gt;", "Possible UFO&acute;s seen over Dresden, Germany, no unusual flight paths or speed. Please suggest explanations.We were sitting in our local pub (about 50 people outside) when one of us pointed up to the sky, drawing our attention.  A rather large orange-red, very vibrant pulsating light was visible moving straight across in an airplane-fashion, about the same speed.  We had limited visibility through bushes and pub-inventory, when we noticed that there were additional objects with the same appearance that floated farther away from the one we just spotted. At first glance it seemed like a helicopter, however the number of objects and the rather intense light and color would not have justified that conclusion.  I went on to a better spot to examine these objects and a friend followed me.  Surprisingly no one else of the few people we had made aware of the objects followed, after the incident they explained it was due to disbelief.  We&acute;re not sure how many of the guests in the pub had noticed them as well.  We gained full sight of the sky, about 2 objects were flying to our left, with the rest in no particular formation to our right, in front of them.  They were flying level, apparently with considerable distance between them (the first one we noticed was just glowing so much, seemed much closer), and at normal, aircraft-comparable speed. After watching them for some time and taking a photo via a cellphone, one after another began to disappear.  The size of the glowing balls began to shrink, until there was only a very small but shiny star-like glow visible, then they disappeared completely, one after another.  It did, to me, not seem like they were speeding away as it is common in ufo reports, but rather that the light got smaller until invisible (it did not dim out).We are examining the possibility of these objects being candle-balloons, however from our observation that does not seem to be a possibility due to a) the extremely bright orange-red color of the objects and b) the straight level flight of all of the objects (horizontal, not upwards).((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))[edit - i&acute;m sorry it was just today in july, not june.]", "Two men see very bright light from sky, and then another flying object afterwardsMy friend and I were sitting outside of my house. The sky was perfectly clear you could see every star. We had all of the outside lights off and were just sitting there talking when a bright light, almost like a ball of lightening, shined through the top of the trees. It was very bright, and scared us a lot. We ran to the end of the driveway, about 15 yards, only to find no kind of air craft such as an airplane or helicopter to be visible. It was almost as if someone took a picture of us from the sky. At first we thought it may have been lightning but considering there were NO clouds in the sky and we saw no other flashes of lightening we had decided we may have seen a ufo. Later, about five minutes after the burst of light, I was determined to see something else and I did. I saw a very quickly moving object, which looked almost like a shooting star fly over the top of us. I dont think it was a shooting star because it had two purple streaks of light coming from behind it as if it had wings and engines. The drawing from the sighting in Lexington, Kentucky on your home page looks very similar to what I saw, may have been the same thing.  My friend did not see this object, because by the time I could say &quot;look&quot;, it was gone.", "Bright, multicolor light hovering in air in rural Santa FeAfter leaving work in rural Santa Fe around 12:15am MDT, two coworkers and myself observed a light in the West that was slightly larger than a star, but changed colors. The lights would change rapidly from red to blue to green to white and then it would repeat those colors on a regular time interval, but the order of the colors would change. Red and white would appear simultaneously.We observed the light for quite some time, and it seemed to be hovering incredibly slowly and in a somewhat circular pattern. Occasionally, there would be smaller lights that would &ldquo;shoot out&rdquo; from the main light &ndash; it looked like sparks. Toward the end of our observation of the light, the light in the sky seemed to move vertically slightly.Our location in rural Santa Fe never has commercial or private aircraft fly over it, and it was far too high in the air to be a helicopter.None of us have ever witnessed a UFO, and what we saw completely defied any explanation that we could come up with. I myself believe in the existence of UFOs, but the other two do not. What made this experience all the more interesting is that even with skepticism, we all believe that what we saw was a UFO and we all saw the exact same thing.", "Red square shaped lights hovering by the full moonOn 7/17/08 ,   I was in Ventnor  NJ ,    half mile south of Atlantic City ,  on the boardwalk , over looking the ocean.

I kept my eyes on that spot , and about Five minutes later they reappeared ,    only farther to the right of the moon ,   again for 10/15 seconds.Another five minutes passes and they appear again ,  this time back in original place ,   only smaller , As if farther away.   That was the last time I saw them.   There were a few other people on the beach , and As I was going to ask if they saw it too ,  the objects would fade.There is no mistaking what I saw.

When the &apos;firefly&apos; arrived at the bottom of the bushes it got a bit brighter. My son said &apos;walk with me&apos; and nothing else to his 2 friends. When they came around the corner of the bushes, the &apos;firefly&apos; suddenly turned bright blue and grew to the size of a baseball and shot at an angle over a parked school bus and disappeared into the sky.  All 3 witnesses saw the bright blue baseball sized light and were startled considerably when it made the sudden physical change and took off.  I was just at my sons place tonite for 4th of July celebration and both the other 2 witnesses were there, and made the same exclamation about how it startled them and how it zoomed into the sky from the base of the bushes.  And they all said there was no sound from the object.  It seemed to be a definite reaction to their presence.", "first things first i am not a english major... that said i was driving south towards flagstaff arizona on hwy 89 just past chandler when i was looking at a strange cloud to my left and saw an object just coming out of that weird skinny cloud. at first i thought i had seen my first weather ballon, it was shinny, round, silver and hovering. still driving 75 miles an hour i watched it as i drove as much as i could. It moved right alomg with me on 89 the whole way to flagstff 45 mn.?but had deceptive speed and stable movement, not fast, but way to smooth for a ballon or plane for that matter , thats the best way i can descibe its movement. at times when looking at the object,a different more distant, smaller faster moving light was present behind it. much of the time my radio station was changing stations but that does happen on the road with a shitty i pod connector but i thought i would at least mention it.I watch it as i pull into flagstaff and park and watch  stay completly still for more than 30 min.im guessing 5000 ft above ground very clearly visable above sunset crater area. im looking around at peaple to see if they see it , nobody.i still dont know why i didnit ask anybody if they see that to but i did not.it was reflecting sunlight of it silver sides, shaded underneath perfect sphere.this basically freaked me out . after 30 min. of watching this parked at dennys i went inside to eat, kind of hoping that when i came out it was gone and it was.later that day drove to havasupi indian reservation to meet friends that were 6 hours behind, sat to wait for them and begin seeing the smaller more erratic moving further distant object that was behind the sphere before . realy quick moving daytime star looking thing.that only lasted for 20 sec.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I was facing towards the Potomac River looking slightly north-west at a group of three bright stars that formed an astrological triangle.  I am no expert but I think it was a group that includes Polaris.  As I was gazing at these stars just to the left a very bright light flashed head on then disappeared.  It did not shoot across the sky it came on then went out almost like someone turned on a flashlight in the sky then turned it off.   It was 10 times the size of the stars I was looking at.

In the sky, almost above the tree line to our west-south-west was a brillian stationary light.  It reminded me of the large lights that illuminate the fields for night time stadium games.  There was no sound at all.  It also reminded me of the type of light a helicopter might have to illuminate the ground in a search. (but, no sound)  I turned for a second and it was gone.

The object was moving kind of slow, as I walked down the driveway to watch this object,  was when I noticed more the haze or aura around it. It seemed to all of a sudden disappear as I was watching it. When I walked back up the driveway, I looked up again and saw the same object moving in the same manner as I have described. I again walked down the driveway and watched the object and this time it had disappeared.

Since I already had my binoculars in my hand, I zoomed in on it up close it was squared off in the front like a bay windows yet rounded as it tapered off towards the back,it was totally silent did not make any wild manoeuvres, Stayed at constant speed, no lights or flashing lights at all, it just traveled a straight low line until I could no longer see it.No way was it a balloon, it was a dead air night no wind whatsoever.Left no smoke/com trail.When observed through binoculars the membrane was transparent, and oval in shape.I could see through membrane but the &quot;teardrop&quot; shaped craft was solid with defenent shape.I did not panic, felt no fear or anxiety, just intent on details.Plus it was traveling too fast on a horizontal heading.It was not a plane for it had no wings and as close as it was I would have heard the engines, this craft was silent.I would guess the size -30x20x5&apos; towards the back. I honestly can say now that I have seen something in the sky that I can not explain..It was not a satellite, plane,swamp gas,hang glider, balloon,jet,dirigible,shooting star,or helicopter .I know the constellations,I have see MANY satellites and shooting stars, we live in a City with a International Airport so I have seen all kinds of aircraft including stealth military aircraft.By its description It sounds like what a friend and his father saw about the first of June 08.The one they saw was flying at tree top level at a constant speed,with some manoeuvring and in the same area of the city.It also had that weird membrane, was teardop in shape the only difference was the craft they saw was emitting a reddish light and was much lower.I realize this is only anecdotal evidence, one mans story, but I will never forget it and from now I will have a camera along with my telescope and binoculars!", "The strangest light I have ever seen, and the fastest accelleration I have ever seen.I was sitting on my front step on the evening reported, and heard a jet and was watching it travleing from West to East, when a flash of white light cauget my eye in the South.

I as well was being entertained with the neighbors fireworks, when all of the sudden what appeared to be a plane on fire was in the sky in front of me.  the reason I say on fire was because of the unusual orange lights.  Since I&apos;ve never seen anything like it I immediately thought of fire. It appeared that the front right engine was on fire because of the concentration of light on that area. The lights were very bright but thats when things got strange. One why would lights on a plane if not fire be pointing upword more than down.  Two at that point it was moving so slowly just a straight path no funny movements but I&apos;m still thinking plane on fire . Then I realized NO NOISE which would mean the plane should be coming down (no sound = no engine). But in fact it stayed at the same highth the whole time. I told my nephew to go get everybody else they had to see this.  The &quot;plane&quot; was directly above us at this time. still no noise. But maintained an altitude of what I assumed even using a single engine plane for reference of about 10-15,000ft.

At this point my mind even though I&apos;m open to anything still didn&apos;t or couldn&apos;t wrap around seeing a UFO.", "bright silver cigar shaped object appeared in the air ahead of me when I was teenager driving home after schoolThis happened to me 40 years ago.  Over these many years one sighting and an historical event that followed have haunted me and I have never known what I should have done at that time.  Heck I was 17 years old, driving home from cheerleading practice.  I questioned my own credibility that day.  Who would believe me? I told my mother when I got home that I saw a flying object that I couldn&rsquo;t explain.  She had little to say other than, &quot;I don&rsquo;t know what to say about that.&quot;  For what it is worth, here is my story:  April 4, 1968.  I remember the day because it was that evening that Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated.  The events of that late afternoon coupled with his tragic death colored my world view forever.  I made a promise that I would remember everything.I left the Gainesville High School gym at about 4:15 pm.  My family lived in a small brick ranch house on Lake Lanier about 6 miles outside of Gainesville, GA in Hall County.  I headed east on the Cleveland Hwy while listening to WDUN radio.  At that time the Cleveland Hwy. was a winding 2-lane road lined for most part by large trees and small residences sparsely spaced out.There was a restaurant called The Big Bear at a bend in the road.  It was noted for the cage in the parking lot that housed a large bear.  (In hindsight this was a cruel thing, but in 1968 it was just a promotional gimmick for a dingy old restaurant.)  Once I cleared the bend and lost sight of the Big Bear, the landscape opened up.  Trees had been cleared years before to make room for Riverbend Baptist Church on the left and a small strip mall on the right.  The sun was very low and bright behind me at that point.  I recall that my rearview mirror caught the sun and I slowed down because its reflection in my mirror temporarily made seeing ahead more difficult.  I adjusted the mirror so I could see, but I still was going very slowly.At that moment in front and above me I saw it.  The object had suddenly appeared from the south or southeast.  It came to a dead stop.  It did not waiver.  It hovered silently above the highway.  I looked in the rearview mirror to see if anyone was behind me and there wasn&rsquo;t.  I wanted someone else to see this.  (There weren&rsquo;t a lot of cars on the road because most people didn&rsquo;t get off from work until 5 so I saw few cars in front or behind and passed few cars traveling in opposite direction.)  I slowed to almost a stop while my eyes fixed on what hung suspended ahead and in the air.  Its size I could not begin to guesstimate.   Its altitude I couldn&rsquo;t say.  But I can say that it was metallic silver because the sun that had so bothered my eyes fropm the west reflected on part of the object.I thought at first it must be a jet the military was testing.  But there was no noise, there were no windows or markings and I saw no lights.  It was daylight and if there were lights they had to be white and were indistinguishable from the sun&rsquo;s rays that bounced off the right side of the cigar-shaped object.  I knew I was looking at whatever it was from the side.  It could have actually been a disk.  Its smooth shape was almost too perfect. It stayed there for a number of seconds, but it seemed like minutes to me because of all the thoughts that raced through my head.  My body felt as though something passed through it.  I vowed to remember every moment.  Maybe one day someone would want to know when I first saw an UFO.All of a sudden it catapulted to my left and was gone.  Not a trace.  Not a sound. It was as though it disappeared, but for a nanosecond I did see movement and I know it headed north or northwest.  I simply don&rsquo;t know which because the road twisted and turned often.There was another strange occurrence at that moment it left.  The radio DJ or news reporter commented on Martin Luther King, Jr. being in Memphis.  I distinctly remember something about a garbage collectors strike.  Now I had given very little thought to King in my short life.  I heard the things my parents said and I had listened to the &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech which greatly impressed me.  But heck I lived in the Deep South and there was controversy that swirled around him.  Back to the story.  At the moment I heard the radio and saw the object disappear from sight a thought passed through me, MLK was going to die that day.  Now this thought came to me between 4:30 and 4:45 EST.  King was in Memphis and was shot at 6:01 pm.  It hadn&rsquo;t happened yet. When I got home and after I told my mother about the UFO, I asked her if she had heard about King being killed. The question was asked because I thought it was strange that I was aware of his death and yet the radio announcer had said nothing.  I turned on the TV to see if there were any news bulletins.  During those times there was no 5 PM news.  There were no bulletins.  So I thought to myself, &quot;You are crazy.  That UFO has rattled you and crazy stuff is going through your head.&quot;  I plopped down in front of the TV and was the typical teenager.At some point that evening a news bulletin did come on and said King had been killed. My first thought was, &quot;Why did it take so long for the news to announce this?&quot;  Then Walter Cronkite (I think it was him) said King was shot on the balcony of the Lorraine (sp) Hotel at 6 pm.  My heart started pounding.  That was wrong. He must have died earlier. You can&rsquo;t imagine how I felt.  I had known something was going to happen to King, but I couldn&rsquo;t interpret my instant knowledge at the time it was revealed to me.  I wouldn&apos;t have known what to do.  I thought I was crazy.Over the years I felt such guilt.  I could have stopped it.  I could have called the radio, but I was so young and had never had anything happen to me that could be classified as weird.  The UFO sighting and the knowledge that King was going to die occurred almost simultaneously.  I didn&rsquo;t sleep well that night.So as you read, these two things are entwined for me.  I can never separate them.  Everything is so clear from that afternoon and evening and yet it was 40 years ago.Since then when I hear about UFO sightings, I don&rsquo;t doubt that some of them are true.  Over years I wondered what it was I saw.  Funny, I never thought of the object being piloted by aliens, at least not aliens of a hostile nature.  At some point during my college years I found peace about what it might be.  I came to believe that the UFO was piloted by the descendents of humans.  Maybe this seemed plausible because as a young child I loved science fiction.  I have always chosen to believe that time travel would one day be possible, far off into the very distant future. When the technology exists to transcend space and time, our descendents, whatever they are like, will come back to witness history.  I don&rsquo;t believe they will or can tamper with us very much because if they do, they could be destroying themselves.  Their mere existence hinges on us.  The desire to understand from whence they came, what we looked like at this primitive stage, how we lived, and what formed our values is certainly things to study.  They are looking for themselves.  No, I don&rsquo;t believe in aliens that truly are alien to us.  I believe in beings that have evolved and long left earth.  They have populated other celestial orbs.  They won&rsquo;t bother me or anyone else.  I am one of their ancestors. I know that my story is in the distant past.  Before the Internet I didn&rsquo;t concern myself about what or who I should tell my story.  It was shared over the years with only a few close friends.  Still before I aged anymore I wanted to tell my story for the record.  I saw something I couldn&rsquo;t explain. It flew at a speed I couldn&rsquo;t comprehend.  I don&rsquo;t know why it stopped there or why I was the only car at that point past the bend. I have wondered if anyone else saw anything that day in North Georgia, but I never heard any stories on TV.  I presumed that either I was it or the others were like me.  It couldn&rsquo;t be explained and people questioned their sanity. It still amazes me that NO ONE has taken a credible photo.  When these things appear they are often too far away to get clear shots.  No pilots who have claimed to see them up close even had a camera and could record it.  There have been so many hoaxes over the years that the few that have credibility are questioned.  I didn&rsquo;t have a camera that day and even if I did, the event passed so quickly I could have never gotten a shot off.  Surely someone at some point with get a verifiable photo that can be blown up and will make it evident to everyone.  We are out there.By the way, I have never seen another.  It was a one-time thing, but I still look up and hope that before I die I can see another.  If I do I won&rsquo;t wait 40 years to share it with you.", "Observered unmistakeable very bright metallic saucer/disc hovering and moving slightlyUFO Sighting  I was traveling east on Highway 40 coming into downtown Hayden, Colorado  to pick up a pizza at Wolf Mountain,  traveling at 20 - 30 miles per hour.  The sky was dark  blue with some sparse cirrus type clouds.Looking into the sky in front of me I had observed what appeared to be an unmistakable disc, a very bright shinny metallic silver, a silver unlike any I had seen before.I had thought to myself, maybe it is a very shinny old plane moving forward, however it was moving slightly to my right as if semi-hovering.  I could not take my eye&rsquo;s off of it as it,  again ever so slowly shifted to the right .  I had also noticed a jet much farther distant and very  high with it&rsquo;s vapor trails.I thought to myself this is definitely a disc and was watching to see if it would make any sharp movement&rsquo;s, when a tree branch and than a number of buildings obstructed my view for about 5 to 10 seconds.I observed the craft itself for about 10 to 15 seconds.When that area of the sky came back into view there was a wide funnel/chimney cirrus type cloud extending vertical and angular to the left, in it&rsquo;s place.  The disc was gone.I stopped at the pizza shop, got out the car and went out across the street to get a wider view.  If it was a plane it would still be in view somewhere, I thought.  Nothing in sight except for this broad funnel/chimney type cirrus cloud.I looked at my pocket watch and it was 12:30 pm Mountain Standard Time.The size of the disc relative to the sun was very near one quarter to one fifth of the Sun.  Relative to a star it was perhaps 20 times larger or more.((name deleted))5:44 Mountain Standard Time  I AM going to sketch a drawing of this scene.", "Three orange glowing  lights slowly moving across the sky.The objects made no sound. It was glowing orange, what seemed to be two large lights on top of one another and they moved from the North to the South then disappeared. First 1 then 1 minute or so another appeared. they slowly moved across the sky (which was extremely clear with no planes just stars) then began to disappear then another appeared from the same place in the sky as the others then followed the same slow path then disappeared too. this all took about 8 minutes. They looked exactly like the photo taken in Macky Indiana. 7-4-08. May I start by saying I am (was) not a believer in sightings and thought it was camera trickery. But. Wow, I am sitting here now still wide eyed and in amazement of what I just saw, I could not no way, no how see what they were. It was real. I am still in awe! Wow. Please if every these objects are identified, let me know.", "Reoccurring visitations?  Senses altered.This has occured a minimum of 3 times before but this event was the last and most vivid, although all ocurred in about the same fashion.I was 10-11 at the time.I awoke in the middle of the night to the sounds of what sounded like fast whispering, my eyes were closed so I assumed I was swimming out of a dream and hearing dream stuff, so I opened my eyes.  I heard the whispering with my eyes open.  At this time I knew the thing was happening again. It is strange and hard to describe, but I will try.I have this overwhelming feeling of guilt or saddness, or some sort of PHYSICAL-emotion that is either overwhelming or bad.  Gravity feels stronger or muddy-like, and every thing I stare at grows, or my eyes had telescopic vision.  All I wanted was for this to go away as soon as possible.  I would therefore go to my mom&apos;s bed and lay with her, staring at everything growing with this terrible feeling inside and outside of me.  Words and crying didn&apos;t seem possible at these times, so the other witness, my mother, was unaware.  I think I  cried when I was younger.All these events I thought were personal until one night a caller on Coast to Coast named Brian described almost the exact same events happening to him when he was younger.  I almost cried.  I say telescopic vision, he said things grew when he stared at them (he specified his mom growing, so he was probably feeling the same thing too and went to her).  He also said he saw those two white theater face masks, you know, I think the one is laughing and one was crying, up in the corner kinda just there, and I freaked out because I had one of those in my house, or so I thought. I swear I have a memory of having them but thinking on it for four years now, I am positive we have never owned that. That is weird.I swear everything I wrote is the absolute TRUTH.  I even left out my speculations so you will not dismiss this odd one.  BTW, is there a name for this phenomena, I would Love to find out or talk to someone with similar things.  Also I still get little drops of the emotion from time to time.", "The light speed up fast and then followed behind us and then ziped away and was gone.but yet there was no sound.My daughter and I were traveling threw the Shawnee one of the back roads home,when a very bright light was speeding up behind us I was the driver of the vehicle, I then said &apos;&apos;why is this guy traveling so fast and speeding up behind us&apos;&apos;,my daughter who was in the car as well then looked back and saw a bright light as well..... I continued to be confused because the very bright round light was in air when I continued to look back and say what the hell is that it zipped away just diapering to our left and was gone in a flash.well you could not make a left turn we were driving threw mountains in the woods when it vanished.My daughter and I were freaked out and didn&apos;t know what to think.when we reached home we shared our experience with everybody but they just laughed at us so we never mention it or nor do we discuss it amongst each other,But it never leaves my mind to wonder what was that? what did we see.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))", "Three spherical shaped objects flying in a triangle position and slowly rotating.We noticed three spherical shaped objects to the east of where we were watching fireworks the evening of the Fourth of July.  They sky was clear and visibility was perfect.  At first it looked like the three objects may have been flying due west in a straight line, but then got into what looked like a triangle shape and begin to almost rotate position while they dropped in altitude  (the top point of the triangle would drop down and one on the bottom would take its place).  The rotation seemed to be fairly slow as all three only made one full rotation.  We observed this pattern until one of the objects on the bottom of the triangle dropped out of our view and the others followed.  The objects were bright white in color. Also to the east of our location is DIA (Denver International Airport).  At first, we thought it may be planes, but the object&rsquo;s flight pattern would be almost impossible for a plane to follow, especially for a commercial plane that would be at DIA.  We also do not think it was helicopters either because the angles at which the objects rotated and then dropped would be too sharp. Fireworks were happening about two miles west of our location and you had to turn completely around to see these objects.  They were definitely not fireworks, due to their location and that they were visible for much longer than fireworks would ever be.", "I was driving east on a road that runs through a forest preserve. I saw a chevron shaped metallic craft. A first i thought it was a plane. But it was moving to low to the ground and it was performing a number of maneuvers that aren&apos;t possible for a plane. It was about 2 or 3 miles to the north of my car. it stayed the same speed as my car, staying next to it for about 1 minute and 50 seconds.

I saw my first UFO as reported on June 17th, 2008.Since that night, I spend about 1 hour per night watching the skies&hellip;hoping to see it again.Since June 17th&hellip;I swear I have seen white orbs between 9:25 pm and 10:35 pm Chicago time&hellip;every single night except one night.  In fact, I stopped reporting them as they became regular&hellip;and I am speaking to someone in a few days from MUFON.  Now&hellip;people have told me to get a photo or a video of it&hellip;and I have, and will download some of them as soon as I get access to a DVD drive&hellip;or have one installed.  But&hellip;tonight&hellip;I filmed a orange/white orb heading due north&hellip;pretty high altitude&hellip;and as reported&hellip;before&hellip;it stopped&hellip;and hovered.  But this time&hellip;it turned off the lights on the craft and it hovered somewhere.  I tried to re-acquire the orb for about 20 minutes with my video camera&hellip;but I lost it up there in the night sky soon after it stopped.  I kept looking.  Suddenly&hellip;just north of where I thought it stopped&hellip;.The orb lit up the entire sky around it.  It was by far the biggest and brightest light that I have ever SEEN in my entire life.  It looked like lightening in a huge circular sphere.  It was lower than when I first filmed it too.  I swear I pulled up my camera&hellip;and it immediately shut off on me!!  It took off slowly for one second&hellip;and the 2nd second&hellip;it took off faster than anything I have ever seen fly before!!  It streaked away&hellip;with a huge white trailer. It is so frustrating&hellip;because even if I was totally ready&hellip;and the camera stayed on&hellip;I would have missed it&hellip;it was simply too fast&hellip;It was gone in a blink of an eye.  It makes me almost skeptical of other videos.  Who the hell can catch these things on film so easily?  I mean&hellip;who has a video camera on their shoulder all night long, like I just did for the last 4 days?

I have seen them start up from a dead stop&hellip;three times now&hellip;and it is the most amazing thing I have ever seen.  It is not a shooting star or meteor for sure.  It is a craft&hellip;it hovered&hellip;shut the lights off&hellip;and s! tarted u p again&hellip;and took off.  Something is controlling it&hellip;and I just don&rsquo;t think it is the TR3-B&hellip;unless it lights up like a lightening bolt.  I will take a polygraph and provide my video evidence soon.  2 or 3 fly by without stopping per night&hellip;sometimes they are real high&hellip;and sometimes&hellip;they are lower&hellip;and someone out there will see them for sure.  Report what you see to this site&hellip;no one believes me&hellip;and it is so frustrating&hellip;people think I am nuts&hellip;.but it is the truth.  I DID catch the orb on film before the light went off&hellip;We will see how it looks later&hellip;I had the camera zoomed all the way in too. You can see it moving for sure.  Even if a skeptic was here tonight&hellip;and saw what I saw&hellip;he/she would believe from tonight on. Now&hellip;I finally know how other people who have witnessed these UFO&rsquo;s feel&hellip;you cannot sleep&hellip;you sit up wondering what the hell it was.  I just don&rsquo;t think it was human. Now&hellip;I am NOT a trained observer&hellip;but growing up five minutes from O&rsquo;Hare Airport&hellip;I know what a plane looks like.  I lived in Arizona for 8 years, and I know full well what a meteor looks like.  This was neither&hellip;it was the most unbelievable thing I have ever seen.  I would say that at the speed it was traveling&hellip;it go from Park Ridge, IL to Milwaukee in only a few minutes. If you are in the midwest...check the skies&hellip;for one hour...and you will see something for sure.

At around 9:15pm on July 31st 2008 over Mosinee, Wisconsin I witnessed a straight horizontal line of 5 yellowish lights.  The tops of the perfectly rounds lights seemed to have a little bit of red in them too.  They were kind of weak in intensity and just above the tree tops over a potato field about 2 blocks away.  I only saw them for about 5 seconds before I grabbed my Mom&rsquo;s arm to look at them too.  As I did that they quickly started to fade out one light at a time from the right to left.  She saw that last light sparkling before it disappeared.We continued on our walk for about 15 minutes and came to a spot where we could see the sky in full view over the potato field.  We stopped and looked up towards the south to see if we saw something to explain it.  We watched for about 3 minutes.  Then all of a sudden to the SW we saw it again, but this time it was really bright and lasted for about 15-20 seconds.  And it faded out from right to left again, but faster this time.It never appeared to be &quot;flying&quot; or moving, just hovered there. It was as high up as a helicopter would fly and about a quarter mile away from us.  There was nothing in the path of our view, completely open and clear skies.  It was unbelievable!!!

I have observed commerical aircraft in flight of about this size. Ther speed at a few hunderd miles per hour would have taken at least 20 minutes to travel what this did in 10 to 12 seconds.It was easy to discount military because their paint is to reduce light reflection and commerical aircraft are painted also, and not be  &quot;brightly&quot; reflective.

He lives in a high rise apartment building over 40 stories tall near Lake Michigan. We went to the roof to have a panoramic view of the fireworks around the city. There were a great number of fireworks particularly in the out-lying areas of the city. Even with the city lights the fireworks were phenonmenal. At one point I noticed an area of intense firework activity. I only focused on it for a few seconds then scanned other areas. When I returned my gaze to this spot I noticed some of the lights seemed to be hanging in one spot for an unusually long period. &quot;How do they make them do that,&quot; I asked myself. Then I pointed it out to my son. Again I was distracted. When I glanced back the lights were still hanging there. They seemed to form a &quot;hat-shape&quot; with red and green lights which shimmered around the form. UFO popped into my mind but I discounted it. I was once more distracted. When I looked back again at this &quot;hat-shaped&quot; object six very bright golden orbs seemed to emanate from it and hang momentarily around it. My mind seemed to be affected by what I saw. I certainly felt spaced out. (I don&apos;t drink or do mind-altering substances stronger than coffee.) When I looked again for the object, it had disappeared along with the orbs. It wasn&apos;t until the next day that I realized that I&apos;d seen a UFO. I&apos;m over 60 years old and this is the first one I&apos;ve ever seen one though I do believe we are visited, if not influenced, by aliens. I broached the subject of the sighting with my son &amp; daughter-in-law. He&apos;s an engineer and she&apos;s an accountant. He brushed off the UFO hypothesis. She said nothing except she hadn&apos;t noticed anything. I feel the need to communicate this with someone, hence this letter. Peace to all...", "shiny object in the clear sky hoovering, then suddenly disappearsI was driving down the street and happened to look up in the sky because I saw something shiny, almost like metal or tin reflecting when the sun hits it.  It was the only thing that was in the sky, a clear sunny day with no clouds or anything.  I kept staring up at it as others in their cars did too because it was reflecting the sun so brightly.  I kept staring at it while it was stationary in the sky and without blinking it was GONE!  No movement, no nothing, just completely disappeared.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I rounded a corner to find that the object was now directly in front of me, over the road, and not moving.I drove up to it and parked under it.When I rolled down my window to get a good look I realized that their was total silence and no downdraft.

It was pitch black and all of a sudden there was this blinding white light that enveloped the car and I remember being terrified.  The next thing I know we are down the road a good 4 or 5 miles from the plant, I don&apos;t remember how we got there, but now we are at the old Oak St bridge.  Anyone from that area should remember that old metal bridge, we were going so fast across it we were fishtailing, it had been raining.  I know we were both terrified and I looked up at the sky and there were 3 or 4 of them following us all the way thru town.  We finally got to my Aunt &amp; Uncle&apos;s house where we were staying the night, I remember being so afraid to look up in the sky, but as we ran into the house I saw them go zip, zip, zip and they were gone.  I don&apos;t know how else to describe it.Once inside the house, we immediately started telling the other adults there what we had seen.  Of course we were met with jokes and sarcasm.  My ex couldn&apos;t take the ridicule and so he did an about face and said he really hadn&apos;t seen anything.  As you can imagine, I was furious with him for not standing up and telling them the truth.Years later, after we divorced, we met for drinks and he admitted to me that he had seen what I had seen, but could not take the ribbing from the other men in the room.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I took several digital images of the storm clouds before being forced inside by the heavy rain and wind gusts from the storm. My only intensions were to capture digital images of the storm and nothing else.After the storm left the area, I took the CompactFlash card from my camera and inserted the card into my card reader in my computer. I downloaded the digital image files into Adobe Photoshop CS3 Bridge. I took the CompactFlash card out of the card reader and put the card back into my Canon EOS 40D camera and reformatted the CompactFlash card for storage of new digital images.On the afternoon of July 5, 2008, I started to review the digital images from the storm from the afternoon of July 2, 2008. As I started to enlarge each digital image file, I noticed an odd object that appeared on the right side of the trees across from the condos near my apartment. I enlarge the object trying to see if I could make out what the object was. I sat at my computer and stared at my LCD display in total disbelief. Then I started to check other digital images taken about the same time and I found another object near the storm clouds in another image file. I enlarged that one and found an object that appears to be coming out or going into one of the storm clouds.I had no intentions of trying to capture digital images of strange objects as my intent was only to try to capture interesting cloud formations to send into one of our local television stations in our area. These photos are 100% original and I did not altered these actual digital images in any way except for cropping and enlarging the images as I tried to determine what they actually were.I know this object is not a conventional aircraft as anyone around this area has observed before. I have my own impressions as what this object(s) appears to be but as of now, I will not divulge my thoughts to anyone until further study has been completed.", "When first sighting the light it was moving unusually fast and changed course after a few minutes and then conducted erratic movements.I woke up a 02:19 and made myself a cup of coffee and sat outside on the front patio enjoying the peace and quiet.  From the patio which faces east I have a 180 degrees view.At approximately 03:15 I was looking to the north and noticed a dull yellow/orange light moving from west to east across the Rio Puerco valley.  I estimated that the aircraft/light was 6 to 8 miles away and moving much faster than the normal aircraft on  approach to Albuquerque International Airport which is nearly due east 19.5 miles to the control tower.  I am guessing that the altitude was 5000 AGL.  This is only a guess.I followed the object with the naked eye until it entered a low thin cloud.  I was curious about the fast moving light so I got up out of my chair and search for the object.  After a minute or so the object appeared out of the top of the cloud.  At this point the light began to flash a very bright red and white strobe.  The object headed west again and seemed to trace it&apos;s path back.  I went into the house and got my 8x35 filed glasses and video camera.I returned outside and followed the light with the field glasses. Then the light began to jump around.  Up and down and left to right.  At first I thought I might be moving the field glasses.  There was a large star in the northeast that was in the field of view and it was not moving, so it was the object that was jumping around.I went to the north patio to follow the light&apos;s westerly track. The light moved across the Rio Puerco valley at a rapid pace, but not beyond current F16 military aircraft capabilities which operate out of Kirkland Airbase (ABQ International).At this point I tried to video the light, but the battery was dead.  The valley is approximately 5 miles wide where the light made its westerly track and it took approximately 5 minutes to cross the valley.  As the object crossed over the Rio Puerco River it began to jump around again.  The erratic movements covered the entire field of view of my field glasses.  Again I tried to make sure I wasn&apos;t moving the field glasses, but there were no stars visible in the west, northwest because of a slight cloud cover and the brightness of the moon high in the south, southwest, but I did use the edge of the western horizon as a reference point when possible.  Same results the light was jumping around.During the period of erratic movements the object was flashing a red and white strobe light similar to conventional aircraft.  I followed the light/object for several more minutes as it seemed to pass over the north lava fields of Mt Taylor.  At this point it was not moving oddly, but the red and white strobes continued and I returned into the house.The temperature was approximately 70 degrees and there were clusters of thin clouds.  Visibility was very good.  Humidity was high for the Rio Puerco valley.  A near full moon was high in the Southwest.  Winds were from the north at 1 to 2 knots.I am a former general aviation pilot and currently fly microlight aircraft (powered paramotors) and I trained pilots to fly powered paramotors for 9 years.  I retired from training in 2007.  I was an certified EAA instructor.", "See&apos;s light over CranstonI saw a U.F.O. above my appartment building at about 12:37 am on july 12th. it was bright, and glowed a sunshine yellow. It had now descernable shape, though it seemed circular, and seemed to be spinning. The event lasted aproximately 12 minutes. The object hovered in the sky for about 7 minutes, staying in one spot. After about seven minutes, it began to shift left and right. I recorded two videos, one about 1 minute long, the other just under 3 minutes long, on my phone. the event ended at about 12:50, when the U.F.O. vanished when i looked away. It was far away, yet, since i could not see any specific features about the object and it had nothing except sky behind it, i could not estimate a distance from where i was.Stranger than the actual U.F.O were the things that happened during the event. First of all, i live just off of a major avenue, which is always being used all hours of the day. During the time i saw the U.F.O., i didn&apos;t see a SINGLE car pass bye. Second, i didn&apos;t alert either my sister or mother, whom i live with, because (and i am realizing this as i write) during the event, i felt separated from the world, like it was me, the thing in the sky, and the road below my window. it took me several minutes to gain my sences after the thing dissapeared. It might have been shock and even fear of seeing something i couldn&apos;t explain in the sky over my home, or something else. Either way, it was indeed freaky.", "report edit pleaseim sorry i just filled out a report but i put the wrong highway it was highway 217 and wlker rd. i hope that it gets fixed((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))", "Probable abduction  Not exactly sure as to date but certain on month and year. My girlfriend and I were exploring the backroads and small towns of the Appalachias and camping out of the back of my 1970 VW Squareback station wagon. It slept two quite nicely. And I&apos;m 6&apos;4&quot;. We were a couple of hippie kids in our early twenties and I had found a dirt road off of US 421 at about 7:00pm as it was still daylight. This road had a lot of switchbacks and it was mainatined by Ashland Oil Company as we had seen multiple signs along this dirt road. I drove off of US 421 for approximately 15 miles and up to an elevation that might have been several hundred feet higher than where I had turned onto the dirt road. I stopped beneath a beautiful rock cliff that stretched about 100&apos; above where I&apos;d parked. The cliff was due east and a thickly forrested and very steep drop off was to our west. The car was oriented front facing north. We got our Hibachi out and cooked a couple small steaks and some veggies on it and hand about a third of a bottle of red wine between the two of us. We sat and talked as it got dark and we could make out a narrow band of sky and stars above us but most of the sky was no visible due to the cliff and the trees. At about 10:00 pm we decided to call it a night and settled into the VW for a good night&apos;s sleep. It was warm but nice and the sky was clear the humidity was low and there were no bugs so it was a beautiful night for sleeping. We had the hatch open on the VW with the rear seats folded down and the front seats folded forward as to aloow as much length for stretching out as possible so I would say that my feet were probably about 6&quot;-10&quot; inside the car and my girlfriend was on my right side.I woke up and only could open my eyes but could not move. There was a LOT of brilliant blue white light (like an electric arc welder only more) shining into the car from BELOW our elevation, coming up the steep slope to the west. I could tell that it was from that origin due to the light shining onto the ceiling of the car and not down into the car. I must have been on my right side as I could see the VDO dash clock and it said it was about 1:00 am.  I should not have been able to see that clock as we were in the middle of nowhere and it had been pitch dark when we turned off the dome light at 10:00. Sometime later a awoke again and this time I was lying on my back which struck me as odd as I had never slept on my back. I was looking at the headliner of the car and all I do was move my eyes.  There was a very even blue white light illuminating the inside of the car at this point but it was not very bright.  As I looked to my left I could see the B-Pillar moving away from my field of vision and I realized that I was moving out of the back of the car, flat on my back, unable to move.  I had the very definite sensation that there was something/someone moving around outside the rear of the car.  I immediatley thought &apos;bears&apos;.  I remember struggling to move but all I could do was move my eyes and the last thing I remembered was seeing the inside of the hatch window glide by and out of sight.The next morning was very strange as my girlfriend and I barely talked, tossed our stuff into the VW and drove to the nearest town in search of a restroom with plenty of cold water to splash on.  We made it to Hazard Kentucky and there was a little festival going on in town.  When I found a restaraunt I went to the men&apos;s room and immediately noticed that I had about four days beard growth when I had shaved just 24 hours before.  My girlfriend was in even worse shape as she had started her period just the day before and she said that she was a &quot;mess&quot;.  We both felt as though we had been drugged as we were kind of woozy and I remember pain in my neck and lower back and she reported pain as well.We didn&apos;t really talk much about that experience for the next six years.  We were married for five of those years and the experience only came up once or twice.Thirteen years later in Bloomington,Indiana I was reading a book by Whitly Streiber and another book about abductions that I just happened upon at the county library and I flipped to the photos in the center of the book and there were B&amp;W photos of &quot;scoop marks&quot; on people&apos;s shins/lower legs. I about dropped the book because I knew that I had three perfectly proportioned scars on my right leg that were perfect matches to the photos I was looking at. I had know for years that I had these scars but I had never really questioned their origin.... That struck me as really weird because I can account for every little scar on my carcass but not these. And they are deep and would have been into the bone based on their dimensions.I&apos;ve seen floating, dimly lit orbs once before this event when I was about ten and once after when I was about twenty-eight. That&apos;s pretty much it.....I worked in high energy accelerator physics for about seventeen years after this event and I felt that it was possibly some sort of abduction event even though I was immersed daily in hard scientific facts.Feel free to contact me only if you feel that I may be of help to you.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))", "We were outside at around 11:20 - 11:30 pm and I happen to look up and see a light in the sky that as you look you could tell that it was really high up.  It was heading in a straight direction when all of the sudden a bright flash of light appeared from where it light was moving in the sky.  All of the sudden it took off in another direction and as you watch it it became dimmer and dimmer as if it was flying higher until you could not see any longer.  My wife witnessed it as well and suprised by it as well.  I checked all of the online schedules for many of the different space agencies and did not see anything that was scheduled for taking off that night.  I also did the research to see if it was an iridium satellite flare as you suggested peter.  It definitely did not look like that at all.  This was definitely different than anything I have seen happen in the night sky.  I see objects in the sky that appear to be most likely satellites and the space station that move in a constant speed in the sky on the same path.  Never have seen something like this going one direction then moving in another after the flash.  Very strange.  My wife was speaking with her boss and she and her husband just so happen to see the same thing.  I have never reported anything before and this is my first time.  I definitely will continue looking up!", "Bright orange orbe over Colchester EnglandAbout 01:00hrs on Sunday 22nd June 2008, I was in my back garden feeding my cat prior to going to bed. I work a varying shift pattern so I am around all hours.I had just completed the feed and was closing the door to my shed, when my attention was drawn to a bright, light orange coloured, fluorescent type globe moving in what I describe as a relatively slow zigzag movement. It was travelling from the south west to the north east. It was probably no more than 200 feet high and approximately 100 foot north to my location, travelling over the roof tops. The globe from where I was standing only appeared to be about two foot in diameter.The light from the globe was constant and bright, at this point I was not aware of any other lights. I could not see any other features.There were no noises of aircraft or ground vehicles at the time.Having passed near to my location, the globe appeared to move into a straight flight path, continuing north east.Once the object had passed, I immediately ran upstairs and looked out of the bedroom window. I could still see the object, however it was by now quite some distance away, and it appeared to be moving faster than when I had initially observed it.I located my binoculars and used them to view the object but I could not identify anything further other than I could now see a steady red light on what I would describe as its left side. I was unable to keep the image steady.Weather conditions at the time were fine with a light wind. There was a small amount of cloud about. Visibility was very good. I had a clear and unobstructed view of the globe, initially for about two minutes and then through my binoculars again for about one minute.I have thought about all of the logical things that this could be and I cannot think of anything that would give me an answer.There are several things that I had to take into consideration.I have had a long experience of being in and around aircraft, both military and civilian. I have served for 10 years in the Royal Air Force, working in and around various types of military aircraft.I am currently a Police Officer stationed near to the Air Support Unit from where the police and ambulance service fly their helicopters.I have a very keen interest in all aircraft and as such I have a flight simulator.Firstly, I live in a military zone. However, the main military aircraft flying is helicopters, mainly Chinook and Puma. It is highly unusual to have military jets flying in the area. However, it is rare for the military in this area to engage in night time flying. At the height that I witnessed the globe, there would have been engine noise.Secondly, because of my experience of the police and ambulance helicopters I was able to discount them from my observations. There was no aircraft noise. I have worked with both aircraft on many occasions.I live relatively near to Stansted Airport (35miles) and the sky is littered with civil aircraft, however, they never fly this low or so close to the houses. I considered that it may have been the landing lights for the aircraft which are sometimes on, but these obviously go out of sight as the aircraft passes. At the time of this incident I did not see any civil aircraft flying.The globe light remained in view for sometime.I was unfortunate not to have any photographs and there are no other witnesses that I am aware of.I have given full and logical thought to all options and I do not consider that this was a low flying aircraft of any description.As such I have no explanation as to what the flying object was.I am a sceptic when it comes to UFO&rsquo;s, however, this was and to me an unexplainable and surreal experience and having discussed the matter with my wife I thought that I would report the matter.", "two craft dropping from the sky maybe chasing a meteor? and then rejoining as one and disappearing...This event took place, Tuesday,  July 1, 00.25, over the city of Guelph, Ontario, Canada.   Initially, We thought we were seeing a bolide, or a very large meteor, which appeared directly overhead, very near the star Vega, in the constellation of Lyre.  As it proceeded directly northward, it increased, then decreased in brightness, and once more  increased magnitudinally,  and subsequently exploded into at least two parts, each diverging from the other, with the contrail appearing white, and the point of fracture an electric blue.  The time of the transit from zenith, or first appearance overhead, to obscurity, due to local roof tops, ( approx. 15 degrees above N) was estimated to be between 8 to 10 seconds. Now this would normally be considered a natural celestial event, were it not for the events that followed 15 minutes later.  While discussing what we had just seen, and looking straight upward, again, in the region of Vega, and through a thin ridge of Cirrus,  Two objects,  the brightness a bit less of Arcturus, suddenly dropped into the sky, and proceeded on a track Nothward and slightly West of the track of the &quot;meteor&quot; we had seen earlier.  These two objects were what i would describe as being a delta form wing,  almost bird-like, yet, gave not notion of being avian in intent or motion.  In fact, they reminded me of old Korean War era jet fighters with everything removed from the cockpit and wing on down...they had no tail assembly.  I thought perhaps they may be geese or something, yet, their light was constant and almost seemed internal, and not reflective at all.  The light from these objects did not change at all due to the ambient city lighting.  There was no sense of fluttering or wing motion.  They simply &apos;floated&apos;, did zig zags, heading Northward, and one always seemed to go off course, then return, as if seeking something.  The two would diverge, converge, and fly in unison.  At one point, within a second, one returned to the other in the snap of a finger, travelling si! deways.Lateraly, at speed.  These were no geese!!  There was no noise, no contrails, just the off white, egg shell glow, and they did travel quickly.  The time elapsed from dropping from the sky overhead to disappearance would be roughly estimated as 40 seconds.   I have no idea of size or speed, other than the were below the cirrus cloud from which they appeared, (20 K?) and travelled 70 degrees of sky withinin 40 seconds.  And  they were in clear sky all the way northward after the cirrus bank.   As my friend and i had discussed at the time, they seemed to be Searching.  Perhaps it was coincidental with the meteor.  OK... AND then, as if it could not get stranger, again overhead,  an object , not 20 minutes after the sighting of the two &apos;floaters&apos;, comes, from the south , a Tube or a Cylinder, again with the same glow, heading perhaps towards Toronto. And the reason i say towards Toronto is because a comercial jet flew its normal track 3 minutes earlier and this tubey thing seemed to fly in that direction.  I do not have friends in,  or access to ATC..but 5 will get ya 10 that either RADAR or one of the pilots saw something tonight.   There are things we see and things we miss, but having seeing this, i cannot dismiss the things that are in my gut.   Something fell from the Sky tonight.  Two things went and looked for it.  Later, a device, either conjoined or unique to itself, flew over my head.  Same colour, yet, as we thought, together.", "Short, silent, very fast spinning yellow disk.I was just outside grilling for a party when my friend shouted to me to come check out the sky. When i looked up there was a yellow very fast spinning oval/disk. Since i was already taking pictures from the party i was able to take 2 clear shots. The ship gave off no noise.I quickly ran inside but by the time i grabbed my camera the oval was gone. My friends said that it just all of a sudden disappeared. It was the most wild thing i have ever seen.", "Moving stars?At 11:00 p.m. 6/29/8 me and my girlfriend went into the back yard to observe the night sky. While we were sitting on the swings we noticed what I thought were stars seperate from one another. One object was brighter than the other, the brighter &quot;star&quot; moved then stopped and moved again and stayed in place for hours.The dimmer &quot;star&quot; moved a little faster and stayed in place for the same duration as the other object.They moved probably about 150 miles apart from one another and like I said stayed in place for as long as we were observing.30 minutes later another star moved as a jet flew in its direction.This &quot;star&quot; also stayed in place after it moved out of the path of the jetliner.It appears as if there are many ufos that resemble stars in the night sky!.I have had many sightings on and around the 4th of july,maybe the aliens get brave and move closer to earth to view the fireworks,I dont know.I know how a satellite moves and looks and satellites dont stop and go and seperate from one another then stay stationary for the rest of the night. But then again who knows what kind of new technology Nasa might have.", "NJ UFO sightingI was letting my dog outside my back door last night. As I stood in the doorway I noticed a very bright string of lights in the sky. They both flashed quickly and raced. Its hard to explain, I have never seen lights do this before. They where red lights. I also noticed a green light when the lights flashed off. This green light was not on the same strand of lights as with the red.I new this was not an airplane or a blimp. I could see the shape of the craft. It was similar to the disc type I have seen on TV and pictures over the years but it was a bit different. The disc was a bit thicker and not as &quot;flat&quot;. Is the only way I could describe. There was also a section on top of the disc as well. It looked to be made of some type of metal.It was low enough and close enough that I could see it clear as day. I also noticed  rather then flying in one direction, it seemed to hover and move side to side slowly, like a zig Zag. I watched this for about 20 to 30 seconds until it moved to a point where the house located in the lot behind mine had blocked my view.I called my mother immediatley. She has seen one over a cornfield at our old house about 20 year ago. This one did not look like the one she had seen.Considering how low this was, and how busy the area I live in is, I would definately think someone else saw this. There is a major airport located about a 45 minute drive from me so I do see many planes regularly however I know this was definately not a plane. However about 1 minute or so after I had seen the ufo there was a place in the same area. I dont know if this is somehow connected but I found it ironic at the time.", "A white light brighter than the stars moved slowly from south to north, seemed to slow, grew quite bright, then faded within 10 seconds.  No sounds.  Object seemed fairly low in the sky...emerged from the top of the treeline.", "It appeared to be a white orb surrounded by red and blue orbiting lights, traveling northwest at 9.00 p. m. July 14, 2008.My 4 friends and I were standing outside at approximately 9.00 central time on july 14 2008 beside my truck. Friend #1 saw it first to the south traveling north straight toward us. It appeared to be a white orb with red and blue streams of light orbiting all around it and it was moving along the treeline faster than anything Ive ever seen. My brother recorded it on his cell phone and when we watched the playback, there was no red or blue lights, only the white orb moving in random directions so fast that it appeared to be moving in a smooth flowing manner to the naked eye. After about five minutes it jumped to the left and then to the right as it disappeared traveling west. We saw 30 -35 aircraft traveling all over the sky til around 10.00p.m. central.", "Cylinder object morphs to Sphere shape with Amber colored light over Kernersville, NCOn Monday July 21, 2008 at approx. 3:18am, we (my son Dustin, his friend Casey, and me Keith) were watching some late night movies. Our dog, Rusty, alerted me that he needed to be taken outside. It was a very clear night with no clouds and a very bright moon. We all were amazed at how bright the moon was and how far you could see and make out things that you normally cannot see at that time of morning. Upon opening the front door, I saw a bright Amber colored light in the Southwestern sky. Our house sits down in a small valley with a steep hill directly in front of the house. At the top of our road, which is approx. 150 yards away,lies the main road with a row of houses and then another very large valley around 1000 yards behind them. From our house looking up toward the main road, I noticed that the object was hovering about 200 or so feet above the valley. The valley consists of heavy woods, a large lake and several houses. A majority of the valley is wooded and is not heavily populated. Upon standing at the front door and watching the object, it continued to hover in the same area now for approx. 8 minutes. As the object continued to hover, my son Dustin says he is going to go up to the top of our road for a close look. Once up there, he is overwhelmed by the size of the object and notices that it is Cylinder shaped and the color of gun metal(polished nickle). He notices that the object is much closer to the houses on the main road than we had thought. He also notices that the object is silent, no noise at all and the Amber light stretches the entire length of the object. He also notices that the Amber light is a solid light and though it is very bright, it does night emit a beam out in front of it like a flashlight would or headlights do. What happens next is what really scared him the most. The object, now hovering less that 200 yards from the top of our road changes its shape from Cylinder to Sphere right in front of him. He then takes off running back to the house and literally begs me to shut the door and lock it! While watching it from the front porch, his friend and I had also noticed that it changed shape, but, from our view point, I had thought that the object had just turned instead of changing its shape. Now, instead of us being able to see the light span the entire length of the object, we could only see a small part of the light which made me think that it had turned. But, my sons exact words to me was this: &quot;Dad, it made no noise and was hovering just behind the houses, it changed it&apos;s shape from the cylinder to a sphere and the light is now in the center of the sphere&quot;. &quot;Please dad, shut the door and lock it...Please!&quot;  At this time, I really started writing all of this down because not only had it scared my son, it really made me fear for our safety. His friend at this time had started to cry. I think it was due to just not knowing what it was or feeling threatened. Now, being about 13 minutes the Sphere started to move to the south. We noticed that as it moved to the south, the Amber light now covered the entire object. As it hovered, it slowly began to make a southwestern turn and very slowly began to move away from us. It moved very slowly and the farther it hovered away from us, the smaller the light got. It was completely out of our view/site at appox. 3:36am. We stood on the front porch for several minutes there after and never saw the object again. As far as our backgrounds, we are your typical family. I, the dad is a 37 year old male and my son is 14 years old and his friend is 14 years old. We have all been skeptics about the very thing that we witnessed Monday morning. While we do not know what it is that we all witnessed, we would like to know exactly what it was. After talking to my son and his friend, they both stated that they wish not to discuss it. I believe that it scared them as much as it upset me. Overall, the object was about 80ft in length and about 40ft in thickness. It&apos;s color was that of polished nickle or at least that it what color it appeared to be under the brightness of the moon. The object had an Amber colored light that spanned the entire length of the object and was positioned in the center. Once it changed it&apos;s shape from Cylinder to Sphere, the Sphere was now around 60 to 80 ft in diameter and was completely silent. The Amber colored light was now positioned in the center of the Sphere and totally surrounded the Sphere as it hovered southwest and completely out of our view. It was not seen there after. The entire event lasted approx. 18 minutes. The temp. outside was in the upper 80&apos;s and very humid. The moon was very bright and the skies were very clear. A light northern breeze was blowing at the time of the event.", "Flashing white light was traveling across the sky from south to north, at an incredible speed, and gone within seconds.I live in the northwest suburbs of Chicago. There were a few planes flying around either taking off from or circling to land at O&rsquo;hare Airport.The skies were mostly clear, with some clouds in the distance and at 9:30pm I was standing outside looking southwest almost straight up in the sky and saw a quick white flash of light, almost like the flashing lights you see from a plane but a little brighter and caught my attention. This light would blink about every other second, but what I experienced  was the speed of this light. The distance between each blink of light was incredible.  I saw this light coming from the south moving north in a straight line and lasted four to five seconds before disappearing in the distance.  All the planes in the sky seemed to be moving in slow motion after watching this sighting.", "a cigar shape light moving slow to the left then shot of with speed to the rightwalking back home when i notice a cigar shape light in the sky it moved to the left slowly and shot to the right and disappeared. the colour of the object was like a bright white light. the sky was dark with rain clouds and this made the object sticl out more in the sky", "stationary bright object changing colors in sky over AzI couldn&apos;t sleep so I went outside to sit in our spa.  I&apos;m sitting facing the west and there was this bright light that was stationary but to me it was flashing. There is alot of air traffic out here, so I thought it might be a plane coming in my direction.  But it never moved. I called my wife out to observe it and she said that flashing was actually changing colors(I&apos;m color blind)from red to blue to white, we watched for about an hour and it just got smaller and smaller and then disappeared.  From where we are I&apos;d say it was just a little bit north of west and maybe 15-20 degrees above horizon.  I 1st observed it about 12:30, it disappeared about 1:30am.  We did get out an old pair of binoculars, my wife said the red light was circling around whatever it is.  As I am writing this about1:42am, there is another object with same characteristics sw of us only it appears to be farther away.", "Three objects moving SSW to NNE across Massachusetts night sky.June 20, 2008. At approximately 22:00 hrs, we witnessed a circular object with haze around it traveling SSW to NNE across the night sky. It was moving at a very high rate of speed. The duration was about 30 seconds. Then about 2 minutes later another circular object with haze around it came across the sky in the same direction but with a smaller circular, bright (star like), object in formation with it around it&rsquo;s 8 o&rsquo;clock position. That also lasted about 30 seconds. There was myself and 5 other people that witnessed this event.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))", "Glowing orange objects, which you could see were round disk/sphere in shape when glow dimmed completely.This event happened on the East End of Long Island New York, in the Village of Port Jefferson on 07/04/08.  I was with two other friends and we were just talking, while watching cars and motorcycles drive by.  It&rsquo;s a popular hangout spot in town. First sighting at 10:15 pm, two bright orange balls of light are flying in close formation maybe around 3-5 thousand feet heading from the South.  A few people at this point noticed and we all thought it could have been helicopters flying over. Though, I thought it was rather strange for a helicopter to glow bright orange in color.  The crafts hovered over for a short period of time, then flew a little farther and in the blink of an eye disappeared straight up into the sky.  A gentleman stood by saying &ldquo;those were definitely not helicopters. Next sighting at approximately 10:35 pm, this time three bright orange balls of light are flying in close formation from the South.  They started to hover at about the same height as the first sighting.  No doubt watching what was going on below.  These crafts moved up and down in a very speedy fashion, the light would fade as they moved up and would glow brighter as they came down.  These were very fast moving objects. Next, a plane was flying in from the West toward the crafts and at this point at least 50-60 people were pointing up at the sky wondering what in the world the objects were.  Moments later at the same time, all three crafts dimmed their lights completely (no light at all).  But this time, the objects didn&rsquo;t disappear into the sky.  As they flew by, you could tell without a question of a doubt what the objects were once the glow was gone.  They were light gray in color round disks (sphere like), not small from what I could tell (maybe around half the size of a football field).  At this point they were moving at a relatively fast cruising speed; one craft flew up ahead while the other two trailed close together but all three in formation.  If it matters, they flew over the water and if they continued to fly straight would have ended up somewhere in or near CT. Without a doubt, the single most surreal experience I&rsquo;ve ever had (my friends included). These were not planes, helicopters, blimps, weather balloons, fireworks, or any other known object that I could think of. My one friend took some camera phone photos, but they&rsquo;re worthless. About myself, I have an Accounting background (MBA) and work in the lab plastics business.  My other friend/witness is a Speech Therapist in a School District and the other works for Allstate Insurance.", "BRIGHT LIGHT IN SKY TURNS INTO SMALL LIGHT IN A BLINK OF THE EYE AND FLYS NORTH UPWARD INTO THE SKYAround 11:30 or 12 at night on June 30th of 2008, me and 2 female friends were up on the canal located in Terrace Heights looking toward Mount Adams. I happened to look up threw my moon roof of my car and noticed a bright white light toward Mount Adams which was at a south west direction from our location, but it seemed to be right over Yakima. At first I thought it was a airplane but it had no flashing lights like an airplane. I also observed an airplane fly by this object, the airplane was heading towards Seattle. When I realized the object was not a airplane I told my female friends &ldquo;what is that&rdquo;. My friend in the passenger seat tried to look at it threw the moon roof but didn&rsquo;t see it, so she looked out the window, as she did that the light just in a blink of the eye turned very small like a star in the sky. Me and her observed the object fly north in a upward direction until it vanished into space. I have talked to another female friend of mine who also said her and another friend had seen this light at the same time for about 20 minutes, they were on Mead and 13th ave looking south west when they observed the light. I was wondering if anyone else has seen this light and also see it fly away.", "Huge wing craft - 1000 feet in width hovered over house, no noise or lightsI was in my house looking out of the sliding glass windows and saw an odd six-pointed light that was very bright and hovering over the trees in the distance. I flashed the floodlights from the side of the house and as a result, the points of light came together creating a flat linear shape that proceeded to accelerate in the direction of the house. As it approached the house, it was silent and approximately 300 feet over the house and trees. There were no lights (except for the floodlights) and it hovered making no sound! As I looked out the window, I noticed it was enormous, so large that it must have been at least 1000 feet in width, resembling one large wing in a wide triangle shape. I noticed enormous, cavernous bays (similar to aircraft carriers) underneath the wings yet there were no lights and there was no movement. Out of fear, I hid behind the curtains for about one minute and then built up the courage to run outside and look into the sky &ndash; there were no traces, no noises, nothing. It simply had disappeared, yet could not have turned as its wing would have hit the house and trees. It made no noise and had been attracted by the floodlights on the house. As we were younger children, our babysitter would not allow us to go outside out of fear as she could not figure out what it was either. The location of the sighting was approximately 12-15 miles from the military base in Warwick, RI.", "I witnessed a diamond shaped craft with 4 white lights and one red light in the center hovering above Ashland Missouri twice.Two nights ago my girlfriend and I were on our way back from Columbia, Missouri and traveling south on Hwy. 63. As we were approaching Ashland, Missouri we noticed four bright yellowish white lights spaced evenly with a red light in the middle that were very low in the sky. The lights were constant brightness except for the red light which appeared to dim at random times. At first we thought it was a plane because there was an airport near by and we thought it was so low (about 150 to 200 yards above us) because it was about to land. But then we realized that we had already past the airport about 3 miles ago. As we got closer we realized the craft appeared to hover and was moving to slowly for it to stay in the air. There was also no sound like that of a helicopter and was also to big to be a helicopter. If I had to guess its size I would have to say it was about 70 yards wide and was symmetrical in a diamond shape. We turned around and put the pedal to the floor to get a better look at it but by the time we got to where it was it had disappeared. We went on the outer road to see if it had landed somewhere but didn&rsquo;t find anything.Then tonight July 2, 2008 I was driving home and from the road by my house you can see across the river to the area where Ashland is. I noticed the same lights and couldn&rsquo;t believe my eyes! I put the car in reverse and watched the craft float back and forth for about 4 minutes like it was searching for something (hopefully not me). It was also thunder storming so every time the lightning hit u could see the out line of it. Then all of a sudden the lights almost looked like they disintegrated and lightning hit two more times and there was no outline. The craft had just disappeared. And I&rsquo;m not making this up I never really believed in ufos until now and if you knew me you would no I wouldn&rsquo;t waste my time to make up a bogus story. It really freaked me out cause I&rsquo;ve seen it twice in the last 3 nights and the way it disappeared was what really shocked me&hellip; Hopefully some one else will report something so I won&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;m completely crazy.", "Several sequencing lights appeared over a vast part of the southern sky from right outside the Goshen, Indiana areaHusband&rsquo;s statement:  On the night of Wednesday, July 24, 2008, at 10:15; My wife and I witnessed a series of red-colored lights appear in the sky from our home, outside the Goshen, Indiana area. From our field of view, the lights first started to appear in the south-south-west area of the sky. I first witnessed two lights that where bigger then the stars around them. One of the lights were red, the second slightly above the first was white. They disappeared a few seconds after I saw them, then 5 degrees west, another red light appeared stationary like the first two and then faded out remaining in the same position. These first lights looked like they were several miles away and were fairly low in the southern horizon. I then told my wife, who was standing with me, that I thought there was something odd going on in the sky and motioned her to see. We then witnessed two more red lights appear, and then disappear, in a relative similar position to the first sighting . Less than a minute later ten red lights appeared in a sequence at an exact 45 degree angle.  Then two more lights appeared at a 45 degree angle away from the previous angle still in sequence with the other angle.  For 15 more minutes I had numerous red lights appear in the sky from south-south-west positions to south-west-west positions of the sky.  The lights appeared to be many miles away. Wife&rsquo;s statement:  We saw an amazing, unexplainable, display of lights.   Lights were appearing and disappearing all over the sky.  We even saw weird light patterns.  All this transpired about 15 minutes or so.", "At end of fireworks, 30-40 objects,2 squadrons of 15-20 each, 1 single rear guard, bright orange,haze glow, pear or cone shapeReport Date: August 3rd, 2008-08-03, 7:30am EST Occurrence: 10pm, EST, Saturday, August 2md, 2008-08-03 Location of Event: Lake Muskoka, Gravenhurst Bay, Government Wharf Gravenhurst, Ontario, Canada Reporting Event: Immediately following local fireworks display from 9:30pm to 10:00pm EST Approximately 200-250 local cottagers in boats on lake watching fireworks, several hundred viewers on land on docks, government wharf Immediate Witnesses: 4 family members in my boat, [4 adults], many other boaters on lake pointing upwards to sky. Hundreds of local cottagers and residents of the town of Gravenhurst standing on the mainland docks watching the end of the fireworks display.Visual Description: 2 separate squadrons of 15-20 in each squadron, of bright orange, pear-shaped, glowing objects [similar in shape to a triangular Gemini space capsule], flying a loose triangle formation, flying from north to south west across the sky very slowly [about the speed of a helicopter]. Each squadron appeared on the northern horizon at the north end of the 22 mile long lake, and moved slowly southwards and south west towards the end of the lake and then continued southwards out of line of sight towards the City of Toronto area approximately 100 kilometres south.First squadron appeared and flew overhead over a period of 3-4 minutes at what appeared to be a lower level height of a commercial airliner [10,000 to 20,000ft], which was followed about one minute later by a second squadron at the same height and speed. After both squadrons disappeared on the southern horizon, a single bright orange object [which appeared slightly larger than the others] appeared in the north, and followed the same southwards path, somewhat like a rear guard. There was no sound. The bright orange objects had a very bright glow [an unusual vivid orange glow and narrow margin of orange is haze around them, and left no visible entrails or tracking marks in the sky. Each squadron formation changed in shape slightly as they moved slowly across the sky, with the distance between object changing slightly occasionally, and the shape of the formation adjusting slightly from triangular to single line shapes, and then back to into more of a box/square formation.Credentials of Reporting Source: 55 year old male, resident of Toronto, Canada, spending weekends at cottage 100 kms north of Toronto in the lake district known as Muskoka, Ontario.

I&apos;ve seen or caught these images before several times before during previous months, but never paid much attention due to air traffic in this area from Nashville international airport. Once I&apos;ve seen them I&apos;ve more actively seek them out and for the next 2 days I saw them briefly each night.

They copters were flying low and as I moved out of range they appeared to be hovering above that hill where I saw the circular object disappear.

NOT A PLANE , ROCKET OR  COMET", "Object with pulsating red and white lights appears in the middle of the sky and travels to the horizon at extremely high velocity.I submitted this report to MUFON almost immediately after the event took place. I was not aware of the existence of NUFORC until just now, otherwise I would have submitted it here as well. I have edited it in a few areas where I might not have been as clear as I would have liked (I was understandably in a kind of fervor at the time), but my original report is still on MUFON.com if you&rsquo;d like to view that as well. I&apos;ve spent a lot of time observing satellites, stars, planets, meteors and aircraft, and nothing has baffled me like this.I was outside my house smoking a cigarette, and I decided to move a lawn chair out into the yard so I could look at the sky. It was the perfect summer night. All I could hear were crickets, and the skies were clear. I was looking about 40 degrees up to the east, and that&apos;s when I saw it appear. It was such a shock to me that I can&apos;t tell if it rapidly decelerated to a speed at which it was visible (Who knows?) or if it just &quot;turned on its lights&quot;. I literally jumped in my seat!  We&apos;ve all seen meteors, they reach a point at which the friction and pressure of the atmosphere builds up heat which produces incandescent light that we see for usually no more than a fraction of a second. If this was a meteor, then I&apos;m Santa Claus. It was already moving when it appeared (like a meteor), but its brightness didn&apos;t fade (the lights did pulsate, however), there was no rapid descent, and I was able to follow it to the horizon. Fireballs have been visible over several states before they either impact the ground (or someone&apos;s unfortunate car), but this object wasn&apos;t as bright as Jupiter, it left no trail, and nothing was seen breaking off of it.I could be one of the lucky few who have witnessed an earth-grazing fireball, but I doubt it. Here&apos;s why: the object had red and white lights, but not lights as you&apos;d expect to see on an aircraft. They weren&apos;t points of light; rather there was a center that was brighter than the periphery around it. That&apos;s the best I can explain it. The center part wasn&apos;t even that bright, but the smooth glow of the light around it really set it apart from anything I&apos;d ever seen.This object definitely had some size to it. Let&apos;s assume this was something entering the atmosphere. From my point of view, the apparent size of the object was no smaller than a commercial airliner at cruising altitude, possibly larger. I&apos;m no expert on which altitudes objects start to glow at as they enter the atmosphere, but it&rsquo;s definitely more than 40,000 feet, making this thing at least as big as an aircraft, if indeed it is something entering the atmosphere. There are lots of variables involved, but that seems logical to me. As meteors have not developed stealth technology since they are essentially rocks, I would have to imagine that this object would appear on radar if it was nothing more than a very large meteor.The object was moving northward, possibly to the NNW. It made no sound whatsoever. If this was an aircraft, it would have to AT LEAST be going mach 1 at roughly 10,000 feet. That&apos;s as slow and as low as this thing could have been going. The higher up this thing actually was, the faster it was actually going. Common sense, right? I should have been able to hear something if this was an aircraft. B-2&apos;s and F-117&apos;s are pretty quiet, but they&apos;re also subsonic.All I know for sure is that I saw something extremely unusual travel from 40 degrees above the horizon in the eastern sky to the northern horizon in about five seconds or less. The time at which the event took place eliminates a satellite in low orbit being illuminated by the sun, so either this thing made its own light or was glowing from the heat of entering the atmosphere, possibly both.  Please call or email me if you have any questions, or if I&apos;m flat-out wrong about something. Thank you for looking into it for me.", "Object moving north  just west of City of Fenton at approx. 10PM.  Bright orange light...looked like a fireball.  No sound.

I first saw the object from a distance of about 3 &frac12; miles. At first I presumed it was a helicopter as there is a helicopter club within 12 miles of the area. It was a very bright white/pale blue light and stood out as there are no homes or other light sources for another 5 miles further down the road. When I got within 1 &frac12; miles of the object, I began to doubt if it was a helicopter as the entire body of the object seemed to be illuminated. Travelling at a constant speed of 45 mph towards the object, I slowed to 25 mph when I got within &frac12; mile of the object. The object was about 200 ft to the right of the road. I passed the object slowly at about 10 mph just to observe it. It stood completely still, and was completely covered in a bright pale blue light. My view of the object was obscured slightly by a 6 foot tall hedge, but I could still see it clearly. The object was a tube shape or &lsquo;cigar&rsquo; shape and I would estimate it was almost 90 foot long and 10 foot high and wide. Although I am not absolutely positive about this, I recall it making a faint sizzling sound, but can&rsquo;t be sure as at the time I was not concentrating on the sound. With my passengers side window open by two inches, the temperature in my trucks cabin increased by about 50 degrees, and I believe that this heat was produced by the object. It was a quiet night and for the entire 20 mile journey I took, I saw nobody on the road, nobody driving or anybody walking. I presume that the object was in the field before I left Maryville and it was still visible in my wing-mirror for another 2 miles after I passed it. I&rsquo;ve known this stretch of road for more than 25 years and use it as many as 8 times a week and have never seen anything like this before. On the 19th I used the road again and stopped at the side of the field where the object was on the 18th. The object was not there, and there were al! so no si gns that it had been there either as none of the grass was scorched, which I had expected it to be. I am not sure if this object was manmade or not made by man, or simply a natural occurrence, but I am positive that it was not a helicopter, of any other vehicle either.", "Multiple orange globes traveled slowly across skyline then dissapearedIm not entirely sure what it was that myself, girlfriend, father, and several other witnesses saw this night, but after seeing the pictures fro Indiana on your site it has made me want to post this to say what we saw was VERY similar. It started off with three to four orange in color globes moving across the sky very slowly. (Not sure on the direction, but if I went back to the site I could for sure use a compass to identify) At first we all thought it may have been helicopters or some other kind of aircraft, but as in the Indiana description as they went across the sky, they dissapeared. After we noticed that the objects kept coming across the skyline, it started to draw our attention more and more. I would say about 4 objects had passed when I started to actually count as they kept coming. By the time the last one past, my father and I had counted 18 crafts, but there could have been up to 25 or so as we did not immediately start counting. Others were joking that it was Aliens, and one man kept suggesting that it was just helicopters. Im having a hard time believing it was helicopters, especially that many in flight, in no distinct patters, flying across the sky at almost 10PM at night. There was no sound, just the orange globes traveling high enough and far enough to where it could not possibly be fireworks. And I also have a hard time believing that helicopters could fly as high as these crafts were. No way they were airplanes either, I know and have seen so many airplanes in the sky at night, and these were not. I dont care what anyone tries to tell me, this was something odd, dont know what it was, but they surely were not an airplanes or helicopters.", "Triangular shape object with five white light in a triangular formation beneath object structure.Something odd was flying around in the Gulf Breeze area. On June 26, 2008, I noticed a somewhat bright, solid, reddish light stationary in the sky that was probably 500 yards off the ground. It stayed in that position for at least five minutes never moving or doing anything else. Earlier that evening, there was some helicopters flying around, and they never stopped and hover in one position. I suspected the solid red light might be a helicopter, but I never heard any noise coming from it. I estimate the distance the object was from me about half a mile and located North-East in direction. I had a camera in my car and I went to get it. That took about five minutes. When I tried to locate the object in the sky, I could find it. The event took place around 9:00 PM.The next day, my friend and I went fishing again at Bob&rsquo;s site bridge. I didn&rsquo;t think to bring the camera with me. Again, I saw the red light around 9:00PM situated in the same area in the sky at the same height and direction. I hurried to my car again which took at least five minutes. Again I couldn&rsquo;t locate the object which appeared to be stationary in the sky for at least two minutes before I left to get the camera.On July 16, 2008, my friend and I went fishing at Bob&rsquo;s sites. This time I had my camera with me. We fished on the pier instead of the bridge.  There was lots of people fishing which is unusual for a Wednesday.  The sky was clear and the almost full moon was rising . I was facing North and it was about 8:45PM when I noticed an object coming from the North. I watched the object as it made a turn to the North-East.  It wasn&rsquo;t a passenger jet.  As the object made the turn like a jet, I clearly saw for a brief moment the shape of the object. It was triangular in shape like a B-2 stealth bomber. I also saw five separate white lights in a triangular formation beneath the wing-like structure which also appeared to be part of the craft structure.  After that moment, I got my camera out. The object was now heading North-East. I could only see two separate light orange/red in color and fading slowly.  I put the camera in available light mode and zoomed in at max, but I couldn&rsquo;t see the object in the viewer.  I took two pictures anyways hoping that maybe I get something. After downloading the pictures onto my computer, I was not able to see the object or lights.  It might had been a military jet, but that is the fist time I saw a triangular shape object flying around in the area of Gulf Breeze, and I lived near this area practically my whole life.  There was no strobe lights, red lights, or green lights on the object.  Nothing to indicate that it was a commercial jet.", "White oval above treetops in Madison, WI - changed direction and colorFrom my office window, on the East side of Madison, Wisconsin, I had just watched a flight of F-16 fighter jets make their landing approaches to the Dane County Regional Airport when I looked around to see if any other aircraft were approaching. Less than 2 minutes later, I saw, to the North, a white, but slightly yellowish oval approaching the airport just above the treetops. The oval was horizontal to the horizon. From the size, I judged it to be an approaching airliner a long way off, but one that seemed too far away to have been on its glide path that early. It wavered laterally and vertically just slightly, as it approached (these changes in position were slow and gradual). I estimate it was about a half mile out from the runway when it appeared to slow down. As it grew darker- to a grayish color &ndash; and very slowly shrunk in size, I realized that it had changed course and was traveling almost due Northwest.

After observing the light for several minutes , I noticed that the light wasn&apos;t moving, it was quite stationary in the sky. There was also no evidence of a willowy or feathered edge, nor a trail to this light that is so characteristic of contrails.The light&apos;s shape was that of an elongated cigar whose ends seemed to be positioned N/S.  The color of this object was mainly illuminated white, with a mixture of yellow &amp; blue throughout its corona.I cant give accurate dimensions because I do not have anything to reference it to.  But as far as scale goes, it was 3 inches long by an 1/8 inch in height. It seemed to be over the NE edge of the range that holds Lake Pleasant, so maybe 25 miles away? There were other planes in the sky, local traffic for Deer Valley Airport, as well as the usual Sky Harbor traffic.  None of these planes, regardless of altitude, had contrails.The entire duration of the sighting was less than 10 minutes before it disappeared from a clear sky.", "Four red sequenced blinking lights in a diagonal bar formation sighted in Kentucky.One night while leaving a late night event I sat in the passenger seat while my boyfriend drove us across a deserted stretch of highway. I leaned my head against the window and caught site of one small red light hovering over a distant mountain. The red light blinked four times and then a diagonal bar consisting of four other red lights would light up too. This only happened on every fourth blink. This pattern continued several more times but I didn&rsquo;t alert my boyfriend because I was unsure about what it was. As we drove around the mountain, I finally decided to alert him to what was there but because of his position in the driver&rsquo;s seat, he was unable to see it. I strained to see the lights but could only do so for another minute or so. Even though I knew I was looking at the same point in the sky, the lights stopped blinking entirely and soon, it was out of sight. This was in a familiar area that I&rsquo;ve taken often so I am sure this was no type of tower and it didn&rsquo;t resemble any type of jet or other aircraft that I&rsquo;ve ever seen. It may have been moving but due to our changing position and the winding road I was unable to tell for sure. I haven&rsquo;t seen the lights since but I am sure I saw it this night because it lasted several minutes and was very distinct.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I thought I had just lost it in my field of view, so I kept looking and maybe 10 seconds later, it re-appeared, (confirming it as unidentified) moving in a different direction, for only a few seconds.I continued to look and it once more had a very ethereal re-appearance, which may or may not be attributable to a trick in the vision but given the anomalous nature of the event I have elected to mention that it showed itself once more very very short, less than 0.1 second, in a fast tight loop.

I work as an engineering intern at an AERONAUTICAL ENGINEERING FACILITY.  I know aircrafts very well, both experimental and common.  So as I was driving home, I looked up to the North West and saw a light approaching very low over the highway.  There was an airport close, so I assumed it was a 1 or 2 engine plane coming in for a landing.  I looked up again, and prepared myself for a huge blast of noise (this is how close it was).  When I looked up a second time, a triangular object with three white lights at each point hovered silently over the highway.  This is no plane, as I&apos;ve said before, my education is in engineering, as well as working specifically in aero-engineering field.  I am not dumb, and I know what I know. I looked up a third time and it was gone. What I saw cannot be identifiable by anyone on earth, and by my good understanding of physics, broke many physical laws that we could not even begin to comprehend.  I&apos;m not saying it was an alien, I&apos;m just saying that I could not identify it, and I believe most on this world couldn&apos;t.  I mean, an object of this shape could not create lift unless moving at a very fast speed, and if it did create lift by using a propulsion system from underneath, how could it move side to side efficiently?

Clear dark sky.I was 15 years old walking with my oldest sister on 9th street towards downtown Los Angeles, CA. Heading for the Greyhound depot.  It was dark and quiet.  All I had in mind was the approaching boycotted Moscow Olympic games.A small spheric light appeared traveling horizontally in a straight line, and paralleling 9th street (West to East).  At a height of, I would say, half the height of the terrorized 9/11 tween towers of New York.No sound at all. It left no trail behind (as an asteroid would).  It did not appear to be descending or decelerating.  A very stable and fast speed.It disappeared in the skyline of downtown Los Angeles.Feeling disturbed, I turned around and asked my sister,&quot;did you see that?&quot;. &quot;Ahu..yes&quot;, she responded.  We both kept walking disturbed and quiet since it was too early in the morning and we were still sleepy.A few minutes later, I still asked,&quot;did you really see it?  It was a light bulb, or something like that..right?&quot; She responded, &quot;yes&quot;.What ??  A LIGHT BULB ? ?

We are right on a golf course and on the other side is a separate neighborhood which we saw all of them almost scan. it was very bizarre then we saw more object that were fireball shaped and moved faster than anything vie ever seen they changed colors from red to yellow and even blue but there was no pattern to these lights.

These images were in what I believe is the east sky of Shanghai, Pudong New District, PRC.  The time stamps on the images are 2152 to 2206 hours because my camera had been set to a different time than where I was taking the photos. At about 2035 hours on Thursday July 17, 2008, I was in the study of my apartment where I frequently go to view the beauty of the buildings in Shanghai Pudong.  Within a couple of minutes I noticed what appeared to be slow a reddish color light from my vantage point about 40 degrees up from my position.  My first reaction was do to nothing, but after a couple of minutes of city gazing, the light was in approximately in the same location. I went to my desk to get my binoculars (power of 15 X  60 X 63) and see if I could get a better view.  To my surprise the view was very clear.  I saw an array of lights that formed a &ldquo;V&rdquo; shape.  The color of lights ranged between reds, blues, purples, greens, and at time some yellow.  They were flashing randomly and they were randomly changing colors.  In my estimate there were about six to ten lights on each side of the apex of the V.   This &ldquo;object&rdquo; for lack of a better term seemed to hover, and every once in a while made almost floating moves, certainly not &ldquo;darting&rdquo;. After a few minutes of watching in amazement, because I am not a particular believer of UFO&rsquo;s, (but I had never seen anything like this) I considered getting out my camera.  However I thought that it may not get a good shot and/or the object may disappear.  When I finally decided to get my digital camera (Nikon D80)  it took about a minute or so to change to my telephoto lens (80 X 300).  I have not used the camera too often in the manual mode, but I knew that if I left in automatic mode, that the flash would be used and I did not want it because I was inside looking through a window.  So, I switched the camera to manual mode with auto focus enabled.  In the beginning I could not see the object, so I first focused on a building within my site then directed my lens back to the object in the air.  I actually took three shots (two which captured nothing and one of the spire from the building I focused on, before I auto focused to the spire).  On my fourth attempt I was able to capture the object.  I believe that I set the camera to manual focus before my fourth shot, but it may have been auto focus, because at some point in time, I changed the focus mode (on my 28th shot). Over the course of 13 minutes I clicked every so often.  However, I was holding the camera in my hand, leaning on the window frame and doing whatever I could do to keep it steady.  I am not sure that the F stop setting was, but I can obtain that because I have not changed it.  At one point in time I actually changed the camera to a second manual setting which took a longer exposure.  I finally decided to get my monopod and set the camera on it so I could have a bit more stability, however by the time I set my monopod up (within a minute or so), the object started moving towards the south and then further east.  I continued to shoot until the object was no longer within my sight.  As of 2157 hours, at the point when I am writing this sentence, the object has not reappeared. As I state above, I am not a UFO believer, however I did see something, and I did capture some very interesting digital images.  As soon as the object had disappeared I opened my Web browser and searched for a web site to report this event.

It duplicated this maneuver several times, then we saw nothing for ten to fifteen minutes.  When object reappeared (assuming it was the same object), it appeared to be 2x closer, apparently over the middle of the lake.  This time the light pulsed on more gradually, and showed three or four lights along a horizontal elliptical pattern, suggestive of a round or disk shaped craft.  The lights were the same color and shone brightly for several seconds, then faded.  No sounds accompanied the display. About ten minutes after that, a very dim jet aircraft traveling from north to south moved directly overhead (jet aircraft sounds heard).  Immediately after it moved to the south, a more piercing white light appeared &quot;behind&quot; it, then moved steadilyand silently off to the east. Very eerie stuff.

I was curious and continued to watch it, and then noticed there was an identical object a short distance behind it.  They moved at a moderate pace in a straight line and did not waver, which confirmed they were not birds.  Then the second object started moving underneath the first one, but stayed the same distance apart and neither changed speed.  It continued rotating around the first object until it was in front.  Then they passed behind a building and from my sight.

I noticed a small drop of light moving through the trees and was trying to figure out if it was a lightning bug or a plane, but I never could be sure.  This was nothing compared to what we eventually saw.  We got out of the car with our flashlights and we were just goofing around.  All of a sudden, my friend calls my attention, &ldquo;come here! look! Look!&rdquo;  I was completely spellbound by this object.  I kept checking myself to make sure I was not crazy and we kept reassuring each other.  I was very curious and without fear as the object swarmed around the tree tops.  My friend was yelling at me to get back in the car because he was terrified.  I don&rsquo;t know what would have happened if I continued to welcome the craft.  I did not feel like it wanted to do me harm, but I just felt overwhelmed.  It seemed like the more I welcomed it, the more it moved towards me and became more noticeable.

I did not feel normal until I had left about 20 yards from my house, where I did indeed see my dog, but he would not come when I called him.All this, albeit out of the ordinary, was nothing to what I would discover in the weeks to come. When I had gone to McDonalds, eaten my food, and come home, I found throughout the day that I was no longer hungry. I had also discovered that my athletic ability, which was already significant, had dramatically increased; my times in the mile dropped from 5.03 to 4.27, and continue to go down, despite my being in the off season for track, and no longer practicing as hard. In the past week alone, I have grown 1/16th of an inch, and in total over the month that followed this event, have grown about an Inch and &frac12;. I only now need to eat one meal a day, and my Vocabulary, Math skills, and Memory have vastly improved, and I dare say they maybe on par with others who have achieved doctorate degrees.I have noticed similar changes with my dog, which is 16 years old, and has the agility of a puppy. I searched my property and found nothing; similar occurrences have happened with my neighbors, only effects are less impressive than my own. All doctor check outs have found nothing unusual. I will continue to monitor my process as time continues.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I witnessed the first 3 and the others only caught the last one. The event certainly had our attention.As we were discussing what we had just seen the sequence started again, same general location and this time 5 or 6 lights, again one at a time over a few minutes duration. There was no visible motion to any of the lights just appearing and the quickly diminishing.The only plausible conclusion I can think of we were near the Marine Airbase off Cherry Point NC and what we saw was the afterburner glow from departing aircraft.", "I saw orange lights moving in formation, going from north to south.

Too big to be a star, I assumed it was a planet.  After about five minutes, it shot across at a diagonal angle to the right at a very fast speed.  It then hovered, moving back and forth at what looked like 3000-5000 feet of altitude from the ground. I was observing the object at 10,500 feet above sea level, on National Forest Road 422, branch CR-4221, with a 30 degree view of the southern sky through thick pines.  Orange object first appeared to be three &quot;bulbs&quot; of light at the beginning, and after about 20 minutes diminished in brightness as it undulated and moved quickly through my field of vision.  Clouds began to move in, and block the stars but not the object entirely.  Two planes with classic red and green lighting moved below the object, at about 2000-3000 feet from the ground.

It mainly stayed red, but the way that it was moving was what held our attention; side to side in a zigzag pattern, circular, up and down.

It&apos;s huge and it&apos;s silent!!! I beleive it to be a secret aircraft or a real UFO. I&apos;m familiar with milary a commercial aircraft shapes and behavier what i saw Thursday June 26th 2008 is the oddest shape craft i&apos;ve ever seen. It looked like a B-1 bomber and an F-16 rammed together. The sun was setting but there was plenty of light so could clearly see the shape and get an idea of it&apos;s size. The front of the craft had a standard &apos;high speed&apos; fighter jet shape swept wing (30&apos;wide) without a tail section a very long fuesalage and a large main swept-wing. I would estimate the overall length to be 90&apos;-100&apos;(feet), and the wing-span of the main wing to be 80&apos;-90&apos;(feet). The color was dark non-refective gray almost ceramic looking. This craft was moving very slowly towards the South East at around 8:30pm. I watched it for about 3 minutes then it faded out. App. 60 minutes later it came back from the South East on a North Western heading moving much faster but still silent. By this time the sky was dark and could clearly see lights on it. This craft was totally &apos;silent&apos; and it had a delta (triangle shape) pattern of cream colored lights on the front half of the craft, with duller, dimmer cream colored lights on the tips of the main wing. I had seen this craft once before after dark from the side and i could tell that the front delta pattern of lights were slightly lower and a little brighter than the others. All of the lights on this craft are constant, they don&apos;t &apos;blink&apos; and there are no traditional aircraft green or red running lights. This craft is odd, it&apos;s huge and it&apos;s silent!!!.

I hold an associate&rsquo;s degree.  I am also an expert in long-haul transmissions technology with six years of military experience in the communications field.  Prior to my military service, was in project management for five years with a large telecommunications company.  I lived in and around Garland, Texas, from age 5 until I enlisted at age 28.I apologize, as the date and time of my account is only a guess, as it took place over 15 years ago.  However, I estimated the date based on a few facts: I had recently graduated high school in May 1992; it was summer; I was driving an &apos;87 Honda Civic during the incident, a car which I owned at that time.  The time was late evening, an hour or so after sunset.A childhood friend of mine and I were driving SE down what is today President George Bush Toll Way (TX 190) at around 2200.  Today, the area is very built up with shopping malls and restaurants.  But back in 1992, the only building in the area was a high school (my high school).  It was dark and, at the time, there were no street lamps.  As I&apos;m driving, my friend points to the sky through the windshield and tells me to look.  He&apos;s pointing straight up through the windshield to a point directly over my car.  And, while it was difficult for me to lean forward over the steering wheel to see what it was he was pointing at, I caught several glimpses of it.  This is what I saw: three reddish hued lights in a triangle configuration, with one brighter light in the very center of the formation.  And, while the sky was dark, the space between the lights was even darker, giving the shape a distinct triangular outline.  Because I was driving, I could only glance at the object for a few seconds at a time before I had to put my eyes back on the road.  It was difficult to tell whether or not the object was moving along with us, or if it was at such an elevation that it appeared motionless from our perspective.  When I would glimpse it, I could tell the object was rotating slowly in a counter-clockwise direction, at an estimated rate of one rotation every 30 seconds.  We were now approaching a stop sign, and I brought the car to a stop.Without speaking, immediately after I stopped, I shut the engine and lights off; we exited the car and stood up in the road to get an unobstructed view.  To our delight, the object was still there, hovering silently.  Now that we were no longer moving, we could tell the object wasn&apos;t moving, either.  It was completely stationary (though it continued to rotate in place) and produced absolutely no noise.  As far as the size of the object, it was difficult to estimate.  But I recall that, from my perspective on the ground, the triangle appeared to be about the same size as the shape one can make by touching the thumbs and index fingers of both hands and holding them at arm&apos;s length directly overhead (approximately 4&quot; x 4&quot; x 4&quot;).We continued to watch the object for another thirty seconds or so when another car began to approach us from the rear.  We quickly hopped back in my car, started it up, and pulled it to the side of the road to make way. As soon as the other car pulled away, we got back out.  But when we looked up at the sky, there was nothing there.  Nothing at all.  No noise, no lights.  Whatever we had been observing only seconds earlier had vanished.  I don&apos;t recall ever telling anyone about it, and I don&apos;t believe my friend or I ever discussed the incident with each other again after that night.  Of course, we haven&apos;t spoken to or seen one another in over ten years.I realize it&apos;s been many years since this took place.  In fact, I rarely even think about it.  However, it was several years ago that I first read an article or saw a news report about someone witnessing an object matching the exact description of what I&apos;d seen so long ago.  Since then, I&apos;ve seen or read many other separate but similar accounts.  And, since I&apos;ve always been somewhat of a skeptic with regards to UFO sightings, I tried my best to pretend what I&apos;d seen must&apos;ve been something else...maybe something I would&apos;ve recognized had it been daylight.  However, ever since that day, when I&apos;m outside at night, I still find myself staring up at the sky, semi-hoping that I might see the same thing again, if for no other reason than to prove to myself that whatever I saw actually does exist.Though I still remain skeptical, I felt I should at least contribute my experience so as to at least add my account to the collection of other similar sightings.  Skeptic or not, I saw what I saw.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I watched it as I walked. It very very slowly descended directly downward for a long time. I assumed it was something falling from space. Then, when it looked like it was just about to reach the top of the mountain, a smaller light fell or was dropped and took a few minutes to fall onto the mountain and disappear. The light then began to rise in a diagonal straight line heading southward at a noticeably faster speed than before for about five, or at most, 10 minutes. It flashed and disappeared just before crossing paths with a commercial airplane headed West. (It looked nothing like the airplane.)

Near the end of the sighting, the one light changed into 3 lights, colored red, green, and yellowish white. And, when bathed in the street light below, one could make out a cross like shape before the craft made it&apos;s exit from view.Object&apos;s Behaviors: Began as a blinking, red light in the sky, which, after seconds of sighting, began to drift to the left slowly then would STOP, change directions, STOP, and change directions again in a very erratic and sudden fashion, changing directions far too much and too fast to be of any known aircraft.  The red light would, at times, shift, or slowly turn into a white light at times, and in both modes, the light would suddenly flare, or would brighten drastically and then dim back down at random intervals and would appear to have sudden lashes of light whip from it, the color corresponding to the current color of the craft.Craft would not stay in just one general area, but would at times, move over to another area, fly about in that area, and would then return to the previous area to seemingly wander that area some more.  This was observed for approx. 14 mins. before the craft suddenly multiplied for a total of three 3 lights, a red, green, and yellowish light and began to approach closer to the western end of the town at a very quick speed, much quicker than most civilian helicopters I&apos;ve seen about town.
