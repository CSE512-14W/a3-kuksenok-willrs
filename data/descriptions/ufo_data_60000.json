I am not sure about the exact date and time but pretty close.My friend and I were with her older sister who was driving. we had been at a picnic. On our way home as we came to the end of our street was a big very bright hovering craft over a telephone pole. I remember saying Oh my gosh look! and we all looked as we came closer to the craft. There was no sound that I can remember but the brightest light I have ever seen.  The strange thing is, it was so profound yet I believe there is some time missing.  I am unsure what happened between the time we saw it and when I arrived home. We never talked about it together again. Last week I saw one of the girls after not talking in 15 years and I asked her if she remembered it and she said yes she did! I am a normal person and am not crazy. I really did see it.

Listening to music and watching the scenery pass by I looked up to the sky at about a 35 to 45 degree angle and saw what at first I took to be a airliner that was traveling east to west.  I quickly realized that the shape was not right and that it was not a more whitish color.  It had more of a gray metallic look, and there seemed to be no wings.

The sighting took place on July 4th, 2010.  My wife and I were lighting fireworks in the back yard of her parents&apos; house when suddenly the people at the house started talking and pointing to the east.  They called out to me, &quot;What is that?&quot; I saw a light moving far in the distance. Initially I thought it was a helicopter because the light seemed to flicker, like the flame of a candle.  However it was high and very fast and the light seemed to be one of burning, and not an electric halogen bulb like you see on modern aircraft.  Additionally, there were no red and white strobe lights that are standard on regulation aircraft (we could clearly see these on commercial aircraft passing at cruising altitude high overhead).  It continued north (it had first been spotted to the southeast of us), and the light didn&apos;t really change as our perspective of it did as it passed (i.e., there was no dimming effect like you might get from headlights passing you as the craft eclipses its lights, etc.).It was flying quickly, at least the speed of a large helicopter or a plane. After a minute or so it was across the sky, and northeast of us, when it rather quickly faded out of sight entirely. This was surprising to us because we were seeing commercial jets far over head and could clearly make out their blinking red and white lights over an altitude of at least 15,000 feet.The object (or a second one, identical to the first) appeared again about 15 to 20 minutes later, again in the southeast.  It followed the exact same flight pattern as the previous, vanishing again in what we can say at best was the same spot as before.A third and identical sighting took place roughly an hour after the first one.  By the third time it came around, we had gone inside to get some binoculars. The object was difficult to focus on, but the characteristics of the light coming from the object was more akin to the flame of a candle than the steady shine of an electric source.  I&apos;d say it was about 10 times brighter at least than the brightest star in the sky at that point, and perhaps three times the diameter of any of the stars.  My father in law was able to track it in his binoculars, and describes that it seemed like a round object, like looking at a disc on its side or perhaps a sphere, with the burning light coming from around the perimeter of the circumference.All in all, the sightings took place between 10:00 pm and 11:00 pm, US Central time.There were 6 adults and 2 young children at that house, and we all saw it each time.  After the third one, my father-in-law and I went next door to see if the neighbor had seen the same thing.  She and her two grandsons had seen it during one of the fly-overs.  She thought at first that it was a basket from a hot air balloon, saying that the light&apos;s quality made her think of the hot air generator present in such balloons. But she quickly realized it was moving far too fast to be a balloon.The object&apos;s trajectory was more or less level across the sky, parallel to the ground for an apparent distance of several miles, except at the end it could possibly have been increasing altitude, but hard to say without any precise measurements.The following day (July 5th), we communicated with some family who live in Wichita, Kansas, and they saw the same object flying in the same direction.Though the light was the brightest thing in the sky (the moon was not visible at this time), we heard no sound from the object on any of the three passes, only the sound of fireworks across town.  Also there was not much wind that day, so the object(s) appeared to have had to be flying under their own power.", "there formation/armada was huge.I was looking at stars with my dad over puget sound when i look west and see 28-30 redish orange orb lights stationarie in the sky.  not florecent lights like we use on earth,it was more like a different type of light, an energy ball that had a golden tint around the formation of ufos.i felt that there was a tremendous amount of very radiant energy comming off of the sun like orbs.

Since we are in the flight path of the Greater Cincinnati &ndash; Northern Kentucky Airport we thought these were smaller aircraft or helicopters judging from their speed which was slower than jets.These two objects were amber to almost orange in color and very easy to see. The size I would say was 3 &ndash; 4 times bigger than the planet Venus which is now prominent in the night skies. These 2 objects appeared to be at the same altitude but we could tell there were two separate objects.As they got closer to us, they appeared to slow down. There was no sound coming from these objects which really got us wondering what these were. The objects stopped moving completely for about 5 to 10 seconds then they both started moving slowly upward and we watched them disappear into the clouds.The weather conditions were windy because thunderstorms were in the area. Some low clouds were passing by but visibility was good. We are located about 15 miles west of Cincinnati near the Indiana border.", "yellow-orange circular lights sighted above beach in ncThere was a strange set of orange/yellow lights, horizontal (about four or five of them in a straight line curved at the ends) that were sighted (they suddenly appeared) over the beach for ten seconds, and then disappeared quickly again.

It was approximately the same brightness as the stars comprising the Plough.

The three orbs all seemed to be similar in size.  They made no noise I could hear from the freeway. Each one glowed with pure white light.Within the span of seconds, the three orbs came streaking from seemingly out of nowhere across the sky, towards us from the north, then came to a complete stop, hovered momentarily just above the treeline, then dashed away very quickly towards the south.As soon as the orbs had sped away from us, my roommate, who was driving said, &quot;Wow, did you see that too?&quot;   We then had a conversation confirming that each of us had seen the event.I decided to submit this report after reading a local news article regarding the same event.

However, this time the object hovered longer as if it were observing something.  The first time, the strange object quickly zipped across the night sky and disappeared from sight.  This time I saw a bright white flash that came from the high school I am attending.  I noticed the strange object was giving off a bright light and would become dull once more and repeat this cycle.

A forested area surrounded the end of the street. I was sitting in a lawn chair watching fireworks down on the street (the neighbors yard was up on a small hill), when I noticed something coming across the sky from the east. I knew it was far too high to be a firework, and the object was getting brighter as it got closer. It was coming what I perceived as slowly, so at first I thought it was some kind of air plane.  I was just surprised at how bright it was getting and close to be a small plane, since it was too close to be a commercial jet.  I don&apos;t really remember much sound either, no engine sounds for sure.  When it finally reached us, I saw it was a circular craft.  It hovered right above the poplar trees at the end of the street where we were all gathered!   Amazing, I was really amazed since my father watched Star Trek and being so young I was thinking it was something from the show....I could see the bottom of it, it hovered there with a very quiet sound, a quiet humming but not like any engine I had ever heard(boat,plane,car,tractor, ect).  It had different color lights on the edges on the bottom.  The lights circled around the perimeter of the bottom at equal distances. It hovered there for at least 15 minutes that I can remember.  It was close.  I&apos;m not good at estimating size, but I have a Ford F250 now, and you could fit three of them in the diameter of this craft easily.  The most amazing thing was its departure.  This is when reality hit me that this was not something from TV, even though I was only 6 or 7 years old.  It started to ascend upward, somewhat slowly, but then suddenly it just shot extremely fast straight up above the earth, and became just visible like a small star within just a few seconds, and then I totally lost view of it.

I remember thinking that it was funny that a car would pull out from this wooded area since there is no road or driveway.  It was very dark out but from driving this road every day.  I was aware that there were no roads on that side of the road.Suddenly, the orb which I had assumed was a vehicle light disappeared from behind me, but then noted in my passenger side mirror that this &quot;orb&quot; ( the color was slightly more yellowish than a clear headlight) was following directly to the right of my vehicle.  This &quot;orb&quot; followed me along the road for approximately 5 miles &quot;bouncing&quot; along the right  side of my car.  I also remember  thinking that it looked like the &quot;bouncing ball&quot; on the old  Mitch Miller show.  I then remember thinking maybe this was a UFO, but from anything I had ever seen on TV, this was not a UFO vehicle, and my radio was playing and the car was running so I  just couldn&rsquo;t figure out what this was.Then in the fall of 2004 ( October or November), I was again driving in the early morning, around 5: 15 a.m.,  I was driving south on Interstate 75 and was near the &quot;Kings Highway&quot; exit on the interstate, when suddenly to my left and up approximately 300 feet (estimate), I saw this very large plane like object.  It flew directly to the left of me and it looked like a large jumbo jet but without wings.  It was silent, and I saw no lights on this object.  I felt it was a plane that was about to crash because it was so low to the ground and now just 50-100 feet above the road and to my left.  It passed me and I looked in the mirror expecting to see a large explosion/smoke or some evidence of a crash but there was nothing.  I could no longer see anything as the sky was dark.  Again I did not lose any power to my car or radio.I picked up a co-worker in Punta Gorda and continued to travel south to Estero, Fl., that morning, and saw nothing more but did mention my sighting to my co worker, and she just laughed.We returned home the following night (Sunday) around midnight, and about 10 miles south of Punta Gorda, we both witnessed another bright &quot;orb&quot; like object high in the sky.  We watched this for about a minute and it didn&rsquo;t seem to move, then suddenly it was gone.  We did not see it move, it was just there one moment and gone the next.  Shortly afterwards as we were exiting the highway to return to her house, she looked at her watch and commented that it was much later than it should be  when we arrived back.  It seemed to take us approx 45 minutes longer to make the trip from Estero to Punta Gorda that night.I had kept these 2 &quot;sightings&quot; to myself all this time until I mentioned something to my sister in law recently, and it was she who said that round &quot;orbs&quot; have been reported in the past as UFO&rsquo;s.I then found your web sight for reporting any sightings, and felt that perhaps this may be significant, even though it has been quite sometime ago.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the dates of the two sightings are approximate.

The lights were so bright that they left a residual light shadow in my sight when i closed my eyes like when you look at a flash and it stays with you for a while after.  I would have watched it all night long if the cloud deck did not block the view.  They were white with a tinge of blue and the left most light seemed brighter than the rest.  The light clouds that would obscure the lights from time to time helped me to see that this was a string of lights as opposed to one bright one.  The clouds are not uniform in their thickness and it would show as they passed how one end would be brighter and the other would be dim and successively the other would get dim and then bright depending on the shape of the cloud. Imagine a 747 about six miles out at 5000 feet coming right at you with landing lights on.  We see this quite often from our front yard.

Heading west towards the bay. By the time I got my camera out it was in front of the sun. it was climbing in altitude and slowly turning north.  It was moving about as fast as a blimp but it was as big as two and a half commercial jets end to end.  Or from my eye view about 2&quot; long. it seem to be about 12000 feet up.Report #2 Last Friday, July 9th at around 1pm, I witnessed an aircraft hovering in the sky for a few minutes while speaking with Evva.  I thought it was hovering at a height much higher than consistent with commercial airliners landing or having just taken to the sky.I was standing at 1390 Grand View Drive in Berkeley and it seemed like the aircraft was directly above us.  The color of the aircraft was dark brown or black and shaped like a perfect cylinder, with neither any tapering at either end or anything resembling the wings of an airplane.  The end of the aircraft looked like the color chrome, but that may have been the sunlight glinting off of it.  Based on the altitude I estimate the aircraft was hovering at, it seemed like it&apos;s size was much larger than a commercial aircraft.After a few minutes, the aircraft reoriented itself from an original position consistent with the hull of an airplane flying horizontally to one flying vertically, while still holding almost the exact same position in the sky.  I then departed and did not see the aircraft any further.", "Cylidrical object with bright white lights heading northeasterly from downtown Huntington BeachAt approximately 10:30 pm my brother went outside to the balcony to smoke a cigarette and I was speaking with my sisters inside my second story apartment.  I live very close to the beach in Huntington Beach and the fireworks display at the downtown pier had just finished at 9:30 pm.  My sisters and brother were waiting for traffic to subside before the departed home.About 10 seconds after my brother went to the balcony he yelled my name very loud to come outside now.  I proceeded outside to see what the commotion was about to see him pointing in an easterly direction at an object approximately 300 feet in the air at a distance approximately 3/4 to 1 mile away moving in a northerly direction.  The object was cylindrical with bright white lights on the entire exterior of the craft and a flashing red light at the top of the object.  It continued in a northerly direction for approximately 5 seconds when it banked to a easterly direction.When the object banked you could see the object was cylindrical in shape.  It continued in a easterly direction for 10 seconds until out of site due to the low cloud cover.My estimation of the size of the craft would be about 200 to 300 feet in length with a width of 75 feet to 100 feet in width.", "July 3, 2010 sighting over Seattle,WAI was enjoying the beautiful clear night whith five family members, from the rooftop lounging area of Inn At The Market, on July 3, 2010.  The veiw over Puget Sound was amazing. Just after sunset, yet not quite dusk, I noticed a brite yellow-white fireball streaking across the sky from the direction of the space needle toward the south west.  I know this was not a plane, it was too fast, and strobes were absent.  I also know it was not a sattleite, because it was too fast.  It&apos;s size was too large to be a hellicopter yet too small to be a plane.  It was missing wings and/or rotar.  The other thing that sets it apart is it was silent.  There were no fireworks going in the area muchl ess in that direction at that time.  The height in the air that it was flying was equivalent to that of plane not preparing to land. This fireball object was moving way slower than a meteor/falling star. I am reporting this because I couldn&apos;t identify it, even with a military background.  I am truly stunned.

They asked me to come look outside; that they have seen a UFO. I rolled off the couch and when I looked, there was a bright light, that looked like a star... The problem?  It was moving in circular, diagonal, vertical and horizontal motions.  It is sort of difficult to see, but if stared at long enough it is possible to see the movement.  Also, it seemed to have smaller red dots sort of behind it, but still part of the same craft.  Not only did we see this moving object but we saw a much smaller, and less dim, object come from the larger UFO and fly through the sky and disappear!

They fly around it and then seem to disappear out of nowhere.  One my boyfriend pointed out and because before disappearing a blue beam of light shot from it.  Please look into this.. I feel as if my family cannot be the only ones who are witnessing this.P.S my boyfriend, a skeptic beyond all belief, even agreed that there were flying objects and that the white light in the sky was moving!

It was still out over the water as I traveled on and out of sight.  It was a really dark night with rain and some lightning.

They continued eastward across the horizon, until my sight was blocked by tall trees and houses.

Then, I realized that didn&apos;t make sense--they moved much faster than hot air balloons.  Since they appeared to be a fair distance away, I then assumed they might be planes from Portland airport or the military base nearby.  Although, I didn&apos;t know how far away they were, they seemed to be too close together to be planes (I&apos;m guessing 1-2 miles apart).  The color of these objects never changed, and no other lights or anomalies were seen.

It does not occur every night. It always seems to be around 11:15 pm.  I called my husband and my eldest daughter to see it one other night.  The one time there was only one in the sky my daughter said she thought it was a geo satellite.  Each other time there have been only one or two of these lights in the sky.  They flash red, green, and white and are very high up in the sky.  They do not look like stars because the stars stay white and these flash the colors.  I have driven the area where I have often seen them looking for cell phone towers or RCMP communication towers and there are none in the area where they appear.  The objects are also too high in the sky to be on a tower.  They are too far apart and appeared in the NE part of the sky, SW part and the due W part of the sky.

While basically round, it had a &apos;jointed&apos; look to it.This was in the winter on a clear, moonlit night, and it had snowed recently, so the colors and craft were highly visible.

It was getting visibly closer and appearing larger by the second.I called my son&rsquo;s attention to it, and he also saw it. By this time it was not quite directly over our heads.

It was completely silent and moving in a straight line, south to north.  I saw no visible structure of any type. There was no noticeable wind blowing at the time.It passed almost directly over our heads. I turned around so I could continue to watch it as it passed by me on its way north.  After watching it for a few seconds now from behind it, I saw it make a little series of zigzag movements, right, left, then right left, again.  It then continued heading off to the north in a straight line until it disappeared from my sight.It was impossible for me to accurately estimate the speed, size, or altitude, in the dark sky. If I was going to guess based on my gut feeling, I feel it was smaller (less than 3 ft. in diameter), rather than a large object and at a few hundred feet elevation, rather than higher. It was moving quickly relative to its size.  The total time I watched it was about 20-30 seconds, maybe slightly longer.There are a couple of things I am sure it wasn&rsquo;t.

It stayed in one spot low in the horizon; I&rsquo;d say about twenty five to thirty degrees up.Baffled, I called my husband who was at home fifteen miles away in Springbrook, WI.  I asked him to step outside and tell me what the big object in the sky was.  When he asked me the direction, I replied, &quot;Don&rsquo;t worry, you will know when you see it.&quot;  It only took a few seconds to see what I was talking about. I asked him, &quot;What is it?&quot;  He replied, &quot;I don&rsquo;t know.&quot;When I arrived at home, he was still in our yard watching it through a brake in the tree line.  We watched for about 5 seconds, and then it dipped down and to the right about an inch in a swooping motion.  I gasped, completely shocked, &quot;Did that just move?!?!?!?&quot;  My husband replied, &ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s been moving the whole time.&rdquo;  We stood and watched this thing bounce around and move.  It dipped and dived and moved in small circles, almost as if we were watching someone flying a kite with a light on top of it, a kite you could see 20 miles away, with no wind.  Several times we had to move a few steps left or right because it would move behind the tops of the pine trees.We called our friend Dan who lives 8 miles west of us in Trego, WI.  When he stepped outside, he was stunned. When I was sure that we were not the only ones who could see it. I called 911.  I couldn&rsquo;t be sure that whatever it was, it wasn&rsquo;t dangerous.At about 11:00 it seemed to start heading down in the western horizon and it got gradually smaller, like it was going away from us. At 11:05, we couldn&rsquo;t see it anymore.It was a clear night and we could see hundreds of stars and satellites, and even an airplane flew by.  But none of them moved or looked like this.  I really wish I knew a good solid explanation of what the thing was, and every night, I keep my eyes open to see if it comes back.", "Unknown very big object with 2 lights disappears no sound with it at all... thought we were going to dieI am reporting this in sadness because of this event my dog died!  My daughter went to get the dogs from outside to bring them in (she&apos;s 15) and she ran screaming &quot;get out a plane is going to hit us&quot; &quot;run&quot; and she was hysterical.  Me my husband and my son went running downstairs and my husband went to the backdoor (running) to investigate because my daughter is very meek and quiet and never screams.  The next thing I know my husband is yelling &quot;run&quot; &quot;its gonna hit us&quot; and he started praying to God that we lived and if not take us to Heaven.  We ran straight out the door as fast as our legs would go.  Myself and my son never heard or saw anything we were just running for dear life.  My husband told us to stop behind the trees because he thought at any moment it would hit and we wouldnt get much father and we live in the country so its all mostly open space.  When nothing happened he told us to keep running as I horrifyingly saw him turn back toward the house.  We kept going as we went trying to call our dogs that had escaped with us.  My husband returned in his truck to state the object simply vanished he had no idea where it went but it never hit our house or flew over us.  So we continued the search for our dogs however one was struck by a car and killed.  Later when I spoke with my husband and daughter I was informed it had 2 bright lights and was up in the sky they could see the back neighbors house below it and it made no sound and teetered a little back and forth but the lights were always horizontal to eachother.  This object made no sound what so ever and my husband said he saw the silhouette and it was as big as our back pasture across and very dark.  I am very saddened but wanted to report this because weird things have occurred before.  Like our laser lights we would play with our dogs with when we would point them in the field they would disappear at some points but would be seen all the way to the orchards at other points and we! always laughed that it was like something invisible was sucking up th e light at that spot. Im scared and wanted this reported in the case something happens to us.  Now it is time for me to grieve.", "i seen a ufo with circling lghts above hoteli was sitting watching tv my sister came running in and told me that they are real i got up ran to the door and seen it in the sky i seen a big saucer shaped object with a single red light on top lights circling the bottom i ran trying to see it past a palm tree and it was gone", "ORANGE FIERY ORB TRAVELING NORTH TO SOUTH  BENEATH CLOUD COVER THEN SHOT STRAIT UP THROUGH CLOUD COVER AND DISAPPEARED.ORANGE FIERY ORB TRAVELING BENEATH CLOUD COVER NORTH TO SOUTH.

Animated movie from prior sighting of 1997.We call this event &quot;The July Orb&quot; because we have witnessed this twice before, all in July.The event this year, 2010, was over Bothell, WA.  An orange, glowing orb silently and smoothly cruised from North to South in the same way a satellite would move, but was only as high up as a helicopter would fly. Myself, two other adults and two children also saw it.My camera was at the ready to photograph our fireworks and to pause light in the sky, and I was able to take a photograph!  The camera zoom is a 12x.  While the photo shows a tail, this is only due to the shutter being open as the orb moved.   The falling tail in the photo is due to me trying to find it to focus. Perhaps someone can figure out the size of this orb and it&apos;s speed based on these details!  Our neighbor came by and as I showed him the picture and explained what we saw he asked &quot;Do you mean like THAT!?&quot; Pointing up, there was the same thing, moving in the same direction.HISTORY Event 1: I first saw this same orb over Bothell WA, July 1997, and called Mr. Davenport to report it. I was so amazed that I created an animated version because it was hard for others to believe there was no other way to describe it other than a mystery object.  It also moved North to South, slowing and silently gliding.  However, the object was closer than the described 2010 event as I could see it pass behind trees in front of me.Event 2: July 2009, Couer D&apos;Alene Idaho, 11 or 12 pm. My husband and my sister witnessed this same orb while sitting on the dock (south and west end of the lake).  However, it raised vertically from behind a home on the same cove about 6 or 7 houses south, or the trees behind it.  It glided silently and smoothly up, then past them and over the lake and then just disappeared.

My job has me walking outside every night and the night sky is usually clear with no light pollution.  So as I was walking I noticed this really fast light in the corner of my eye.  This light had a red hue. Lasting about 5 seconds it crossed &frac34; of the sky until it disappeared into the distance.  I know it was not an airplane because it was traveling way to fast with no sound.  It was also not a weather balloon because of this factor also.  The conclusive factor I see in this is while as I was watching this light its trajectory curved.  As it crossed the night sky its path curved multiple times.  The curving was not dramatic but very noticeable and smooth. The curving path of this flying light factors out a meteor and a satellite.  Neither of these objects curve like the way this light did that night.  I also know that this light was not at the altitude of satellites because I have seen many satellites in the past and know they are very hard to see due to their high altitudes.", "A strange shaped object was floating in the air for 5 min in Yokohama City, very low then disappeared in the cloudy sky.I just reported an UFO flying up and down in a gravitating way, going upward and downward very quietly, birds were flying around it but the birds were being pushed away, causing the bird to fly downward.  First sight I thought it was a helium balloon, but too big for a helium balloon, so I ask my girlfriend for binoculars, but couldnt position the UFO insight.  Then I thought it was plastic but not plastic, UFO was floating as if it was looking for something.  The color was like aluminum foil but more of a plastic look.  It changed color shape so couldnt tell the shaped of the UFO.  I have seen many aircrafts, balloons, gliders but this wasnt neither.  But as the birds were taunting the UFO it flew higher into the sky and disappeared.  I really believe now so shocking.

The plane was obviously moving to the west and leaving a big billowy trail, while the object to its north seemed stationary in relationship to the plane and did not have a trail. I pulled to the side of the road and we watched. The plane moved on but the silver object seemed to not be moving. Then a little wisp of cloud passed in front of it.

I stopped and looked at it on my bike and after about 30 seconds it it slowly worked itself to not be seen afterward.

A dull orange colored orb suddenly &quot;switched on&quot; about 30 degrees above the southern horizon.  It was large in comparison to the stars and planets, I would estimate it was the size of a pea at arm&apos;s length.  It was moving quickly in an arc heading towards the northeast, faster than any of the aircraft that were visible but too slow to be a meteor.  The orb had an appearance similar to a circular charcoal briquet, with the center slightly flickering as it moved.  It was not very bright at all, as a landing light on a plane would be, and its circular shape was sharply defined. It did not leave a trail of any type or make any sound.  I watched it until it disappeared behind the roof of my house.  I ran to the front yard, but was unable to locate it again.  I cannot say how high it might have been except that it did not seem to be as high as a satellite.  There were numerous commercial and general aviation aircraft in the sky at the same time and I could clearly hear the sounds they made.

There were about three dark objects on the right and about 5-7 objects on the left of the freeway.  They did not have any lights.  The first 1 or 2 we saw we thought  were clouds, but then realized there were many more &amp; they appeared to be descending and moving at the same time.  In looking closer they appeared to look like parachutes. Soon after that, however, we realized that assumption was impossible.  First of all, the objects were traveling at an impossibly fast speed.  Even though we were driving on the freeway, they continued to pull further and further away from us.  Another reason that these objects could not have been parachutes was because they never came close to the ground.  Eventually, it seemed that some split off the the right of the freeway towards our house, and some went to the left of the freeway toward the Van Nuys area.  After we got off the freeway, we started to go up the hill that we live on, and I continued to look for any sign of the objects.  That was when I saw an extremely large hovering, triangular shaped, flat craft above the mountain.  Again, it had no lights, but this time, it was motionless.

It wasn&apos;t completely dark yet and we were looking up because of fireworks and helicopters.  I saw a light above that was a circle shape, the light was white.  It was very high in the air, way too high to be a helicopter with a spot light on, and was definitely not a plane.  I don&apos;t know the exact direction, but it came from the inner harbor area, and went over Patterson Park.  I asked everyone to look up at the light and everyone agreed it was definitely not a helicopter due to how high it was.  It seemed to be in the height of where commercial planes fly, but it was definitely not a plane.  It was about a pen cap size, definitely bigger than a star or a planet you can see with your eyes.  It moved slowly, it didn&apos;t zig or zag, just in a slow fluid way.  Then, towards the end, it was hard to see as it was like it was shimmering out of sight.  You really had to look for it to find it towards the end, then it just disappeared.  It was a clear night with barely any clouds in the sky so it wasn&apos;t like it disappeared behind a cloud.The light, was very solid in the center, then it was like a very slight black ring, and more light, almost like a halo around the center light.

I followed the second dimmer light and it passed directly over my position and then continued to travel northwards, as I turned my head back to look at the plane I noticed a shooting star fall somewhere behind the plane to the southwest of my position.

After walking for awhile we decide to lay down and relax for a bit in a nice grassy area.  It was a nice spot with many small trees well spaced apart.  Me and her were relaxing just talking looking up into the sky when I first spotted a group of lights.  I then pointed and said to her &quot;what&apos;s that?&quot; &quot;right there...that group of lights&quot; then I jokingly told her &quot;right there it&apos;s a UFO.&quot;  Of course she didn&apos;t believe and said something a long of the lines of &quot;no it&apos;s not!,&quot; but then 30 seconds later she spotted it as well.  So then for a good five minutes we watch the group of lights trying to talk out what it might be.(boy) The pattern of the lights is best described in my opinion is that of a school of fish swimming together. It was about 10 to 12 very dim lights in the very far distance (past the cloud line) moving around together in a very fluid motion.  The overall movement was not in a straight line, but as I said like a school of fish moving in a large circle.  Very fluid, very pretty, and very graceful movements.  The lights were very hard to keep track of, and we both had to strain our eyes to see it, but what we both saw is very consistent and unmistakable.(boy) Neither of us can say that we believe that is was aliens or anything to that effect, but what we did see doesn&apos;t a line with anything we&apos;ve seen before.  It could not have been a plane, helicopter, or satellite.  It was very foreign to us, and I thought it would be best to report while the event was still fresh in our minds.(Girl)  I don&apos;t exactly know how to describe what i saw because i have never seen anything that nearly resembles it.  To me it looked as if an invisible bubble that was nearly the size of the moon was containing a small group of 12 or so fire flies.  The light didn&apos;t move like fire flies, the movement of the light was so fluid and graceful. It was so hard to see the lights at times but once you had your eye on the lights it was unmistakable what you saw.  The lights almost looked red to me but I&apos;m not sure, just like dim stars look red sometimes.  The lights moved together in random patterns, but as they moved in their sphere they as a group moved in a circular movement.  The lights didn&apos;t flash at all they were completely solid unlike a plane light or like a twinkling star.  We watched it together and discussed what we saw for about three minutes until a cloud moved in front of the lights and then it was completely out of sight.  There was no sign of the lights through the ! clouds.  We sat for about a minute and were a little confused at what we saw and decided to get up and go home and tell my boyfriends family what we had seen.(Girl) While we had been watching the lights I had mentioned that we should call someone so that they could come outside and see what we had seen but then I realized that no one would be able to see it unless they knew where to look and also the light pollution is bad and we had been lucky enough to have stopped in a slightly dense area of trees.

Then, seemingly appearing out of nowhere, my mother and I saw an orange-red orb flying towards our house.At first we thought it might be the lights on an airplane because it was flying so smoothly, but as it moved closer we speculated it might be a flare or firework of some kind.  However, it was moving slowly, and the light wasn&apos;t diminishing in intensity at all.  There was no trail behind it--it was an entirely self-contained light.  As it flew over our house, we both noticed smaller lights that seemed to be circling around the larger light.  The smaller lights, to me, looked to be pink and green in hue (among other colors.)  I only got a clear look at it for a couple of seconds.We ran to the back of the house, out onto our deck, and watched as it flew slowly over the pine trees and over the neighborhood behind us.  Again, it didn&apos;t explode or diminish as fireworks might. It made no sound whatsoever.We ran inside and downstairs to inform my father, then ran back upstairs to watch it circling around and taking a similar path over the house for a second time.  I ran to get my camera, but the battery was dead.  I hooked up the family camcorder quickly so that it was pulgged into the wall and not running on a battery, but it was behaving strangely and kept shutting off.  We watched as the object disappeared over the house a second time.  I went to charge the other camera while my parents watched the object take its route over the back of the house again.  My father initially suggested it might be a flare, and then admitted he had no idea what it really was.My mother and I are confident we saw something out of the ordinary.  It was the moment when it was almost directly above us and we saw the smaller lights around the object that conviced us this was no typical 4th of July experience.", "bright orange glitterly light travels across sky and then dissapearsMy sister and were walking through our neighborhood and it was about 11:00pm at night.  We were cresting a hill when I saw a strange bright orange/yellow glittering ball of light overhead just above the pine trees, high in the sky.  It was very bright, as bright as a planet I would say.  Certainly not as bright as an airplane might be.  The strange light moved away at a steady slow rate and we lost it.  We walked for minute more and then suddenly we saw it again!   It was coming back in the opposite direction!  We were so stunned by this we stopped to look at it and we definitely though this light was odd. It was glittering, bright orange and sometimes reddish in tint.  We just stood there and watched it move silently, and slowly.  It&apos;s flight was somewhat wobbly, even though it moved in a straight trajectory.  After about a minute it became very dim, only a pinprick of light and then it vanished completely.  Whatever it was, my sister was overjoyed she&apos;d seen a ufo but I on the other hand was pretty shaken up.

The object was bright and was flashing red and green lights along with an almost L.E.D. white light. These lights were clearly visible to all three of us using just our eyes and later confirmed with binoculars and telescope. The object almost appeared to be rotating at high speeds which could explain to alternation of lights which had no apparent pattern. This object was relatively fixed in the same portion of the night sky compared to other celestial objects. The object would move in irrative movements, suddenly going to the left and right really fast and then in circular movements. Then, it stopped moving and the green and red lights settled down. I flashed a bright HID light at it in sequences of 3. It was like the object was reacting to my flashes by beginning to move again and flashing back once again. I couldn&apos;t believe what I was! seeing and neither could my astronomy buddies, we were all stunned.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Upon looking at it closer I noticed that the light formation on it was different than the airplanes that I&rsquo;m so used to seeing. What caught my attention was that it was moving abnormally slow for an airplane, but on par with maybe a helicopter or blimp. For a minute, I thought it could be an ultra light aircraft, but it was completely silent.  Next I thought maybe the lights on the bottom of a blimp, but I have never witnessed a blimp in 15 years of living here.  My best guess was that it was triangle shaped, but it was very hard to make out with city lights around. This thing whatever it was made absolutely no noise.  It kept slowing down and finally stopped and sat there for about 10 seconds before changing course.  It was initially heading west but stopped and changed course to heading due north. When it changed direction it went straight over head.  As it flew over I tried to make out what it was.  It had three white lights in a triangle formation with one blinking red light in the middle with one additional slightly dimmer blinking white light mixed in.   The red light was slightly brighter than the rest of the lights. It didn&rsquo;t seem to be very far up at all, and it wasn&rsquo;t very big that I could tell.  Before it changed course, it was sort of near the moon I could make out sort of a roundish looking bottom to it, but only for a second. As it moved northward, it picked up speed to what would be expected of an airplane.  I ran into the house to get my video camera, but when I came out it was way far off.I am quite used to planes flying over and see them often.  I don&rsquo;t however EVER see a plane slow down, stop, and then completely change course.   It was very eerie watching that fly overhead with no noise at all!  The blinking red light seemed to indicate that it was manmade, but who knows?   Whatever it was it gave me the creeps!  I&rsquo;m a student here, and have good eyesight and wasn&rsquo;t at all drunk or anything.  This was not the first weird thing I&rsquo;ve seen here either.  On Dec, 23 and 24 of 2009, I saw a ball of light out in the distance that looked like the spot light on the front of a helicopter, but got dimmer and after it travelled some distance faded into nothing.  I saw this twice in two days!  I followed the second one for a block or so on foot just watching before it finally blinked out.  I highly doubt it was &quot;Chinese lanterns&quot; as some might say.  These were not flickering, and they were Venus bright at times and silent.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It appeared in the SSE sky,   In a major landing path For Pearson International Airport.  The total visible time of the blue fireball was 1 second or less.

The strange noises sounded as if there were hard droplets, hail, or a large amount of pecans falling onto my roof and sidewalk from trees outside.  Being concerned that a thunderstorm was blowing in, I stood up from the computer and went to the window to look through the blinds to see outside.When I peeked through the blinds, the strange sounds immediately stopped.  I looked into the yard and into the street across the way to see if rain drops or hail were falling.  Not seeing any drops of rain or hail, I then looked out onto the horizon to see if there were any thunderstorm clouds, and immediately saw a series of strange lights directly south approximately 15 degrees on the horizon.At first, the lights appeared to be three landing lights on the front of a large airplane heading north. What was strange about this apparent airplane was that it was banked downward as if it were about to turn to the west, but it did not move from this position.  The lights were all of the same amber color, with the two outermost lights the brightest, the center light more dim.  The craft stayed stationary as if it were parked in the sky at an angle.  The other odd thing about this craft was that it seemed to be extremely large, and located approximately 5 or 6 miles southward near the junction of the Dallas North Tollway and I-35.  An estimate of the size was approximately 300 or 400 feet across (huge).Then, incredibly, another craft of similar proportions (but further in the distance), suddenly appeared to the left of the first craft, and it was banked at a different angle compared to the first craft.  The sudden appearance of the second craft was immediate, as if a light switch or strobe had been turned on.  My immediate thought was that there was some sort of fireworks or laser light show being given near the American Airlines Center near downtown.  Then, incredibly, a third craft, immediately appeared to the right, with the same proportions, but at a different distance than the other two craft.  The third craft was also banked at a different angle compared to the others.  It was difficult to discern whether the crafts were actually moving very slowly, or if they were completely stationary.Then, each craft blinked its lights off and on (the three lights of a craft in unison) as if the crafts were communicating with each other.  The blinking seemed to be in a sequence, as if each craft was a separate ornament on a Christmas tree.  The sequential blinking lasted less than 1 or 2 seconds.  All of the lights disappeared as suddenly as they had appeared, but not at the same time (each craft &quot;turned-off&quot; at different times).All of the above took place on the order of about 10 seconds.  I have never seen anything like it before. I have been searching the news sites to see if anyone else saw the same lights.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

A few weeks ago a similar incident was reported to the Jewell County Sheriff&rsquo;s office.According to Sheriff Dave Fullerton, the cause of the recent bull&rsquo;s death has not been determined.  The animal was found and reported to the sheriff&rsquo;s office last Tuesday by Jim Harris.  The bull was owned by Mike Harris but running in Jim Harris&rsquo; pasture.  It was found in a remote low area of a pasture located on 140 Road about one-third mile north of V Road.The bull was last seen by Jim Harris the prior Thursday afternoon so the time of death has been placed between that afternoon and its discovery the following Tuesday.According to Fullerton, the bull had one ear and other body parts cut off.  Since the bull was  lying on its right side, the sheriff could not see if the other ear of the right eye had been cut.  He observed, &quot;There was blood around the eye, on the left side and indications that it was partly cut, in an attempt to remove it as had been done in the other bull mutilation.&quot;  Fullerton said the person or person&rsquo;s responsible, did not finish cutting out the tongue, eye or eyes, as had been done in the other mutilation.  He noted, &quot;Something may have interrupted whoever is responsible and caused them to leave the scene before they completed the act.&quot;Fullerton checked for tracks in the snow but could only find cow tracks.The bull thought to be mutilated a month ago was found in a pasture north of Burr Oak.

As is my habit, when I got out of the car I looked up and surveyed the nighttime sky. Looking in a south-easterly direction I noticed what looked to be an airplane. Again, as is my habit, I looked for the FAA lights (blinking red and green lights). I did not see any.  The light was pretty bright, so it&apos;s possible that, due to the angle and the brightness of the light, I just couldn&apos;t see them. I also noticed the speed, which seemed relatively normal for an airplane.  The trajectory was mostly straight, though for a moment I could have sworn that I saw it drift to the east just a bit. This could have been an optical illusion.  However, over the course of the 20 or so seconds that I was watching, I saw the light increase in brilliance.  The object seemed to get bigger, though this might have been an effect of the increasing luminosity, changing from an off-w! hite color to more of a resplendent white. This lasted about 5 seconds, after which the light dimmed, making the object seem as if it were getting smaller. As it dimmed it became blue, like so many stars.  What was left, for a moment, was a dim dot of light surrounded by an even fainter corona; it resembled the dot of light that would be left in the center of the screen on old black-and-white televisions immediately after being turned off.  This lasted for just a moment, after which the dot became smaller and dimmer, until disappearing altogether. I kept looking at the sky for at least another ten minutes, in case it was an airplane that had turned it&apos;s lights off momentarily, but the light did not reappear.  I could not see the outline of any kind of craft, nor was there a sound to be heard.", "Silver Object, flashing and floating in place. Commercial Flight Altitude.To the West, over the Rockie Mountains, I saw a grey/silver object floating stationary at my best guess around 30,000 ft. It was near commercial flight altitude. Too high for a helicopter, and not moving at all, unlike a flare, missile, or Satellite.It would periodically and randomly flash a bright white light at me, as bright as a super bright iredean flare. Not in any kind of consistent order like FAA lights. Every now and again it looked like the light shown right at me. Atleast in my direction.Over the course of about 10 minutes it started to slowly move off to the North where I couldn&apos;t see it anymore.I took pictures and video of the object. I can&apos;t see it yet, but I haven&apos;t put it in Photoshop to blow it up and clean it up yet. But I did notice 2 round very strange lense blurs on my camera.

I thought it could be a military jet....but its lack of speed/being a weird bright flashy red / orange.....I COULD NOT EXPLAIN IT!

The objects were in no particular formation, they were randomly staggered to describe it best.  From my view they approached from the north making their way into my view from my building which blocked that part of the sky.  They were approaching my next visual obstacle, a tree, when one light seemed to disappear in the distance as if it went straight into the sky or due west away from me.  The other three lights then passed behind the tree.

As we were passing the Brady landfill, she noticed  something in the sky and asked what it was.  After a quick glance me and my friend said its  just an airplane, but after taking a second look we realized that it did not look at all like an  airplane.  The object looked very low in the sky and was a four cornered shape with lights in  each corner.  In one corner the light flashed back and forth from green and red. We pulled  over on the side of the highway to get a better look and try and record it on our phones, as we  did this the object started accelerating quickly west and then turned very suddenly and flew  north, across the city, very fast. As this object left, another one appeared from the east, and  flew west across the sky, before turning north, seemingly towards the airport, but ended up  staying in one spot high in the sky, which appeared to be west of the city towards the north.The second object stayed in this position for as long as I could watch it after that, which was  at least an hour, and it glowed brightly in the sky, clearly with blue/green and red lights.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Using the size of the window, 3&rsquo;x3&rsquo; as a reference and a piece of tape on the window to represent the object, the tape would be about 1 to 1 1/2  long, and 1/4 wide.The color was  an orange-yellow-red liquid fire and was moving/flowing/changing within the cylinder.  It was very bright,  and had depth, as if you could see into it.  (It did not appear to be a flat surface, but a surface with depth)  There was no glow or halo around it and no trailing tail.

(Retraced steps today and it takes approx. 45 secs. to get to where I was standing last night.)  The object was not where I thought it would be, instead, it was stationary and enlarged into a circle. (I thought the plane had exploded.  There was no sound and nothing falling from the circle.)  The light was contained within the circle, there was no halo and it was not as bright as the cylinder light.  There was still movement within the light.

Theirs a reason why psyphy depicts them as circular saucers and this one was no exeption. It looked exactly in the movies. It had 4 circular lights under it but they were not in the middle of the craft.  They were kinda grouped and at the side of the underside of the craft facing away.

It wasn&apos;t long, maybe just a few seconds before we both realized this very bright star seemed to be moving.  When we say bright, we mean like venus has been for the last several weeks, just really standing out in the night&apos;s sky.  So the &quot;craft&quot; (obviously can&apos;t call it a star now that it&apos;s moving), began to move upward in relation to it&apos;s neighboring stars then began to get brighter very quickly which we realized was being caused by it moving rapidly in our direction.As it approached I guessed it looked to be no more than 1 mile up, either that or it was a very large craft because as it flew over us we could distinguish individual lights on the body of the craft.  Also I could faintly see that there was a blinking of some sort, however my girlfriend got a much better view as she had run inside and got the binoculars.  She then raced to the north side of the house as it flew overhead and told me a moment later that she was able to clearly see what appeared to be a paramecium shaped craft with rythmically pulsing light from front to back.The craft continued it&apos;s North by Northeasterly course until I could no longer see it. It was extremely bright to me the whole 3 minutes that I was watching it. I have been fascinated by technology and space my whole life and am very familiar with our current abilities as humans in regards to vehicles and propulsion systems.  This craft or vehicle that my girlfriend and I both saw last night in no way compares to anything I have ever seen or heard of that humans can construct. It doesn&apos;t even compare to stretching our most advanced flying vehicles to the point of absurdity.  The reason I say that is the most shocking part of the experience for us:  The Speed of this craft, based on its apparent size, distance and luminosity had to be upwards of 5 or 6 Hundred MPH.  For all of its speed and distance covered, the craft we saw remained COMPLETELY silent.  I mean this thing didn&apos;t make a sound. Not in the distance and not when it was right above us, and it looked like it was over Sacramento 1 minute, then right above us in Nevada City the next, then on it&apos;s way over Nevada the next minute.I am completely certain this craft was not Man Made and I am not a ufo advocate, nor have I ever seen or reported anything like this in my life.", "Red Light, no sound, Moves from SW to NNE,  below low clouds, 10-15Sec then disappeared.I saw a, steadily Red, glowing light/object in the SW sky heading from SW to N-NE. (more north I think)  No other lights on the object that I could see.   Moving at speed of an airplane but no sound, no &ldquo;structure&rdquo; seen, no blinking/flashing lights and if I recall correctly it was just below the overcast/clouds it may have been &ldquo;reflecting a bit&rdquo; off of them.   It was definitely low in the sky at height of planes I often see going into O&rsquo;Hare.Time Lapse  Aprox 10-15 Secs.    Aprx. Time: 11pm well after fireworks.I was standing looking around in the sky at the stars, planes etc.  I had a set of binoculars around my neck (which I occasionally do now when observing the night sky).  This object caught my attention as I happened to be looking SW.  I kept looking with my bare eyes as it traveled closer towards me (initially dismissing it as probable helicopter or plane).When I still couldn&rsquo;t make it out, I took two steps forward , looked down to grab the binoculars and sit (so I could steady my hands) to get closer view&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;but, in the few seconds it took to look down, grab binocs and glance back up&hellip;while trying to feel for the chair&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;it disappeared.  No where to be found as I continued to pan the sky and recapture it.Now, I was with one other person who did NOT see the object because it disappeared before I made any comment about it.   Even though I was VERY curious about the object, I  kind of &ldquo;blew it off&rdquo;  thinking, no way this happens two years in a row, it must have been legit craft and went into the clouds when I diverted my gaze.2 Years in a row?  That&rsquo;s a weird part of this occurrence.  The same thing happened last year (and I reported it on this site then -you can view it there) July 4th 2009.  At about same time/diff trajectory.  But,  in 2009 the color and appearance was more like a Hazy Orange glowing basketball/orb- more definitively round with an entirely fuzzy glow emitting from the object itself.  Now-In 2010 the object was definitely Red and I don&rsquo;t think I would describe it as purely &ldquo;round&rdquo; NOR as having a &ldquo;hazy&rdquo; glow&hellip;&hellip;any ambient glow was more of a steady &ldquo;reflection off clouds&rdquo; this time.Sorry my facts aren&rsquo;t exact.  As mentioned, I wasn&rsquo;t going to post this as I find it rather odd that, (1) It happened on Independence Day when millions would likely be looking to the skies.  And (2) Similar events happen two years in a row?  This does not change what I saw &ndash; either year --without a doubt.  But, It makes me suspicious that somebody might be pulling off a big hoax/scam/trick somehow&hellip;.or, some manmade flying thing makes the same trip every year on the 4th?  There were many sightings last year too.I decided to post my observation after I went into your site to see, by chance, if anyone else saw what I saw and was surprised to see one other Streamwood, IL. report. Plus many others elsewhere.  I hope you can investigate this somehow to see if there is an &ldquo;earthly&rdquo; answer.  Next year on 4th maybe you can send out trained spotters in Midwest with good equipment?

It was sometime between 9PM and 10PM.I noticed a bright white light, in the direction NWN, about two fists above the horizon, not much higher than the fireworks going off all over the horizon.  I guess it was two or a few times brighter than Venus, and seemed to be stationary, maybe moving a little bit.  My guess was that it was a helicopter less than a mile from me, coming in to the hospital - except that it never came.  I watched it for a few minutes, maybe 5-10, but it didn&apos;t change appreciably in any way.  Then it just kind of disappeared.  I assumed it was a plane or helicopter that turned a different direction, but I never saw one.It seemed a little strange.  I assumed (and still think it&apos;s likely) that it was a plane or helicopter, but considering the numerous reports that night, I have decided to make this report.", "Possible explainations of what i saw in Salt Lake City last night((name deleted)) in Salt Lake City 24 hours later:  I&rsquo;ve tried to make sense of what I saw last night and came up with two plausible theories.  The first, which I have disqualified is that I was witnessing a reentry by the Space Shuttle at a much greater distance than I originally perceived and at an angle more or less directly toward my position.The second, is that I was watching some sort of burning balloon.  I had this notion in my mind tonight and then saw some you tube videos on Chinese lanterns.  If that is what I saw, it was quite large and was either on fire entirely, or was supporting an enormous flame before burning out.  This does however explain the orange flame color, the lack of sound, the slow movement, and the ultimate disappearance if it were to burn itself out.Still, I wish someone would confirm they saw what I saw last night, or someone would confess to launching the thing.  Like I say, I saw it for two minutes before it disappeared.  It could have been there much longer before I noticed it upon admiring the full moon.", "During the fireworks display at 10PM, 4 of us witnessed a red/orange glowing sphere or disc shape moving silently, smoothly and quickly at around 300 feet across the sky until disappearing from our view.

It was July 4th and my wife and I wanted to watch the fireworks. It was getting dark, but it was still light. I got the ladder out so we could get on the roof and watch the neighbors shoot off fireworks. After my wife and I got on the roof, we both saw a fireball streak across the sky, from the south heading what looked to be due north.  There where clouds also that night. It was traveling at a very high rate of speed.  The fireball was bright orangish and was directly to the west of us.We could see it as it passed in and out of the low clouds, reminded me of the flame coming off a missle. But, I didn&apos;t think it was.  A few minutes later we saw another one.  Same type direction and so forth.  The Fourth one though, came out of the south and flew directly over head at which point I could no longer see it for the clouds.I had gotten a real good view of it. It was just a fire football shaped traveling very rapidly.  Jets fly over all the time but it was going at a much faster rate.  And it seemed to be heading North by Northwest.

Fearing someone had hit my car I looked outside to see nothing out of the ordinary, but due to the load nature of this boom I continued to scan my neighborhood.  I then looked up to see that there was a orange ball of light in the sky.  This ball looked to be like fire, but seemed to be in a half circle shape, rounded in the front and trailing off to the back side.  I immediately called my wife to come to the window and take a look, and she came to the window and watch the events with me.The orange light in the sky continued from south to north disappearing behind a few clouds before reemerging from the clouds.  After this light had reached almost the end of our vision another orange light very much same shape as the first appeared to the south tracking about the same direction.Then we heard a boom to the north of our house.  The boom was accompanied by a bright flash that seemed to emanate from ground level, and that was very bright.  This was no fireworks, it was bright white, produced shadowing effects and kind of hurt our eyes.  Then this happened again, I moved to a window I could see farther north from but did not see anything burning nor any explanation for the booms or flashes.My wife then announced to me that another one had appeared to the south same as the first two.  Prior to this one even getting close to our house we heard two more loud booms each accompanied by that same bright flash.  At one point I feared we were under some kind of attack mainly due to the intensity of the booms, and flashes, I dialed 911, as I awaited the dispatcher (placed on hold and transferred once since I called from my cell phone, made this call at 10:30 per my cell phone memory)  I saw another one enter from the south this one on a path south to north but much closer to my house.We heard a total of eight to nine loud booms, and saw a total of four bright orange lights. and witnessed 6 flashes, we were not at the window for all of the booms, got phone for one and was moving to different window for another, and the original boom that made me go to the window was approx 3 booms I had not been looking outside during.The 911 dispatcher told me they had reports of fireworks in the area, but I told him it was not a fireworks display. The light was high enough to be in clouds, and was traveling south to north at a fairly slow pace for something that high in the sky, with the flash and explosions occurring farther north then the orange light in the sky, and the flash appearing to be ground level.During the event my wife and I saw our neighbors come outside pointing into the sky at the lights, with still other neighbors looking out their windows for the origin of the booms. I do intend to talk with them tomorrow, but wanted to file this tonight as the information was fresh on my mind.Although I do not personally believe in Aliens or any such thing, I know today I was witness to something unidentified and flying.  I am not prone to events like this, having worked 10 years as a paramedic and been very scientifically grounded I realize now, that this was something very odd and I am intent to find out what was going on.", "Bright slow light in the sky moving from NW to SW like a satellite but very much brighter July 7th 2010My 14 year old son and I were outside cleaning up @ 10:47 PM.

The street we were on ran north and south. A red fireball appeared in the northern skies, directly north of us, and we initially thought that it was a flare someone had shot off.  The red fireball continued to fly overhead and to the south-south-east.  It was definitely flying lower than a commercial airliner but higher that a local police or news helicopter would be flying. Its altitude was more like what the local military jets fly.  Its flight speed was also similar to what U.S. jet would be.  Also, it did not emit any noticeable jet, propeller, or helicopter rotor sounds.  Once it was almost out of site, it appeared to increase altitude and head back northerly along the same path.  We then notice two additional red fireballs coming from the same northern location and travel along the same path as the first.  I ran into the hou! se to get my binoculars and viewed the crafts as small single balls of reddish light; no other shape of the craft was apparent in the dark night sky.  One member of our party took two digital still pictures of one of the crafts with little to no enhancement by the limited zoom.  Before the end or the half hour encounter, four more craft individually traveled overhead from the north to the south.  All craft had the same attributes.

I would also estimate it to have been approximately 8 to 10 times the size of those planes.  It moved very quickly and made no discernable sound and left no trail.The object appeared to be mostly white in color, possibly glowing or having a shiny reflective surface.  It appeared to be cylindrical or &quot;cigar shaped&quot; with a dark line or area at its center, with brighter areas at each end.  No flashing or blinking lights were observed, though there appeared to be a mild haze around it.Both my son and I observed the object until it disappeared from view.

It has a nice open space where the stars are visible with a picnic area that you can sit at.  We went out wanting to enjoy the nice weather and have a romantic ending to our night.  It was around midnight when we went, walked to the back of the pond and sat down.  We where there for aproximately 10 minutes when I looked up saw something circular blinking in the sky.The object was towards the south of us flying lower than an airplane would, and it was blinking red, green, orange, blue and yellow, something an airplane would not do.  I urged my husband to look at it, and he agreed that it was not a plane.  The object was not moving at all, as if it where hovering.  We both at the time just kind of blew it off a bit,joked about it being a UFO we lit a cigarette, and looked up and it was gone.  This is when we began to freak out and get real serious about it, realizing that we where talking about it and observing it for at least 10 minutes without it moving, and then it just disappeared.We continued to scan the sky when I noticed the same looking object to the west of us.  Appearing about 5 minutes after the other one dissapeared.  It had the same blinking colors, only the distance seemed closer, and lower than before.  We kept watching it hover in place, shift to the left and right real fast, and then at moments it would stop flashing colors and turn a yellow-orange color.  It also would get distant and then come closer.  My husband then noticed to the north another one, by this time I am really freaking out, and almost in tears because I cant believe my eyes.  My husband on the other hand excited about what he is seeing.  My husband watched the one towards the north as I watched the one to the west.  We would report back and forth to eachother what they where doing as we watched.  My UFO then shifts right then zooms left leaving a trail of light behind it then dissapears in a split second.  If i would have blinked I would have missed it! Im still not sure where it d! issapeared to.Since the UFO I was staring at had disappeared we both continued to watch my husbands, which was not moving at all.  It was just flashing red, orange, green, blue, and yellow.  I looked over in the direction where the one I was observing disappeared, and it reappeared!  They where both there in the sky again, one to the north, and one to the west.  The one that I was watching seemed as if it would get distant, and then come closer, contunuing to shift right to left and up to down.  My husbands seemed to stay in the same spot not getting closer or farther.  As we observed them seperately we would continue to report back and forth to eachother what they where doing.This all came to an end at about 2:40 p.m. when all the sudden mine turned yellow-orange, then his did too.  Then mine started blinking colors, then his did too.  Then all the sudden both of them began to get distant and higher extremely fast together(still in their seperate directions of west and north), then they both just disappeared.   We stayed until 3:00 to see if they would come back, but they didnt, so we walked to our apartment.From what we collected and witnessed, it seemed as if the two crafts where comunicating back and forth with their lights because one would blink lots of colors then turn to a yellow-orange color, then the other would do the same.   And it also seemed as if the one I was watching was on a mission, as the other one was on the lookout.   We collected this because mine was doing all the moving and his was just still.I had a very hard time getting to sleep after having experienced this.  My husband was very excited about our experience, and was releived that he now knows life on other planets exist.  He seemed pretty calm about it, but still said that he was a little freaked out.

I studied harder and harder, as did my boyfriend and human aircraft was not coming up as a logical option.  It was traveling very fast but you could tell it was so high that it wasn&apos;t going from point A to B in a snap, as others describe sightings often.  It was the type of thing that when you looked away for a few seconds, and tried again to sight it, it would be much further east.  (Kentucky facing Indiana).  Eventually it got to be at such an elevation, it was hard to keep up with and make out anymore. Moments later, I noticed even further southeast, it seemed to have two other identical objects waiting for it.

It&apos;s really bright and teardrop shaped.  This started June 10th and had accured every night since.  Only one night did I see it move.  Thats when I decided to report this.  That really spooked me a bit. 6-29-10 was the only time I saw it move.  I jumped in my car and followed it.  When it was flying I heard no sounds at all and the light seemed to change to a strobe looking light in the middle and appeared to have solid lights around the perimeter of the craft.  It appeared to stop at  times and change direction fast. I followed it down to main street in Norristown where it appeared to hover for a while.  It also appeared much lower in altitude once it reached main street.  This for sure needs to be looked into.  I have ten or so witnesses including myself.((NUFORC Note:  Venus in wnw sky?

I worked for the Utah power and light company out of Salt Lake Utah around 1981-82 time frame and I was on a small crew near Jensen, Utah, erecting power line towers.  We had just finished one of the towers at around 6:00 pm and began loading all of the equipment into the trucks getting ready to end the shift and go back to the warehouse.One of the guys spoke up and said look at that!  The object looked like a silver cigar holder and I would say it was approx. 40-60 ft. long, and approx. 10-15 ft. wide, and rounded at both ends, with a gold light on the front and a blue light in the middle.  I also estimate that the object was about a mile away from us at the time we first saw it.  As best as I can remember it had no signs of trailing gas and was silent.  We saw it coming from the northern horizon and it only took probably 10 seconds to go out of sight in the southwestern horizon.  I know that it was not a satellite, jet, or anything I have ever seen before, it was in our inner atmosphere, in other words it was very close to us.  My opinion the SR-71 Blackbird or the X-15 wouldn&rsquo;t have had a chance.  I have been seeing a lot of reports on the net and on TV about sightings lately and am very reluctant to let anyone know about this.This event happened years ago and it is as though it happened a few minutes ago.  It has been bothering me for a long time and I am just now getting the courage to tell someone, it is a relief!  I mentioned this to my wife once and she said, are you sure you weren&rsquo;t smoking pot, drinking or something?  I replied to her that all that I was doing was drinking a jug of iced tea I had in my lunch.   She didn&rsquo;t take me serious at the time but she has since then changed her mind.  I work for a government defense contractor now and am aware of the many false reports that people make and some that are very real.  I know what I saw was real and in my knowledge of air travel and planes, jets, drones and similar aircraft, we have nothing! like what I saw.  This was in the 1981-82 time frame.

My balcony faces Northeast towards Nellis Airforce Base in Las Vegas, NV, and has a clear view of the northeastern section of sky.  As I smoke, I frequently watch planes landing or taking off from Mcarren Airport, or I watch aircraft fly to and from Nellis.  On August 27th around 3 p.m. I was on my balcony, and I noticed right away that a plane was approaching Las Vegas from the North. Whats interesting about that is Ive learned through months of everyday observing that planes do not fly in from the North, so I picked up my binoculars (used for watching the planes and helicopters fly from Nellis) and saw that it was one of those &quot;Janet&quot; planes that transport employees to and from Area 51 (Classic red stripe passenger plane with no identifiable markings). As I followed the plane with my binoculars, I then noticed something appear in my field of vision that was further away beyond the! Janet plane. I stopped and adjusted my binocs to get a clearer image of what this object was, and once I did I could see a white, solid, dome shaped object hovering in place far off in the distance. I know distances can be deceiving, so I dont want to say how far away i think it was exactly, but I can say it was miles, beyond Sunrise mountain and perhaps even Lake Mead. I stood and watched it for 2-3 minutes until I noticed another Janet plan coming into approach at McCarran. I took my eyes off the craft for only a second and when I scanned the area it had been, it was gone! I searched the entire sky for about 20 minutes and never saw it again. It was dome shaped, white and never moved from the spot I first saw it. I assume that it was far away, and if it was then I would say the craft was huge. Being stationary, I was able to study it for 2-3 minutes through my binoculars and though it was too far to make out any details, I can say it was big enough to clearly make out it! s shape. I am absolutely certain that it was not a plane, heli! copter, weather balloon, or any other craft Ive ever seen in my life. It was a clear, hot summer day with no clouds in sight.

Initially though it was a nearby mylar balloon ascending in the evening wind.  Upon observing, I realized it was considerably more distant because a light aircraft landing nearby at a community field eclipsed the object and based on the size I would have estimated it to be much closer if it was a &quot;free-ranging&quot; balloon.  Still skeptical, I observed and noticed the sphere ascending slowly to the south at a steady rate.  A faint fuzziness existed around its perimeter. I photographed the sky using a blackberry camera phone such that each frame should encompass the sphere.  To my amazement the object passed behind a thin but opaque cloud during the observation period.  This then confirmed that it was much higher and further away than a mylar balloon or facsimile.  The object maintained its altitude (estimated ~2000-3000 ft).  The presence of numerous jets landing and small private aircraft preclude the notion of a misidentification of a plane as a black/opaque sphere.

Since there are street lights out front it was kind of hard to see, so I went out back (about 9:45pm) and kept looking up in the sky.  As I was looking at the stars, suddenly one started moving across the sky and as it was headed straight for another &ldquo;star&rdquo;, that star shifted right and let it! go by then it moved back into place. Another &ldquo;star&rdquo; that it passed started moving in the opposite direction.  There were greenish light streaks moving a little ways to the left of it.  I watched all of them until they disappeared.Then around 10:15pm I went out front again and saw yet another one moving across the sky, it did a zigzag then went straight.Each one of these things were visible for under 5 minutes each before they disappeared.It is now 12:22 am and I have gone out several times since then and have not seen them again.  I will keep looking and if I see them any more tonight I will post again.If anyone else reads this and sees the same thing please post it.  Thank you.((NUFORC Note:  Probably a star or planet?

I began to watch it as it traveled across the sky very slowly.  It was low for a jet or commercial plane, but still much higher than any blimp you would normally see.  I began to think maybe it was a weather balloon of some type, but eventually decided that since it was traveling on such a direct path that it must be some sort of vehicle with an engine.  I was first surprised by the fact of a blimp so high in the air at first, but what really surprised me was what happened after it had traveled halfway across the sky.  It was traveling at the same speed, never stopped or slowed or sped up, yet when it had traveled roughly halfway across the horizon it spat out a huge chunk of white &quot;smoke&quot;.  Then about 3-5 seconds later it spit out another hunk of what I thought was smoke.  Now there were 2 dashes ! of smoke across the sky coming from what I thought was a blimp.  My second witness also witnessed these puffs of smoke.  However, seconds after these two puffs were spat out, it began to emit a CONSTANT trail of this smoke like substance, just like your typical Chemtrail (or Contrail, I suppose).  After traveling at the same speed completely across the horizon, this Blimp (which looked like a cigar covered in Aluminum foil) just SUDDENLY, out of nowhere without changing a thing in trajectory, speed, or altitude, began to omit a chemtrail. It literally looked like a giant crop-dusting blimp, miles in the air.  The thought of it made us feel extremely eerie and upset for the remainder of the day.", "4 red/amber lights seen 4 times in 45 minutes- no sound, circular shape- clear night.Sitting out on the deck overlooking the ocean in the 6800 block of Ocean Drive on Emerald Isle.  Almost full moon and clear night- little clouds in the sky.  Looked up with my daughter and asked her if she saw the lights and she agreed- we saw 3 red/amber lights in a row, no sound coming from them, maybe a flicker, but not blinking- then one by one they went out- in a row.  About 10 minutes later I  saw them in about the same position in the sky and they appeared to come on one by one and then go out one by one- a total of 3 lights.  Again, no sound, no continued blinking like a helicopter or a plane would make- silent.  I called my family outside- 4 more adults and 6 more kids.  In about 10 minutes we again saw the row of red/amber lights- 4 lights this time come on in silence and then go out- my dad said&quot; well that was a circular shape&quot;.  Everyone started screaming and was very excited.  10 minutes later we saw it for the final time a little bit further no! rth or to our left.  Caught it on  video film this time- same amber lights- no blinking, just on and then off, one at a time.  Everyone agreed it was not an aircraft, flare or fireworks- no smoke, no sound, no &quot;falling flames&quot;- just the lights in the sky.

It was faintly dark gray and was spinning so it looked like a rectangle building block being thrown and spinning. It spun and flew slowly for about 9, 10 seconds.  I was watching this from my balcony so I had a very clear view.  It was spinning to look as if someone had thrown a very big, very far rectangle and it was actually going very fast and I would be able to tell if I was way closer.Then all of the sudden, it stopped spinning, it was still flying for 3 seconds, then stopped flying also. Since it was sitting there just still and obvious for a couple seconds I wanted to grab my low power telescope as soon as possible. So I got my telescope and came back out.  It was still in this position. So I looked at it through my telescope, and all I saw was the same big gray rectangle but, this magnified, I could see that one corner of it (the top right corner) had a bent, broken off part. I zoomed in and out and if I zoomed out slightly, I couldn&apos;t see the broken off part. It just looked like the rectangle I saw without the telescope.  But through the telescope, as zoomed in as I could possibly get, I could see the faintest yellowish glow around the edges of the rectangle.  There were no sounds or rumbles whatsoever coming from said rectangle(s). Nor any lights.  Just dark gray.I know it had to be something far, far off in the night sky and not some kind of bag or weird toy (they&apos;re making all kinds of weird, powerful kids&apos; toys these days) because even through my telescope it was still far and fuzzy.  And I&apos;ve easily looked at Jupiter through my telescope before.After putting my telescope back down on a chair, I looked back up in the sky and it was gone... poof... just... gone. Very frustrated, I stayed on the balcony looking at the sky. The same thing came again, appearing over some nearby buildings.  But this one (or the same one?) was not spinning, just flying through the sky very slowly. I looked at this one through my telescope and saw nothing.  Not one thing!  So I looked up and it was gone, again.  Weird?

We noticed an object in the sky and stopped our vehicle and actually got out of the car as did the people in the car in front of and behind ours.  We all stared up at a circular disk hovering at tree top level.  It was about the size of a station wagon.  It was silver with different colored lights around the perimeter.  It hovered there not making a sound for a few minutes while we watched standing by the sides of our cars. It then just zoomed off at tree top level with a whooshing sound at a very fast, steady speed and disappeared quickly.  We didn&apos;t say a word to the other people watching (which seems odd in retrospect) and got in our car and attempted to follow it.

That night, my girlfriend and I were sitting on their deck enjoying a romantic evening when 5-6 lights appeared maybe 35 degrees above the horizon.  At first I dismissed it thinking that it was just a group of air planes from the nearby military base, but as we watch the lights go higher in the sky they began to divide into smaller points of light and dramatically change direction.  By now we were curious, knowing that neither of us had seen anything move so quickly and precisely in the sky before.  The lights came closer and closer and were just below cloud level when all of the darting points reconvened and assumed a linear shape.  The lights were at an angle that made it impossible to tell for sure, but it looked almost like a bent line (chevron?) as it veered north.What made it so peculiar and distinctively not an airplane was the in consistency of its movement and the way the lights divided themselves.  I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like it and must say that it was certainly one of the most eye opening experiences I&rsquo;ve ever had.((NUFORC Note:  Date is not indicated by the source of the report.

We noticed it was no further than a half mile in the air and about 5 miles to the north west of us.  It moved very fast and came right over the top of my house. To start off it was a very bright white light.  But the closer it got it seemed to change from white to orange. As it got over my house my husband and I looked up and the light was so bright we could not see past the light to see what it was.  It made no noise at all, which I thought was very strange due to how close it was.  But then the light seemed to fade and what ever it was just disappeared. It was gone by 11:16 pm.  Only lasted 3 minutes but it has really intrigued me. I am going to go by a video camera because it seems as if these sightings are happening more o! ften in this area.

I noticed overhead an object at about my 11 o clock position .  In shape it was somewhat like a spade from a deck of cards but less round. The first thing to come to mind was a phoenix, it was glowing very bright yellow and was flowy like feathers.  It was relatively small about 5 feet wide and 3 feet long.  It remained in that spot in my line of sight for a few seconds, then it simply vanished after turning pale in color, almost white.  After that happened for the rest of the way home,(just about 3.5 more miles), in the sky there were what appeared to be shooting stars going different random directions through the sky.

My co-worker was spending the night, so I called her out because I couldn&rsquo;t believe what I was seeing and I needed witness.  I also called my grandmother.  They both looked at it and told me that it was a typical star, just bright.  My co-worker and I drove across the street to rent a movie.  We were only gone for about 5 to 10 min max.

I immediately called my grandmother because this was the craziest thing that I&rsquo;ve ever seen.  My grandmother went outside and said that it was unusual how low that star had gone.  She agreed that it couldn&rsquo;t be a star or a plane because it had been stationary for extended periods of time.  My co- worker agreed that this was strange.

I know this was around the time I earned my driver&rsquo;s license, but the date may be off by a year or so.  Sorry for the inconvenience.At the time, I was living in Winslow AZ, and two friends and I were driving to Flagstaff in the late afternoon to catch a movie.  I was sitting in the back seat, passenger&rsquo;s side. We were traveling west on I-40, coming up on the Leupp exit. This is the first exit after Winslow, traveling west.  At this exit, there is a large butte.  I&rsquo;m not sure how tall the butte is, but here is a link to google maps where you can see the actual google photo of the butte.  There is a car and a couple of road signs in the picture to help with the scale of the photo.http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;ll=35.065833,-110.825272&amp;spn=0,0.084543&amp;z=14&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=35.069161,-110.834558&amp;panoid=--tNYYmSTeVgXLV4q9Gpgw&amp;cbp=12,0,,0,5  As we approached this exit and butte, we were startled by the sight of what appeared to be a hovering commercial airplane to the right of the car.  Just an average airplane, only without any insignia or markings.  We could clearly see the windows, without people in them.  Not only was it hovering, but it was incredibly low.  Only two or three times the height of the butte off the ground, less than 1000 feet.  There was no sound.Like I said, this took place during the afternoon, and well within the sight of the highway. It was practically hovering over the exit ramp.  There were tons of people pulled over on the side of the road, going in both directions.  They were talking about it, some on their phones, others were taking pictures. We were too scared to stick around to see what would happen next, so we kept driving.  I remember turning around in my seat to watch it out of the back window.  It stayed in the same position until I lost sight of it.How many people must drive on that major interstate in the afternoon on any given day during a 15-30 minute period? My guess is about 500.   Everyone who drove by saw it, it was impossible not to. I&rsquo;m hoping one of those people will remember seeing this too, possible post a picture.

This was also witnessed by my wife and our two sons, and also my friend and his wife (and perhaps his two kids).  We first saw the objects while driving home in our cars from a fireworks event in town.  We were in two separate cars but close to each other.  We were about 1.5 miles away from where the fireworks were when we saw about 5-6 objects low in the sky.  We first saw the objects travelling down Landry Avenue, toward Kelly Boulevard (in North Attleboro), in the vicinity of the Joseph Martin Elementary school.  They appeared to be travelling north to south (or slightly northwest to southeast).  My wife first saw them, as I was driving the car.  I looked over and my initial thought was that whatever they were, it was definitely strange (particularly the brightness and the slow movement of them).  I thought it was a constellation for a split second, but then quickly realized they were too low and too bright to be a constellation.  Again, they were very low in the sky and much brighter than any night star or planet that I&rsquo;ve ever seen.(I should mention that we had a weather cold front move through earlier in the late afternoon that day with heavy rain, so there was still a heavy overcast, although the town fireworks went off as planned.  The cloud ceiling was high enough that the fireworks were visible; no issues there.  There was no rain at the time of this sighting).We proceeded to drive to my house, which was just around the corner.  My friend and his wife were heading to their house, which was some 30 minutes drive away (Northborough, MA).  As I got out of my car, 3 of the objects were almost directly overhead.  My guess is that they were several hundred feet up in the sky, to maybe a thousand feet.  They were all uniformly reddish/orangish and appeared to &quot;shimmer&quot; slightly.  They had the shape of a small dome, and they were fairly large (you didn&rsquo;t have to strain to see them).  They were definitely larger than anything in the sky and symmetrical as best I could tell.  My wife and my two boys witnessed the same thing.  I called my friend on his cell phone and asked if he saw them, and he said he had, and thought they looked really strange.  He was puzzled too.  2 of the 3 objects were very close to each other at one point, with the 3rd one straggling behind.  At one point, the 3rd one seemed to increase its velocity slightly, moving sideways, toward where the other two were.   What I thought was really unique is that they made absolutely no sound.  They kind of hovered, then moved slightly.  I watched them for only about a minute, and then they disappeared into the overcast above.I called the local police and they said they didn&rsquo;t receive any calls; same for the local newspaper, nothing.  North Attleboro is a town of about 30,000 or so, so we&rsquo;re not a rural area; others should also have seen this (particularly with fireworks having just ended and a lot of cars on the road).  Landry Avenue is a main route that took people away from the fireworks, which many people viewed at the High School, also on Landry Avenue.I also sent an email to several friends that are in my section of town to ask them if they saw anything; I haven&rsquo;t received responses back yet, as of this morning.", "Yellow lights in formation; very fast; no soundI observed two lights- yellow in color- from the South East moving North East at an rapid rate.

The one in front would move a bit then stop as the one behind would move the same amount before stopping and the front one move again.The movement was much like that of an inch worm.  Once the lights arrived back at the place where i first seen them they stopped and just hovered untill they gradually faded away.I believe that they were nor still but moving in the direction away from earth causing the illusion of stillness and them fading out of sight.There was a family of 3 and two crossing guards which i know saw the lights along with me and my girlfriend.", "I WAS OUTSIDE WATCHING A THUNDERSTORM.

I looked up at the sky and spotted what I thought was a shooting star.  I was very bright and falling very quickly.  It suddenly stopped and started to fade away.  As it faded away, I saw what looked like 3 red lights in a triangle formation.  Then the white lights got very bright again and looked like LED lights.  When lit fully it almost looked like an X, but curved.  It looked far away but very big, probably the size of a large plane.  It moved faster then anything that I could imagine.  I watched it go from one part of the sky to another in seconds.  It continued to fade away and I would see the red lights again and then get very bright white again.  I really can&rsquo;t stress the speed that it was traveling and the size of it.  There is no way that something that large should be able to move that fast.  After 4 minutes I decided to run in and grab my video camera.  I was able to get a! bout 45 seconds of it on film and it does show the speed that the object moved at.

I was taken aback at first, because I know that most helicopters in the area flash and blink lights and more importantly, make a noise.  No planes fly in and out of the area at that hour of the morning.The objects were travelling at a constant rate toward my home.  As they neared, the lights of each three went out one by one.  I have never seen or experienced aviation aircraft to suddenly turn off any of their lights to the point of complete darkness.  I followed the path of the lights of where I thought they would have been should the lights have stayed on, and in the darkness I saw a faint grey shape, that became slightly larger in size, with no light, no flashing, that you would expect from any aviation aircraft, especially over populated London areas.Again, these orange/red glowing &lsquo;orbs&rsquo; and the shape were at the height of helicopters, and completely silent.

It was flying north at a downward angle.  It looked like it was right over us.  It then appeared smaller as it turned and leveled out north then suddenly it went East and disappeared.   We got back into the car and headed North.  I looked out again and it reappeared over town again.  We turned the car around and headed South see it, but it disappeared again.

It appeared coming in from the South West at a very fast speed, than slowing to 150 mph or about the speed of a small plane.  Its altitude was approximately 3,500-4,000 feet.  The size of the object was approximately the size of a blueberry or the end of your small finger and was glowing orange with a plasma haze around it.  The object was consistent with its trajectory vector and color as it traversed across the sky.  Than it abruptly turned and accelerated in speed, going South East over Portland, OR, at a gradual increase in altitude until it was no longer seen.

We were going to get some dinner.  It was 8pm and we saw a grey-black ob-long object streak out of the north sky over I635, make an impossible J curve to the left and disappear behind the Forest Tower Building.  It was larger then a Jumbo Jet and performed the whole manuever in less then a second. I&apos;ve been to many air shows and can assure not even a fighter jet could move that fast and would never come that close to the ground or public buildings.

My Dad actually thought it might be a plane on fire at first and called 911 in Genesee County to report it.  We were told by the dispatcher that we perhaps saw Meteors from the Pegasis Meteor showers that were going on.  We have been watching them and know the duration of a meteor or shooting star is usually seconds.  We actually saw it a second time but further away and lower on the horizon.  The direction of travel was NNE from the Big Dipper towards Cassiopia however it was actually below Cassiopia constellation.  When  it disappeared it looked like a star however when it was overhead, two of the persons smelled a burning smell in the air.  The other two did not.The 911 Center did call us back and stated that Bishop International Airport did not have any reports of aircraft in trouble.", "Huge space shuttle like --- blimp like object observed floating above SeattleI was looking straight across Puget Sound from Suquamish in Kitsap county towards the Seattle skyline when I saw an object hovering above North Seattle about 2,000 feet above the tops of the buildings. The object looked very similar to the &quot;Space Shuttle&quot; only it would have had to have been 10 or 15 times the size of the space shuttle.  It was white and reflected a lot of light as if it was quite shiny.  If it wasn&apos;t a giant &quot;Blimp&quot; made in the shape of a very large space shuttle---then it was something that I have never seen before.  I called my wife on the cell phone because I knew she was traveling on a Washington State Ferry just leaving the downtown area of Seattle.  I asked her if there was a Huge Giant Blimp in the shape a space shuttle hovering over the city--she said she could see something similar to what I was describing but there were too many buildings and trees blocking her view to get a real good look at it.", "Low flying silent object with pulsating lights, possibly landing at airportI was outside looking at Jupiter through our telescope and decided i would go inside to get a drink of water and then come back out, but i as i was walking back to the house i glanced to the west and saw a low flying white blinking light, so i walked fast over to the west side of our yard to get a better look.  The object was probably about two or three miles to the west, and less than a thousand feet above the ground, and moving at around 80 or 100 mph.  There was a white light that was blinking fast, and a red light on the rear that appeared to be moving back and forth, I could not hear any sound at all. I did not observe this through the telescope because of how fast it was moving, and i should also mention the telescope is very heavy, so it is difficult to move it around. The object was moving northbound, and as it got about five or six miles to the northwest, it started to decend, and it eventually disappeared behind some trees, possibly landing at the Lawrenceville-Vincennes airport in Illinois, and if so, was probably just an airplane, but the object made no sound at all, so i am not quite for sure what it was.", "A rotating TR-B3 Spotted in California.I am 15, living in california (14, yesterday.) I had gone to see my grandparents in San Diego.  I am unsure of the date, but it was either the day or the day after my birthday. (August 9th, possibly 10th) I was looking outside the window as we were driving down the highway.  In the car was my mother, I and 3 girls that were friends and worked for my mother since we own a farm.  The time was anywhere between 9PM and 12AM.  I noticed a few white dots moving in the sky, but my eyes quickly adjusted. It was fairly large, possibly 120 yards in diameter and black, triangle shaped.  It had three lights on the bottom. I forget if there was one in the middle.  I assume it was a variation of the TR-B3 after researching it.It spun horizontally while gliding in all directions.  I believe it spun from right to left.  It would glide low along the fields about 200 yards to our right and than rise and fly over the highway.  It was a busy night and there was traffic on this highway out in the middle of nowhere.  As it flew overhead I could make out the shadow of it blocking out the stars as it was a clear night.  It repeated the same manuevers and the traffic began to clear up after about 20 minutes.  At that time it sped off in the direction we were going, west along the highway.  We were pointing towards beale airforce base. We were on the way home from Six Flags Magic Mountain, so I estimate the sighting between there and Sacramento.  I have been fascinated with UFOs since I was 8, the fleeting wish when I blew out my candles was always to spot a UFO.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

At 3:20 pm I purchased ice cream for my daughter at the Glen Echo Caf&eacute; and then after walking around, maybe for 10 minutes we sat at a park bench facing the main building area.  My son was with me as well.I looked up at the sky and saw something that appeared round remaining in the same spot.  It was high above the clouds.  I heard a helicopter near by and also saw a plane.  I looked again to see if it was a helicopter but realized that it was too high for me to hear any sound from it.  I remained seated with my kids but chatted with them taking my eyes off what I had seen.After a few minutes I thought I would take another look and sure enough it was in the same spot.  Not knowing what it was-it did look like an unusual speck-I grabbed my camera and took a picture of the sky where I saw it thinking I just might be able to magnify the picture and see it better later at home.  Three minutes later, I zoomed in and took another picture.  I also did a short video clip with a description of what we were looking at.My children did not see it at first but I brought it to their attention by directing them to look in an area in between and above two red turrets and then to follow up the sky to the last cloud.  They did locate it at that point.  I would have to say we were there for at least 10 minutes and it had remained in the same place.When I got home, I was convinced I got nothing but then when I pulled up the picture, I located the spot in the picture and with interest magnified it.  It turned out to be what looked like a metallic sphere reflecting the sun.I am sending a Google Earth picture of the area showing exactly where we were sitting.  I am also including the clearest snap shot with magnification.  On the original picture with the cloud, you cannot see the spot too easily but once you locate it and magnify it, you can view the sphere.The best way to find it is to look at the cloud, move your eyes to the part on the bottom that resembles the map of Italy.  From there look to the right and once you reach the far right side of the cloud, you will see a tiny dot-don&rsquo;t ask me why I even noticed it on such a bright day.I have no idea what it was-a weather balloon?-but as shown by the pictures I took, it had not moved in the space of three minutes.

The effect did not break up like an atmospheric anomaly.  I am sure that this is what stealth using light would look like.

The UFO also has 2 bright white strobe lights down the middle of the triangle at opposing ends.On Wednesday at about 1am,  August 11,  2010, I was getting out of my truck at work and quickly glanced at an aircraft flying overhead at a low altitude from the south heading toward the north.  At first, I thought that it was a commercial jet, yet as I took a moment to focus my gaze, I realized that there was something unusual about it.   I see commercial jets and helicopters flying over head at times, but I didn&rsquo;t hear any sound from this flying object and that the lights displayed didn&rsquo;t fit the description of a plane or helicopter that I&rsquo;ve seen before.  The UFO travelled at a steady pace similar to a commercial jet until it faded in the distance.  I witnessed this UFO cross overhead from the south heading toward the north for about 10 seconds until it was out of my sight.  I would say that looking north, the UFO was heading north with a slight 10-20 degrees toward the northwest.Other than witnessing the UFO, I did notice a helicopter passing overhead shortly before this sighting.

We were at an intersection Hulmeville and Gibson when we saw a really bright light moving across the sky way in front of us.

It then changed direction again crossing over Hulmeville road.  At this point I still was not convinced until I got away from some of the high trees and saw it had stopped.  It was just sitting in the sky about maybe 800 feet up give or take.  At this point the brighter lights were no longer on just 3 dull lights (white) and one red light which were not blinking.  All the lights though were dull at this point even the red one.Then I rolled my window down and heard nothing.  I could hear cars, people, and one point even crickets but no sounds that something should make just hovering there in the sky.  It then slowly started to turn and the point or tip of the triangle was pointing downward as it rotated.  Then we had to keep moving and it slowly started crossing the houses over school nearby.  The sighting was about 5 minutes but we turned around about 5 extra minutes to get back to that area and we could not see it anywhere.We looked and looked and nothing.

The object rose straight up at least 500 feet from where I first saw it and was not affected by any winds aloft that would usually sway a balloon horizontally.

After about 2 hours of staring at the stars, I finally decided to go back inside my home.  After I walked up to my front door, I opened the storm door and then turned around once more to look into the sky. When I fist noticed it, I wanted to freak out.  There it was an object floating in on a direct path, It didn&apos;t move side to side or volley up and down. It moved as if though it had a mission or purpose. I was nervous, and scared,  So afraid in fact that I could feel my knees buckling. I guess because I didn&apos;t know what to expect and I wanted to act non aggressive. I though that I was either going to be taken, blasted into nothing, or become part of this things menu. So I! wanted whatever or whoever was propelling this thing to know that I am not a threat. As It approached from the North sky,  It floated down into my yard just above the tree in the center of my yard. Then it lowered itself approximately 7 to 10 feet above my head and stopped for approximately 5 to 7 seconds then proceeded forward ascending above my rooftop. As it was leaving I yelled out &quot;What are You.&quot; it never made a sound, not one sound. It was an unusual color.  A low intensity pinkist to violet light, that was almost hypnotic to look at. When I first noticed it all that could be seen was the front. As it came closer I noticed that it&apos;s body was approximately 20 to 30 feet in length. The body looked as if though it was filled with fluid color. It had no wings. the body also had no real width (I mean that it appeared that nothing living could occupy that space). approximately 1 foot in width, but the front was enormous compared to the body 4 to 5 feet in width. There were! windows or slits in the front that were slanted in opposite d! irection s and were also illuminated. As it elevated higher to clear my house and the trees in the back yard its speed never accelerated. I would guess that it&apos;s speed was approximately 10 to 15 miles per hour until it was out of sight. It should also be mentioned that I attempted to get video of all of this, but upon uploading my camera videos to my computer I noticed that I had nothing.

I had just begun an evening of stargazing in rural southern Ohio and was planning to start with sightings of Venus, Saturn, and Mars, which were grouped quite close together just after sunset on 8-7-10.  I noticed the object in question while waiting for Venus to appear after sunset.  In terms of brightness it looked a lot like Venus, but it was way too high in the sky to be that planet, and its brightness was probably closer to that of Jupiter, which was not due to appear until much later in the evening.  I thought perhaps it was a very bright star but did not know what star it might be.To attempt to identify the object, I trained my 6-inch Dobsonian with low magnification on the object.  What I saw was a disc, but not a disc in the sense of a flying saucer type object seen edge-on.  Rather, it was perfectly round and about the size of Jupiter on high magnification.  It appeared to have some markings on it somewhat similar to the light and dark areas seen on Mars when that planet is relatively close to Earth.  It did not appear to be moving at all.As I observed the object, I noticed it had a much smaller object which appeared to be circling it, much as you might see the Galilean moons orbiting Jupiter.  But the circling was not horizontal like a natural satellite --- east-west or west-east --- but rather a vertical polar orbit.  As I watched, the smaller object moved from about the 7:00 o&apos;clock position on the main object up to the very top 12:00 o&apos;clock position.  What was even weirder was that the smaller object appeared to be attached to the main object by a line which was very thin but quite visible.All of this happened very quickly, in a matter of a few seconds, and after this brief observation I was mystified as to what the object might be.  I thought perhaps it might be some exotic satellite of which I was unaware.  I took my eye from the telescope so I could just look at it to see if it was moving across the sky in a straight line at a steady rate with a steady brightness the way satellites do.  But when I looked up it had vanished.  Satellites wink out when they enter the earth&apos;s shadow and are no longer illuminated by the sun.  But as far as I could tell this object was not moving at all.  Had it been moving I would have almost certainly noticed some movement of the main object when I was looking at it through the telescope, since magnification also magnifies the perceived motion of an object across the sky. I have never seen anything like this and I am at a loss as to what this object might have been.  I was sober with my faculties intact when I observed it. {:&gt;) If anyone has seen something similar or knows what it may have been I would be interested in some feedback.", "oval sphere hovering at 500 feet over my truck pulled my pistolapprox. 14:00 HRs I was gonna go fishing with my newphew at holley beach in laguna Vista tx.

I was 23, male, American; others were early 20&apos;s Scottish and Canadian, both male.  Other witnesses had been smoking hash, I was completely sober.  We were on the roof of the hotel watching a meteor shower.  There was a (wedding?) party a few blocks away from us with big flood lights that were periodically blowing out all the lights in our section of the town, and there were few street lights.  While I/we were looking up, the object flew directly over us, and I watched it travel from almost directly over us where I first noticed it to the horizon. With no reference objects in the sky I can only guess at the size and speed.  If I held my hand above me at arm&apos;s length my thumbnail would have almost covered it. It took 5-6 seconds to travel about 60 degrees across my field of vision.  It seemed much lower than the stars, and I could clearly see the edges, so my guess is it was between the size of a single prop plane and an airliner, flying at about 10,000 feet (higher than a prop plane but much lower than an airliner).  The shape was perfectly geometric: draw a circle, cut it in half, then remove two half circles with the &quot;corners&quot; touching from the straight line where the original cut was made and that would be the exact shape.  The result if you were drawing it should be something like a rounded boomarang with a point comming out of the back.  It made no noise at all, and had no running lights.  It appeared to have a dull orange glow; the closest thing I can compare the color/glow to is the coil of an electric stove when the coil is just starting to heat up.  I cannot say if the glow was coming from the object or was a reflection from the lights from the party.  In any case, it was not very bright and since it made no noise, I do not think I would have seen it if I had not already been looking up.

The objects were triangular in shape, vertical with the apex pointing straight up. Inside the triangles were undulating white, green and red lights that morphed around inside the triangles like colored bubbles inside a lava lamp.  Each triangle was about the size of a dime at arm&rsquo;s length.Initially the triangles passed from the south toward the north in a somewhat horizontal path and stopped due east about 45 degrees above the horizon.  At the same time I saw an airplane pass in front of the triangles and then I saw a satellite pass over them. They were bigger than the jet airliner so they must have been at least 100 feet on a side. The objects were distinctly different from either the airliner or the satellite. The objects were about as high as the plane and beyond it a ways. Once the triangles stopped, they slowly moved around in the sky, up, down and sideways with no particular pattern to their movements.  At times they hovered nearly still in their positions and then they would resume their dance.  The objects were never touching and did not remain adjacent to one another.

I was looking out the window in a north east direction and contemplating taking my telescope out to view the night sky as the moon was very bright in the eastern sky low above the trees. I was looking at the constellation Cassiopeia when there was a bright star that began to descend from the constellation. As it descend it got brighter and very large then began to move in a north eastern direction rapidly.  The total experience was less than 1 minute.Background: I often lay on my couch watching television and look out a 6&rsquo;wide by 10&rsquo; high sliding glass patio doorway.  When looking out the sliding glass doors I am facing in a north eastern direction.  My wife and I live somewhat near the O&rsquo;Hare Airport and are in the direct line of incoming and outgoing air traffic.  So, I am very familiar with aircraft and their appearance both in daylight and dark night skies.  I have seen aircraft flying low and high and feel I can tell the difference between aircraft and what I saw on 8/26/2010 at 9:03pm.9:03pm 8/26/2010: I had spent the evening noticing how the sky was clear and how the moon was very bright and low in the eastern sky. At approximately 8:50pm CST I noticed a bright star below the moon and wondered if it was a planet.  I took a walk back into a spare room where I keep my 10&rdquo; Orion Dobsonian Telescope. But as it was going to be too much trouble to take it out of the storage closet I decided against it.  I walked back to the living room and lay upon the couch and was looking at the constellation Cassiopeia and noticed that from out of view above the sliding glass door a star was getting brighter and looked as though it was descending directly from the constellation. Over the next few second the star got very large, bright white and began to slow its descent. At this point I called for my wife in our bedroom reading a book to please look out the window, as the bedroom window are on the same north eastern facing wall.  She said she could not see a thing, as I assumed she had alrea! dy closed the drapes as she always does. As this conversation was happening the object had gotten very large and stopped descending. It was at a magnitude I have never witnessed before.  My wife did come out of the room and asked what I wanted her to see, as my request was unusual and I was shocked at what was happening and I think she could hear that in my voice.  I continued to observe the object and it got suddenly got very bright and moved in a north easterly direction rapidly.   When she joined me at the sliding glass door, I pointed out the object and she said &ldquo;you mean that star&rdquo;.  When my wife said &ldquo;you mean that star&rdquo;, the object had already become about an 15th of its largest size and had moved out and away from us. It moved rapidly and then disappeared into the sky in that same direction.  She said it probably was plane, but she had not witnessed the full event.Conclusion: In the two years I have been living here and observing the night sky and passage of commercial planes I have never witnessed anything like this before.  The object I saw was round and moved like nothing I had ever seen before.  It descended rapidly from what appeared to be a small star to a large round object. It hovered for a second before rapidly moving out of sight.  There were no blinking lights on the object like on the commercial craft that fly overhead constantly.  And as this was a clear night I am an amateur astronomer I cannot identify what it was that I witnessed. My only conclusion would be to say that this was an UFO.", "I went outside with a coffee. I took a drink of coffee, lit a smoke, then looked directly overhead. it was exactly 8:52 pm the sun was behind the garage to the west and I saw between the branches of the trees above me what looked like a star, &quot;which never moved&quot;, to early for a star I thought?  I grabbed my camera CANON REBEL EOS T2i with the Canon 28-135 Ultrasonic EF, I.S. lens and ripped a few shots, then zoomed into the shot on the camera panel to see if it was a star, I saw a definite sphere, I aimed the camera and shot some more, I then decided to get my tripod and 400mm Tamron crap lens. Into the house I run, unravelling the video camera from the tripod, grabbing the 400mm then extending the tripods legs with the object still in the sky, I aimed on auto focus, it locked, so I snapped away. The object then went dim and the auto focus wouldn&rsquo;t take so I switched to manual and focussed and focussed I could barely see the object through the camera when the Probe lit up and I shot again seeing it split into a few pieces, I was so pumped with my heart pounding and I could barely operate the camera.  The object then went dim and I lost it all in the camera and in visual. Just then A freand came in the driveway, I told them I was taking photos of birds.  Later I told freand, and showed her the photos.  Looking at the photos in the computer with the Canon Photo software I noticed there where five shots that were black instead of blue but the object was still visible in the photos, the most interesting thing was near the ending there seemed to be a puff of smoke in a Saturn like ring around a center object then two sets or 4 more spheres come out, here&rsquo;s the 28 pics I took.  The photos are from Raw images, roughly 20 MB, I enhanced and enlarged them for detail.((NUFORC Note:  Source elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

There were three of us in a car heading west on Saginaw Hwy. Person 1 is sitting in the passenger seat, person 2 is driving, and person 3 is sitting in the middle back seat. It was around 8:40PM, the Sun  was just under the horizon almost centered with the road no stars were visible yet. Person 1 noticed a light that was approx. 60-80 degrees vertical, and 100-120 degrees horizontal (90 degrees being centered with the road) which was really high in the sky and could be easily confused as a Star/Planet. At first it was thought to be Mars because of the reddish orange tint. Person 1 announced that there was a light in the sky when he noticed it was to close to be a star/planet, the other two started looking for it. Person 2 located the light, then the two noticed that the light was moving slowly flying in different directions at will and slowing down and resuming speed.  They also witnessed it dim ! until not visible, then fade back in, then faded back out.  Person 3 noticed the light fade back in while simultaneously the other two noticed another light higher and brighter than the original and getting brighter, thinking it was the original. At this point the three thought they were looking at the same light, person 1 and 2 kept saying, &ldquo; It&rsquo;s getting brighter!&rdquo;  Person 3 noticed that he was looking at a different light because the one he was looking at was getting dimmer then disappeared then reappeared then he noticed they were looking higher up in the sky and had to lean forward to see the other light which was really bright. Then person 3 yelled, &ldquo;oh! There&rsquo;s two of them!&rdquo; Person 1 noticed the original light, it took person 2 a little longer to find it because he was driving. We watched the lights move around, and vary in brightness then the brighter 2nd light started to head south, the other light soon followed they accelerated way  faster than we had seen them trav! el previously, and as they flew they faded out. The 1st dimmer! light w as out of sight first. We were unsure if the lights were produced from inside or reflections of the sun. This all happened within a few minutes.

We had planned to take a short trip across town to visit my mother that evening, and our only vehicle at the time was his motorcycle. As we mounted the bike in the driveway we looked up and in the distance saw three blinding white lights. They weren&apos;t far from the ground; two below and one above in a tight triangle configuration. My fiance was in the Air Force at the time and worked at Wright Paterson on the weekends. &quot;What the Hell is that?&quot; he wondered aloud. &quot;It&apos;s probably just highbeams on a crane&quot; I suggested. We would know soon enough since we had to head in that direction. We drove for about a mile, all the while my ex was saying &quot;What the Hell is that??&quot; Eventually we came close enough to be able to tell that it was too high up to be lights attached to a crane, but they were dead still. Suddenly we noticed that a large rectangular space behind the lights was far darker than the sky around it. My ex yelled &quot;WHAT THE FUCK IS IT??!  Then slammed on his brakes as about six African American kids ranging in age from about ten to sixteen dashed in front of our bike. Their eyes were also fixed on the monstrous craft. And it was bloody huge. Not &quot;Independence day&quot; huge-but easily as large as a football field or larger. It was gunmetal gray; like a giant monolithic slab  about the proportions of a thick cereal box or box of cigarettes with slightly raised and depressed geometric shapes of various sizes on it&apos;s surface (it was not smooth at all). It hovered over a large empty parking lot that stretched out in front of an abandoned Rink&apos;s department stor! e. The road we were on was busy, but I didn&apos;t notice if others had stopped to look. The craft had the three painfully bright lights mounted on what looked like it&apos;s front. There were smaller amber/ red and bluish green lights underneath it that glowed steadily, and as we kept driving we came around to the &quot;back&quot; of the craft, which featured three (maybe four) flat, glowing rectangular panels in a horizontal row that were tilted slightly downward. They looked like large observation windows to me, and I felt-or perhaps even saw-figures moving around inside. I didn&rsquo;t want to see anymore and looked down. My former fiance finally said &quot;We have to get closer!&quot; and I completely flipped out -and I&apos;m not one who is given to &quot;flipping out&quot;. He turned the bike toward the craft and I hit him hard and told him that there was no way in hell that he would take me any closer. I was in tears I was so frightened. Just as this was happening the group of boys that had crossed in front of us co! uld be seen running across the expanse of the parking lot towa! rd the a rea under the craft. As they neared it I glanced down for a second time, not wanting to see what was happening,  and as I did I heard my ex exclaim &quot;Holy Fuck!!&quot; I looked and the kids were standing there, but the craft had disappeared. Ken said that it had shot straight up into the sky at a speed that was simply unbelievable. I begged him to keep driving and we continued on.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although source of report does not indicate that fact.

My sister went outside for a smoke and immediately shouted for us to come outside to see something. From my balcony over looking the whole of Cape Town city bowl, we saw a light. It started the size of a star and as it came closer it got bigger.At first we thought it was a meteor because of its speed and the size it was becoming. It was soon as big as a full moon, but a burning orange. It seemed to hover for about 30 seconds then hovered to the right and it got smaller. It then did 3 big flashes, as though it was turning it&apos;s lights off, then all you could see was a black shadow with tiny orange lights.  It was only my one friend and I who could see this, as the other two wear contacts and their vision isn&apos;t very good.It started to descend relatively fast.  Just as it reached the glow from the city lights it went completely black and dropped fast. It appeared to have landed in the ocean.  The whole experience lasted between 5 and 10 minutes, and it was around 21:45.Also on radio 5FM, a local radio station, two days after our experience, my 1one friend was listening in her car, and said a man phoned in from Pretoria and had the exact same story as ours except that his just disappeared.", "Seemingly Motionless craft near Memphis, TN.The Object that was observed was seen in the Western sky at a high altitude near Memphis, Tennessee.  I had just finished mowing the lawn and was sitting on the back porch having a phone conversation with my Dad.  It was quite bright and seemed to appear out of thin air.  That portion of the sky was visible to me the entire time I was on the phone and the object was noticeable as soon as it appeared.  The object seemed to stay in place, relatively motionless for the entire length of the sighting.  Being unsure of what the object was I had my fifteen year old son come outside and take a look.  He verified that the object seemed to be hovering in the same spot.  At that time I called a friend who was working approximately 6 miles from my location.  He proceeded outside and spotted the object from his location.  At that time I went inside the house to get a pair of binoculars to try and get a better view.  Being unable to locate my binoculars I utilized the clo! sest thing I had, which was a 12 power rifle scope (unattached from the firearm).  With the aid of the scope I could make out what appeared to be faint red lights around the circumference of the object.

As I continued to investigate, it slowly -- and at a deliberate and even pace - traversed east across the moon.I got the sense I was witnessing something quite unique and even though it sounds mundane as I type this, it was truly awesome as it stretched as far north and south as the eye could see.  It was geometrically perfect, narrowing at both ends.  If I had to guess at what it might be, I could only say that I believe it was a deliberate mass of something that had a specific purpose.As it arrived close to the moon and was about to cross it, I could determine it was approximately twice as wide as the moon, and as it traveled east and away from the moon, it got dimmer until I could no longer make out the outline.NOTE: I am a frequent sky watcher, C2C listener and have observed (and filmed) many unexplained phenomena and I have never seen anything like this before.", "5-6 lights scattered on the horizon, helicopter in the vicinityAll 4 of us saw 5 or 6 incandescent lights on the horizon scattered in a squiggly line up from the horizon.

It was impossible to tell how many UFO&rsquo;s there were because it appeared as if each UFO&rsquo;s was in two places at once.  It could have been two really large crafts or two sets of two or three crafts blinking in patterns, constantly blinking back and forth, they two &lsquo;sets&rsquo; of lights were moving at a slow speed, one due east and the other due north.  The lights seemed to be like some sort of strobe light effect.  Occasionally a bright red light would appear in between the two objects as they moved apart.   There were other planes in the sky during the forty-five minutes that they flew.  None of the other objects blinking lights were as intense as these and none of the air planes zig-zagged back and forth and up and down as these did.

From the West end of Madison, where it intersects with DT, the light was slightly north west, appearing just above the tree line.  I have observed that there is a cell tower in that vicinity, however the light that I saw appeared to be acting more similarly to the light of a lighthouse than the on/off blink of these towers.  The light changed from a large red to a smaller, dimmer yellowish amber - similar to that of stars.  And then it appeared to fly off.   At first I suspected a helicopter, however I could hear no sound and the rate of travel was inconsistent with my expectations, thus this posting.I have noticed something similar this evening, appearing this time in the south west sky and appearing to be much further away than what I observed last night.   Again, the red/yellow &apos;blinking&apos; and unexpected movement.Perhaps this is merely light from stars that flew around like firecrackers at the end of their lives thousands of years ago and the light is just reaching us now.", "At about 11:30 pm , I was sitting in my chair on the deck outside relaxing and watching the sky .

Lauderdale international airport.  On a clear night if I look west I can see an aircraft approaching maybe out 30 miles or more.  As the aircraft proceeds to land I can see it all the way until about it reaches the airport approximately 15 miles east.  On ordinary nights I see several dozen planes go through.  I&apos;ve lived at this location for the last 10 years and I know the types of lights airplanes have.  Typically they have bright almost white lights for landing, and typically a blue, read or white flashing lights.   On this August night, it was about 830 PM and I just got home from work.  I live near I-75 and the Griffen Road exit in Broward county FL.  The conditions were partly cloudy with a very distant thunderstorm South East of my location approximately 25 or more miles in the area of North Miami Beach.

The were flying at what appeared to be low speeds and in the midst of low level clouds.   The lights appeared to be bigger than what you would expect from lights shinning on an airplane at that distance.  They flew for maybe 1 minute heading west and then turned together toward the south. The light was directional for one of the objects and was not for the other.  In other words, as one of the objects turned south, its light turned with it.  The other object seemed to turn the light after it had turned south. They repeated the same flyby another 3 times.  The lights seemed to dim and then brighten as they flew by.  When the lights turned south there were no flashing strobe lights to indicate it was an airplane. My parents witnessed the lights from their car just south of my location less than a quarter mile away. I confirmed they saw and object with orange redish lights and they thought it was an airplane at first! , but my dad noticed there were no recognizable lights that a ! typical airplane would carry.

The sky was clear, with a full moon illuminating the sky considerably.While looking at the moon we witnessed a very bright, solid white, orb-like object float into our field of view.  We don&rsquo;t know where it originated from as it seemed to have simply appeared.As we watched the light, we witnessed it accelerate fluidly and slow down just the same.  The object was able to make left, right, up, and down movements while changing altitudes quickly.  This object was totally silent, and it traversed the length of our house, but must have been at least a couple of miles away.  The light then moved behind the trees just behind our house.  Yet, being as bright as it was, we were still able to maintain visual contact and track its movement.  We were at this point standing on my neighbor&rsquo;s porch, my girlfriend on my right, when the object vanished.  Simultaneously, a shooting white light shot off into space faster than lightening.  The light trail was almost imperceptible to the eye, and it&rsquo;s duration a fraction of a second.  Almost like a reverse shooting star.At this point, we were stunned because we knew it was like nothing we had ever seen.  As we sat and discussed the object/light, we continued watching the sky. It couldn&rsquo;t have been mo re than 5 or ten minutes since the other object vanished when we began to see multiple high-altitude aircraft flying towards the area where the object had been.  These aircraft made no sound, and had blue and red quick flashing/blinking lights.  These lights flashed quickly and they appeared to be set in a rectangular shape or pattern.  One after another, these aircraft continued to appear at what looked like the same altitude and speed; the latter being hard to estimate.  At one point, it appeared these craft were assuming a triangular formation or were flying in a formation directly above where we witnessed the first object.I estimate seeing at least 10 of these aircraft, and I do not believe these were commercial aircraft.  I think it&rsquo;s possible they were military in nature, and that they also may have been circling the area.  These aircraft eventually disappeared, maintaining the same direction, speed, and altitude.", "Bright light moving slowly with what appears to be aircrafts around itAt about 21:15 I went out to have a cigarette and noticed a bright light in the sky to the east at this time I believe it was a star but after sitting and looking it appeared to be moving really slow.

After review of the video, they were indeed moving slowly, noticed by a point of reference in the video.I thought possibly it was a bright star or planet (even though I have never seen a star or planet this bright), so I rushed home to grab my camera and tripod.  I was going to attempt to do a long exposure photograph that would capture the star trails as the earth spun to see if these lights were of the same pattern.  As I went back out to the vicinity of the lights, I noticed they were much farther away.  They were moving in a west / south-west direction.

The best I can describe the shape is like a thin slice of black, I may have been to far away to get the full definition of the craft. But it hung in the same spot for at least 5-8 minutes, had me staring the entire time till it started moving slowly towards Las Vegas strip and disappeared behind the mountain range.

The objects themselves were in motion as they maintained the line formation, and they appeared to move in front of each other and around each other.  Formation then changed shape from a line to a V.  Objects appeared to be the same size as the stars and appeared to be at a high altitude based on my observations.A closed fist at arm&rsquo;s length when the formation/cluster was directly above me covered about 1/10th of the formation.  The cluster of objects was very large across the sky.  No other witnesses were present at time of sighting, and objects made no noise whatsoever as they went overhead from west to east.  Objects then changed shape into a V formation, and then disappeared from view to the east after about ten seconds.  Speed of objects was very fast, covering the sky and off to the east in seconds.  Speed of the objects was constant the whole time.  It was almost hard to follow them because of the speed.  I have been an amateur meteorologist for about 15 years and I watch the sky daily and observe weather conditions and aircraft all the time from my residence.

The lights came in formation from the east starting as 1 bright light at approximately 700-800ft followed by 4 bright lights, followed by 3 bright lights, then followed by 4 bright lights,then 3 bright lights, and then lastly by 1 bright light. This formation passed directly overhead and as i! t passed directly overhead the lights went out in intensity like a candle would go out, until the lights disappeared. There were no flashing lights, or red or green navigation lights observed. The most astounding thing when this formation passed was there was absolutely no sound coming from these lights and no &ldquo;craft&rdquo; or visible shape was observed other than large white round lights. As the formation of 4 lights and 3 lights passed their intensity decreased at the same time and disappeared at the same time. The lights were all in a wing formation with the 4 lights being wider than 3 747&rsquo;s flying wingtip to wingtip at 700-800ft. I was so moved by witnessing this event that I called many of my friends and family members to share our experience. It took approximately 3-5 mins for these lights to pass from beginning to end, the weather was clear with no wind.", "Orange Flaming Orbs fall from the sky over Lake Erie, August, 2007The Event occurred during a late summer rain storm. Although the rain was not heavy, the dark cloud over Lake Erie was distinct. The phenomena observed began as a casual observance of a single speck of light. We observed what appeared from the shoreline as a light perhaps a mile or two offshore. The only way we could observe this occurence was with an average powered pair of field binoculars. At first looking through the binoculars it appeared as if it might be a small boat, but closer examination revealed that this was something &quot;on fire&quot;. I quickly alerted my companion to look into the binoculars to get his opinion. He also saw this ball of flame. What happened after this first encounter was quite startling. Let me say that I have never had a close encounter and am suspect of anything currently being written about the UFO phenomenology. However the unfolding events of that night have not only startled me, but have stayed with me for the last three years. O! nly today was I able to define my observances based on other eye-witnesses who had similar sightings. They have described what they similarly saw as &quot;orange flaming orbs&quot;. Other descriptions were ascribed to them, but in my case the &quot;orange flaming orbs&quot; fits the description perfectly. I thought that one orb appearance was enough, but what makes this an even more intriguing mystery is that after this first orb disappeared beyond the Lake Erie&apos;s horizon line, another one began to fall from the low hanging dark storm cloud.I have read other accounts and descriptions of &quot;ascending lights&quot; and fast lateral moving lights but these were not like that at all. We watched as consecutive flaming orbs fell very slowly from the sky and eventually into the water. What is also amazing is how each was orchestrated in its falling velocity (extremely slow-- slower than a parachutist, so we knew this wasn&apos;t a nighttime military mission) and also that the intensity of the light stayed consistent-- from the time it appeared coming out of the dark cloud until it hit the water&apos;s horizon line. I should note that there were no sounds being emitted and no sounds of jets, airplane or helicopter engines were heard. The fact that it was a drizzling rain (with no lightning, I might add) made it impossible for this to be man-made-- such as what I thought it might be: a summer &quot;art performance&quot; by some of the local artists. No one in their right mind would want to be out in this weather on the vastness of Lake Erie. No ot! her lights appeared-- suche as boats or planes. The house we observed all of this from is remote from the city so no street, traffic or building lights could have interfered.As much as I am recreating this story, we unfortunately had no access to good night time cameras or videos, but I would testified unequivocally that this was a phenomena that deserved a full and further investigation. To continue with the observation, we stood on the back porch with a full panoramic view to the west toward Cleveland and to the east toward Buffalo. We were facing north toward Canada when these lights were observed. In the same fashion as described earlier, we observed at least 16 of these same flaming orbs extremely slowly fall from the sky and into the waters. As each one disappeared the next one began to come out from the underside of the cloud. This event went on for at least one hour. There were more that continued to fall and perhaps a whole string of them from our line of sight and down toward Buffalo, but I actually felt frightened (amazed and excited as well) and wanted to report this occurance to the Lawrence Park police, but being a skeptic and resp! ectful of this tiny suburb and being late at night I hesitated to call anyone to bring undo attention to the neighborhood. I looked in the Erie Times News the next day to see if there was a story about this light phenomena, but did not find anything, nor was there anything on the television. This event has stayed with me since 2007. It is only today that I found your reporting website and also found better descriptors based on other observances.", "We saw an object round in  shape appear in the south west sky that traveled north east and appeared to be flying lower in the sky than most airplanes travel at.We then saw an airplane that had blinking lights cross paths with the object except the airplane looked to be 2 to 3 times as high up in the air. The airplane was traveling North to South. When we looked at the object with binoculars it apperaed to be a bright white circular spaped object but there were no red or blue flashing lights on it.

Moments later a commercial aircraft on the normal flight path into Glasgow Airport (Scotland) passed overhead.

Minutes later a light appeared , again going in a south to north direction.  Once again the light passed to my left (northwards) the light dimmed then disappeared.I waited for about five minutes, searching the sky from horizon to horizon and suddenly I saw two orange lights, one following the other some distance apart but both going in the same direction high in the sky, south to north (right to left from my viewpoint), again as they reached the left of me (north) the lights faded then dimmed to nothing.This fading convinces me that the light was shining at the front of the object and I could see no light from the rear of any of them.These lights made no noise I was aware of and the weather conditions were clear in a bright sky with no wind.I have no idea what I saw but I&rsquo;m convinced these were not these floating Chinese lanterns I&rsquo;ve read about recently, nor were they any recognisable aircraft.Help!!((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was in the middle of a field and it faced towards the interstate and it took off going from 0 miles per hour to what looked like a super sonic speed.", "Silver disk flew over my backyard, directly overhead, low and slow.On the afternoon of August 6, 2010, I was on a lounge chair in my backyard on the north side of the swimming pool. It was 2:40 pm on a sunny day with a mostly blue sky dotted with a few puffy clouds.  I was facing east and was in the shade cast by the tall bamboo behind me.  Although there was no change in the light, I had a random thought that dark thunderclouds might be coming in from the west and looked up at the sky.  A few seconds later I saw a silver disk travelling from west to east, in a straight line over my pool almost directly overhead.At first glance I thought it was some kid&apos;s silver balloon that got loose but quickly realized it was no floppy, tinfoil balloon, but some kind of solid, firm-surfaced metal. I focused in on it so I could remember as much detail as possible. It was shaped like a disk but also had a squashed circle/egg type shape. The top and bottom were rounded and the sides were slightly rounded, like the shape of a Mento candy. There were no hard edges or seams, no puckers or variations of color or texture in the surface. It was totally smooth and reflective, the bottom of it turning darker as it passed over the green trees at the eastern end of the yard. I&apos;m estimating that it was about 30 feet above the fully mature maple trees, so maybe 60 feet above ground. I got the impression that it might be 3 to 4 feet in diameter. Although it was breezy at the treetops, the disk moved in a straight line, with no side to side wavering or drifting from the wind, and no change in altitude. There! was absolutely no sound emitting from it.After the disk had been in my sight for about 5 seconds I had the presence of mind to call out, &quot;Look up!&quot; to my husband, who was doing some yard work about 20 feet behind me and to the right. Since he was to the right of the edge of the bamboo stand he had a clear view of the disk and looked up in time to see it just as it was going over the trees. His description of the disk corroborated mine. From the time I saw the disk to the time it travelled out of sight was about 8 to 10 seconds and I estimate that the distance it travelled in that time was about 50 to 60 feet. Using these estimates, the disk was travelling at about 3 to 5 miles per hour. Unfortunately there was no time to take a picture, even with my cell phone.I am recently retired but was a government employee for 33 years and my husband works for a major airline. Our eyesight is fine and neither of us requires eyeglasses or contacts for driving. Immediately following this sighting I felt satisfied to have finally seen something concrete and real because it left no doubt that these objects do exist. Then I started wondering whether the fact that they do exist was a good thing or not. Knowing that there is technology far advanced than that held by us here on Earth is a bit unsettling. From our own history we know what usually happens when a technologically advanced civilization meets a less advanced society. I can only hope that whoever is controlling these objects has a less aggressive nature than us humans.  I am not overly worried about it, though, because I feel that if they meant to do us harm, they would have by now.  Perhaps they are just documenting our own self-destruction, via the proliferation of nuclear weapons, p! ollution, greenhouse gases, over population, genocide, chemical farming, antibiotics, destruction of the rainforests, and over fishing?  Maybe we are their version of watching a demolition derby; dirty, ugly and violent, but oh so entertaining!  We told friends about the sighting but, of course, most of them just laughed it off and asked how much we had been drinking at the time (which, by the way, was not at all). We humans do laugh when we are nervous about something, and we don&apos;t want to hear about something that makes us uncomfortable. And the quickest way to shut someone up is to ridicule them. So our friends reactions are normal, but we know what we saw. I don&apos;t think our government could keep such technology a secret. Even if they could, if we had it, we wouldn&apos;t be fighting wars to get oil because we would have a better propulsion system already. So what we saw was an Object, that was Flying and is Unidentified...a UFO.", "Took  picture of a large circular/disc with a black haze around it while it hovered over Regensburg, Ge on 25 July 08.The pictures that I took were in Regensburg, Germany, 25 July 2008.  I was taking pictures of the St. Peter&apos;s Cathedral steeples in downtown Regensburg.  I took the pictures with a Kodak Digital Camera (360).  I did not know or notice the object at the time I took the pictures. This is another explation.I did notice the object when I downloaded the pictures while in Germany.  It was only a few days ago (5 Aug 10) that a co-worker and myself were browsing pictures of Germany from 2008.  We looked at this picture and magnified it to 800x to get a better look at it.  It is our belief that the object is not an airplane, helicopter or any type of aviation device known to humans.  There are no wings, tail, nose or rotary blades.  There is a black haze/mist around the object.  We also noticed that the object had an indention close to the top of the object that might appear to be windows or some type of design that&apos;s indented on the object.  The indentation goes aroun! d the object also.  I have two pictures that were taken back to back.  One of the pictures does not have the object in it.  The pictures were taken about 1 to 2 seconds apart.  I wish that I had noticed and investigated this back in 2008.  I have never seen anything like this before.  I was also of sound mind when taking the pictures.  I did not hear anything while taking the pictures.  I was looking at a direction of South/Southeast (approximately 2700 - 2800 mills).  When taking the two pictures, there were trees in the background, a river in front of me (Danube River) two church steeples and a walking path below me.

I was walking east towards the ocean, and was passing the firehouse when several people out front had already noticed the lights and were discussing what they could be.This is not the first time I have seen these lights.

Hi I&apos;m a homeowner / observer from  .... yep, Gulf Breeze FL .  I have a report on a recent sighting that should match up with other reports in the area.  I&apos;m confident at least 50-100 people would have seen the same thing, to include my neighbor as a witness.Taking out the trash at approx 5:40pm Jan 13, 2010..  looking north from &quot;midway&quot; towards Escambia Bay, I saw a bright white/orange-tinted ( about -6 magnitude brightness ) spherical light-form traveling East from Garson Point Bridge towards Eglin AFB&apos;s West boundary at a rate of approx 500knts.  As it approached the middle of the bay, about 3-4 seconds since I noticed the object, it made a downward 180 degree turn at the same rate of speed.  I dropped the garbage bag in the driveway, and knew that what I was seeing was not anything in our publicly known aviation inventory. My view was obscured from about 15 degrees from the horizon to the top of the tree line to my North. The object would dive below and above the trees moving in a very similar pattern as a dragonfly. After approx. 2 minutes of viewing I was able to signal my neighbor to be a witness.. after about a minute or two the object shot skyward from it&apos;s last position below the tree line as if it were staying in ! a particular piece of airspace in the middle of the bay, approx 1/2 mile wide and below 4000ft.  I should also mention there was a thin cloud layer around 5000ft which helped me judge the distance and scale of the light sphere.  At times the object would traverse and incredible speeds, well in excess of mach2-3 without breaking the sound barrier and without making any audible sound from approx 1mi away.  Traffic from Hwy98 was audible as well as several single engine recreational aircraft off in the distance, west and south of the activity, approx 8-15 miles. The last maneuver the object made was from west to east it climbed to approx 4000ft, turned north, &ldquo;zig-zagged&rdquo; in an S pattern and vanished after the 3rd &ldquo;zag&rdquo;, not to be seen again.Shortly after a single rotor helicopter came on site ( pursuit ) from west to east along the original path of the sphere, and turned north toward Whiting Field NAS.  No other aircraft approached the area except for a commercial flight leaving PNS traveling North-East, which tells me the airspace was not locked down.  I was under the impression that this object wanted to show-off and be seen.  Also another observation was 3 satellites at 90 degrees elevation, magnitude about +4, intersecting directly above shortly after the sighting.I&apos;m still in awe over this observation.

This happened on the outskirts of Lowell, in one of the more suburban areas along Andover St.At approximately 9:30 PM I went outside to take the trash out.  It was raining pretty hard and I remember it being exceptionally dark that night.  I walked out the front door with the bag of trash and around the back of our house.  As I turned the corner from the side of the house to the back, I saw a huge, round, red light hovering in the sky almost directly above me.

The light was deep red, like a stop light, and in the 20 seconds I watched it, it didn&rsquo;t flicker, fade, or pulse.  It was solid.  I remember thinking how strange it was that it was just glowing with no portion of the circle being any brighter than another and had no different characteristics - just one massive, solid, glowing orb in the sky.At some point, I looked away to drop the trash into the barrel I&rsquo;d been standing next to, and when I looked back, the orb was gone.

For the time that we observed it, it moved several times. The impression was that it was demonstrating an interest in the fire works, and we discussed the possibility of it being a helicopter or balloon/dirigible observing the firework display.  My son pointed out that the lighting was not correct for either.  Upon conclusion of the firework display, the object traveled quite fast to the east where we lost sight of it.

He had just arrived home and noticed a metallic cigar shape flying above the treeline.  The camera battery was dead but I got our dog and ran down anyway. By the time I got to the parking lot, the object had flown out of sight behind some hills.  We got in the car to drive a bit in the general direction it went and see if we could spot it again, but we couldn&apos;t see due to all the hills in the area.  About five minutes later, we headed to our apartment building.  We went to let the dog use the bathroom and that was when I spotted the object, headed back in the same direction it came from.  It looked like a jet with no wings, and it made no sound. I could not see any markings.  It appeared to be rolling like a barrel as it made its way through the sky.  My boyfriend estimated it to be at 1,000 ft. altitude.  He also saw an antenna on the craft which I did not notice.  We watched it for about a minute until it flew out of sight.

They were absolutely silent and moved slightly sporadically.  The disks were spinning, but not on a perfect axis.  They were not in sync, but they stayed relatively close to one another for the approximate two minutes in which I observed them. It seemed as though they were moving closer and they flew higher extremely fast.   From my perspective, it seemed as if they flew straight up into the sky. I was able to keep an eye on the objects the whole time until I had to travel below an overpass and I lost sight of the objects, which were very far away the last time I had my eye on them. I was a passenger in a car with two other people, who both observed the objects.  Traffic notably slowed down on the exit ramp, as I assume that other drivers noticed them as well. When the car I was in parked at the mall, I got out and saw an unmarked plane, and I am! not sure if it had any relation to the UFO sighting I had witnessed minutes before.   The sighting did not have any physical effects on me or on any of the other passengers in the car that I was traveling in.

Though I thought this was unusual, we dismissed it and looked elsewhere in the sky for signs of the meteors.  When I returned my attention to the star, I found that it had moved Westward and toward the horizon significantly.  We then watched its motions for several minutes, noting first to ourselves and then aloud that the object was swinging strangely from side to side.  This seemed curious especially due to its apparent distance from us.  If the presumed object seemed to us the size of a very bright star and it was performing such wide swinging motions and there was only a slight breeze that night, I assumed this might not be a conventional aircraft or an object being manipulated by air currents.Thinking the rapid movements of our eyes may have caused this pattern of movement, I scanned the sky for a star and attempted to produce the same affects but could not.

I&rsquo;m not sure  what area of the country we were flying over at the time, but my daughter observed some bright lights below, outside the plane window.She was 10, an elementary student, at the time, sitting on the right side of the plane (if facing the front), and I was 35, a police officer, sitting on the aisle.  My boyfriend, who was in the Navy over 30 yrs, and a fire fighter for over 30 yrs, looked out the window and also saw these lights.  I leaned over her to look out the window and I too saw these bright lights below at ground level.

The night sky was clear and the moon was out.  At first we thought they may be a bunch of transformers blowing up below, but there is no way that many would do that, and if they did, there wouldn&rsquo;t be any other lights on in the little cities/towns we were flying over.  Then I thought maybe we&rsquo;re flying over a bunch of little ponds and lakes, and it was the reflection of the moon on the water.  But then we&rsquo;d pass a highway or a large lake, and you would see the lights all the way up to the highway or lake and then they would jump over to the other side, fast.   And the reflection of the moon on the water was distinctly different.  These lights wouldn&rsquo;t flash over the water or highways.  When we would pass over a tree/wooded area, we could see these bright lights light up the trees.  If we passed over neighborhoods with street lights, you could see these bright lights light up th! e immediate areas where they were.Then we asked some other passengers to look, they saw what we saw.  We even had a retired air force pilot look.  He said he&rsquo;s seen some strange things in his air time, but nothing like that.  No one seemed concerned, but we all kept watching.This phenomenon occurred for about 30 minutes, that we had timed it, then just stopped.  Who knows when it started.

But then I noticed it wasn&apos;t really moving. It was hard to determine if it was in our atmosphere or in space.  Then I began to think perhaps it was a very bright star or planet, but it just seemed too big for that and the red hue didn&apos;t make sense.  I couldn&apos;t really determine what it might be. I called to my wife and a visting friend who witnessed it as well. Star, plant, plane; they came to the same conclusion as me.  I called a neighbor and he and his family witnessed it as well. They had a pair of binoculars and ! indicated that it was round with a red hue.  They could not determine if it was in our atmosphere or not.  We watched it for about 15-20 minutes, and then it made an apparent wobble to the left and the white light disappeared.  You could then see a faint red twinkling hue in it&apos;s place.  At one point, about 3-4 min. following the bright light&apos;s disappearance, there was another flash or shimmer resembling the largewhite light that lasted about 2 seconds.  I watched the red twinkling hue for another 5-10 minutes before clouds moved in and obscured my view completely.  I live in North Asheville, and called a friend in South Asheville to see if he had noticed the light.  He, in fact, had noticed it while driving home, and had thought it to be an oddly large, bright planet.  He suggested that perhaps it was a large meteor.  I called the local paper shortly after to see if anyone else had reported it, but no one had at that time.", "Large Orb Above White Tank Mountain RangeI was standing on my back patio which faces west towards the White Tank mountain range and noticed a bright amber orb just above a peak on the mountain range.It was stationary and seemed to brighten quickly at times.I thought it might be a star, it was brighter and bigger than any other star visible in the sky.I went back inside the house for about 20min and returned to the patio to view it again and it was gone.I looked higher in the sky to see if it had changed position like a star (due to earth&apos;s rotation), but did not see anything that looked similar in size or brightness.", "On July 3, 2010, at 2:33 am I was traveling north on interstate I-77 just passed mile marker 8, in South Carolina.  At the time, there were a few other cars around me. Something caught my eye to the west of me in the sky.  At first glance I thought it was firecrackers, but the objects moved directly towards the interstate.I notice that the objects were flying in a V-formation.  As the objects passed directly over me, they changed formation. I looked upwards and notice that there were about seven of the unidentified objects.  On the bottoms of the objects were stripes of red in which each stripe would appear brighter as a light alternates across each stripe.  I also noticed that the objects had a rotational spin as they continued to move toward the east.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The set of lights on the right would flash three times then the set on the left would flash three times.

I have worked in aviation for over 20 years and have seen a lot of aircraft so I asked them if they wanted to see something interesting. As we walked outside we noticed two more behind these, then two more seemingly flying in pairs but fairly evenly spaced overall. The moon was partially obscured in the western sky but there were few clouds and the winds were calm.The string of lights were yellowish-orange in colour, somewhat like the sodium street lamps in our neighbourhood. They were slowly pulsing and as they travelled at what would appear to be aircraft takeoff and climb speeds (200-300 knots), they turned to a more northerly course and faded out. There were no visible beacons or other lights on the objects (what caught my attention in the first place).  I ran inside to get my phone to see if it could record the event on video, but the quality was too poor to detect the lights and only recorded our commentary.As I came back outside we watched in amazement as the count increased to eight, then ten and finally twelve with about six visible at any one time (the others had turned north and faded out in sequence).  We noticed that they appeared to be climbing from the Georgetown area to the west and did not all follow the exact same course, some turning north before others did.  I observed one passing behind a cloud and then emerging again just before fading out completely and none of them ever stopped pulsing, they just appeared to dim as they got farther away.  I thought they must be helicopters to have maintained their formation so I asked my daughter to run in and shut off the air conditioning but there was no detectable sound so they may have been too far away.I could see no other aircraft in the immediate airspace, but saw one to the south heading north (presumably from Pearson International Airport) that may have observed them.  After the last light faded away, an aircraft flew overhead with the familiar beacons of a passenger jet and it was obvious to all of us that these lights in the sky appeared to be something different.", "Silver Blue Light Observed doing spirals, zigzags and other movements in sky.August 5, 2010 at 2230 hrs was outside of residence a rural area, approx 4mi SE of White Swan, Washington.

The light wasn&rsquo;t as bright as Jupiter but not as dim as a satellite moving in the sky. I yelled for my Great Niece to come out and see.We stood there for 15 minutes watching the light. It would move in spirals, zigzag, and linear, then would appear to remain in one spot with a quiver to it. The light stayed constant in intensity never changing its brightness. I flashed my LED flashlight at it to see if any response but it did nothing, I don&rsquo;t think my light could have been visible from any distance anyway. We thought of getting a camera to take a picture but our zoom isn&rsquo;t strong enough and too dark for it to pick out any detail of the sky.Before going to bed at 0010hrs 080610, I went back out to see if light was still visible, it was still in the sky still doing its spirals and odd movements. Still couldn&rsquo;t hear any aircraft that may have been in the area. Even the wildlife we have Owls, bears, and coyotes were quiet no real background noises other then from the open windows of house.The light was silver blue no real shape possible diamond, then possibly round. Was hard to tell when it &quot;quivered.&quot;  Just appeared to be a light that did not change its intensity. Was much brighter then the satellite that moved to its East from North to South that was barely visible to us. It was not as bright as Jupiter. The area of sky that it was in was in the Milky Way, in that band of bright stars. It was mid sky from the southern ridge of mountains to &quot;noon&quot; above us.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she struck us as being an unusually capable, level-headed witness.

I stopped kissing my girl and told her to look up and tell me what she sees?  This is why I&apos;m filing the report.It&rsquo;s nothing strange to see a plane or even 5 or 6 of them I can see Westover AFB, A good part of the city of Chicopee (just over the Connecticut river) , But tonight is different, Clear and calm stars out and visible and then this object.  I thought it was nothing more than a satellite at first glance.  They move just a bit slower though.This object was the brightest thing in the night sky, and if I was to measure the thing, I estimate around  the size of an apartment building.  This light was intense.  It had height, width, and depth.My girlfriend and I watched this bright light move from the Southeast, toward the east for about a minute, and then it changed direction three separate times, almost a slow zig- zig.  Like it was crawling in the sky, then it moved faster toward the South, (heading over Springfield for about 4 more minutes? We then saw what looked like jets going after this object, like it was trying to chase it.

It was a beautiful, clear night with no moon.  Jupiter was hanging high over head and slightly to the south at this hour.  There were several nice meteors, two brilliant ones of note, but the rest were just tiny little streaks.  I was getting a little bit bored with looking at the same section of sky so I looked back over towards the South.  I could see Jupiter shining through the fabric of the sunshade but off to the side of the shade and directly overhead, I noticed a bright, smaller, pale, bluish, white light.  I was confused since I knew it wasn&apos;t another planet and I hadn&apos;t remembered seeing a star that was that bright. As pondered this anomaly, it just slowly faded out.  While my eyes adjusted tracking around it&apos;s position, I then got this bizarre motion sensation which really bugged me out since I was sitting stationary.  I realized then that it wasn&apos;t me that! was moving, it was a tiny light that my eye had fixed upon, it was no brighter than the background stars, and it was moving slowly towards the South.  That&apos;s when I noticed it wasn&apos;t alone.  There were two distinct, small points of light moving perfectly in unison together with one ahead of the other at a slight angle from my perspective, there was a decent gap between the two, about an inch and a half to two inches if you measured between two fingers of an outstretched hand.   A jet flying at a high altitude with it&apos;s standard running lights flashing also happened to fly overhead a moment later, but towards the East at a completely perpendicular angle to the lights.  I don&apos;t think the jet&apos;s appearance was related, as I could tell it (the jet) was much, much closer that the lights.  What ever I was seeing had to be at an extremely high altitude, possibly in orbit or possibly in outer space.  I honestly don&apos;t know what I saw tonight but it just gave me the chills.  I thought, maybe it was two objects at first, but then I wondered, what! if it w as just one, extremely long object that was dimly illuminated at either end?  I&apos;ve seen a few weird things in my life, but nothing like this.  Please don&apos;t think I&apos;m crazy, I&apos;m usually pretty skeptical about these things, but to actually see it with my own eyes...  I don&apos;t know what else to say.

It was very high in the sky and passing under and threw the clouds.  I called the guy who was putting the carriages away and told him to look up at it.  He did and he saw it too.  I said its not a plane or a helicopter or a jet and he agreed.   We both thought maybe it was an airship shaped in a rectangle shape.  It looked like it had windows on one side and the back three quarters was a light blue color with occasional strobe lights on each side.  It glided slowly across the sky and into the clouds.  Later, I looked up Airships on the internet and found out that there are many types of airships nowadays and that some are even shaped like ! sauser ufos and that they now have passenger rides on airships and that companies make personal airships for people customized to whatever shape or design they want.  Also learned that the Army has made one the size of a football field to do spy work over Aphghanistan and saw a picture of another unmanned spy airship that looks like a ufo.  They said they can also operate them remotely.

I recall everyone gathered above the top of the Edmonds Library for a quick break and re-assignment when one of us spotted 3 flashing lights in the sky above Puget Sound.  All of us stopped talking and were in shock to notice these circular white and red lights make triangle formations in the sky.  They appeared to be playing and chased each other at rapid and then slow speeds to re-group.  At one point, they disappeared into the night sky and then came back to spin/zip around.  Eventually, a 4th one came down and then they disappeared by fading so high into the sky we could no longer see them after 15min or so.  Some of the teens cried and went home.  The police officer who was there literally got teary-eyed from fear and asked that we not ever speak of what we witnesse! d that night because he promised to deny it, and advised people to leave.  I was an adult and we were all police explorers doing a security detail for the community artists and vendors.

It was about twice the size of Venus (as it appears during this time of year).  At first I thought maybe it was an abnormally bright light on top of a radio tower or that it was Venus but since it was larger, brighter and had a steady glow, I started to think maybe it was a plane or helicopter falling from the sky...  It looked like a ball of fire and it moved at a slow, steady speed downwards toward the horizon (I stopped my car for a moment to make sure it was actually moving).  Then it gradually started to move diagonally towards the north, then almost completely parallel to the horizon and then down until I could no longer see it because of trees on the horizon.While I have no idea how large it was or how far away it was, it was about 40 degrees from the eastern horizon when we first saw it.  It also had a steady glow, didn&apos;t twinkle or fade out or anything.  Just stayed a constant brightness comparable to Venus&apos;s but white with a slightly orange outline and an almost burning appearance (which might not make it a steady glow... but it didn&apos;t flicker or anything.  It just seemed to &quot;boil&quot; slightly as a ball engulfed in flames would).I considered the idea that it could be something someone had shot into the air, like some sort of firework that came falling to the ground but it appeared to be very far away and thus would be quite large (I&apos;m not sure if you can really measure the distance of something with no idea what the object is... or how large it is... so this guess is based on the fact that the trees in the horizon were probably a mile away or so).", "Me and a friend routinely go to Chestnut Ridge Park near Cooper&apos;s Rock State Forest to get a clear view of the night sky.

I was scanning the treeline with my binoculars while my friend observed with his eyes.  Through my binoculars I noticed a cluster of several hexagonal yellow lights. This was not a constellation, or any star formation.  It immediately stunned me because I am very familiar with the area as I go there all the time, it is one of the best places to see the sky clearly close to Morgantown.  I got my friend&apos;s attention and observed it with my naked eye. It was a large, quarter size at arm&apos;s length, cluster of hexagonal lights blinking on and off.   We could not tell for sure if this was several objects hovering together, or lights on a larger craft, but it did appear that it was a singular craft as we were both able, through binoculars, to see smaller objects flying around the craft.  Both of us felt frightened by what we saw.   We observed the object for about 25 minutes. It never moved suddenly or swiftly but it did appear to be getting smaller and! farther away as the sighting went on.   Eventually, we left as it was getting late.  The object was still observable when we headed home.I do want to remain totally anonymous, as I never report the objects we witness in that area, but I decided to submit this account because it was an especially startling sighting and unlike anything I or my friend had seen before.

Two other vehicles pulled over behind me and appeared to be watching this, also. The light balls were not moving much at this point.  I was so excited, I forgot to put my camera on movie mode so all I have are the still photos.Two light beams came down from the sky at an angle from the two light balls to my left. The light beams changed their angle a few times as the light balls moved a little.  Then, suddenly the two light balls formed into one larger light ball.  The two light beams coming to earth formed into three beams, then instantly, there was only one light beam.The light ball came to Earth VERY FAST at an angle following the one remaining light beam.  Then the light ball got much brighter, like it was on fire and it was leaving a &quot;fire trail&quot; behind it, not a long one.As it got closer to Earth, it looked like an explosion took place.  I snapped a picture of this &quot;explosion&quot; then it took off for the sky again.  It was traveling very fast.  It went up and over the hill to the right in the photo then went straight up in the sky at a rapid rate of speed.  It disappeared in a matter of a few seconds very high in the sky.  There was no noise whatsoever.I dropped my camera after taking the picture of the &quot;explosion&quot; and took off in my car.

We were waiting for one of my friends to get out of the car. while we were watching him take forever to get out, i noticed a very bright pulsating light in the sky directly lined up with his car just miles in the distance.(i&apos;d say it was over the delta near travis air force base)Due North.One of my friends thought it was a planet the other thought it was a star going supernova. i&apos;m well versed in my astronomy and told them that there was no star or planet in that direction (due North), especially none that bright.We watched as it sat completely still, hanging in the sky for about 5 mins when two men got out of their car and were going into the apt. complex; so we stopped them and asked them if they thought that it looked like a helicopter. they said,&quot;hell no! that&apos;s a UfO.&quot; they watched it with us for about one minute and went inside. it was still stationary at this time and still very bright and pulsing.At that time two of our friends came out of the complex because one was getting a ride and the other was walking her out. As soon as they saw it one of the girls said that&apos;s a UFO, we didnt even tell her what we thought it was. The other girl saw it and ran into the house because she was afraid. The girl got her ride and we still sat watching it.The object then started to dim, then brighten, then go even more dim still. as it did this it moved slightly up, then stopped;slightly left, stopped; and up once more and stopped. The whole time my two other friends were trying to call the people we knew in the apt., but none of there phones were working.We were thinking it was getting bigger for a moment, then i realized it was coming straight toward us. the object moved very slow and was completely silent. when it did reach us, it was 100% lined up with our position, i mean when we looked up it was not to the left or to the right, it was right on top of us! we waited for it to pass a little then ran inside our friends apt. to try and get them to come out to see it. they came out as it was nearly passing the apt. complex&apos;s walls.We watched it fly into the distance when it suddenly split into to separate lights with a good amount of distance between the two. we watched it until we couldn&apos;t see it any more. The whole experience lasted about 15-16 mins. After the experience was over my two friends that saw it the longest with me, and myself, felt very ill and shaky.After we went back inside we stepped out for a cigarette , this was about five minutes after we went in; we saw a black stealth bomber, running below super sonic, flying in the exact same direction as the UFO.I checked MUFON&apos;s website the next day to see if anyone reported it. The stealth bomber was sighted slightly more south than my town, which is the direction it was heading, coming from the north.

Was very quiet.It was in level flight, straight line coming from the direction of roughly west-south-west and flying east-north-east.It got my attention because it had a light brigher that a normal aircraft and was coming my way. The light was a off-white color, almost yellowish.  There were NO blinking lights on the craft like you would normally see on a normal aircraft.  After it flew by, I could still see the bright light, but then I could make out 3 white lights in the rear.  It was too dark to see the shape of the craft.  Did I mention it was very quiet?  Normally a craft flying overhead, you can see the blinking lights, and normally at that altitude you can hear the jet engines.  I did not.  All lights were an off-white to yellowish color, and I could not hear the engines.  Looked to be traveling at normal speeds of a jet craft. Maybe 400-500mph.People up near the Wisconsin border or even Kenosha may have seen it too if it kept going that direction.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was out walking my dog at about 9:30pm it was just about fully dark out with a half moon to light up the sky.  I just happened to look up into the sky in time to see a dark object in the sky flying faster than any aircraft I have ever seen.  It had no lights and made no sound.  It was out of my viewing range in a matter of 5 seconds.  It was flying really low between 1500 and 1800 feet.  But it was too dark to see anything physical about it or any shape.

We are both in our mid-20s, college graduates, work regular jobs, have NO experience with UFOS or aliens.  While travelling back to port at Seattle from Victoria, BC, we happened to notice a meteor shower during the late evening of August 12th.  We ended up watching this meteor shower for several hours.  The meteors were amazing, ranging in many sizes and colors.  Around 1:40am (now Friday the 13th), my boyfriend noticed something unusual in the sky.  He saw two uniform spheres of light appear in the sky, move in a figure 8 motion, and then disappear.  He quickly tried to explain this to me in his bewildered state, but within a few seconds these two lights appeared in the sky again and we both saw them.  The spheres were always equidistant apart, as if they were attached by some invisible pole, and danced around each other very quickly and sharply.  The lights moved in a zig zag pattern, back and forth for abo! ut 5 seconds before flying a straight path over the ship and we could no longer see them from our balcony.  The lights were a little larger in comparison to the stars and seemed to appear from mid air in the sky.  We sat in shock for a very long time, trying to come up with a logical explanation, and hoping to see them again. These lights were absolutely not meteors, they moved in several different directions and left no light tail, and they were solid white lights, no blinking or shimmering. We also thought that possible the military was trying some new type of aircraft, maybe a new invisible plane and all we could see were the two lights on it?   But there was no sound, and with the speed these lights were traveling I&rsquo;d expect a very loud rocket sound.  So my theory is now that these lights were either one or two UFOs, maybe aliens use meteor showers to hide their arrivals?   I would definitely love to know if there is a logical explanation, I don&rsquo;t think I will ever stop wondering what we saw and it may just drive me crazy!  This was seen while we were in the Strait of Juan Fuca/Clallam Bay near Port Angeles.((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))Hello Peter, Thank you for getting back to me so quickly!  I will definitely have my boyfriend prepare his own independent statement.  Its just absolutely unbelievable, I never expected to see a UFO in my entire life.  Half of me still thinks there is no way I could have seen a UFO and there has to be some explanation, but the other half knows that there is nothing on Earth I know of that moves like that, and there is no way we both could have imagined seeing the exact same thing.  To be honest, I feel a little crazy.  I&apos;ve always believed in other life, its bogus to think that we are the only living planet in an unimaginably vast galaxy,  I guess I just never expected to see for myself.  Either way, it was a once in a lifetime experience and I would definitely welcome another! I will have my boyfriend, Eyad, submit his report though the web form.

While watching the bright light through the binoculars, it went from a single light to 5 lights in a pentagon shape, and then it went back to a solid light.   We watched it for about 30 minutes until it went below the tree line.  I live very near the Little Rock AFB, and the bright light was in the southwest of my house in the direction of the far end of the runway.  When the bright light dipped below the tree line, I could still see the two green and red object at the exact 10 and 2 positions above w! here the bright light dipped below the tree line.  Coincidentally, two C-130 aircraft flew in after the bright light dipped below the tree line. They were flying in the direction of the bright light, and then they did a U-turn over the base and flew in the opposite direction of the light.  Coincidence??  No C-130s in the area while the bright light was glowing.  I tried to take a photo, but couldn&apos;t focus on it with the digital camera. I got one blurry photo.", "Bright red --orange balls in the night skySPHERES OF RED LIGHT IN THE NIGHT SKY.I live in the north east of Glasgow Lanarkshire Scotland.  On the 8th.of August 2010 I looked out of my window and saw in the sky, a light, travelling in a SE. to NW. direction.  I went outside and looked up at the light, it was red to orange in colour and in a figure of eight configuration with the two balls of the eight off set.  I watched this light and when it was almost directly overhead it slowed, stopped, then faded into two little white dots, and disappeared.  I realised that what looked like a single figure of eight shaped light was actually two separate round red lights.On the 14th.of Aug, my wife and I saw a red ball of light come over the Campsie Fells (which are 10 miles distant to the north) and fly towards us in a N. to S. direction.  When at a distance of approximately one quarter of a mile to our left it slowed, stopped, then disappeared.  About 30 seconds later another red light appeared over the Campsie Fells and travelled towards us, it slowed then stopped at exactly the same spot as did the first. This went on at very regular intervals for some time, red lights travelling towards us, stopping and then disappearing. Although I didn&apos;t time them, the lights took about one and a half minutes to travel the 10miles from the Campsie Fells.Later that night I looked over towards the Kilsyth Hills which are really a continuation of the Campsie fells and saw a red light, then another come over these hills and disappear at some distance from us.There is no way these lights could be Chinese lanterns.  They travelled at speed in the same trajectory, stopped, then disappeared in exactly the same place.On the 17th.of August we saw two more red lights travelling in a NW. to SE. direction then disappear.", "Fireballs witnessed by 6 people over Battle Ground, Washington skies August 28, 2010On Saturday August 28, 2010, our family was having a great evening watching the UFC 118 fights on Pay Per View.  When it got over, I took our dog outside for his nightly walk in the yard.  I looked up in the sky to the east of our house and noticed about 7 or 8 orange balls floating sporadically in the sky all heading to the south east.I quickly called to the rest of the family in the house where they all came running out to see what was outside. Everyone, 6 members, also saw the lights floating in the sky.The fireballs were originally floating at different levels and intervals, then continued floating in a semi-circle formation to the south east where after about 5 minutes of witnessing this, they just simply flickered out of sight.The sky was clear with no visible clouds.  The moon was nearly full.  The temperature was about 60 degrees with a very slight breeze.  No precipitation at all.", "2:36am in Stonington, Ct there was a bar of light in the upper right sky about the sz of an inch, it tilted to  right, then sped awayThis morning,  August 11th, 2010, at about 2:36 am, I was driving home from Foxwoods casino, as I had passed our local movie theater a ways (regal cinema in Stonington,Ct),  I suddenly saw a bar of light to my upper right in the night sky.  It was white light like a bunch of stars linked together to form a line about an inch wide from my perspective.  And it tilted down to the right a bit.I was thinking how it couldn&rsquo;t be a plane or anything like that because those are usually one dot and slowly moving.  This was like if an edge of a coin were lit up in a line and it wasn&rsquo;t really moving.Then it slowly tilted with purpose (again this was strange to me because if it were a man made prop or something far away the effort to so even would be quite difficult) like when you weigh something with those doctor scales and you get the lead weight right it kind of has this slow settling into place as it gets its balance.  Like that. It tilted in that &lsquo;gaining balance&rsquo; way for another 20 degrees tilting down on the right side.Suddenly it looked like it was moving forward away from me for a moment and then I got this sense of a burst of incredible speed because the lights became smaller so quick they practically winked out they were gone so fast.I was not tired. I was not drunk.  I have never made such a claim before.  I saw my first UFO.  I have no idea what it was alien, military, or otherwise but Unidentified Flying Object.  Oh yes.", "Two Bright Yellow/Gold Lights.My boyfriend saw them first then I saw them.  He had me stop the car.  When we saw them we got out of the car and we were just staring at them and trying to figure out what they were.  There were two really big like the size of a spot light they were bright yellow/gold lights flickering.  One was on top of the other.  The bottom one was a bit off set from the top one.  They were not moving at at all.  The top light started to slowly fade.  A few seconds later the bottom one faded out too.  The both just faded into the dark sky.My boyfriend is a photographer and I am a legal assistant.", "Low flying lights manouvering over treeline.Went out to the lookout point east of runway 7 at Ingalls Field abandoned airport to watch the Perseid Meteor Shower at about midnight with a group of 6 people.  We saw several bright shooting stars before a brief rainshower passed through and everyone bugged out.  Took everyone home, and by the time everyone was home, it had cleared up again, so I decided to drive back up the mountain to see the peak by myself.  I arrived at about 3:30 AM, parked and set out in my chair behind my car with all lights off... about one or two per minute for at least an hour! Ink black sky, Milky way easily visible with the naked eye.  It was beautiful.  Then, I noticed something flashing through the trees to the east. It was a VERY brigh pure white light flashing so brightly it could be seen through the treeline, very low.  I waited for it to pass from behind the trees, and it raised in altitude and changed from a single white light brighter than any star in the sky to a row of 2-3 ! orange lights in a line, which seemed to pulsate or move left to right.  What scared me was the maneuverability.  This thing was flying &quot;S&quot; shaped patterns up and down over the treeline, estimated max altitude 2000 ft., apparent size as big as a pinky fingernail width at arms length.  It started flying in the same direction as the road I drove up to get to the lookout, and I got scared, so I instantly popped my trunk, folded my chair and threw it in as fast as aI could and hit the &quot;unlock&quot; button on my car. As soon as the car unlocked, all the car lights went on, and I thought &quot;SH*T&quot;!  I looked up, and the three orange lights became one much brighter orange light, almost looked like it was shining something at me, like it saw me.  I instantly hopped in my car, cranked it and tried to run in a panic... the car cranked very very slowly for a few seconds, and the lights dimmed before it started up and I drove away. I was scared because I had to drive in the direction of the thing to get out of there so I floored it very fast, narrowly missing a deer.Looked up, and at one second could see the thing through my winshield, which scared me even more. I didn;t feel safe until the road went under the dense tree canopy. There was no noise at all, and no contrails. All I can say is, never again by myself.  Been up there several times to look at stars with people, and we often see solid lights at high altitude on ballistic trajectories, probably satellites, but this was low and bright, and abnormal.  Don;t know what it was, but never again by myself at that hour..", "Slow moving silent black triangle craft observed over Nansen Park Lake Oswego OregonOccurred :  7/24/2010 11:45pm Submitted to NUFORC By:  Cameron Johnson, Director of the Oregon UFO Review 2 (OUFOR2)  Reported:  7/28/2010 10:35 am Posted:  8/4/2010 Location:  Portland, OR ( Mountain Park area ) Shape:  Triangle Duration: 2 minutes Large silent black triangle coming from the west and traveling towards the northeast.I received this report through the online report form on this site.  I have met with the witness who wishes to remain anonymous due to his position as a doctor in the community.  The witness was very adamant that he saw what he described and seemed like a very level headed man.  This is a preliminary report on this sighting and there will be follow ups posted as more information becomes available to the OUFOR2.  Below is the information from the online sighting report.Date of sighting: 7/24/2010  Event time: 11:45pm  Event duration: 2 minutes  Altitude of craft: 500 to 1000 feet  Approximate size of craft: 100 to 200 feet across the flat sides ( Equilateral triangle)   (Weather conditions added by OUFOR2 after researching)  Weather conditions: Clear skies, moon lit night.State: Oregon  Country: USA  Zip Code: 97219 (Mountain Park area of Portland )   Number of witnesses to the event: 1  Shape of craft if any: Triangular  Number of craft seen: 1  FFull sighting description from witness statement:  I was walking my dog out to do his nightly business in the park near my home (Nansen Park ) and while I was waiting for him to finish up I caught sight of something out of the corner of my left eye to the west of me and turned to look.  I saw 3 whitish lights moving towards me ( to the east ) at what I thought was about 500 to 1000 feet in the air. As it drew closer I was able to make out the crafts shape as triangular in fashion. It drifted slowly over head and away to the northeast and seemed to speed up the further it got from me until it was gone. There was no sound that I could hear and my dog did not react to it at all. I would like to know what this may have been, but, due to my being a doctor I request to be kept anonymous in the public eye.Contact info withheld by request of the witness.Initial findings:  I met with the witness on 7/28/2010 in the park and asked him a barrage of the usual questions and from first impressions I found him to be a stable intelligent man without an agenda or any obvious deceptive statements.  He seemed truly perplexed and concerned about the sighting and was not making any rash statements about it being an alien craft or a craft of known origins. He seemed fairly savvy on the local ( usual ) air traffic in his neighborhood too.  He did repeat several times that &ldquo; It was like nothing I have every seen before. The OUFOR2 will be conducting further checks with the FAA at the PDX tower and also by contacting the Oregon Air National Guard at PDX as well. OUFOR2 has already checked the weather conditions for the sighting date and has confirmed that the witnesses statement and the official weather conditions match.Shown below are views of the location via map and also forensic models built to illustrate the witnesses sighting.  The witness has viewed the forensic reconstruction models and has agreed that they closely represent what he viewed that night. There has been added detail to the forensic model from information that the witness expounded upon during our interview.  These models are NOT 100% accurate as to what may have been witnessed since there was only one witness and no photographs or videos taken.", "See approx. 15 reddish orange bright lights flying east of Southport, NC toward Wilmington, NC.

The vehicle had to of crashed within 15 miles of Kecksburgh.", "Hovering circular-dohnut shaped object with red and green-blue light moving at an incredibly fast pace up and across the night sky!!!4 family members were outside at about 12:52 am to see the Perseid meteor shower, we live out in the country which gives us a perfect clear nightsky. I saw towards the north and a circular object with red and greenish-blue lights was hovering from side to side smoothly but straight up within seconds. I quickly told others and we ruled out it could not possibly be any aircraft given the way it was moving! Another member came out and we were in awe! THe UFO then went south passing above us at a high altitude and we heard sound......I immediately called my brother withing city limits and he saw it too and at the exact moment it was above me, there was a sound on our phones!!!!!! The UFO continued to travel south towards Mexico until it faded away.  It was too bizarre.....we are still in shock.....  Then at about 3:02am, we are about to go inside, when we see what appears to be the same object this time going straight up hovering from the East side, but farther awa! y.

I then looked around to see if others had seen the object, and noticed that several other patrons were already staring skyward.  We began to ask each other if we were seeing the same thing, and if we had any idea what it was.My initial reaction was that I was seeing some sort of balloon suspended in the sky with a light shining on it.  However, I quickly realized that the light was being emitted from the object itself.  I felt very strange as I stared upwards in disbelief along with several others.  The orange orb appeared to be changing its shape.  Its movements during this time are hard to describe, but seemed to be pulsing.The nightclub featured many patrons with glow sticks and other flashing lights.  A DJ was playing electronic music from the roof terrace.  I began pointing at the object with two glow sticks to help others see what I was talking about.  At this time, it began to pull back further up into the sky.  The light became dimmer and it moved near what appeared to be a star in the sky, slightly to the west at about 60 degrees above the horizon.Over approximately the next twenty to thirty minutes, the orange glowing orb would generally move in a methodical fashion between several stars / planets in the night sky.  Sometimes it would move slowly and deliberately, while other times it would move in quick movements.  On one occasion, while pointing the light out to another individual, we watched as it slowly approached a star, and then made a semi-circle movement around the star, and then proceed in a straight line.  Based on my own amateur use of a night sky computer program, I believe that this star may have been Altair.I tried to take a picture of the object with my phone&apos;s camera. The object did not appear on the camera, however, an unexplained square orange shape appeared on one image, which I would be happy to provide if needed.  I did not see any square shapes with the naked eye.At least 15 to 20 patrons witnessed the same event over the course of approximately 20 to 30 minutes.  After I went to find others and return, patrons could no longer locate the object.The coordinates of the sighting location are 39.293&apos; North, 76.611&apos; West.I am currently a Ph.D. student at a university in the Washington, DC, area.", "Glowing light hovering and rising slowly then shooting across dky.The object was a glow of light about 2 feet wide with an orange tint.  It had a glow around the light signifying that it was bright.  It was hovering approximitly what looked like 10 yards sbove the road. I was heading west on 32 mile passing the romeo high school when i saw the glowing object. I quickly pulled off into the school parkinglot but tree were blocking my view. Pulled out to the road and the object was higher and no longer directly above the road. I quickly pulled across the street into a sub to get a better view. The object seemed to just be hovering in the air. It was slowly moving up at a very slow speed the object continued to do this till about 50 yards above ground.  I then yelled out my car window to see if it would change the pattern of it.  At this point the object moved a quick speed heading north east. I continued to watch the object but from the point it started moving it was gone in a matter of 5-10 seconds.", "Was photgraphing clouds and didn&apos;t see object until I was looking at the photos on my computer.I noticed a beautiful cloud formation to the south (towards the Grand Canyon) at dusk while standing at my kitchen sink.  Decided to run and grab my wifes Canon Rebel XST camera so I could get a few shots of the clouds using a zoom lens.  I was bare footed and climbed on some small landscaping rocks near the pool to get higher so the block fence wouldn&apos;t be in the way.  I took a total of eight photos within less than two minutes.  When I downloaded the photos I noticed the first four had an object moving through the photos at a downward angle to the left.  I seemed to be fairly distant as I never saw it with my eyes.  It probably only took me 30 or 40 seconds to take the first 5 or 6 photos because the rocks were hurting my feet and I wanted to get down to the pool deck where I took about two more.  I showed my wife and she thought I might have had something on the lens. If I did it came off quick because the last four photos do not show the object.  I zoomed in on ! the photos to see if I could detect a shape. Two looked oval and the other two appeared to have a saucer shape.  I have no idea what it is but it is strange and I don&apos;t think anything was on the lens.  I have the unalterd photos if you want them.", "Possible UFO over Blue Island, IllinoisCircle of white light appeared in southwest sky traveling north, then quickly turned to northeast flightpath. Object traveled for 5 to 10 minutes in a straight line at constant altitude until disappearing in the distance (must have been over Lake Michigan).  A mostly full moon and Venus were visible in the southeast sky and object traveled under them.  Object&apos;s glow was constant, did not twinkle, and appeared exactly the same as it traversed the mostly clear night sky.  Fuselage, tail, wings, wing lights, strobe lights were not visible at any time, nor was there any sound.  Event occurred on Wednesday, 25 August, 2010 at approximately 8:35 to 8:45 pm.

I was taking pictures when my girlfriend got my attention...  At first she thought she saw a police car, but the red and blue lights didn&apos;t flash.  Once the object floated way above any bridge in downtown she knew it was no car.  That&apos;s when she called for me.  I looked at where she was pointing, and instantly knew it was something I had never seen before!  So I pointed my camera and pressed record, but my camera was still set on photo.  So I snapped a quick blurred picture of it before I switched it to video.  I think I got some good footage of the orb floating up, down, and all around until it flickers away into nothing.I still have the raw footage on my camera as evidence to it not being altered with special effects.  I have a simple little digital camera, which would be impossible to add special effects to video on it.The light seemed to be solid blue on one side and solid red on the other.  You can see this as the object moves from side to side.  During the filming I was so excited, I wanted more footage! I am going back tonight 08/16/2010 hoping to see it again.  I most likely wont, but you never know!   My girlfriend and I feel so special to be able to have seen what we did!

There was a green glowing patch of object that was in the sky.  The object was slightly oblong in shape and the size was hard to determine but possibly about the relative apparent area of 20 &quot;stars&quot; ( as it was the only thing I can compare it to). there was only 1 of these object. the object remained stationary for the sighting. i believe that it was a UFO sighting contrary to search lights because vancouver search lights are not green, it was emitting green light that was not uniform within the surface seen, the green light was slightly covered by clouds as they moved by and then revealed again. there appeared to be a slight cloudy area around the object. to further describe the green light, the light quality had &quot;noise&quot; and the light was similar to that seen in LCD/LED clocks and watches.  the object observed was slightly towards the southwest direction from where i was standing and this would&apos;ve been towards the juan de fuca straight. i did not watch until it left my sight.  but when i put my head down and looked up again,  its position has moved in relation to the stars, further south. the neighbouring stars were quite bright but unfortunately i was not able to identify them.", "A glowing yellow ball from the distance that was a &quot;single headlight&quot; for a triangular shaped craft.On August 12, 2010, my sister (a 20-year-old 3rd year university student), her boyfriend (a 22-year-old security guard), and I (a 26-year-old elementary school teacher with a master&apos;s degree) planned to watch the meteor showers at my house in Berlin Township, MI.  At about 10:30, we all laid on the deck and were enjoying the clear skies, stars, and a few meteors.Shortly after 11, my sister&rsquo;s boyfriend pointed out a very bright glow (appeared golf ball sized) to the east.  We all sat up to look, at first thinking it was a meteor.  The light appeared to be getting closer.  After 30 seconds or so, we knew it wasn&rsquo;t a meteor because we could see the light was coming from some type of aircraft.  It appeared to be a headlight, the beam went out into the night sky like a flashlight.  It was NOT a spotlight&mdash;it did not shine down.  The craft continued to move forward, it was moving west.  On one side of the craft was a small blue light and on the other side a small red light, similar to airplanes.  As the craft moved overhead we could see it was triangular shaped and was close, not so close where we&rsquo;d be alarmed but closer than airplanes normally fly.  We watched as the craft very quietly moved west , dipped and glided toward the north, dipped down and up a few more times, and was finally out of view.We were all stunned at what we saw and returned to the deck to continue watching for meteors.  Less than 5 minutes later from the same point in the sky, the bright yellow circular glow appeared again.  We witnessed the same thing again with the same (if not very similar) flight pattern.  This time we all heard what we describe as a &quot;whirring&quot; noise.  After this one was out of view we began to walk from the front yard to the back yard again when we immediately saw another one of the exact same appearance.  This led us to believe there were minimally 2 separate crafts since our 2nd sighting had vanished only seconds earlier.My sister&rsquo;s boyfriend left at 11:40 p.m..  My sister and I drove south down Dixie Highway for about 5 minutes in an attempt to find better views.  As we turned around and headed back, we had our 4th sighting.My sister&rsquo;s boyfriend called shortly after midnight (8/13/10) to say he was outside of his home in Trenton, MI, and was witnessing the same yellow glow.  However, this time the glow hovered at a farther distance for several minutes.  It did not move overhead to reveal the triangular shaped aircraft, but instead simply hovered.My sister and I stayed outside until approximately 2:00 a.m. (8/13/10) and saw a few more meteors but did not have another sighting of the aircraft.  We emailed our local channel 4 news to see if anyone else reported a sighting or if there was an possibility of some type of military practice.  We haven&rsquo;t heard anything back and have not found any other reports online.", "Amber, oval lights over Round Rock, Texas on 8.15.10Around 9:45p.m. CST in Round Rock, Texas, facing West, my mother and I were  taking a walk.  We had just been admiring the clear skies and looking at the  big dipper before we turned a corner.My mom pointed out the first light and I didn&apos;t even look and dismissed it as  an airplane, she said.  Then I looked up and up from the ground somewhere  ahead of us flew amber tinted oval lights.  They look like what a steet light in  the dark.  One after the other they flew up at a 45 degree angles and then  disappeared before our eyes as they went off into the distance.  At one time  one got so close to the other that it looked like it was on top of the other  one.   As we watched several fly up into the sky I ran to my parents house and  got my dad who witnessed the last couple fly up.  We counted 9 in a row.Neighbors at the end of the street were also standing in awe and witnessed  the same.   We also ran into a group of boys who had been riding their bikes, who were standing on the sidewalk watching the sky in awe and asked us what  we thought we all had just seen.  It was scary and amazing at the same time.We immediately thought of UFO&apos;s.  After watching them fly off we did see an  airplane in the sky headed another direction.  We knew after seeing the  airplane that what we saw tonight was not an airplane, helicoptor, or  anything else we have ever seen in the sky!", "Red/Orangeish, or Golden Colored Lights, many appearing then Fading out Together, and being in one place then another instantly,,,I believe the date was around July 20-30th sometime, not sure exactly what date but I believe it was on a Tuesday night though so most likely the 20th.  The time was around 9:30PM - 10:00PM. We were driving to Millen Georgia on I-25 if I remember correctly around Portal when we observed what we believe to be multiple UFOs.  This wasn&apos;t the first time, I had seen a very similar thing close to that area as a child maybe 10-15 years ago.  You can see from the map on this link exactly where the sighting took place between I-16 and Millen somewhere on I-25 heading north from I-16...http://www.flashearth.com/?lat=32.554451&amp;lon=-81.86212&amp;z=10.8&amp;r=0&amp;src=msl  What was seen cannot be described any other way but very ominous, for me anyway.  I was looking straight ahead at the road through the front windshield and didn&apos;t notice anything.  I was in the middle of conversation when my mother, who was driving, said &quot;Hey, is that a UFO?&quot; jokingly.  It was directly in my line of sight however I didn&apos;t seem to see anything until she said something.  When I focused my eyes I began to see Orange/redish or more like golden colored lights in the sky.  Roughly 2 or 3, although she had been looking longer and counted 5 or 6, approximatly 300 to 600 yards high off the ground.  As I had just glanced and only witnessed 2 or 3 for no more than 5-8 seconds, they all simply faded out at the same exact time.  The odd thing is that it couldn&apos;t have been clouds covering them because they all did it simultaneously and they were approximately 2 or 3 miles from each other, spread apart throughout the sky in front of us.My mother claimed that the other ones that I had not seem did the same thing a few seconds earlier.  Then another golden light appeared maybe 2 or 3 minutes later to our front/left.  It was very high up at first and only visible for a few seconds then faded out, far too high to be a light tower.  Then this proccess repeated with no noticeable pattern of timing with only 1 golden light for about the next 10 minutes.  I do some photo minipulation and 3D work for my career so I know distances, angles, and optical illusions very well and this was no illusion.  As we got closer it began to appear lower and lower to the ground, another indication it was not a light tower. It never got under maybe 90 ft from the ground though.  The last time we saw it, it was on the left side of I-25 going north and about 1 mile to the left I believe.  It would disappear, then suddenly appear again in its quite unique golden color for about half a minute or so in different places and appeared to be completely still then it would fade out again.  It was very steady, no pulsing just faded in then out again. I later relayed this info to some family members who live in the area and they said that they had seen some very similar things at other times as well around there. Another interesting detail is that the very next night an extremely severe Lightning storm occurred in that same area. Literally the most severe Electrical Storm I have ever encountered. The thunder was loud enough to cause the entire house to tremble, and it had a sharpness to it that a .44 magnum revolver couldn&apos;t reproduce if it went off right next to your head. I&apos;ve heard that many sightings take place just before or after very severe lightning storms. One of the reasons this was so ominous to me is that I had recently had a dream of seeing a large UFO only a week earlier, which is not a common dream for me. In the dream seeing this UFO was so daunting that it terrified me and I awoke, a dream I&apos;ll not soon forget. On many occasions I have made predictions from my dreams that I discussed with people that later came true, this dream had a similar feeling so I did discuss this with my mother before the sighting took place. In the dream my mother was next to me on my left just as she was during the sighting. I reported this on another website as well, and someone had a very similar sighting with lights of the same color and character only 30-40 miles south of that location in Jesup Georgia just 2 months before.

Then it verry slowly got farther away and faded away.  I could tell its speen and position because I was sitting in a chair and I positioned my head and used the power lines to gauge it speed and movement. Thanks for your intrest-John", "Black Triangle/Pyramid shape craft flew across lake and directly over our carOn Aug 12, 2010, I went out about 2:30 am to watch the Perseids meteor shower.I was by Milton 3 Ponds in Milton, NH, I was looking at the bottom Right star in the little dipper, when I saw a extremely bright flash at first I thought I saw a star burn out, when my eyes  adjusted I noticed that the star was still there but now it was moving from left to right.My next thought was well it is just a satellite or maybe the space station, just then it stopped, It stayed stationary for about 5-6 seconds and then it started moving again but in a different direction, it now was heading toward the lake it made a large ark out and around the lake and right back to the place where I first spotted it.The next night Aug 13, 2010, my neighbor that I told what I had seen the night before ask me If I would go back to the lake and take him this time, and I did, well we were not there 10 minutes when the same object appeared again roughly in the same spot I had seen it the night before. About 5-6 minutes later my friend pointed out a really bright light in the western sky just above the tree line, we watched this bright light for a good half an hour, during this time we watched this light change from red to green to blue and also white.This light also would appear to just blink out completely for 3-4 seconds and then appear again but several feet in the sky to its left and our right, it also looked like it was moving up and down left and right and even at times in small circles this light disappeared 5 times 4 of the 5 it would re-appear but each time it came back it was a little more to its left, the 5th time it went out it did not come back.We had no clue what we were looking at and jokingly I said to my friend what would you do if it disappeared and all of a sudden it was right above us, as I finished saying that I kind of jumped and said holly shit that just scared the shit out of me, my friend quickly looked in my direction and said what?, and I replied oh that plane coming across the lake with its landing lights on, we kind of laughed but kept watching the plane, as it got closer it started looking more and more not like a plane,  My friend asked is there an airport close by and I said no why?  And he said then why would it be so low and have its landing lights on?  Well this got us both really watching these 2 lights that I thought at first was a plane with its landing lights on, it was getting closer and we still didn`t hear any noise.As it got closer we could see it better it had 2 large flood lights in the front but we didn`t see the standard red and green blinking lights on the wings, and still didn`t hear any sound from it we were sitting in the car with the sunroof open, and the craft was coming right at us from my left across the lake. It flew just about right over us, as it got right above us it was about 3-400 feet up and it flew through a small cloud as it got right above us that was when we heard a very low like rumbling sound nothing like a plane at all, but when it entered the cloud those huge spot lights in the front lit up the whole cloud and it illuminated the whole craft in like a golden aura, that was when the 2 of us really got a good look at it and I can say it scared the hell out of us both!! It looked like a large triangle, the first thing my friend said was holy shit look at that it looks like a pyramid flying over us!! It had the 2 large lights in the front and one large strobe in t! he back there were no other standard lights at all on this thing! what I saw was what looked like a pyramid sitting on top of this black triangle I also saw well the only way I can describe it as a half of an arch going from half way from the rear point of the triangle from the front arching up to this pyramid shape that was on top of the triangle.On the inside of this arch looking part on the pyramid part it looked like either a row of six windows that were illuminated from inside with a golden light or maybe it was just a row of 6 golden lights. It wasn`t moving very fast at all, maybe like 40-50 MPH because we got a good look, as it went over us for I would say maybe 4-5 seconds. On the right side of the road, is a row of pine trees as it went over these trees, I jumped out of the car and ran to the other side of the road just past the row of trees is a swampy area roughly a quarter of a mile across then you hit the rest of the woods.It looked to us like it had dropped even lower when it passed the first row of trees to where I thought it was either going to land or crash into this swampy area, but when I got to the tree line I could see this thing start to move back up and over the wooded area on the other side of the swamp, and it  seemed to just blink out of sight.I have never seen anything like this in my life, and I have seen a lot of different aircraft, I am a Navy vet that served during the Gulf war.I have been trying to draw what I saw but I am not a very good artist, after we got back in the car I realized my new cell phone had a camera and does take video I am really kicking myself in the butt for not thinking of using the phone to either video it or at least get a few snap shots of this thing!", "red light over Falkirk.It was a dark red light that came from nowhere and flew in a straight line across the sky above us.

It was in a suburb of North London called Finsbury Park.  I was 20 years of age and considered myself observant.Their apartment was at the top of a block about 50ft off the ground.  Their front door led out onto a balcony walkway with an unobstructed view over approximately a half mile square plot of land that had about six water filtration reservoirs surrounded by a collection of low buildings that I would guess, housed tool stores, offices and maintenance vehicles.  Apart from the residential viewpoint I was looking from, there were blocks of houses to the left and to the right of the filtration plant.  A busy main road ran along the front of the plant site, about a half mile from where I was standing.What I saw from the balcony was a cone of very bright light pointing down from above.  The wide circle of light slowly and methodically searched the reservoirs and buildings in circular motions.  The sky was inky black and the reservoir area was only lit by low powered security lights as the place was only worked in during daylight hours and never, as far as I can recall, at night.  At no time during this sighting could I make out any shape looking up at the apex of the light beam.I called my father out and asked him what he thought it might be?  He said, &lsquo;I think it&rsquo;s an helicopter!&rsquo;  I invited him to listen and he had to admit that all he could actually hear was the faint sound of the traffic on the main road, half a mile away and nothing else.  We stared at the light for another five minutes, then my father suggested that it might be a secret silent running helicopter with an astonishingly bright light that we don&rsquo;t know about?  I suppose it was as good an explanation as we were going to get, though I rather doubted it on the grounds that if the military had perfected such a thing, then why did they insist on using extremely noisy machines in war zones? (to this day)  That&rsquo;s the thing about helicopters, the noise, you can always hear an helicopter even if you can&rsquo;t see it, the noise will bounce off buildings and trees which will make you look in the wrong place for it even if it&rsquo;s behind you.  Unlike this thing which was somewhere in front of us and poss! ibly above us, but totally silent.I left the apartment and made my way down to the main road.  On the way, I entered a gap in the houses and this time got a side view, ground level looking up at the cone, still I couldn&rsquo;t see anything on top of it, and it remained totally silent. Next I went to the main road and stared at the same view, this time with my parents apartment block behind the light source.  No silhouette, no sound other than the traffic behind me as the beam of light continued on it&rsquo;s rounds of the site.  I stopped a man passing by and asked him to look at the light.  He didn&rsquo;t, he just looked at me then accused me of being a drug addict. I got on a bus to go to my class and tried to get some passengers to look out of the window, most just looked at me, and the only guy who bothered to look out said it was an helicopter!  Helicopters were not that common in the U.K. back then as they are now.  Police helicopters and Air Ambulances are such a common sight these days that they seldom register.  Certainly the military had them back then, but you never saw any in suburban areas.When I witnessed this event, I was keen to tell as many people as possible.  Firstly, when I tried to inform whatever authority I could find, the Police, local government, newspapers, Water Authority and the BBC, was treated with disbelief or just plainly ignored.  The only thing the Police was interested in was where I had obtained the Water Board&rsquo;s (Water Authority) phone number from when I told them that I had already spoken to them, and they told me to contact the Police.Over the years, I have related that story to people who I believed might make some intelligent use of it, but all I&rsquo;ve ever got was ridicule and anger.  One smart guy I thought better of, shouted &lsquo;YOU SAW A HELICOPTER&rsquo; and refused to talk about ever again.  People who were not there at the time and people who were not even born at the time have accused me of being on drugs, drunk, mentally unstable or just a plain old liar.  Some have offered physical abuse while a few have actually hit me.  The worst I suppose was having someone at a party tell the other guests that I&rsquo;d seen a flying saucer with little green me in it.  No!  I would try to explain, what I encountered was a U.F.O.  It was above me, so &lsquo;Flying&rsquo;.  It was, I&rsquo;m sure, an &lsquo;Object&rsquo; and it was and remains so, &lsquo;Unidentified&rsquo;   A couple of years before that happened, I saw what appeared to be an aircraft flying high in the night sky. The single tiny white light was constant and moved in a straight line across the sky quite slowly giving the impression of great height.  Then directly above me, the light made an abrupt 70 degree angular turn and shot upwards and was gone in a second.  The various explanations I have been offered, either cynically or violently have been:-  You saw a...comet, a shooting star, a meteor, an aeroplane, a spy plane, a weather balloon, a satellite, a Chinese Lantern, the Moon and even Venus.  It&rsquo;s little wonder I haven&rsquo;t mentioned these things too much over the last four decades.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))", "A small light flew accross the night sky at tremendous speed.July 31st and on August 2, 2010, both at approxiamately 21:45 hrs, a small white light (the intensity of Polaris) moved rapidly accross the sky about 25 degrees above the horizon due south from Hanover, Ont.I observed it crossing about 40 degrees of the sky in a west to east direction. It covered this span in 4 to 5 seconds. I have observed many planes and satellites over the years and nothing ever came close to this speed.There were no flashing lights, just the steady glow resembling a regular satellite.I could not estimate its&apos; distance away. The sky was clear and many other stars were visible at the time. Many air routes pass by here so I am well aware of airplane lights.", "Reflective orb revealed in digital photo of clouds.On the evening of July 23rd, I shot a number of cloud formation photos that were backlit by sun filtering through storm clouds.  The semi-setting sun was at approximately 30 degrees above the horizon. This shot was taken straight overhead as I stood facing west.  Once I downloaded the digital photos, I discovered one showed an orb located in the upper left corner.  Unfortunately that area of the picture is blurry; however, the orb definitely shows the reflection of the neighboring clouds.

Out of the northeastern sky a fireball appeared heading straight down for the ground. It burned with a bright green flame through a partly cloudy sky. Out of the trailing tracer behind the fireball a dart shaped craft appeared. It was silver or gray with no tail rudder and appeared to be standing still then suddenly began moving southeast perpendicular to the ground. It suddenly picked up speed and disappeared into the horizon leaving behind a light white beam-like tracer that quickly faded.Everyone on the road and in the vicinity saw the fireball/meteorite because traffic slowed down, several people swerved to avoid hitting each other. The meteorite made the local news but I have not seen any reports of the craft that emerged from it. I&apos;m sure most were focused on the fireball because it was spectacular and the craft could have been mistaken for a low flying airplane.I have played the event back over and over in my head and the craft was definitely not an airplane, helicopter, or other known type of terrestrial aircraft.

This has caught my attention because the light never went away. At one point the trajectory of the rocket stands still and begins to transform into a small disk and started approaching the city and the area of observation. I left the area of the bridge and sticked close to a building that could give me a possibility of covered area but continued to attend the same approach. However, the subject held his course, and exhibited an additional light that turned towards the bridges. Returned to walk in another direction, for example, approaching the other side and turned his light towards a monument. When the subject has stopped in the area of observation it was almost over my head. While standing on top of the observation zone, its light (which to me seeme! d a kind of probe) directed her toward the area of nightlife  and then went in the direction of the bridge next to the West . Being the nearest point of observation, I note the discoid shape of the object, brown with a more nebulous area in the base bottom center of the disc, giving the idea that this area is moving. The object was low in altitude, no more than 100 meters. The subject did not exhibit any noise or sound. Returning to move slowly forward until the next bridge, also changing its path. Stopped over this (where many people walked) and drove his light / probe towards the main street and monument of the city. Speeding up and leaned for a moment seemed to gain a little altitude and then dive (giving the notion of sudden loss of altitude) towards the northwest on the horizon of observation (almost like land), disappearing. The observation lasted at least a minute. After this, looking for any witnesses, found no one to look to heaven and once I was in a foreign count! ry and in a problematic nightlife &aacute;rea I kepted to myself. One! cellula r photo was taken and I will submit.

As i watched the plane I noticed a glint of light coming from behind the plane.  At first I thought it might be another plane. I looked directly at the object and noticed it was a triangle shape, moving extremely fast. In a matter of 2 or 3 seconds it went from being about 1.5 miles behind the plane to 2 miles in front of the plane.  I could hear the sound of the planes engines as it went by my location. I heard nothing as the craft accelerated to pass the plane.  As I reached for my phone to take a picture this craft went vertical and accelerated to over 1000 miles per hour.  Both plane and craft were at about 10,000 feet when seen. As the craft went vertical it was out of my sight in a second.", "A low flying cylinder shaped obect with a propeller fan looking device at the end about 150 above ground.It was yesterday- Saturday, August 21, 2010.  I live in Santa Rosa, CA.  It was right after I left Wal-mart In Windsor, Ca, (just a few towns north of Santa Rosa).  There was an Airshow going on at the Santa Rosa Charles Shultz Airport and as my girlfriend and I were walking out of walmart we were looking in the sky towards the west direction watching a jet in the sky.  Once it was out of sight we got into the car and proceeded to drive home.  Before getting on the freeway heading west on Shiloh road in Windsor Ca, myself and one passenger in my car both witnessed a very strange craft in the sky about 1000 feet ahead of us.  It was flying really low, maybe 100 to 200 feet max. above the road.  It was a cylinder object with a fan looking propeller device at the back end of it. Instead of a propeller on the front of it like a normal looking plane.  It was a bright silver, almost white looking color. It looked to be about 20 or 30 feet long by 10 to 15 feet wide-(about ! the size of a personal 1 to 2 man plane)   Like I said there was an airshow going on so I was kind of looking towards the sky when it happened, and so when I saw it I thought to myself am I really seeing this?- what is this thing flying so low and it seemed to be moving at a good speed but I could see it so clearly.  And as I thought that my friend riding in the passenger seat yelled out &quot;look at that!&quot; and we were both in such awe because we think we just a ufo.  It was wierd it looked like something that would&apos;nt even be able to fly.  I had her describe to me what she saw and she explained it the same as me.

Our drawings look just about similar.", "Round, bright orange balls in sky traveling in single file while climbing in altitude.On 7 August 2010, I took my dog out for the final time before bed at approximately 2205 hrs.While waiting, I noticed a bright orange orb to the West of my property traveling from South to North at about 15 to 20 thousand feet. I stopped and observed the object moving 300 to 400 mph in this Northerly direction. I listened for the engine noise thinking it was a jet with the afterburner burning. There was absolutely no engine noise.At this time I saw a second bright orange orb at a distance behind the first estimated at one mile. At this point I went inside and called my wife to come outside and look at what I was seeing and grabbed my camera. Then a third came up toward the second and so on, until there were 10 to 12 objects passing in single file above the horizon, climbing in altitude and all moving at a steady rate.This went on for a total of 15 minutes. It was mostly cloudy at the time we observed the objects, except where we able to see the objects appear. All disappeared into the clouds at the far North, estimated to be ten to fifteen miles.At no time was there any engine noise and all of the objects had the same orange color and dimensions. All were round, bright orange, about the color of a fresh pumpkin.

Noticed a brightly flashing object in the WSW sky.  Thought it was an airplane because it had several different colors being displayed.  It was the brightest object in the sky except for Jupiter which was to the east area of the sky.  Moon not visible as it had already set.As I watched I realized the flashing lights did not move in relation to the trees in the yard of the house next door to the south of me.  After 5 minutes (40 miles of jet airliner flight distance) it still remained in the same position.I walked to where my driveway meets the street some 100 feet west of where I first spotted them to get a better view of the lights.  They were still in the same place.I returned to my house side door and retrieved my 20X80 binoculars to determine if I could see anything with the use of them.  Going back to the driveway entrance I used the binoculars and could see that the lights were changing colors and very quickly.  Red, blue, white, green colors were visible with the glasses but of course the image was all over the place. I placed them on the top of the fence post at the entrance of my driveway and although it steadied the image somewhat it was still only a bouncing globe of lights moving around.  Like trying to watch a star with high power glasses, almost impossible.Although I watched the lights for about 30 minutes, less the time to get the binoculars, they appeared to remain the same intensity and with multicolors.The position was about where I would expect to see Arcturus, the star the tail of the Big Dipper leads to.  Maybe it was that star, although I have looked at it hundreds of times, including from the flight deck of jet airliners.  I have never noticed it have coloring and flashing brightly like it did tonight.The object was about 35 degrees above the horizon and the sky is clear although there could have been some smoke from the forest fires that occur this time of year adding particulates to the atmosphere and perhaps giving a view that I have never seen before.I stopped watching at 23:45.", "Orange Ball brightness of street light, low altitude, no sound, heading West then South, slow, lost visual.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Our family friend had told us all the flights were delayed or canceled  because of the thunder storm and severe rain we were having.  While we were standing outside his house in the drive way he saw a really bright light. He said, &quot;Come here and look at this.&quot;  I was standing where tree branches were blocking my view so I couldn&rsquo;t see what he was pointing at. When I stepped closer to where he was standing and looked into the night sky I saw a bright hovering disk (it had a disk like shape but the light surrounding it was rectangle).  It was very bright and looked far away, yet the whole craft was brilliantly lit. It emitted a yellow/golden light in color. We both stood looking at the flying object until it flew straight into the clouds.  During the short amount of time we saw the UFO, it maintained the hovering position, not moving anywhere, for about 5 seconds.  Then went up a few feet in the air (from our perspective) and back down to the original position.   After this the UFO flew straight up into the clouds at a super fast speed.  It looked like it disappeared. There were no more lights emitting from the craft.This is my first encounter with anything to do with UFO&rsquo;s or aliens. I can&rsquo;t explain what I saw.

I looked for the object with 8x42 binoculars, but could not see anything.  About 6 seconds later, I observed another flash(object), then 2 seconds later, another flash in  the same area of the sky.  At the same time, a two engine, wide body commerial jet (flying out of Toronto International airport) came into the vicinity of the flash.  Next the object turned on, what seemed to me to be dark yellow landing lights.  I thought the object was trying to let the commerial aircraft know that it was in the area.

I lived North of the city, pretty dark in those days.The first:  Facing South, a white, star-like solid light, like a medium size star, appeared in the sky very, very high up, at an almost-directly-overhead latitude and crossing the sky coming out of the East to West. I immediately thought it was a satellite. Way too high to be an airplane.  It was either already in space or just on the fringe. And faster than a satellite I was use to seeing.But just as I told the person I was with to &quot;look, it&apos;s a satellite&quot;, the object stopped crossing the sky half way, almost directly overhead, and literally stopped on a dime, and then went straight up into space, fading out.  It didn&apos;t continue across the sky like a satellite would and then instantly &apos;blink&apos; out when it went into earth&apos;s shadow.  This object went straight up.  A 90-degree instant &apos;turn&apos; up into space.  I verified this in my mind by acknowledging that it did not &apos;cross&apos; any more stars in any direction.I&apos;m a private pilot, university graduate and voluminous readings, I know of nothing that would act like this, particularly that it was so high to start with, traverse half the sky, and then abruptly stop and go into space and fade out, not suddenly blink out.Now here&apos;s the kicker:  about six years later, my wife and I were standing in my backyard, same house, facing North this time, looking up towards the horizon, not straight up.

Both were traveling much faster then the satellites I&apos;ve seen crossing the sky.  So, from first sighting it near the horizon to it going up into space took about seven seconds and then another two/three seconds as it faded out)   Without taking my eyes off of it this time, I told my wife, &quot;see the light coming at us?&quot;   Watch...it&rsquo;s going to come almost overhead, stop, and then go straight up into space and fade out!   And it did just that as I was describing what it would do to her!!

The object traveled in a straight, unvarying course.  When it passed over a cloud I could easily estimate where it would come out again further up the path. I just happened to look up at an aircraft that was heading south (I presume coming from Vandenberg due to its low altitude) and saw the object pass over it.  Round, white but not reflective, no noise and at first I thought it might be a parachute from the aircraft.  But after a few seconds it was obvious it was not an aircraft.  From when I saw it to when it was out of view was between 1 and 1.5 minutes. My niece was outside at the same moment and she saw it too.  There are storms coming in from the north-west and the wind is also swirling so any balloon or something like that should not have traveled in a straight line.  I have never seen anything weird in the sky before and I get to see a lot of aircraft every day and this just stood out as quite strange.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

I happened to look out the passenger window I saw what I first thought was one of those blimp type balloons attatched to the ground with cable that used car lots use to advertise. It looked relatively close, just off the highway, in the town I was passing. Not sure of the town, but I will say around the Willcox, AZ area. Anyway. about five minutes later, I again look out the passenfer window and see the same object, at about the same location, but I had traveled at least 5 miles. So I keep on driving and looking at this object every once and a while. Mountains and small towns are going by in the distance, but this objuct is always in the relative same spot in the sky out the passenger wingdow. I must have traveled another half an hour, maybe 45 minutes or so, and this abject is still inn the sky out the passenger window. I then thought if it was tracking me or something. I finally come to an exit on the highway, and I was to see if i can get closer to it. This must be at least 30 miles from where i first see it. I get off the highway and go south, finding the roads to get! me closer. I must have tried for maybe 20 minutes to get closer. I finally stop I get out of my car and take a look. It was cylinder in shape, like a soda can, with the &quot;top&quot; facing up. No wings, not a hot air balloon, not a hellicopter, did not hear any sounds of an engine. It was just hovering in the sky.

There&apos;s one craft that I mainly see up there cruising around changing directions in a way that a plane could not, the craft is also illuminating red, blue, and green flashing lights.  Tonight as I was watching this craft another craft flew directly over my apartment to high to make out the size.  I live near the airport so I am familiar of airplanes and this was not an airplane.  This craft was v shaped with red lights on the bottom.   It looked like it was at the height of a plane but made no sound, I watched to see if it descended to the airport which it did not.  The craft instead moved higher into the sky at an angle until it was gone.

It was clear less humidity in the air and sparce fluffy clouds from a little rain we had that night.As i sat looking up waiting to see what would happen some jets passed overhead and i decided to photograph them figuring i would get those little non-seen UFOs around the jets. I photographed two jets passing and waited. Just them at 10.39.24 i see a silver star appear exactly were i saw the V UFO yesterday. I jumped up with my camera totally pumped and excited aimed the camera and it wouldnt focus, i switched to manual and shot, switched to auto and shot more. The Probe started moving slowly to the east from the west with the direction of the wind, clouds were slowly passing by it. As the probe passed over head i tried to get some video but it would nt work  i started shooting as best i could, i then see a jet coming rite at the Probe and i thought the probe would disapear but i didnt, the people in the jet must have seen the probe as it passed pretty close but both jet and UFO were in a light fuzz hazzy cloud, my camera wouldnt focus, the jet then went by, i shot more, ! then another jet was coming rite at it again and it passed by in another fuzzy cloud, my camera wouldnt focus, if the pilots missed it they shouldnt be pilots i thought. I was alittle frustrated because the jet and UFO would had been great shots. As i shot more photos a jet higher up than the UFO came from the East heading West i snapped great focused shots of the UFO and jet. As the UFO probe headed to the east towards the tree i ripped off as many shots as i could until it went out of sight. In total i got 110 shots as it passed overhead. I then felt it wasnt over so i waited looking around for a few minutes seeing nothing, i grabbed the camera coffee and radio swatting mosquitoes in the miserable zombie heat and headed in the house, i looked over the far trees and over them i saw a flashing object moving west, reminded me of snow goose in flight then i remembered my Chatham sighting of the object that flashed like a snow goose, i quickly sat my coffee and radio down turn! ed as fast as i could to shoot it and it was gone in a split s! econd, i t could have been a Ring-Billed gull, but ill never no cause i missed it!!. In the house processing i picked the best, focused and silver shinny shots of the craft and enlarged and enhanced them. in all the photos there seems to be some sort of plasma dripping out of the craft in every shot. Also in a couple of shots there seems to be a black dot on the bottom of the whatever it is. Awsome! im so pumped up over this sighting. Anyway i only sent the best enhanced enlargments and one normal shot for orientation at 135mm focal lenth, and one with the jet and tree a little larger than normal just to see it all alittle better.((NUFORC Note:  Photos not of a genuine UFO, we believe.

Initially I dismissed the objects as airplanes as Switzerland lying at the crossroads of Europe sees lots of air traffic.  My initial assessment was deemed incorrect on the basis of other aircraft moving across the sky at altitudes that made it clear that they were indeed aircraft (shape, contrails, speed of movement).  The four objects remained almost motionless, until I witnessed a smaller and less bright object break or drop away from one of the objects.  At this point (after five minutes of viewing) I determined it necessary to gather other witnesses.  I went into my house and asked my girlfriend to come outside with me, and to bring a camera.  When we returned outside, the 4 objects were now 3 and we watched them for approximately 10 more minutes before going inside to look for another camera with! a telephoto lens.  The objects moved slowly, and were hard to see against the brightness of the clear summer sky, often fading into the blue back ground and then returning with intensity in a new location making it difficult to judge their exact location.  The objects moved closer to each other over time, one after the other, never at the same time.  I stopped two other passing strangers to confirm that they could also see the objects, which after a moment of searching (again, bright white objects on a bright blue sky) they found and confirmed.  At this point my girlfriend and myself went inside to look for my camera and telephoto lens.

The brightness fluctuated which seemed awkward for a air craft to change altitude so much. When first spotted it was near Cassiopeia heading towards the constellation Taurus.

It seemed odd to us that stars would be aligned so perfectly like that, so we kept watching to see if they were planes, or thought maybe our shifting view would clarify what they were.Our view was obstructed for two minutes, and as we approached Palos Verdes Drive W. (we were on Via Coronel at this point), the lights came in to view again, unchanged.  Our view was obstructed again as we approached the Palos Verdes Drive West, and was blocked by trees as we headed North for around 1/4 mile.  When there was a break in the trees, we pulled over to give it a better look, and again we saw the lights.The lights were definitely above land, though not extremely high in the sky.  They were as bright or brighter than how Venus usually appears.  We guessed that there was around 1000 ft between each light.  It seemed odd to us that stars would be aligned so perfectly like that, and while we were watching, the middle and upper light started flashing.  The light on top was flashing green and the middle light flashed red.  This continued for approximately one minute, then suddenly a fourth white light zoomed in from the East and into position directly over the green light, and a second or two later the lowest light took off in the opposite direction.Following that, the red and green lights turned white again.  Then one by one, the three remaining lights appeared to be moving away into the opposite direction of where we were.  First, the uppermost light became fainter and fainter, then the middle light and finally the lowest light remained, becoming fainter, and then disappeared.

My friend asked if I noticed that the far left light was behaving oddly; it wasn&rsquo;t flashing, but it would seemingly disappear from view at random intervals. I thought it looked like a plane, at first, but the light positions and behavior didn&rsquo;t correspond with those of typical navigation lights.  Right before the light turned green, the object seemed to stop.  I was close enough to the ground to use terrestrial objects as a reference for its position.  We then began travelling towards the object on a two lane highway, leading out to the rural part of town (I gather from the way it approached that this was where it was originally, before moving towards us).  The closer we got to it, the more we realized that it had stopped moving and was hovering over a field. It was frozen in place.  The radio was at a very minimal volume and we both had our windows down.  We were more than close enough to hear a jet turbine, prop chatter, etc. At our closest point I would imagine it was roughly 125 yards out in the field.The craft was triangular in shape, but somewhat thin from a side view.  It had three lights, one on each corner of the triangle shape, and a spotlight on the front (or in the direction was moving, rather), which was casting a fading cone shape, straight ahead.  For a brief period, I also noticed a faint blue light emanating from underneath the vessel. We pulled over in a turning lane just beyond our point of perp endicularity.  As we stopped, the car behind us pulled over in the same turning lane, just ahead of us. My friend got out of the car to catch a better look, but my view was perfect from inside the car.  Shortly after stopping, the craft began floating across the road we were travelling, not quite a quarter mile behind us.  It was directly above the street; I would wager it was about 150-200 feet above the ground.  It was travelling very slow and was heading behind the shopping center we had just left. We pulled up next to the other car and asked the driver if he saw what j! ust happened. He said he just got off the phone with his girlfriend, telling her about the hovering object.  He claimed he was a seasoned pilot and began commenting on the object&apos;s triangular shape and strange hovering.  He explained how the particular craft looked and behaved unlike anything he had ever seen.Side note:  This is a tough position to be in.  I used to mock those that reported UFOs, but now, I am one of them.  My friend and I, plus the other man in the car behind us, saw something that was simply unfathomable.

The night sky was clear, other than the clouds in the north. It is difficult to judge the airplane&apos;s altitude, though I could see its underside in detail.  As the plane flew directly above my apartment complex, I noticed a yellow ball of light dart into a position behind the plane&apos;s tail where it began to follow the plane for about 4 seconds.The ball of light was about the size of the airplane&apos;s tail section.  The light did not seem to produce a noise, though it was difficult to know since I could only hear the sound of the plane&apos;s engines.  After it trailed the plane for a short time, the ball of light veered off in a northerly direction, and at times flew erraticly (suddenly slowing down, then speeding up). I estimate the light was traveling at least twice as fast as the plane.I continued to track the ball of light until it faded into the clouds in the north.  It was obvious to me that this ball of light was not another airplane, considering it was not displaying blinking lights, nor was it at a safe distance between the plane I was observing.

or &apos;between&apos; the segments, althogh if i had, i would have noticed.at this point the crescent moon had set, i suspect that this object was high enough to gather ambient light enough from the same source as our satellites (the sun), and reflect it back. it could have been picking up the glow of the moon below the horizon, or ambient city light glow.   the sight of it also gave me the impression that somehow it was absorbing most of the light, like it was cloaked.  my only other thought on what this was like would be an airplane flying with no lights at all.  it still does not explain the shape of the object, or the apparent formation change during flight.there was no sound, no smell, no vibrations, no strange feelings during this sighting.  i live approximately 6 minutes by commercial air travel from newark airport (25 miles or so by car) and wonder if anything showed on radar (if this thing was low enough).   becouse i am an experienced sky observer, i believe that this is indeed a ufo, unless there are man made crafts that can appear as i have described.  when i first saw this object, i remembered to be as observant as possible and kept in mind real life comparisons for a good description. i have searched the internet for descriptions or videos that are similar.  when i find something i will be in touch.  i am only sorry i did not have my hd camcorder ready, although i am not sure this would have shown up in video without more hi-tech equipment.  i get annoyed at some of the ufo reports that lack in detail, or have poor descriptions. and i want to be as detailed as possible.to demonstrated my observational skills and knowlege: previously, i have seen many things that seemed unexplainable in the night sky.  i came to no conclusions until i thought through what i had seen.  there was a reasonble explanation, no matter how fantastic it seemed at the time.   two of these previous sightings are as follows:  one object i had seen was a very bright round falling object in the southeastern sky in mid october. a peice of it had also fallen away below it like molten silver, i watched it fade after about 5 minutes. it made no noise although it looked like it would hiss like a fire if you could hear it.   it was either a shooting star coming directly at me that broke up into two peices, or a rocket booster falling away after lauch. this occured around 3 am and i was too tired to look it up, but i am sure that is what it was.the other object was a very distant, large bright green flair in a cold winter northeastern sky, a green so brilliant, like the the color green a diamond reflects in the sunlight.  this flair left a trail and it traveled in horizontal fashion, taking much longer than fireworks to fade. there was no sound. this was probably a military flare from a marine vessel (i live close to the waters west of new york city and staten island--close enough to observe a flare from the water there if it was shot high enough).the exact dates of these occurences have long been forgotten, because i knew they were easily explained.  at the time, they were surprising and amazing to see.i am an expereinced amateur sky watcher.  i would like to point out that i know the difference between the most obscure explanaions for identifiable objects, and an unidentified flying object.  i have seen almost every kind of non-ufo expample in the day and night sky -- so i do know the difference.  i hope there is some logical explanation for this.  i have never seen anything like this before.ok for preliminary email contact by nuforc investigator.  thanks.", "3 lights poss triangle outline they move individuly some kind of hover zig zag manuver all 3 i line but distants apart few miles apart but in some sortof formation and a lot of what appeared to be shooting stars 8 or 9 within 20 min and i hear a strange hum then it goes away and 5 min i hear it again almost like an ultra light i thought it might be 3 of them trying to freak peop;e out but they where in sequence and the strange fireballs during event this is second time in a month ive seen this in am hours really weird but cool", "Two clearly visible, internally lighted spheres, flying in formation toward New OrleansOn New Year&apos;s eve, 2009, at about 21:00, I went out to my back deck to watch the fireworks going off around our neighborhood.  Looking straight up, I thought I was looking at some strange new form of fieworks over my house.  However, I soon realized these objects were too high up and too large to be fireworks.  What I saw was two large internally lighted spheres traveling in a northeast to southwest direction toward New Orleans from Slidell where I live.  They were identical spheres traveling at about 50-60 mph, in a perfectly parallel course at the same altitude and speed.  Their altitude appeared to be about 1000 to 1200 feet and they were about the size of a small house or about 75 feet in diameter.  The wind was virtually calm and there was a broken low overcast cloud cover.The spheres appeared to be made of translucent glass or ceramic material which appeared glowed pink over-all with uneven blue and gray horizontal bands around them.  They glowed from within and were clearly visible for about three minutes before disappearing into a low hanging cloud bank.  The strangest characteristic was that they had a collar around the bottom of the spheres which was emitting yellow flames in a downward direction which bent back away from the direction of travel.  Looking up into them was like looking into an upside down can of burning Sterno, but much bigger.  The flames were too big to be a hot air balloon and would have set a balloon on fire because they were also deflected up the sides of the objects by their speed of travel. They were also going too fast, and at too constant a speed and altitude, to have been ballons.There were no navigation lights, beams, or other forms of illumination visible.  They glowed with a soft glow from inside them which made them clearly visible in the night sky.  There were no visible windows or other openings to be seen.They appeared to possibly have been man-made robotic craft of some sort, but I know of no craft with these characteristics that could possibly fly in the manner of these two spheres.  For this reason I have to classify them as unidentified flying objects.I am a retired college instructor and former private pilot familiar with many forms of aircraft, but I have never seen any like this.", "White  glowing sphere appeared in the sky and moved  horizontally leaving a white glowing tail behind it .Many UFO sightings happened  at different times and sites, Sinai, Cairo and many other places here in Egypt,as for me I was one from those who had these sightings at 4.30 am (6/23/2010), while i was studying i saw a glowing whit ball(very small ball indeed), I thought it was a star at the beginning since it was standing still in-spite of it&apos;s larger size  and suddenly it moved horizontally leaving a glowing white tail behind it and then it disappeared.

Than I said It&apos;s going right past this star Right now. Than I said shouting there it is I got it on Camera.  Than said I got it. Than I said I got you on Camera boy.  Than I said hows it going dude. Than I said Yeah. Than I said in a studdering voice it got to be a UFO.  Than I said this is not than shockingly said ohhh a Meatorite just fell down that i wish I wou! ld of got that on camera. After that the camera shuts off after 47 seconds. I caught 27 seconds on film. The 20 seconds was me getting the camera out of zoom and waiting for it to come towards a better light source that big star in the sky. There was a some what alot of shacking in the camera footage while filming. The object was half the size of the star. The Star was 85 percent brighter than the object that was moving fast. The footage was taped at 4:52 AM. Footage is hard to see it but i have good contact lenses and can see good clearly. The Bad News is when I try to send this footage named MOV00025 to my email like I do with all my videos it says when I try to send the Cellphone is reading (Cannot add Video. Message will be to Large.) File Size is only 1.4MB and that should be able to send from my Cellphone to my Email.  The video is stored in my Phone Memory as MP4 just like all my other camera footage. Why is this too large when at 5 Am I am filming another one or the ! same one that is 2.7 MB and that one will send but not worth s! ending.Why is 1.4MB to large to send and 2.7MB is ok to send from Camera phone that don&apos;t make sense I think what I was filming sent me a Virus?  I have a AVS Editor I wanted to use to edit the cellphone camera footage file so I can gett a better view on my Windows XP Computer. The transfer file area does not work with the USB 2.0 plug my Cellphone came with the software for transfer says for windows XP says can&apos;t be added to this computer when uploaded the software my cellphone came with. Sending to Video DJ on Cellphone don&apos;t work  Either. Next try to send it to a memory Card once I order one if that will work.  Well anyways the ufo made no sound and over my head in a 360 direction past the sun over parents house as I was on the front sidewalk and saw it for almost 2 minutes until it was too far to see.  Than at 5 oclock it might of been back again it was about 6 blocks away coming back in the background in my back yard. I was flash the camera light at it trying to communicate with it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I saw a dark triangular craft floating about 60-80 yards away and about 100 feet above the ground.  It was dark and had even darker round type windows, it floated silently and hovered around in an area about 200 feet.  I thought at the time that it was a possible unmanned aerial vehicle since the military lives just the other side of the fence.  However, since I was in the Air Force and worked around UAV&apos;s for 8 years and the fact that they would not be operating UAV&apos;s on or around an active civillian runway, I can only speculate as to what it was.", "lights over providencewhile at the fire water display my friends and i observed 5 lights in the sky 4 in a shape of a diamond with one larger(brighter)light out in front of diamond.  although a clear night  (stars clearly visible)the lights appeared still and hazy or behind clouds but visible. hundreds of people around us were all looking up and pointing to the sky as well  baffled.  what was even stranger was the search lights that were used for a promotion going on in the city would actually hit and reflect brightly off of the object in the sky when it made its rotation .this object was very high in the sky yet was a huge object.my friends and i are still convinced this was no blimp,weather balloon airplane satellite or anything else we have ever seen. after approx 15minutes the lights seemed to dim and fade away  i am stunned if no one else reported seeing this A stranger expressed his daughter claimed to see a ufo as well that night aprox 30 miles from where we were", "Pulsing, shape-shifting UFO in Southern IndianaI live in Southern Indiana, near Louisville, Kentucky.  On Saturday, August 28, 2010, at approximately 6:00 a.m., I observed a very bright, odd-looking  &ldquo;light&rdquo; in the eastern sky near Orion&rsquo;s belt.  It was brighter and larger than anything else in the sky.The light would glow bright and produce a huge halo around itself, then it would dim, in a very slow pulse. The light, when glowing bright, formed elongated spikes of light above and below the main part of the light. I got my binoculars to observe the light closer. With the binoculars, I could see in the center of the light three colored orbs: red, blue, green, positioned in a triangle to each other. In succession, each orb would glow bright, then dim (not flashing).I observed the light until the dawn made it impossible. During the entire time I watched the light it did not move its location in the sky; neither vertical nor horizontal.I attempted to observe the light the next morning at the exact same time and place but it was no longer there.((NUFORC Note:  Sirius is to the left of, and below, Orion.

When I looked at the edge of the thundercloud, I saw a completely black object at least 20,000 ft. up in the atmosphere. The object was so high up that I couldn&apos;t make out any details, only could I make out very general details.  The object moved slowly and smoothly and no engine sound was emitted, of course it was so high up. Although the object was to small to be an airliner, and it was way of course the usual plane route. My house happens to be under a MAJOR plane route and every single day at least 150 planes fly above my house, so I&apos;m quite familiar with planes because I see them so often. I strongly believe that the object WASN&apos;T a bird, because I really doubt they fly so high up, we do have a lot of birds in Puerto Rico anyways! Well before I could get someone to see it for th! emselves or a camera at least, the object dissappeared behind a cloud. What interests me is that the flying object was flying over a highly restricted air zone, here in Ft. Buchanan, only military helicopters and commercial airliners are allowed to fly over the base.  I&apos;d really like that government officials have a better eye out on the sky around here, who knows if the object was a threat?  If it was human, it could have dropped a bomb, don&apos;t you agree?  But I highly doubt it was human anyway, it was moving in a way so smooth, that no other plane I&apos;ve seen has ever flown so gracefully.", "Object may have landed in area that saw similar circumstances 4 years agoFrom approx 9:10 this evening to 9:27pm, 2 other witnesses and I observed an orange orb, low in the north west sky, which descended slowly, (approx. 17 minutes) and disappeared behind a tree line.  Through binoculars, it appeared to be perfectly round and pulsating.  The color would at times deepen to red, than back to orange.  The area where it descended is the same area in which I witnessed similar events 4 years ago.

With the naked eye, you can see it flickering colors of blue, red and yellow-white and it appeared to be standing still.  With the telescope, it appeared to be moving since I could not keep a fixed position on it.  The next day, a video was posted of the object during the day by another bystander.

The evening of Monday, August 9th, I was walking my dog along our regular route, which I have walked for many years. It was approx 10 PM.  I was walking southbound along a small creek.  It was a hot, humid night, clear dark sky, no moon that I could see. To my left, eastward, an object came into view over the treetops.  For a second, I thought it was a full, orange, harvest moon.  It was about the size of a large full moon in the sky and glowed orange. It took me a second to realize that the object was moving, travelling east to west.  I then thought it had to be a meteor. However, this object did not streak or fall, nor did it have a trail. I stood there gaping at it as it passed directly overhead; when it was directly above me the orange glow became an orange &quot;halo&quot; around what i could see was an object with rounded edges.  It appeared to be maybe 3500-4000 up; was completely silent, and travelled somewhat faster than an airplane,  While directly above, the object appeared about &quot;dime size&quot; in the sky.I watched the glowing fireball object as it continued west, until it was just a dot in the sky, and then i couldn&apos;t see it anymore.  The entire event was about 30-40 seconds in duration.  I was completely mind-boggled;  I literally could not believe my eyes.  I did snap a couple pics with my phone camera after it had passed overhead, but the object appears much smaller and further away than it actually was.  I&apos;m not a photographer; didn&apos;t think to use the video camera feature, did not even think to zoom in.I called the local Airport Authority the following day and asked if this could have been a weather balloon, or if anyone else had reported seeing this weird glowing thing in the sky.  I was advised they had no reports; also that it would not have been a weather ballon. I&apos;m completely at a loss as to what it could have been.  Googling since then, i have learned that these &quot;fireball&quot; sightings are common recently!  I can attest that the one i saw was not a &quot;ball&quot; as when it passed directly overtop of me I could see that it was most definitely not lit up or glowing from the bottom.I still can&apos;t quite believe it! I have never seen anything like this!

It is a very small airport that does not handle large aircraft or carrier lines.At roughly 9:45pm CST my wife and I were in our front yard.  We were walking past the front of our house passing south when we saw two odd shapes in the sky, quickly followed by one, then another.My best description is that all four shapes were identical, and looked like fireballs, each of which cast a tail of radiation in its wake that made each object look vaguely like a glove with the fireball at the palm and the fingers (four or five) trailing in the wake (my wife saw something very similar, but not in as much detail).  They were orange-yellow, about the shade of fire you&apos;d see from a campfire.I have no way of gauging their size nor distance from the earth&apos;s surface, except to say that 5 or 6 of them grouped together would have been enough to blot out the moon from our view.We initially saw one of the shapes moving directly overhead, due south.  Then another shape seemed to appear directly overhead (or simply fly into our field of vision), then another.  At around the same time we observed the third shape overhead, we realized there was another such shape further off in the southern sky.All four shapes continued rapidly due south until they disappeared from our sight.  They did not disappear over a horizon, nor were they obstructed by trees or buildings, but rather they seemed to fly straight off into the sky until they became too small to see.We initially thought they may be skydivers, but couldn&apos;t explain the intense fire.  We also thought they might be hot air balloons, but we both concluded they were moving fast enough that we couldn&apos;t hope to catch them in our truck, even if we drove rapidly in a straight line after them.  We heard no sound from them whatsoever.", "Large white craft seen on 1-70W during morning trafficOn Saturday, August 21, 2010, I was driving to Wheeling, WV to attend a wedding.  At around 10:45AM, while approaching Washington, PA on I-70W, a large object in the northern sky caught my attention.  Since there was a bit of traffic and I was driving relatively slowly, I was able to observe the object for approximately 45 seconds. The first instant I saw it, I thought it must have been a very large, low flying jet of some sort, but further observation ruled that out.  The object was long, thin, tapered at each end, with a somewhat thicker section in the middle of the craft. It was a solid white in color and was flying at about 8 inches (visually) above the treeline.  It was at least five inches long at arm&apos;s length from end to end, and maybe about an inch maximum from top to bottom at the thickest part. Again, it appeared to be very large.  I could see that it was definitely gliding toward my general direction at a steady speed.  I could not distinguish the exact! shape of the craft as I was looking at an approaching object dead-on. In my opinion, it was probably a large disk or chevron-shaped craft.  There was no sound and I saw no contrail. It was very startling due to the size and nature of the object.  It was unlike anything I am familiar with seeing in the sky.  I was unable to see where it went after I drove past it.I know for a fact that several other people had the chance to see this object, as there were many vehicles on the road at the time, the object was quite noticeable, and traffic was moving relatively slowly.  I&apos;m extremely curious to see if another witness might read this report and come forward with their own account.  Perhaps someone at a different vantage point was able to get a better view of the shape of the object.", "Me and my friend decided to drive to the top of a hill tonight to see the stars, because it was pretty clear.  The things we saw looked like stars but they were moving rapidly across the sky, much faster than a jet. We watched them until they eventually got dim and disappeared.  We saw them one after another.  Each one was in our vision for about 4 minutes.  The last one we saw eventually slowed down and started to zig zag like crazy.  They were all going north to south or south to north.One other interesting thing was the airplanes that were out. They were constantly going back and forth across the sky. They had one bright red light on the left side that was constant, and a strange pattern of white lights blinking.

Then it got smaller, smaller, smaller, and finally disappeared.  It came back, bright as it was before and it started moving in odd motions to distinguish it from a shooting star.

It stayed in the vicinity of the moon and Jupiter for about 20 minutes and I finally went inside. With binoculars, you got the sense that whatever it was, it was trying to get attention, as anyone scanning the sky with equipment at that time could not have missed it.

When I was getting bored of watching, something finally caught my eye.  I thought, &ldquo;a meteor!&ldquo;, but another thought popped into my head; this meteor wasn&rsquo;t moving. After about 10 minutes of watching this orb of light it quickly moved down and to the left, on slightly but it moved nonetheless. The orb left a small trial, like a jet, but it disappeared within 20 seconds or so. Then 5 minutes or so afterwards, it again shifted; up and to the left. Again it left a tail and it&rsquo;s tail vanished.The orb was a white color with an ever so slight hint of blue.I attempted to photograph this phenomenon but it would not show up on my camera (Kodak EasyShare P712) it did though show in a few pictures but with much movement of my hands I couldn&rsquo;t get a clear shot.I am unsure of  what I saw, I know that that light was not there on an ordinary night, and I also had the thought that it could be a star, but stars don&rsquo;t move (well not that fast anyway)!

I had not been drinking on the night of the sighting.I was at my home in Slidell, Louisiana, on the night of December 31, 2009 when the sighting occured.  I went outside on my back deck at approximately 9:00 P.M. to observe the New years Eve fireworks going off in my neighborhood.  I happened to look straight up and saw what I thought at first to be some unusual fireworks.  In a few seconds however, I realized I was looking at two strange aircraft which were way too high up to be fireworks.  I saw two identical, perfectly spherical, internally lighted, translucent globes which were predominantly pink in color with uneven pastel blue and gray bands around the globe.  They were not brightly lit, nor did they have any other visible lights on them such as navigation lights, but they were easily visible in the night sky.  They had no visible windows or openings that I could see.They were each about the size of a small house and were at an altitude of about 1,000 to 1,200 feet, and were moving from the Northeast to the Southwest in the general direction of New Orleans across Lake Pontchartrain.  They were flying on a perfectly parallel course at a distance of about an eigth of a mile from one another at exactly the same speed, which appeared to be about 50 t0 60 miles per hour.  One was slightly ahead of the other.  They eventually disappeared into some low hanging clouds a mile or so from where I was standing.  In all, I viewed them for about three minutes, and never heard a sound from them. The most unusual and distinctive features of the craft were the flange-like collars they had around the bottoms of the globes. From these collars were coming flames which looked like regular fire, not a rocket flame.  These flames did not appear to be any kind of a propulsion system because the flames were deflected backwards by the wind created by the speed of the objects moving through the air on a perpendicular course to the bottom of the globes.  When they first passed over me, I was able to look straight up into the burning cavity created by the collar on the bottom of the globe and it reminded me of what looking into an upside down burning can of Sterno might look like. These craft looked like they could have been man-made objects, but no man-made objects with these attributes could possibly fly in the way that these did. I&apos;ve never seen anything like these craft before or since this sighting so I have to classify them as being unidentified flying objects.", "I seen a blunt horizontal oval light streak through the sky then lifting up while in flight and turning red then blue and disappearingTo begin with, my mother, my girlfriend, my nephew, and i were all in my mothers car on the way home from a house warming party. I myself in the driver seat while my mother riding up front, sat in the passenger seat.  When the sighting occurred my mother and I were the only ones who were able to witness it because my girlfriend and my nephew sat in the back seat, meanwhile my nephew was sound asleep.Next, we seen a streak of light above us, similar to a shooting star.  First it appeared to be a shooting star, then in astonishment, it appeared to be in a horizontal oval, it didn&apos;t just shoot through the sky fading from sight.  At the sight of this abnormal object it seemed to be traveling in the same direction we were headed, but to my suprises not as slow as an airplane or helicopter, and at first not as fast as a shooting star.  Yet it seemed to be going at an acceptionally fast speed.  It also didn&apos;t have any sound, in reference to any airplane or jet.  Which a jet would have been a good explanation except the fact that a jet doesn&apos;t fly silently.In addition, this object in the sky didn&apos;t appear to be flying at a high altitude.  In fact it seemed pretty low as if it were a helicopter trying to find someone or something.  At first it was just a stream of light then it came lower then it was, not by much but still a little lower.  Then it suddenly picked up speed and the aluminescence grew into a stream of light trailing a ball of light.  Then it seemed to reach a higher area in the sky and at this moment it changed colors immediately from white, to red, then instantly blue and within a fraction of a second it was gone.  It almost seemed to have maybe gone behind a thick cloud, due to the weather we&apos;ve been having.  Then my mother and I realized, there wasn&apos;t any clouds in the immediate area of the night sky.Ultimately, the sight was both shocking and surprising, given it all occured within the most two seconds, or less.  I confidentally believe what I witnessed wasn&apos;t anything in our United States technological capabilities, unless it was an SR-71 Blackbird in central Floridas air space.  It&apos;s one of the only flying objects to my knowledge that would fly close to the speed, without sound, and disappear from sight instantaniously with little conflict, compared to what I witnessed.  Besides the SR-71 doesn&apos;t hit an immediate &quot;warp speed&quot; and aluminate in red then blue and disappear.  I know it sounds tampered with but the object had a blunt oval shape to my sight, possibly due to the engle of visual but to my knowledge it was practicaly oval.", "looking North we saw a triangle shaped object in the sky, rapidly changing colors from blue, red, green and white, almost looked like it was spinning, at first thought it was some aircraft, but I have never seen a plane that big and bright before.

(would be bright then go out)...then return to its position. the person sitting next to me witnessed the same movement for verification. another coincidental weird factor was the thunder lightening and showers that followed twenty minutes later. the skies were crystal clear ...the storm rolled in ...thundered and lightening ...rained then went away like nothing ever happened. i think the storm might be a coincidence just due to the fact that the entire sighting was so overwhelming? but we saw an orange ball of light. we saw our first Unidentified Flying Object.the next day there was a millitary huey helicopter that flew around for a couple hours as well. again that could have been a coincidence...but i think the nearest military helo pad is about an hour away?", "Orange-yellow light at high altitude in Detroit area. Apprx. one minute to traverse the sky.On Saturday evening 8/7/2010 at 2135 hours, my friend and were seated on an outdoor patio in the Detroit area and witnessed an object of indeterminate shape rising from the SW or SSW treeline. The object was a very bright orange-yellow and I at first thought it might have been an aircraft with its landing lights on.  Its magnitude was far brighter than Sirius.  It is difficult to gauge the size of the object but I would estimate it as subtending half the angle as does a light plane at very high altitude. From our vantage point, looking in a NNW direction, the object was at about 45 degrees from the horizon. We heard no sound, saw no trail and watched it trace an arc for about one minute before it dipped below the trees in the NE or NNE. It appeared to have maintained the same level of brightness throughout its trajectory, ruling out any &quot;landing lights&quot;.   At the time I speculated that it could have been a space vehicle during re-entry.  The object seemed far to! o bright to have been reflecting sunlight and the time was 50 minutes past sunset.I called Selfridge ANG base and spoke with a colonel in the Air Museum but he could provide no information; they had no reports of a sighting. I checked the Space Shuttle schedule and ruled out that possibility.  I then contacted our local TV stations and had the same result.  I spoke with our TV weatherman, who seemed very interested but he also had no reports of any such phenomenon.  He checked on the wind direction for the time of the object&apos;s transit but the high altitude winds were in a direction almost opposite that which would account for a weather balloon as an explanation.", "Two bright lights in sky that almost hit then turned and went in various directions at high rate of speed.At about 8:30 Thus 8/26/10 my wife and I witnessed two bright white lights.  One was coming from the south toward the road we were traveling on.  The other came from the north. Initally I thought it was two planes and I told my wife that they are going fast toward one another and they were going to hit. They came very close in front of us down the road (up in the sky) and almost hit...then the one that came from the north turned and headed due west at a high rate of speed.  The other light stopped and turned and headed south at a high rate of speed.  The lights were circular a bright blue/white twice the size of a planet in the night sky.  I know these were not planes or helicopters.", "MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP REPORT: Observed on west side of Blue Springs, MO - Sitting outside facing west watching the night sky, noted a single light appear traveling from my south moving NE, approximately 70 degrees to the horizon. Initially thought it was a satellite (have seen many and usually follow them across the night sky) as this was a small, dim blueish-white light. Object was moving very fast in a straight line with no deviation (direction of downtown Kansas City, MO), however it seemed to move faster than most satellites I have seen. No sound heard. Light then slowly turned red for 1-2 seconds (slower than a strobe light/anti-collision light on aircraft) and then back to blueish-white. This occured 3 more times before object became too difficult to see (distance and city lights in the distance). Light appeared to dissapear twice, as if passing through or above clouds (skies were clear from what I could tell, may have been very thin, high cloud! s in the area). Possible sources could have been satellite (was very similar in color, size, and altitude but this was traveling faster and I have never seen them emit red light), meteor (no tail, trailing light, or change in intensity), or military aircraft/fighter (have seen these before with a single, fast blinking red light, but to the best of my knowledge these do not emit a dim blueish-white light when moving away from viewing position).

Flashing lights synchronized back and forth in a horizontal plane.  I snapped a few photos on my iPhone.", "never seen anything like it.i was drivivg home and alittle befor i tuned in the driveway i looked down the street mybe 100 yards down the road was this ovel silver looking thing.i thought it was a birthday balloon that the win blow on its side.it was like it was stuck in the air.think it was bout 7 feet off the ground and just as i tuned in it started flashing purple and white light and moving from side to side then it went straght up but not fast.i jumped out the car and ran inside.i told my wife and her step dad to come look quick.we stepped outside just as it came over the trees.it was flashing briter and spinning.then it just went traight up and was gone.", "multiple fireballs in sky over long islandat 10pm eastern standard time on august 21 i saw a orange ball of fire. at first i thought it was a plane on fire but it made no sound after about two minutes it seemed to fade out or burn out. then i saw another from the same direction about 500 feet apart. i saw six to ten of them before i called my upstairs neighbor also my mother in law to come see. she came to the window and witnessed one after the other for about 25 minutes. we both couldn&apos;t explain what we saw but it weirded both of us out greatly. tried to take video on my phone but wasn&apos;t sure why it didn&apos;t come out. they all came from the same direction and faded out at approximately the same place.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))", "Very bright flashing in a pattern of red, white, green, but mostly bright light.Watching from patio due west and another north west.  Not moving - just flashing very brightly then dimming then brightly.  We are star gazers almost every night(also worked for an airline and know a plane when we see one), but this is unlike anything we have ever seen in the sky.  It&apos;s been 45 minutes and they are both there. Very strange indeed.", "Long steal pipe shaped object with No Wings, a dark outline and bright interior floating at low altitude.On a short break, watching some birds flying overhead and an object caught my attention.  I watched this object pass through some small light clouds as it floated slowly in a Easterly direction.First words out of my mouth were....what the....there&apos;s NO WINGS!!  I repeated this several times.This object was very long compared to its thickness (Long Tube), another thought for describing would be a (Long steal pipe).There was only one cloud above and to the East that had a high bank that tappered off.  The object slowly entered into the cloud at a slow speed and was covered up.I stood for a while longer looking all around this cloud waiting for it to exit, as I headed back to my job slowly, and with my eyes on the cloud...absolutely nothing came out of the cloud.I have thought of all other possibilities as to what it could have been..... The only things that are most outstanding is that it was very long for its thickness and with no contours to the body.  The other outstanding thing is that it did not have wings.There was a dark outline around the object, and with a (best description) white/shiny interior, the end were exactly the same (rounded), and there was no glare off the object from the sun in the West.I cant get this out of my mind....its time I report this!  The clouds were not that high up, a large plane at that height and speed would be too slow for long distance travel, and not to mention the shape would be of a plane clearly!  When I think of the cloud bank and the length of the object, the object could easily have covered at least 3 quarters of the clouds thickness (bank)!  With the sun shining from the West would why would one see a dark outline all around the object?   I really hope someone else in Dryden had seen this that day besides myself!", "Flash of light made me look up to see a dark craft with three lights hovering above me.I was on a Boy Scout trip when I saw the UFO. We made camp at Camp Crooked Creek, located near Ft. Knox. When the rest of the troop went to bed, I stayed up and made a fire, along with a fellow Scout. At around midnight when the fire had died down to embers is when we saw the UFO.I remember everything around me flashed in a blue light, exactly the same flash a camera would make (the same amount of time too). Both of us exclaimed &quot;whoa,&quot; because it was not only shocking but appeared to come from above us. We both instinctively looked up. About 250-300 yards above me, I made out three dim lights ( in a triangular position). I could barely make out the dark outline of an aircraft, it appeared to be in the shape of a triangle as well. If it didn&apos;t have lights on the bottom, i don&apos;t think I would have been able to see it.It was not moving, it just hovered above us. About 5 seconds went by, and then it shot across the sky towards the horizon. It looked just like a shooting star, with the trailing light following behind it. I remember expecting to hear a huge roar of an engine, but it made no sound at all.My immediate reaction was that it had to have been a fighter jet, because we were so close to Ft. Knox. But, I quickly ruled that out, because, what explains the flash?  The flash was targeted right at us. The whole place didn&apos;t flash, just the small area around myself and my friend. Also, what plane can hover like that? A Harrier Jet can hover, but this object was only 250-300 yards directly above us and made no noise. Also, there is no plane that can move that fast. It had gone past the horizon in a fraction of a second without making any noise. That&apos;s what convinced me that this was no plane, missile, or anything man made. We woke a few of the older Scouts and told them what happened, but no one took us seriously, as has been the case whenever I bring up the story.I know what I saw, and the fact that someone else was with me, and was able to recount exactly the same thing I saw, makes me truly believe that we encountered a UFO. Why didn&apos;t I go to the media if I was so sure? Because I knew there was no way of proving it, and this culture seems to dismiss anyone who believes in UFO&apos;s. But, I needed to get this off my chest. If you need any more details or have questions please fill free to contact me. Thank you."]
