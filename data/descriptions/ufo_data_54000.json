["Thought I was seeing a aircraft flying towards me from south to west as  I could see 2 lights that I took for wing tip lights. I watch for a couple of minutes and noticed that it was not moving. I watch a short time until I went to retrieve my camera and upon returning within a few minutes it began to seem to  become more defined and cigar shape with what seemed to be a small trail. I took several pictures but the object was at a great distance it appeared. The sun was just breaking the horizon and all stars had disappeared but you could still plainly see this object and I live in downtown so the street lights  block out quite a bit but this seemed to shine silver and I looked  through bonoculars about this time and it seemed to emmit light from the center and expand and contract. I when inside for a minute and came out to see if I could still locate it but it had disappeared. I just walked outside to see if I possible would see it again and I believe I am seeing it again this mornng but more to the south west but still at a 10 oclock angle.I will try to get a better picture or dvd. Could it be the shuttle or space station?((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We have witnessed this light four times together and once I witnessed it myself. The light usually flys in a straight line and then vanishes in mid flight. Thelast night I witnessed it I actaully saw it change direction and fly straigh up futher into the sky as a plain approached it. We did happen to get video of it on our camera on one of the nights. The lights did not flash nor did it have any flashing lights with it, it also made no sound what so ever and from the looks of it the light flew lower than most of the planes that fly overhead.", "at around 21:41 this evening i witnessed a bright green sphere object travelling in a southerly direction, it was travelling very fast and made no sound, at first i thought it could of been sum meteor but its illuminous green colour was unlike any thing i had seen before, i am only reporting this as i hope i&apos;m not the only one to of seen it.", "Bright dull lights over treelineAt approximately 11:00pm, in West Pittsfield I was letting my dog outside to go to the bathroom before I went to bed.  I noticed strange flashing lights on the horizon in the west, north and north western part of my tree line.  They were a dull yellow and lit up the whole tree line when they flashed. Almost reminiscent of what distant lightning looks like, however,  I should note that no thunderclap was ever heard after these flashes.  There was about a 10 second interval between the largest flashes and perhaps 3-5 seconds between the smaller ones. The flashing alternated in the following pattern: West, Northwest, North. I should also note that I have seen these flashes in the past.  In the summer of 2003, I noticed the same pattern of flashes in the same quadrants of my back field.  I alerted my father to this strange phenomenon. My father who is a doctor was also perplexed by these lights.  He at first dismissed them as distant lightning, and I implored him to stay longer and watch and observe that there was no thunderclap.  He stayed longer and agreed that it was strange that there was no thunder associated with these bright displays of lights, he also agreed that the timing was almost exactly 10 seconds between large bursts of light on the treeline.  I was fortunate enough to have my digital camera in which I took some low-grade videos of the event.  The video is not very good yet shows a decent example of what the lights looked like.  When the lights flashed, it was brightest on the western quadrant of my field.  It appeared as if the lights were flashing at a distance of perhaps 10-15 miles away.  When flashing occurred on the brightest of flashes (every 10 seconds) it was possible to see cloud formations above the light flash (an obvious indication of the brightness of the light).", "Large white cylinder UFO around passenger jetI was sitting on the deck in the morning when I noticed a jet with contrails. Then I noticed another object with no contrail very close to the jet which was about 3 times the size of the jet or more. As they moved to the west, the larger cylinder shaped object moved way ahead of the jet until my husband and I lost track of both. We got the binoculars out and were able to see the cylinder shaped UFO very clearly.It was long and skinny and white colored. It had something in the middle of it, like spokes sticking out or something sticking out. The UFO started out on the other side of the jet going at first the same speed as the jet but then it went a lot faster and kept putting more distance between it and the jet.The UFO disappeared while we could still see the jet and contrails in the distance.We were astounded and excited when we saw it and, of course, very curious.The UFO was too far away and moving too quickly and getting even further away to take any pictures or a video. I wish we could have because it was so clear through the binoculars, it was not blurry in any way.The day was perfectly clear, no clouds but there were winds.Seen 10:15 am on May 16, Saturday, for about 8 minutes.", "A multi-titled, multi-colored possibly foursided pyramid seen before I entered 2nd grade, brother saw same thing years later.My parents still tell a story about how when I was about to start 2nd grade during our family prayers I jumped up crying and hid in the closet in the room that me and my sister shared.  I told them that I was afraid to go to 2nd grade when in fact I was scared of what I had just seen out my window.  My bed was right next a large, nearly full wall window that faced our backyard in the room that I shared with my older sister.  My parents sat on the floor and my sister was in her bed and I was in mine. I remember being bored, per usual, and staring out the window when this...pyramid I suppose floated casually past the window.  It wasn&apos;t like any of the pyramid&apos;s I&apos;ve looked up online.  I guess those are like black triangles with lights on their corners?  This was covered in little metallic/chrome-ish rectangles that were either silver or lighting up different colors.  I remember pinks and yellows and blues so nearly primary colors, but you could tell they were still metallic silver underneath.  It was weird and seemed to lazily float past.  It didn&apos;t seem to be propelled by anything and didn&apos;t seem to be in any sort of hurry. Ok and I get it, I was little could have just been my mind messing with me and I can&apos;t remember if it was four sided (feel like it was) or three because I only saw it in profile and in my memory it looks like it floated right between my house and the gazebo on our deck which is only about 25 feet or so, so there are clearly some missing pieces.  Also I remember it was completely silent. The thing that has finally brought this up in my mind again after 15 years is that my brother is a sophomore in college now and lives in my house here and we were talking about random weird stuff that happened in our old house (which was a lot...I don&rsquo;t know if that relates either) when he told me that when he&apos;d been in about 2nd grade he&apos;d been woken up two nights in a row by multi colored lights outside his window on the 2nd story but facing the street not the yard. He said he didn&apos;t see any object making them the 1st night because it&apos;d been so bright but that the 2nd he&apos;d seen a pyramid type object. I&apos;d never told anyone about what I&apos;d seen and neither had he till we had this conversation.  Now we just want to know if there&rsquo;s anyone else who possibly has seen something like this because after looking it up forever and all over the internet I can&rsquo;t find anything.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Coachella Valley over Santa Rosa Mountains.On June 19, 2009, in Bermuda Dunes, CA 92203, a ufo was sited at ~75 degrees in angle vertically facing SouthWest. I was looking at the landscaping of the backyard with my brother, sitting on a patio chair facing South. There was very little moonlight and the stars were very clear and beautiful. All of a sudden, in my peripheral, I saw a bright light up to the upper-right of my eyes. I looked and it was very fireball looking like the brightest star in the sky which I knew I hadn&rsquo;t seen before as I had been star gazing for about 30 minutes. The light was circular and dimmed out very quickly as it moved in an upward/southern/away motion on an xyz plane and looked as if it was moving slower and slower as it finally, slowly went out of sight. This lasted ~15 seconds. I had seen 2 other very same instances of the very same way which one happened in the very same place (at my new home and in the same area). The other instace was ~3years ago, only this one looked like a satellite moving across the sky from north to south and I was looking Eastward.

It rotated 3 seconds until it finally seemed to be facing directly at me. I called my friend to look which was running from the patio which was about 50 feet away, and right away (coincidentally as if it heard me, just like when I called my other friend to look at the most recent siting), the object went in the same motion only moved SouthEast; then was as dim as original brightness.

I became startled, turned down the radio, and forcefully tapped my friend on the shoulder to get his attention.His first words were &quot;What the hell is that?&quot;  Unlike me, he instantly came to the conclusion that this object was not a helicopter.I was still driving when I noticed the break in the trees was beginning to close. I pulled over on to country club road and parked my car. Because we were playing an &quot;assassin&quot; game, I had binoculars in my car.

I then stepped outside and looked up at the night sky. I noticed a bright light about the size of a plane but a little bigger. I though it was weird there were no lights on it flashing to distinguish it was a plane. My first reaction was that it was a satellite or a space shuttle since they are repairing the Hubble Telescope. I rushed to the garage to get my mom to try and show what I was seeing. I was keeping an eye on the object the whole time as to not lose it. I then noticed that it started to go from side across the sky like a plane would, then it started to go straight up and stay in a spot in the sky and started to flash. Two other points in the sky that were to the lower left of it started to flash and move side to side. The main light was in the same spot but moved up and down and kept flashing. We both went back into the garage and started to sort some things out and move things around. About 5 minutes elapsed and we went back out and to my surprise they were still there in the sky flashing and moving a little bit, and then they all vanished one after another. All 3 lights disappeared. Keep in mind that planes are flying around in the sky due to the fact I live a few towns away from a major airport. They moved way to fast for a plane and too slow to be a satellite or a space shuttle. I have seen the space shuttle in the sky while in orbit and that moved very fast.

Perhaps, I am wrong and the aircraft was very far away and merely looked like it was in the fireworks but that still does not explain its unusual appearance and its abrupt disappearance.I don&rsquo;t know if anyone else saw it, but someone else should have because there were tons and I mean tons of people out on the waterfront on both the Philly and Camden sides.", "brightness, changing shape, light traili woke in the night, went out side to smoke a cig, and drink coffee. it was above the trees a few miles away. brighter than any star. it hoovered then changed shape and went away. with a light trail behind.

During the summer of 1993 I was attending night school so I could pass the 11th grade. I had just been at a friends house and was driving to night school. It was night and I was day dreaming as I was driving. I happened to look up and see a plane coming from my right hand side in the trees or low to the trees, or what I thought was a plane. You know the typical red and green lights on the wings. The area is rather woodsy but some what populated and is a well traveled road. As I approached the Y intersection which I was going to take a left on I continued to see the lights. At this moment I thought to myself &quot;wow this plane is flying very low&quot;. In the exact moment I was in the Y intersection I looked up through my windshield to see why this plane was flying so low. But to my surprise which then turned into a horror it was no plane.Description: Diamond shaped craft. One red light and one green light, at opposites ends of the diamond. A visible line through the diamond (from the small part of the diamond). The size was small and probably as big as a semi truck without its trailer (50-75 feet) max and maybe even smaller. Height above the trees, probably no more than 20-40 feet. Approximate tree height was about 30-50 feet. The color was black and when I say black I mean blacker than the night sky which appeared bright compared to the diamond shaped object. The skin of texture of the object looked like the underside of bark when the little worms dig their little trails but more squared off. It had very sharp corners and the thickness of the aircraft was approximately 10 feet.The moment I acquired the object with my eyes I stepped on the gas. As I was taking a left and the aircraft was coming from my right as I had looked up seen the object and then continued to make the turn. At this moment I was very upset and scared, panicked. So I sped up as fast as I could safely drive and then realized that the object was pacing me but moving away at the same time. Because of the trees and such I could not see the object as I had in the intersection but I could see the lights dimming as I drove down the road. At the next moment I thought that there should be other cars as I was very close to the highway and a second later I saw a car approaching and then the object was to far away to see and it was gone. I was overall visibly shaken from the shock of seeing such an object and the fact that our paths crossed exactly the same time in an intersection. I continued on my way to night school.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We bothed looked at eachother, and were like, &quot;did you just see that?&quot;  We debated on what it could have been.  I began to explain that I had seen something similar two times before.

I have also been a member of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada. I am quite familiar with observing various aircraft at various altitudes, meteors, fireballs, as well as tiny polar orbital satellites.Last night, Wednesday 13th of May 2009, at around 10:30pm I was observing the stars out of my home&apos;s side window looking toward the north west and I saw a very unusual event. My home is situated in Orleans Ontario, a suburb of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.One of the &ldquo;stars&rdquo; I was looking toward became a stationary, relatively bright white light with a ring around it. It then began moving laterally from left to right, maintaining the same brightness and ring.  Then it quickly &apos;faded out&apos;.  When I timed it out later, the whole event probably lasted no more than eight seconds. It demonstrated to me that to see something like this, you had to be in the right place, at the right time, looking toward the right direction. I&apos;m reporting it here (as a UFO) because of the following reasons...If it was a natural phenomenon: it was most likely a meteor that was traveling toward me. That would explain the short duration of brightness, and the slight travel from left to right before fading out. Some haze in the sky would explain the ring around it. But why did it become very bright and remain stationary in the sky at first? And if pieces breaking off it made it change direction while it was coming down, why did it move horizontally, but not downward if it was under the influence of gravity?  If it was an aircraft: it was most likely the landing lights facing me. Once again haze would explain the ring around the central bright white light. But the white was not a &apos;tungsten&apos; white, it was a pure white light. The brightening of the light and fading of the light is explainable if a rotation of an aircraft toward or away from me occurs, but how could it move laterally from left to right while maintaining the landing lights toward me. (Landing lights shine out ahead of the nose of an aircraft for the pilots to light ahead in the direction of their travel, not out from the aircraft body toward the tips of the wings).I had continued looking for a long time after its disappearance to see if any aircraft  navigational lights appeared moving along the extended path of the original white light, to no avail.Following the event I began double checking my observation by going through a mental process of critical thinking (which is stated in summary above).But as I was witnessing it in real time, I was struck with awe, or shock, and an sense that this was perhaps something that was neither man-made nor a phenomenon of nature.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I turned and fixed my camera on the light, it appeared to be oval but the light made it hard to make out the exact shape and it lasted long enough for me to take 4 pictures with the shutter lasting about 10 &ndash; 15 seconds and then the light went off with no flashing lights at all and my eyes unable to adjust to the light I lost track of the object. I have 3 pictures of the light and 1 picture just as it went off.  I am trying to see if I can filter out and see the object just after the light went out.  No plane I know especially that low and size turns off all its lights.  There was no sound that I could hear.  The craft was moving slower than many other crafts that normally fly in this area but over the last 5 years this is only the second craft to be this low and close to my home, the other was a P3 and loud with flashing lights and two head lights.

I thought this was a shooting star or something. Then another bright starlike light shone to just the east of it, but this one started shooting around wildly like a binball machine, erratic and quickly with no discernable pattern and at extreme angles, but completely unlike a plane possibly could, within about a 5 in radius (from my perspective).Then this light headed southward at a more steady pace, and as it went I could see several lights blinking quickly in different colors - red, white, blue, green - but these lights blinked randomly and all around a two inch-long object that I could just vaguely see (It seemed very high up). At one point they almost seemed to light up rapidly in a &apos;band&apos; across the width of the object. It looked slightly grey against the deep blue sky, and it appeared to have an elongated point at it&apos;s head and possibly two shorter points at its end with a concave bottom - possibly chevron shaped (it may have had more points to it, but it was very unclear). All the blinking lights were no bigger than most of the stars around the sky.As it headed south overhead it traveled about the speed of a plane way high up, but it kept blinking these colored lights in a random effect all over the face of it. Then smaller white lights began shooting away from it one &amp; two at a time in all directions, going away up to about 5-6 inches. It still had a main white light, brighter than the rest, which continued to blink at erratic but consistent intervals. We watched it do this until it was very far south, to the distant tree line.

I could see two red lights on the back end. The craft was right over the median grass strip of the highway, moving East to West, very slowly.

However, it became apparent after a few seconds that this was no firework even though it had the glowing color of a yellow/orange fire because it was moving way too slowly. The movement from our vantage point first moved from right to left fairly slowly which seemed like it could have been an airplane. However, after about 30 seconds of this right to left slow movement the object was still for about 10 to 15 seconds. Then the object moved very little from left to right for a short time of around 10 seconds. Immediately thereafter, the movement started going down towards the earth in a straight line. This downward movement lasted about 15 to 20 seconds as the fire type light started to fade away in intensity. After the full downward movement of 20 seconds or so the light did indeed fade into darkness.From my observation the best explanation I could come up with is the fire light might have been possibly an airplane which was engulfed in flames or perhaps an erratic moving missile which seems more unlikely.

On one particular night, as I watched for the International Space Station to go over, I noticed a flash of light near the cup on the Big Dipper.  This flash caught my attention even though it was not in the area I was looking directly at.  I turned my attention to that area of the sky, and approximately 10 seconds later I saw another flash.  I continued to watch and about 10 seconds later saw a flash about the same distance from the second flash as the two &quot;cup&quot; stars (away from the handle) are apart from each other.  The flash was the same as a strobe light on an aircraft, but about 5 times brighter.   Where a strobe on an aircraft flashes about every two to three seconds, these were a good 10 seconds apart, and were not in a straight line.   About 10 minutes later I was looking at the constellation Cassiopeia and noticed the same flash just under the constellation, with another flash about 10 seconds later about the same distance apart as the second and third one near the Big Dipper.  A bit later I was looking to the east, and noticed a flash only about 10 or 15 degrees above the horizon, which was a bit brighter than the others.  All these flashes were extremely short duration, as in an aircraft strobe light, but much farther apart and not in a straight line, and appeared to be at very high altitude, or in space.  As I watched the sky over the next two weeks I saw the same type of flash on every second or third night.I thought that it may be meteorites coming straight at me but thought about it and ruled that out as that would probably be a rarity indeed.On one night I did see what appeared to be a satellite, moving in a straight line getting gradually brighter, and then fading out, southbound over Washington and Oregon states.  On one particular night I saw what appeared identical to the Space Station (very bright), but it was moving southbound over Montana and was visible 30 minutes before the Space Station was to appear from the west.  I waited the 30 minutes and saw the Space Station when it was predicted to come over from west to east.On this past Monday night (6/8/09) I went out to the back yard in Spirit Lake, Idaho (just north of Coeurd&rsquo;Alene) about 10:30 PM and was looking at the sky.  I thought I saw a flash just under the Big Dipper, but wasn&rsquo;t sure because I wasn&rsquo;t looking exactly at that part of the sky again, so I turned my attention to that section of the sky and sure enough about ten seconds later saw the same bright flash as I had seen almost a year ago.  I saw three flashes that formed a triangle near the cup of the Dipper.  These flashes were not spread over an area, as if being generated by a large light source, say for example the Aurora Borealis, but were from a PINPOINT in the sky.  It would be as if a person was in the sky with an extremely bright flashlight and pointed it at me and turned it on and then off within a tenth of a second, or less.These lights did not form any logical trajectory but seemed to be random.  I have a feeling that if I were to go out again over the next ten or 12 nights I would see them again every second or third night, or possibly every night if I continued to look for two or three hours.  I have seen satellites go over so I know what they look like.  Obviously I know what aircraft look like at night.  Maybe there is a military operation going on and they set their strobe for every ten seconds, or so, to keep track of each other, which would explain the non-straight line flashes.  But with the use of radar I would think this would not be necessary, unless it is some type of stealth aircraft.   I am 51 years old and being a pilot I like to look to the sky (I am interested in Astronomy also) and have never seen this type of thing until the summer of 2008, which makes a person wonder why these sightings started to manifest themselves to me, as if there is something going on that had not occurred in my past years.  There are more satellites and space junk up there than ever before, but that doesn&rsquo;t seem to answer the question as to why the flashes would be relatively close to one another in both position and time.", "might just be staron june 12 around 9:30 pm daytona beach florida   bead sized light,no sound,changed from red blue white and yellow,no visable ring might just be a bright star  i saw it from my deck on a clear cloudless night might have moved but mainly still((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

This sighting included my parents, my older brother Bob and myself, I was only 2 &frac12; and I do not recall anything.   My dad and mom have different stories, so I will tell this like it was told to me.It was about 9 PM and we had just left my grandmother&rsquo;s about 5 miles from our home.It is about a 20 minute drive.  Dad had the habit of driving up to S Commercial Street about 2 miles from grandmothers and he and mom  go by and would watch the Color TV in the TV shop before coming home, which they did occasionally and stayed about 15 minutes and then drive home.  This was a very sparsely populated, undeveloped area of town.Dad said, &quot;The UFO  showed up out of no where and it was cigar shaped, it was silver colored and had red lighted round windows and he could see figures moving around inside but did not see any people.&quot;  Then, he said if he slowed down, it would slow down and if he sped up, it would also speed up.  It did not make a sound.  He said it paced him on his drive home. That&rsquo;s where dad&rsquo;s memory ends.Then mom said, &quot;No, it was on Market Street NE, this would be between 10-12 miles distance from dad&rsquo;s sighting, we were heading down Market near Swegle Grade School and Birchwood Drive about 6 blocks from home and all the sudden the UFO appeared and it was near the &quot;goose house.&quot;  This was a house where they raised geese and had a very distinctive odor.  I said, &quot;Did you get out of the car?&quot;  And she said, &quot;Yes,&quot; and dad said, &quot;No,&quot; in an almost terrorized voice,  mom said &ldquo; yes we did and we watched it go over and it almost hit the roof on the goose house.Then mom said she did not recall anything more till they were turning in the driveway at home.  Dad went in and called the local airport and was told that &ldquo; we are closed &ldquo; but he talked to the man anyway telling him what happened, and  the agent said they had also seen it and it went over so fast and without a sound and there was nothing around that could track it or follow it. Note: the airport closed at 11 PM, 2 hours after they left grandma&apos;s house.It was shortly after that time that I begin to react to low sound and vibration.  My family tells me that I would hear a train go by or vacuum running or even water going down a drain and I would cover my ears and scream. My aunt recalls that I would be playing and then all the sudden become stock still and then slowly turn my head as if I were tracking a sound that only I could hear.  I am not sure what happened that night, but I do know that when I was old enough to recall things, between 6-11 years of age, we would pass a building on the way to my grandmothers and I would sit on the floor of the car,put my back firmly against the locked car door and bite my arm to keep from screaming from pure terror. In later years I went back and looked at the building, still there and it was/is a car parts store with radiator hoses etc&hellip; looking in the windows at night it was dimly lit with curved archways over long dark hallways with lots of dangling tubes hanging down  could this have triggered a memory from that night?  As I said, I do not have any conscious memories of the event Mom has two deep red marks about the size of a small pea about &frac12;&rdquo; above and below her naval and she has deep dimples from scoop marks on front of both upper thighs and  she has 6 small brown smooth on the skin dots about the size of match heads on her back, forming two separate triangles which one over the other form one diamond and they have been there since that night.  She said the craft almost hit one of the houses as it was so low, it was cigar shaped and had portals and no visible form of engine, fire, etc, but the portals had light behind them.It paced their car, speeding up when he did and slowing down when he did.  We pieced together there was about a 2 hour missing time for this event.  Dad said it was in one area of Salem, and mom saw it in another, about 10+ miles different in location.  Mom said they stopped the car and got out and looked at it, dad said, noticeably scared, NO WE DID NOT and he would not talk about it any more, he died shortly after that.Mom always wondered about this one and still brings it up from time to time. She is now 83  None of her body marks were there before that night.My brother has no recall of that evening at all, he was about 5 years old.He still lives in Oregon as well. Since he has no memory of the incident it did not make much of an impact in his life, as far as we can tell.Dad was about 24 years old. Worked in a cannery as well as sold real estate.dad was always open minded, but I have to say he did not like talking about this event. Mom was 25 and was home during the day, with my brother and myself to take care of she has always wondered what happened that night and even at her current age of 83 she still has questions and wonders about the marks((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Then, it split into three separate lights, all of red, doing manuevers that airplanes aren&apos;t capable of. They all appeared to be breaking the sound barrier.

Over the last couple weeks I&apos;ve continued to notice multiple balls of lights rising in the Eastern horizon,the lights seem to be rising out of the Bull Run Battlefield in the Direction of Washington DC. These multiple lights will slowly rise than after a few minutes they would have risen so high you could know longer see them. I figured they were airplanes and since I couldn&apos;t get a closer look I wasn&apos;t convinced these lights were anything unusual and certainly not paranormal. That all changed last night when I was finally able to get a closer look at these amazing lights.My wife and I decided to take a walk since the temperature had cooled from the heat earlier in the day. Just as we got to the top of our neighborhood(an area that is very dark and gives you a excellent 360 degree view of the night time sky)we noticed a very bright amber light rising from the NE Horizon. The light raised straight up, I would estimate approximately 5,000 feet. When the light raised to the estimated 5,000 feet it stopped and remained stationary for several minutes.  The light then started drifting slowly towards the SW. Since it was dark we brought along with us a small flashlight. Coincidentally the flashlight had a small red laser light attached. As the light drifted and was now due East from us I got the laser light and flashed it a couple times towards this anomaly. This is still difficult to fully understand but as soon as I finished flashing the laser light the light in the sky stopped. It completely stopped and was just silently hovering due East from our position. I said to my wife &quot;you don&apos;t think the light stopped because I flashed the laser do you&quot;. As we stood their stunned and watching the light I decided to flash the laser a couple more times.  Any skepticism that I had prior to this sighting all ended when this light unbelievably flashed back at us in four bright intervals-Flash-Flash---Flash-Flash. Unable to believe my eyes I flashed my light again at the light.  At this point the brightness of the light which was still stationary started to dim to where we could barely see it. The light then started to move directly up and continued on this path until it was know longer visible.This was an unbelievable experience and one that will be with me for the rest of my life.Thank You", "Was a circular shape with the lights goin acorss the centre of it flying over Birmingham, EnglandIt was a clear sky, no clouds and no trails of any other planes in the sky.

We were on our way to Doncaster to drop one of our friends off and it was about 10pm. Looking up at the night sky i was pointing out constellations when accross the sky came a shooting star, however this shooting star stopped dead on the horizon.

I got a very good look at it and it seemed to have a Silver circle in the middle of a black triangle. It flew away and i was amazed. I told everyone i knew. But no one believed me.

Not a minute after sitting there viewing the sky, a faint orange sphere which appeared to be about a 1/4&quot; in diameter (with no visual aids...telescope, binoculars) moved from a north/east to south/west direction. It took about 10 seconds to move across the whole skyline.  No sound was heard, and the orange glow almost seemed like the same glow from heated metal  I&apos;ve seen meteor showers &amp; falling stars, but this was slower then that. Also I see and hear planes &amp; choppers all the time (on there way to and from John Wayne airport)which move way slower then this objectt, not to mention I see military craft from Camp Penalton and hear bombing a San Clemente Island (or visa versa)all the time.

Apparently the counselors had stayed up late chatting. Sometime after midnight they came around and woke us up to see what they hadd spotted in the sky.We watched a shaky spot of light that hung just over the southern horizon in the middle of a circle stars.  After about 10 minutes the light began to make its way towards the zenith, but it didn&apos;t travel in a straight line and it moved relatively slowly.  It zigzagged from side to side as it moved upwards. Taking roughly 15 minutes to reach the zenith.  It then made a right angle turn and headed down towards the western horizon moving in the same back and forth manner.After about 5 minutes it changed course and in a straight lined zoomed away from the planet.  It was gone in seconds.The night was absolutely clear with no moon and the sky was full of stars.

We noticed two far away lights way in the distance. The lights look like part of a radio tower.  As we approached the lights we then saw three circle shaped bright lights. Our truck reached the lights and we saw that it was not a tower. Puzzled we continued our drive home. Surprisingly, the lights suddenly proceeded to follow to our vehicle. All three objects followed us at eye level on the passenger side of the window.  They followed us on the opposite side of the freeway.  All three lights kept pace with us, my husband accelerated to the speed of 80 mph. At one point, in a split second all three hovered above our truck. They continued to do for the next three miles. My husband slowed and stopped, pulling off the road at one point.  He was going to see what was above us. I was very frighten and asked him not to go outside, the lights hovered above us waiting .We started the truck again and got on the freeway the bright objects keeping up as their lights flashed off and on. As we approached the city of Las Cruces the lights fell back and disappeared as we got close to the city limits.", "A series of light about 13-15, they all were the size of a star...... flying over Dallas on 5.28.2009 at 11.50 pmAt 11:50 P.M. on May 28, 2009 in Dallas, Tx I stood outside my apartment star gazing.  As I look at the dipper, not sure which one but it was a dipper.. a series of lights appeared.   As I watched these lights flying in a V-Formation I couldn&rsquo;t believe my eyes.so I ran inside grabbed my wife.   And showed her the lights.  We both looked in awe.. as the objects was flying.. it then broke into a straight line   &gt; ..   &lt; indicated by the arrows.   This is the formation that the objects flew in, then the middle object took the lead and it then became a V again. As I looked closer and watched and watched this wasn&rsquo;t a huge massive object.  It was at least 15 small specs.. moving in a synchronized pattern..  It was so far away that the dots looked exactly like stars.  It took about 1 minute for these objects to fly completely across the distance of the sky and out of the horizon at exactly at 11.50 or 11.53 close to those times. These objects appear.. clear as day  if anyone was looking in the sky over Dallas around this time it was almost impossible to miss.. as it flew across the sky in blended in with the stars.

Brought to my immediate attention was a very bright (brighter than a KC-10 landing light seen at one half mile distance) , very large (larger than a seedless grape viewed at arms length) , object which was shaped in the form of a child&apos;s &quot;top&quot; .The object was spatially stationary (I fixed its position relative to two near tree branches.) , although it was rotating counter-clockwise at (best guess) about one RPM . It&apos;s color was &quot;opalescent&quot; white ; there was a small red , eccentrically located red light near the upper portion which rotated as if fixed to the object . As a &quot;best guess&quot; , I&apos;d estimate the object to be about two or two and one half miles distant , the direction being to the N.N.W. .As for atmospheric conditions , the sky was overcast with a ceiling of about 3k feet . The object appeared to be approx 1.5 to 2.0 k feet above ground level .I watched the object (with fascination !) for about three minutes , after which I left the bathroom so as to procure a camera . When I returned , the object was no longer viable . I continued to observe the area for about two minutes , at which point I noted two slow moving &quot;conventional&quot; aircraft circling the area where the unidentifiable object had been sighted . These &quot;conventional&quot; aircraft were circling in a 360 degree &quot;holding pattern&quot; , about 500 feet above and roughly a half mile beyond the diameter of the unidentified craft . Although I could ascertain no distinct shape of the two circling smaller aircraft , I assumed them to be helicopters (nav lights , and air speed too slow for fixed-wing) from McGuire A.F.B.  I watched the circling aircraft for an additional five minutes or so , and retired for the night .I awoke at approx 0400 , and immediately (even before coffee !) checked the television news programing for additional details about the very strange object - There was none . The network news did (at about 0920) , however , make mention that some people in Arizona had become alarmed after viewing a U.S.A.F. weather balloon .Why did I wait so long to report such a strange object , when its size surly must have attracted the attention of very many people ? Although I&apos;d never witnessed such a thing before , I suppose that the answer would have roots related to both a sense of frustration/disappointment and the potential risk of loss of credibility . If you&apos;ve &quot;stayed with me this far&quot; , I&apos;ll seize the opportunity to note that I&apos;ve been an aerophile (an airplane &quot;affectation&quot;)for over fifty years , that I&apos;m a former member of the United States Parachuting Association , and that I&apos;m an armature (very)astronomer .In closing , although the experience only lasted for about three minutes , it was quite a show !

The light appeared to be higher than an aircraft would be flying in the area.   The light hovered in the sky and was not moving for several minutes.

It appeared to be moving further away in a southerly direction, suddenly I realized it moved back towards the west and back closer to where it was before.

The other witnesses include the owner of a large telephone company and an oil and gas heir.I was watching as several satellites passed across the sky.  About the third satellite I watched made it half way across the sky, nearly directly overhead, and just stopped.  It stayed in place for five seconds and then started moving in a new direction, about 100 degrees from its original direction.  It made several more course changes while it began moving at what must have been thousands of miles per hour.I handed the binoculars to the other people there and they also watched the &quot;satellite&quot; complete incredible maneuvers in a lot of different directions.  After about ten minutes of impossibly fast and extremely angular turns and flight, it shot across the sky past the horizon.

I was standing on the door step, and something caught my eye shooting past. I thought it was a bird flying low across the houses, and then maybe 3 or 4 seconds later i noticed a reflection in the sky, something going up into the atmosphere. I can still picture it exactly in my mind, and it seemed to shoot up and across the sky.The object i seen was definitely not an airplane or anything man-made, it had a circular/spherical form. and was only properly visible while the sun was reflecting off it. There were no chem-trails for the duration of the sighting (which rules out a jet, or fighter plane), although as it went &quot;up&quot; into the atmosphere, it left a blurring trail behind it which lasted for a couple of seconds, then disappearing from sight.The glow it gave off, maybe lights, or reflection from the sun gives me the solid impression it was metallic. I cannot think of anything man-made of which fly/moves/appears in this way.The path it took across the sky, was a straight line... at a very high speed. As it almost went behind the houses in the distance, it shot up, in an arching motion into the atmosphere.I cannot really tell what color it was, but i can say it was definitely metallic, and after browsing you-tube for similar footage to explain to my friend what i had seen. He mentioned seeing a similar metallic ball shoot across the sky a few weeks back.I hope this report may help towards any other possible sightings on that day, because i am still confused as to what i saw. On, a biased view, it could easily have been said that this ball/sphere was a probe/satellite of some kind.But as for skepticism i cannot find any other kind of object that matches the description of a man-made aircraft.", "My wife and I saw a rocket shaped missle slowly landing on Missianary Ridge in Rossville Georgia.AT 830 i went to pick up my wife from work.

I noticed what I thought to be a plane north of where I was heading.  At first, I was intrigued at how shiny this &quot;plane&quot; was.  It was so chrome that it was reflecting.  As I sat there staring at it, I noticed that there was no rear stabilizer.  Just a chrome cigar, sitting there.  I turned to see if traffic had started to move and it hadn&apos;t, so I turned back to the object and it was gone.  Just like that!  I looked all around to see if I could spot it but there was no sight of it what so ever anywhere.  I kept searching, hoping to find but the person behind me started blowing their horn because traffic started moving again.  That&apos;s when I thought to myself if I was seeing a UFO, so I came home and found this website to see if anybody may have posted something so I wouldn&apos;t think I was nuts.  Sure enough, there is a posting on the second of June of a sighting in Canton, GA around the same time, although that is described as oval.  this may have been, I don&apos;t know.

After learning to track the moon as it moved rapidly across my field I started focusing on the surface.  I used the craters as the reference as where to focus.  After looking at the area on the periphery of the lighted portion of the moon (I used this because it seemed easier to actually see terrain distinctly and in focus).Almost immediately I noticed an object traveling North by North East (upper right direction as my vision would orientate.  It traveled in a precisely straight line for close to one minute.  During this time I tried to determine if this was a just a surface phenomenon or something on my lens.  I quickly determined that it had to be on the surface as it did not appear until I had complete focus on the surface craters and features.After I had established that fact, and continued following the object it stopped for a few seconds (I mention this only because it was a distinct period however short).  It then turned left (almost) 90 degrees to the left and traveled for another 5-10 seconds before stopping.  It remained at that position for well over a minute or so.  I followed it until the moon disappeared behind the trees and the house I lived in - Mountains of Colorado.I tried again in the back of the house (to bypass the blockage that the house and trees had presented) but was unable to establish exactly what or where the spot was.My observation was that the shadow did not elongate as a shadow would if it were to rise and fall on the landscape (because it was on the rising or setting light source).  It remained in clear focus during the entire time and also remained as a spot and did not become an elongated feature or blurred image.", "Flashlight looking lights looking for something in feild in Dulce, New Mexico.I was looking out the window one night on June 2, 2009 and noticed some lights in the field across the street from my house.

The lights were turning on and floating and then they would turn off and come back on. My brother was also with me and went to get binoculars. I quickly got my blackberry out and filmed the incident. The lights moved around in circular motion and looked to be about 3-4 ft above the ground. They moved around fast and were flashing by a road. The main highway is nearby and a car came over the hill and the lights turned off immediately. As soon as the car was out of sight the lights turned on and started flashing again. There were 3 different lights and the colors seemed to change. My brother returned with the binoculars and said it look like a orb, a round like shape with lights around it. We continued to watch the lights and it was obvious it was a UFO.  The lights begin to spread apart and went there own ways and I observed one light that was green spinned around very fast then flew off. The lights then went out and I began to feel shaken so we went inside. I couldn&rsquo;t believe that I got it on video so we went inside and uploaded to the computer.

The lights slowly roatated in a controlled sequence around the periphery of the disk.  It was moving on a southerly track. In my opinion it seemed to be following the same outbound track from Heathrow airport.No central core of the disk was defined and the disk gradually dissapperared into the low cloud.

From my position in North Carolina, the moon was in full lunar eclipse; weather was ideal- &quot;clear blue and 22&quot; as we say in aviation; the moon was approximately 55 degrees South/ Southwest overhead- in other words, I had a clear unobstructed view of the lunar eclipse from my position on my front porch in Fayetteville, NC. I normally wouldn&apos;t be looking at the moon except this Lunar Eclipse event had been widely publicized on TV that evening. I was enjoying an event with unobstructed view that few will ever witness in their life time.Approximately 10 minutes into the full lunar eclipse, about 22:40 EST, I noticed on the left side of the moon (as I was facing it), a very bright, round object resembling a satellite; a bright pin-point of light object; clearly not a naturally formed object appeared suddenly, traveling in a straight line from the left side of the back side of the moon- it was clearly traveling in a straight line towards Earth. In about one to two seconds, the object made a 90 degree turn to my right, directly in front of the face of the fully eclipsed moon.  As quick as it appeared and shot across in front of my unobstructed view of the eclipsed moon, it disappeared off to my right side of the Moon and became invisible almost immediately of passing out of the Umbra shadow of the Earth eclipse of the Moon.  The entire event was less than 5 seconds.I am a US Army trained combat helicopter pilot, Desert Storm veteran of the Gulf War.  I&apos;m accustomed and trained to look for things, especially at night.  This was not a naturally occurring object. This object made intelligent turns and in relation to the position of the moon, was traveling at as fantastic rate of speed. I am not a UFO nut.  You may even call me skeptical.  I have been able to observe a great deal of objects while flying with night vision goggles at night in various parts of the world.  I have witnessed many naturally occurring and man-made events in the sky normally not seen with the naked eye.  But this object appeared from the back-side of the moon with my un-aided view and flew directly across in front of the moon was of intelligent design and flight path.  It probably would not have been visible during the lighted or visible, not eclipsed, moon, by an un-aided human eye.  But during the eclipsed darkened view of the Moon, it was so clearly visible to the naked human eye!   I truly believe the object I observed was not of natural origin but of intelligent origin.  I am capable of distinguishing the difference between a circular type orbit versus a straight flight path.  This object was of the latter. And I know of no known human-made objects that could have produced such incredible speeds and turns based upon its observed position that night from the back side of the moon, making an instant 90 degree right turn in front and across the eclipsed moon that night.By the way, I was 47 years old at the time of the lunar eclipse and my eye sight has been evaluated as 20/12 &amp; 20/15 in each eye during every one of my US Army Flight Physical Evaluations for the past 20 years.  I honestly believe I witnessed an intelligently driven object not of man-made origin.  I have reluctantly not reported this event to anyone before now because it was so incredible to believe myself.  And I do not want to be labeled a &quot;UFO Nut&quot;.  But I witnessed, regardless of scrutiny, a truly incredible event that evening on 20 February 2008 during the Lunar Eclipse.", "Black object tumbling and moving in sky over Santa Barbara, CA on June 25, 2009 7:15 pmSitting on the porch of the ((name deleted)) restaurant, located at the corner of Anacapa and Ortega Streets in Santa Barbara, CA, two witnesses sighted an unidentifiable object which appeared at times to be a flipping disc shape in the sky which exhibited a tumbling motion as it came straight toward us for about 3 minutes.

Living in a small canyon about five miles from and just out of sight of the Pacific coast, it wasn&rsquo;t uncommon to see small planes flying over about five hundred feet up.  They were visible for about ten to fifteen seconds.  But without a sound this time, a flaming crop-duster appeared from over the ridge tumbling end over end about a second a turn toward the setting sun.  I called to my mother, &quot;Look out of you front sliding glass door, Mamma!&quot;  She was too old &amp; slow to see it while I described to her.

We were swimming in the pool at my mom and dad&rsquo;s house when I noticed what we first thought looked like a balloon lifting across the sky at a distance to the north -northeast.  I watched the object track across the sky for a couple of minutes, and then noticed a second object, and then a third tracking behind the first object on a similar trajectory.  I was ready to dismiss them as released balloons of some sort until all three of the objects began to flash and then switched directions and began circling back toward the direction they came from.  It was then that I became very interested in what we were witnessing.  The objects were barely visible against the blue sky, but were much easier to see with my polarized sunglasses.My son and my daughter were able to see the objects with their naked eye.  My wife had to put on my sunglasses to see them.The objects were joined by two others and they began to rotate in a circular pattern.  It was then that I noticed another object that appeared fixed in the sky at a higher altitude and these objects appeared to be rotating in a pattern beneath the stationary object.  As I was watching this happen, I noticed what appeared to be two military jets at extremely high altitude circling the area in a much wider pattern.  It then occurred to me that maybe they were looking for these objects.  My wife suggested that maybe it was some sort of training exercise.  When the jets turned back to the northeast, all of the circulating flashing objects began to disappear one-by-one.  The stationary object remained and I watched it stay in this same position for at least another 10 minutes.  The object then began to drift slowly to the east &ndash; southeast and looked like it was also getting farther away as it became much harder to see.  The object then stopped and remained stationary As I continued watching the object, I saw the two military jets again.  They were travelling on the same flight path, but were much farther apart than before.  They followed a similar path as they had earlier but appeared to be much higher and slower.  I then spotted a third jet that was on a different path and appeared to be heading more in the direction of the stationary object. .  I sent my wife out to my truck to get my digital camera so I could attempt to get some shots of the object before it moved out of sight.  I took several pictures, but it was impossible to see the object in the screen on the camera.  The stationary object then began to move very slowly and then vanished from sight.By this time I was pretty worked up and was scanning the sky for more activity.  I was about to give up when just over the roof of the house, again to the north-northeast , I saw two more objects moving across the sky.  One was flashing, and one was solid.  The flashing one disappeared rather quickly, so I continued to watch the solid one.  It moved across the sky in a similar manner to the previous one.  I tried taking several more pictures, and then I watched it until I could no longer see it, which was probably about 5 minutes.The only way I can describe what we saw is that the solid objects looked similar to what a satellite would look like moving across the night sky (except for the stopping and changing directions) and the flashing objects looked like what something flat and reflective spinning in the wind would look like as it reflected the sun.  I am truly amazed and mystified.  I wish there was a way I could find out where the jets came from and what they were doing there.   I feel very strongly that they were looking at the same thing I was.I am going to download the photos from my camera as soon as I finish this and see if there is anything there.  I will send photos if they come out.", "Bright green ball of light shoots to the ground over Azle, Texas.A bright green ball of light just appeared out of nowhere in the sky and shot to the ground in a matter of seconds.

I immediately looked at it as it traveled out of sight behind trees.  The whole episode last 2-3 seconds, long enough to train my eyes on the object as it went out of view.What it looked like was a spherical bright object shrouded within a hazy fog or glowing aura, traveling at very fast speed.  The color of the object was bright white with a bluish tint, or more accurately, the sphere was bright white while the glow surrounding it was bluish-white.  It seemed, instinctively, like a meteorite flying through the air but there were things about it that made me question that possibility.  One, the trajectory was straight and level, not at an angle downward.  Also, the shooting stars I&apos;ve seen in the past have always been bright and sharply defined, never one with a glowing aura surrounding it.  That immediately seemed very odd and out of place.  Plus, the time that I was able to view the object, 2-3 seconds, doesn&apos;t sound like a long enough time but compared to the shooting stars I&apos;m familiar with, it&apos;s almost an eternity.  Not only that, it didn&apos;t feel like it was going to dissipate, or burn out, as it went behind the trees but rather to continue on its present trajectory.If I was to describe it&apos;s dimension and where it was within the environment, I would say it was roughly 200-300 feet in the air and was traveling at 100 MPH+.  (It could&apos;ve have been higher but then the speed would have been amazingly fast.  I would stay with the original estimation.)  The object appeared about 3-5 feet wide while the glow extended outward 10 feet or so and maybe 15-20 feet behind.  That would seem to suggest a trail (or a tail) but I couldn&apos;t really detect anything like a vapor trail or smoke.If push came to shove, I would say it could&apos;ve been a significant meteorite, if I had to say it was anything identifiable.

Here it is.Back in the summer months of 2003 me and my family member Chasity had walked onto my front porch.  I remember looking over into the field across the way. I had noticed rising up through the foliage of the trees a white light. I had pointed this out to Chasity and we both watched as the light appeared above the trees. It was a ball of light. the ball looked like a glass ball and glowed a dim but bright white light. It was funny to note that the light of the sphere did not shine of the trees and the light was in and of itself. However, the spherehover above the trees. just hanging there. No noise, nothing, the leaves on the trees didnt even move. When we watched it there for a moment, we noticed that in one instant the ball seemed to zip up into the darkened sky. After a little bit of searching the ball seemed to disappear above the porch roof. I am not saying it was a Alien. However, it was not a fire. It was not a plane or Copter or a fire work.....or anything else. It&apos;s nothing I can explain with what I know of the worlds flying contraptions.

The sky was dark and dotted with stars, planes slowly moved across the sky. I continued to watch the sky for a good thirty minutes or so until I saw something out of the ordinary in the sky.  What I saw was a sudden bright light; at first I thought it was just a bright star but the more I looked I realized it wasn&rsquo;t a star at all.  The light was not a fiery white blaze a meteor would normally generate, it instead looked as though something was shining a huge bright spotlight in the sky towards my directing.  The flying object was not bearing any strobe light or light a plane would normally carry and not giving off any loud chopping noise a helicopter would generate and was not giving off a roar a jet would normally create.  The light it was giving was too bright and massive to be any airliner as well. As I strained my eyes to make out the light on the aircraft it suddenly turned to the left so I could get an almost clear view of its side.  With the light no longer focused in my direction I strained to view what appeared to be a long cylinder-like object with a red light on what I assumed was its front.

On top of Palomar Mountain I saw a light blinking at the peak.  My friend and I thought it was the local observatory but our local friend stated there was no observatory on top of that mountain.  As soon as he made the statement we looked at the light and it immediately took off.The craft took almost straight off curving with the wind.  After floating to an altitude still under clouds it proceeded to travel towards the west.  We heard no noise coming from the craft, and we are well aware of the noises normal air crafts (i.e. helicopters, air planes, balloons, etc.) would make.We continued to follow the craft through the sky and it appeared to be football shaped.  All lights on the craft were white, and the two that were on the sides were blinking simultaneously, unlike and air plane whose lights will blink one after another.Soon after, the craft disappeared in the distance, but not necessarily out of the atmosphere.  Since the sighting now about an hour later, we have heard a helicopter flying around the area as well as some other lights, possibly vehicles, traveling to the top of the mountain.We are more interested in what else it could be, seeing as how Camp Pendelton is so close, but this is unlike anything we have ever seen before.", "was a bright yellow light growing and dissapearing.I Was driving from Vegas to Phoenix, in the US93 when me and my wife spotted 2 lights at the sky in the left of the road, and they was like sharing the light, couse some time one was more light than the other, the we spot a 3rd one in the right of the road, communicating with the other 2, the they just disappeared, like 5 minutes later, we spot the light again, but the 4 together, then they just disappeared again, later it was like 1 hour without seeing the lights when finally they appeared at the same time, one at the left of the road, one at the right of the road, landing in the top of a mountaing (and the light stayed in there like for 10 minutes, and 2 more crossing the small town of bahgdad,arizona, I have taped 3 of the lights.I called 911 to let them now about that.", "pulsating lightsI was driving to work and a plane was low and flying across my sight so I looked at at as you do and then I noticed three bright lights in the background a long way from the plane I was traveling at 60ks so I couldnt see if they were moving but I did notice they got small then big like pulsating I was amazed and not realy watching the road and had to turn in the lane with other traffic and lost sight them the brightness of the lights were about as stong as a street lamp at night but these were in broad daylight I dont know of anything that could be that bright in the daytime that man has got. It coulnt be a reflection beause two were high and one was lower and the two high ones were not close to each other but aligned As for stars there were brighter than any star at night.There for my conclusion is they were unidentifieble flying objects", "I observed a single white light in the sky almost directly overhead, about the same size as the stars or an airplane light. It was making a circular pattern then would suddenly and quickly dart forth in a straight line, and then dart straight straight back along the same line, then resume the circular pattern, much like a helicopter would do while circling.

It went down far enough to go under the bridge but when it got within less than 20 feet of the bridge it bounced to the south and hit the concrete bridge support on the south side bouncing off, it came around in a circle several times repeating this bouncing many times.  Then it stayed in that small area going in a circle and bouncing off the concrete for a while and several times hitting a small tree about two feet out from he bridge.  Then it dropped into the swamp grass and made three crop circles about 20 feet across, it went up and down, staying down in the grass about 3 seconds at a time then going up about 1 foot above the grass. Then the cloud suddenly just rose up and went up to the west where it came from until it was too far to see.The cloud glowed bright white and was about 2 feet wide and it looked square.  There was an outline of something inside barley visible.  The only time it make a sound was when it touched something.

It has always stayed in my mind as I had never seen anything like it.  I never knew to whom or if I should report it to anyone as I thought that people might think that I&rsquo;m crazy.  Anyway, I would like to share this story now.Me, my husband and two young children, ages 4 and 10 at the time were on our way to Disneyland in Anaheim, California.  To avoid the evening traffic, we had left our home in San Jose, California at about 7:30 pm in hopes of checking into our hotel at least by midnight.  My husband and I had decided that I would drive as I had been home resting during the day and he had worked.   We decided that he would sleep during the trip and I would awaken him if I would get tired of driving.It was about 10:45pm and we were at least sixty miles away from Bakersfield and my husband and younger child were asleep in the back seat.  My older child was asleep in the passenger seat.  I was listening to music.  I could see in the distant the dark gray of the sky with the shadows of the hills beyond.  I could also see what I thought were city lights in the distance.  All of a sudden a very bright light above the hills caught my attention as it seemed that it was descending in a very vertical manner and quite rapidly.  My first thought was, &quot;Oh my God, could that be a plane that is falling?&quot;   No sooner had I thought that, when it seemed that it was coming right towards our car and very quickly.  I got scared and began to speed up.  I looked into my rear view mirror to see if other cars were close by, but it seemed that the car behind me was still a ways back.  &ldquo;The object&rdquo; seemed to have come right next to us to what seemed about 25 to 30 feet away in the open space next to us.  It zoomed by very low, almost parallel to my vehicle.  It went past us and I remember looking through my side mirror only to see it coming back at a slower rate.  It was hovering and spinning slowly.  It then came exactly parallel to my car as I drove at about 70 MPH.  It just hovered and spun next to me for what seemed like a minute or two.  My youngest son awoke at that moment and I asked him, &ldquo;JJ, what is that thing?&rdquo;  I wanted to make sure my mind was not playing tricks on me.  He replied in his four year old voice, &ldquo;A spaceship!&rdquo;  Just then it made a final quick and rapid spin and disappeared back into the distance in the direction it had come from.  I was speechless and still trying to wrap my head around what I had just experienced.  I quickly woke my husband to tell him what had just happened and he said that it was probably a helicopter or some military object test being conducted.  I then replied, &ldquo;A triangular helicopter that spun with white lights around it and made absolutely no noise!&rdquo;  Furthermore, it was not onl! y triang ular, but the triangle did not have straight lines, it seemed to have inwards curves with many lights all along the curves.I don&rsquo;t know if it indeed an UFO, but to me it surely was unidentifiable.

In the middle of the show, a bit past 21:15 we noticed a red, almost square shape high in the Northern sky above St. Louis county,  a somewhat higher altitude than airplanes that arrive into Lambert Airport, it continued to rise at a very quick pace faster than regular aircraft; a minute later in the direction of the fireworks display, the same size red square shaped craft  rose from the tree-line straight up at an unbelievable fast pace and then angled towards the other red square now hovering high in the sky. All of us on the porch witnessed it, at first a couple people thought the second one was a hot air balloon but within seconds of it rapidly rising faster into the atmosphere than even airplanes do that theory was discounted; it was clear it was not any type of balloon or regular aircraft, we lost visual contact of both crafts in the clouds as it had rained about 10 minutes prior.  Both were identical, almost square, and possibly slightly rectangular, with a very small light at one corner. Visual contact lasted about two minutes in duration.", "I saw an object with mutiple lights near Williamsport, PA on 7/06/2009I stepped out on my front porch to smoke a cigarette around 2:00am on Monday 07/06/2009.

I then noticed that it was hovering and moving slightly in a circular pattern.  It was not an airplane or a helicopter.  It made no audible noise.I watched the object for about 15 minutes.  I don&apos;t have any idea how long it was there before I noticed it or how long it was there after I stopped watching it.  I could see that the object had at least 3 different lights though at first it appeared to be a single light.  I got my digital camera and attempted to take photos but they wouldn&apos;t come out.

I was standing at my living room window in the Sunset District of San Francisco watching the sunset over the ocean when I saw them.  As they approached I questioned if in fact they were planes.They were absolutely quite.  It seemed one was following the other.  They moved in a straight line almost directly toward me.  One got close enough that I could see four lights, one red, one yellow and 2 white lights.  The lights were pulsating.  Then I moved to my bedroom window trying to get a better view.  They were both still there after I transitioned rooms.  My bedroom window also has an ocean view looking west but is more south than my living room window.Then it seemed they were out of view so I went to my back decks on the east side of my building and saw them again.  They were still heading southeast and seemed to be heading toward a third object that looked like a star.  At the closest the larger one seemed the size of an eraser on a pencil.Then a fourth one came from the southwest and seemed to be heading north not following the others.  That one was quite big also, in that it was just over the rooftops and could not have been a star in that case. It also had 4 pulsating lights red, yellow and 2 white lights. It seemed a bit closer than the other two that seemed to pass overhead of the building I was in. All in all it felt like I watched for a good 10 to 15 minutes.

As we watched the,  the object projected a very blue-white beam of light on to the passing train cars,  it lite up the train as if it were daylight.  By this time,  my girlfriend was really freaking out and asking me to drive away,  I was so amazed all I could do was just stare untill she began hitting me in the arm and telling me to drive.  I drove slowly towards the main road while watching this craft,  my girlfriend screaming at me to drive fast but I was in disbelief.

Shasta and the city of Mt. Shasta CaliforniaI grew up in Weed, California, Siskiyou County, and heard numerous stories of UFO sightings and in particular, stories from my mother regarding &quot;St. Elmo&rsquo;s Fire.&quot;  The sightings of St Elmo&rsquo;s Fire were always located several miles south of Weed in an area that bordered the then Kellogg Ranch.  Located west of I-5.  My mother described St. Elmo&rsquo;s fire to be as large as a car, hovering approximately 5 feet off the ground.  The color was always a brilliant emerald green mixed with red/yellow flames.  She stated that the only way you knew St. Elmo&rsquo;s Fire was coming was because the air surrounding you would become charged with electricity causing the hair on your body and your head to stand up.My story begins early evening October 31, 1981.  Fall was settling in and when I was growing up, November 1st always brought snow; thus, there was a coolness to the air with the smell of wood smoke.  I was newly dating someone who lived in Mt. Shasta, California and I was headed to a dinner party that friends of his were having.  Just as I approached the Kellogg Ranch area headed south on Interstate 5, (which at this date of 1981 had a McDonald&rsquo;s and a hotel located on the east side of the highway) I felt the crackle of electricity in the air with it being stronger to my right, which would be due west.  I was slightly confused due to this new sensation and as I scanned left to right I saw a huge ball of emerald green fire shooting from the west headed due east about 2/10&rsquo;s of a mile in front of me.  The ball of fire was as large as a sedan and approximately 5 feet off the ground; just as my mother use to describe it in her stories.  As I visually followed St. Elmo&rsquo;s Fire from right to left, the mountain, Mt. Shasta was in my line of vision to the east.  To my utter amazement, there was a saucer shaped UFO hovering on the side of Mt. Shasta closest to me.  It was huge, sliver in color and slightly dipped downward on the left side of the UFO.  The UFO was located toward the base in the area we call the &quot;timberline.&quot;   As I traveled south toward Mt. Shasta, I was able to keep it in my line of vision for approximately 15 minutes and then it shot straight up in the air and disappeared.  The light during this entire sighting was bright enough for me to not misinterpret what I was seeing.  I had hoped that the UFO would remain where it was as the house I was headed for would have had a front and center view of a life time.The house where the dinner party was being given was located almost at the base of Mt. Shasta on the Everett Memorial Highway.  The house is located on the west side of the highway and Mt. Shasta High School is still located across the road from this house.  Upon entering the house everyone was excited and asked me if I had seen anything strange on my way to their home.  Because I didn&rsquo;t want them to think that I was strange, I told them to tell me what they saw.  They stated that they felt a charge of electricity and when they looked out the picture window that faces Mt. Shasta, they saw a UFO and described it exactly the way I saw it.  None of us saw lights that were lit up on the UFO-could be due to the fact that it was still light outside that none were needed.  I then told them about seeing St. Elmo&rsquo;s Fire and then the UFO.  My friends apprised me that, though they had never seen St. Elmo&rsquo;s Fire, they had heard stories of sightings in the same area where I saw it.The four individuals that saw the UFO besides me were approximately 8 to 15 years older than me as I had just turned 21 that April.  Two of the individuals were school teachers and the other two were business owners.This was not the first time I had seen a UFO while living in Weed, California, and the other sightings were also witnessed by my siblings and friends and on one occasion, we even called law enforcement, who did respond, but found ways to discount what we were seeing and what they were seeing.", "Loud humming triangular craft observed over Western South Dakota moving at high speedOn 25 May 2009 at approximately 2200 hours, a triangular shaped craft was detected moving West to East over various locations in western South Dakota between Highway 44 and Rapid City Regional Airport.

I was gazing out through the moon roof noticing the slight fog in the air as I was driving and noticed two lighted objects appear side by side. It looked as if they were coming towards us but being that we were driving in that direction probably made it look that way. I quickly called to my friend and told him to look up, do you see what I see? he said yes, what is it? One of the objects hovered above us and followed in our direction as the other one had seemed to stay behind. I immediately noticed the shape and lights. There were what seemd to be four octagon pods hooked together with a honey comb shape screen or lens and the lights slowly pulsated in each pod, white, red, blue and maybe orange?? Driving at 60mph I slowed down and pulled the car over to the side of the road so we could get out to get a better look at the object. As we looked up into the foggy air, we could not see the object. We got back in the car and drove on to the next exit ( Trenton, New Brunswick ) As we took the New brunswick exit toward the mall, we had to stop at the next red traffic light. The New Jersey motor vehicles inspection station is on the right. As we were waiting for the light to turn green, I looked up into the fog and there it was, right above us, that same pulsating octagon object. I jestured for my friend to look up and we watched it slowly ascend into the foggy air and then nothing, it was gone. The light turned green and we went on our way asking each other what the hell did we just see? The strange thing about this experience was that it did not creep us out or make us scared. It was like, oh whats that? and then hmmm, life goes on. I do have to say I have always been intrigued by stories of UFO&apos;s ever since i was eleven years old.

Also, after I had observed the objects in all three sightings, I believed the aircraft to be military.  The cities of Del Rio and San Antonio have Air Force installations.  The city of Corpus Christi has a Naval Air Station.  There is also a bombing range approximately 30 to 40 miles east of Cotulla, Texas on Farm to Market Road (FM) 624.I will report these observations as clearly and accurately as I can, devoid of any opinion or speculation.  I did mention earlier that I believed these objects to be military, but that&rsquo;s based on the fact that these events occurred within the triangle of those installations where there are several remote miles to operate in without many eyewitness accounts.FIRST SIGHTING: I was with a coworker traveling westbound on the FM Road 133 which connects Artesia Wells, Texas (LaSalle County) to Catarina, Texas (County).  Both towns are sparsely populated and are surrounded by dense brush for several miles.  Artesia Wells is a town of probably 20 that is approximately 50 miles north of Laredo, Texas, outside of it&rsquo;s city limits and maybe 90 miles outside of San Antonio, Texas.  Artesia Wells is on IH-35 in a heavily traveled stretch of highway that is relatively clo0se to the Mexican border.FM 133 is maybe 15 to 20 miles long and only runs from Artesia Wells to Catarina.  There are no tons in between Artesia Wells and Catarina.  Catarina has a population of maybe 50 or more, if not less.I am not certain as to the time of year, and do not want to speculate.  I do remember that I initially observed the object approximately 10 miles west of Catarina and thought that it was a low flying aircraft.  This was about 45 minutes before sunset.  Approximately 5 miles outside of Catarina, both my coworker and commented that the aircraft did not appear to be moving.  The object was several miles west of the FM 133 and Highway 83 intersection just south of Catarina.The object appeared to be black in color, triangular shaped with no lights or visible markings.  The object did not make any sounds that I could hear.  Also, the object appeared to be hovering.  The object&rsquo;s hover was not consistent with that of a helicopter in that a helicopter moves up and down and side to side as it hovers.  This object appeared to be perfectly still.  I did not notice and type of exhaust emitting from the vehicle.My coworker and I attempted to get as close as we could to the object via dirt roads.  The dirt roads we were on took us due south and not west.  The object appeared to be hovering over brush.  From my position, I couldn&rsquo;t identify any land monuments to pinpoint the object&rsquo;s location.  There were only trees and plants below the object.  I still would like to say that my coworker and I were still around about 10 miles or so from the object.We watched the object until the sun set.  The object remained stationary for the duration.  My coworker and I attempted to get the object&rsquo;s attention by pointing flashlights at it and using flashing lights while we were stationary.At sun set, the object became impossible to see with the naked eye.  I used night vision goggles to view the object.  With very little sub light being used as a light source, I could clearly see the object at the same location, still stationary.  My coworker observed the object through the night vision equipment as well.It was at this time that we left the area.  The object was not visible after sun set.  The object did not appear to have any lights.SECOND SIGHTING: I was working alone near the Artesia Wells area between the hours of 2200 and 0100 hours when I observed lights in the sky.  I was traveling westbound on a rural ranch road one mile south of Artesia Wells and approximately one mile from IH-35 when I first saw a bright light in the sky.On this night, the sky was clear and there did not appear to be any clouds in the sky.  I was I was traveling westbound, a bright light that I can best describe as resembling a headlight caught my eye.  The light was very bright and flashed on and off before disappearing.  There appeared to be lights north of this light&rsquo;s location; these lights seemed relatively close to the first light.I observed the very bright &ldquo;headlight&rdquo; and the others for only a couple of seconds.  I continued traveling west until I reached IH-35.  I parked my vehicle, got out and attempted to signal the area where I observed the light with my flashlight.I was at the intersection of IH-35 and FM 133 when I attempted to signal this light.  At this point the light was not visible.  I scanned the sky and observed a high flying aircraft that could have been a plane.  This object was traveling southbound on the east side of IH-35 but crossed over IH-35 traveling westbound.  Shortly after crossing over, the object began to travel north.  It took the object between 8-12 minutes before it disappeared out of sight due to distance.  Another aircraft appeared to be several miles behind it.I turned my attention back to the west sky where I observed three high hovering objects.  These objects appeared to be in a triangular formation.  I could not make out any shapes or sizes.  The lights on these objects appeared to be consistent with conventional aircraft.  They omitted a white beacon every couple of seconds or so.  These objects did not appear to have the typical red port side light or green starboard side light that many aircraft and vessels have.  They remained stationary for several minutes, flashing.I attempted to signal these objects as well, to no avail.To characterize the initial object, I&rsquo;d say it was about the size of a military flare.  I did not emit smoke and a shadow like military flares and did not appear to be descending under a parachute like a military flare.  It is best described as a single vehicle headlight in the sky.  This object was not a radio or cell phone tower light and was not a vehicle.  It was too high in the sky to be mistaken for vehicle.This entire experience lasted about 30 minutes.THIRD SIGHTING: On this particular evening, I was traveling home from a shopping trip in Laredo, Texas with my family when my daughter, my wife and I observed an object in the sky.  I was at about the 27 mile marker of IH-35, two miles south of the Border Patrol checkpoint when I observed 4 to 5 bright lights, lined up within three to four times their width from each other.  These objects appeared to be in a much disciplined formation.  These objects appeared consistent with the object I saw in my second sighting.  The objects were very bright and appeared similar to headlights.  They flashed off sequentially, starting with the southern most light.  These lights were in the western sky.I immediately notified my wife and daughter and they too saw the lights.  I did not stop to investigate or signal to them.  I continued traveling northbound until arrival at the Border Patrol checkpoint.The 27 mile marker is approximately 27 miles form the Mexican border.  The lights appeared to be hovering over rural densely brushed and sparsely populated ranches.  There are no major towns or cities northwest of Laredo, Texas that would line up directly west of the 27 mile marker.  The nearest town would be Catarina which is several miles north of Laredo on Highway 83.  The next nearst town would be Encinal, which is 39 miles north on IH-35.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))", "LIGHT SPOTTED OVER INTERSTAE 5 CHANGED SHAPE AND COLORTuesday June 30th at approximately 11.35pm, traveling south bound on the California interstate 5 near Avenol. My family and I were in our vehicle, I was driving my wife was in the passenger seat and my two teenage children were in the back.About five minutes earlier we had seen a shooting star that was large and green in color, it stood out because of the brightness and size. I noticed off to my left on the east side of the interstate a similar green light, I watched it for 30 seconds thinking it was a tower light from a cell tower or power line. I did not take my eyes off of it except to check the road and traffic in front of us then return to looking at it. I then noticed it was moving west bound and starting to cross the interstate. My thought at the time was &lsquo;could this be another shooting star?&rsquo; it was approximately 20 feet off the ground it appeared to be moving across the interstate at 25 miles per hour. The only thing I saw was a small green light going across the road, no outline of anything else.At this point I pointed it out to my family who all watched it as well. I was very clearly studying this light and everything around it and saw no outline of anything. As it went over the interstate it went off to the right hand side my family turned to watch it clearly, it appeared to speed up and then all these lights appeared on it . It looked like an almost V shaped two lengths of straight white/ silver lights with  two or three square shaped lights below it. It looked almost triangular in shape. It continued to glow and then looked like it was flying lower slightly tilted which allowed us to see the square outline of lights below the two long strip of lights, then we only saw the glow of it which then disappeared completely.The amazing thing was there was no sound at all, if it had been a jet or aircraft we would have heard the engines as it was so close to us.It lasted only ten to fifteen seconds from start to finish. The highway was busy so others must have seen this as well. We have never seen anything like this before. I am in my mid 40s my wife in her late 30s and my children 16 &amp; 17 years old.", "Sighting  April 14, 1967April 14, 1967:  I was driving West on the Northern State Parkway when I noticed lights in the sky ahead of me, moving slowly in a line and traveling from South to North (left to right). I continued driving until I was past the Post Avenue exit and almost under the lights, then pulled onto the soft shoulders. There were dozens of cars parked, with people all looking skyward.I have no idea how many &quot;lights&quot; there were since I did not see the beginning of the line, but I did observe at least 8, which were yellow-orange in color and emitted no noise. An odd thing at the end of the line occurred:  the object that was second from last moved out of position, passed the one in front of it, and got back in line, thus becoming the third from the end.The next day I contacted MacArthur Field, and the Suffolk Air Force Base who claimed they had heard nothing. The local Police Department, however, said their phones were &quot;ringing off the hook.&quot;On May 9, 1967, I contacted Project Blue Book, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio, giving pertinent information in detail and received a 7 page form to be filled in and returned, which I did.I received a letter from Major Hector Quintanilla advising me that I was watching &quot;an aircraft with an electrical advertising sign.&quot;  Note my second paragraph, last sentence about the object that changed position. Also, if it were an aircraft, it would have had to be tremendously large.It&rsquo;s been over 40 years since the sighting and I have never learned what it was that I saw.", "it what&apos;s not a plane or a bird . this object was moving fast and climbing fast.sphere shape moving fast toward the clouds, the object enter the clouds, it was cloudy and tumder and lightining. after the object enter the clouds it started to rain and follow by thunder and lightining..((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I looked and I saw a circular disk shaped object with green and red lights, they weren&apos;t blinking so I knew it wasn&apos;t a helicopter or plane.", "Two rows of three. Crafts hovering and slowly dissapear into the night. Red lights.At 9:30 PM,There was six crafts hovering  very very slowly in the distance  and it didnt look like they were heading in any particular direction.They were hovering around and stayed in the same area. They were in a sort of rectangle shape in two rows of three. I really could not see the shape of the crafts moving but it looked disk shaped but they had bright red lights. To me it looked like there was diagnal lines on the crafts. I know for a fact that these were not planes because they stayed in the same spot for a while and when planes pass by you would hear a noise, these were silent. Three of them faded away and the rest started to dissapear shortly after until there was only one left and it to, dissapeared. It looked as if they went into clouds. I could not see much detail but I know that what I saw were UFO&apos;s and I wasn&apos;t the only person to see them either. Two of my cousins were there. I tried to video tape it and take pictures from my phone, but it was way to dark and the pictures were just black. I also tried to call the ufo center and they accused me of being a prank caller and didn&apos;t even give me a chance to describe what I saw. I really could care less if anyone believes me or my cousins because we know what we saw.", "white large trianglar shape.   Able to move fast to keep up with the car.I was waiting at the Walmart store in town and looked up. There was not a star in the sky. I noticed a white light in the sky.

Headed home that night live 12 miles north and 5 miles east of Spencer and I looked up and here was a white lighted trianglar object in the sky only lower.

So I went into the house and looked out the window and it was still in the same spot.All I could see was a very white lighted object. Large and not moving now. It just set in the sky. I don&apos;t know what it was but I do know that it didn&apos;t move after that.Hopefully, someone else from Spencer has seen this so they can share their experiance.", "Lights seen in Virginia Beach skyOn July 6 2009 I had gone out back to my patio to talk on the phone to a good friend of mine. After about 3 min of talk I noticed what looked like a dim, pulsating, blue star moving extremely fast to the south west and ascending.  It was moving entirely to fast to be a plane and also moving to slow to be a shooting star. It proceeded to change its course to direct west and straightened its course, then went out immediatly. After about 30 sec I noticed a much brighter and continuous white light bigger than the first (about 3 times larger.) and also much lower and closer, moving at about the same speed as the first, heading in a north west direction. It proceeded to ascend also and then abruptly faded out like a shooting star about roughly a mile from my position. This was not a shooting star.After this event about 3 min to 5 min later I noticed a 3rd light that immediately shot out of the northern sky and descended to the southern sky. It then proceeded to fade out. The 3rd light I believe was a normal shooting star (Meteorite).", "Fireballs slowly descend from the sky and disappear into Lake ErieEvening of 08/11/08:  late night over lake erie. low slung storm cloud on the horizon. I and a friend were positioned facing north looking out over the lake. light rain, cool temperature for early part of August.  With the naked eye, I confirmed with my friend that there were lights out on the lake (28 miles across) as seen first with the naked eye.  Then I asked my friend if he had a pair of binoculars. Through the binoculars it was determined at first that a small boat appeared on fire.  This first bright light was furthest East in its proximity.  Then, on closer inspection I noticed and confirmed with my friend that what we were witnessing was NOT a little boat on fire, but fire balls descending extremely slow from the underside of this low slung storm cloud.  No identifiable sounds were heard in the vacinity. No helicopters, scrambled jets nor weather planes.  The story here is eiree as the fireballs continued to fall from the sky and as the first one went down behind the horizon, another one immediately appeared and began to fall.  This happened for a period of an hour to 90 minutes.  I was a little concerned, not knowing what was happening and decided to leave the neighborhood where this sighting was occurring-- a quiet neighborhood that lines the shore of Lake Erie.  After witnessing at least thirteen of these fireballs, I left the area (my friend lives in the house overlooking the lake and was concerned as well, but not as much as I was.) I hoped that the local news had picked up on this story, but no one has ever reported any similar sightings at the same location, nor did I feel compelled to inform the Lawrence Park police.  I did not want to bring attention to the quiet little neighborhood, plus it was raining and the folks all seemed to be sleeping and not witnessing this.  Too bad, this is definitely one for the books.  I wished that I had had a powerful video camera to capture this phenomenon.", "bright light bolting across the evening skyAt around 8 pm pdt my brother in law and I witnessed what looked looked like a bright star travelling at a high rate of speed ( at least twice as fast as the fastest aircraft I have ever seen) from S.W to N.E. north of town at quite a high altitude but not as high as a satellite.The craft seemed to wabble a bit from left to right as it bolted through the sky and seemed to maintain altitude.No sound or trail was emitted from the object.", "2 silent triangle craftsI was driving home on Yucaloma Rd, when I looked in the sky and saw 6 very bright lights. I pulled the car over and me and the passenger watched as the lights floated silently fairly close to the ground. The lights, which originally were 4 in a string, and two more off to the side, suddenly became 3 on each craft. They started flying North East and as they came overhead we could see that the lights were two seperate triangle shaped crafts. They seemed to be black or some other dark color. It wasn&apos;t completely dark outside, so when they flew over us we could see their shape.They were also very silent, and started to move very quickly and eventually were gone. Me and the passenger both believe in ufo&apos;s, as in, we believe there could be aliens, or it could also just be a secret military craft. But the area they were in is no where near a millitary base.", "Single UFO flying at night splits into 2, then regroups back into 1 in skies over the desert near Roswell, NMOn Wednesday June 10th 2009, while vacationing in NM from CA, a friend and I were traveling west from ROSWELL towards CHACO CANYON NATIONAL HISTORIC PARK via ALBUQUERQUE on US 70. That day, we decided to follow a route via US 380 West towards the town of SOCORRO, searching for any available lodging on route. After securing a room at a local motel in the town of CAPITAN, we decided to go for a ride later on after dinner and check out the stars that night by the desert. We had experienced some overcast weather earlier in the day and the skies had turned clear enough to do so by evening. Somewhere around 8:00 pm we found NM State 234 on our GPS, and we decided to head for awhile on this road eastbound (and towards ROSWELL in Lincoln County).NM STATE 230 is a 2 way road which appeareed to be mostly used by local traffic during the day and not a very busy road at all in the night. There are no light poles to illuminate the way once you&apos;ve entered the desert and sometime after dusk (between 8:45 PM and 9:10 PM) the night fell quickly, and eeringly dark. I engaged my vehicle&apos;s high beam lights in order to better see the road, road markers &amp; reflectors, and also had to slow down sufficiently enough below the posted speed limits (45 &amp; 50) in order to also avoid hitting any of the abundant indigenous wild life we encountered through out most of our entire trip that night. In the 2.5 hour ride we&apos;d traveled on this road, no other vehicles were encountered in either direction (nor could any be seen at a far distance in the mostly flat landscape). Sometime around 9:00 PM we reached an area somewhere in between mile markers 41 &amp; 42 on STATE 230, at which point we decided not to continue any further in that direction. After doing a U-turn to head back westbound, I parked the car just on the shoulder of the road at mile marker 41. I turned off the engine, radio and lights, and sat we sat inside the car talking with my friend in total darkness &amp; silence. We commented on how dark it had gotten on that crisp, clear and moonless night (up to that point...the moon rose up later on around 10:05 or so). Our plan qas to get our vision aclimated to the dark, and then get out of the car and look up at the constellations. However, before we even got a chance to set a foot outside on the ground. At approximately 9:10 PM (and with barely a hint of western dusk light left on the horizon...the eastern skies were already dark &amp; starry!), we both noticed an object about the size of a bayer aspirin traveling hurridly miles above in the skies. We couldn&apos;t make out it&apos;s shape or outline at all, as it had a very bright and steady glowing orange to reddish light. At first, I  thought it may have been either a lear jet, or military aircraft traveling typically in a straight path, with a north-east to east bound trajectory heading, at a 30 degree angle above both the barely visible horizon, and the distant western mountain range beyond. I am well familiar with many aircrafts used by our military, having served in both the: USMC &amp; the USCG.  So it seemed something rather odd that this craft was traveling that at night with no other type of fuselage lights &quot;ON&quot;, nor did it produce any familiar distant sounds, like those from a jet or rotor engines. I was just about to calmy say something to my friend, when at that very same moment he bursted out saying: &quot;What is that in the sky?&quot;...&quot;do you see it?&quot; No sooner did he asked... when suddenly the object disappeared,  vanishing in what we&apos;d estimated to be 5-6 seconds. Then, suddenly it re-appeared again further along on the same path, at what seemed tome to be 2-3 clicks east of it&apos;s last position. Suddenly, the object cleanly splits into 2 (two) objects (each retaining its original orangish-reddish color light), both objects then travelled parallel to the other at first. Quickly separating or widening apart in a sort of an arc fashion, then suddenly both objects did something bizzare: each dove right into each other, rejoining and giving the appearance as if both lights had &quot;MELTED&quot; or morphed back into 1(one)single object---immediatelly after completing this &quot;maneuver&quot;, it completely &quot;vanished&quot; into thin air and it did not reappear again anywhere in the skies. There was absolutely no sound or echo indicating an explosion or collision, there were no visible trails, or &quot;hot&quot; sparks/debris falling anywhere on the ground landscape, nor could we see any surface fire coming out of the desert landscape below at that distance thereafter, which would&apos;ve indicated any sort of accident happening in the skies and over that part of the desert. My friend and I sat there for about 5-10 minutes both, perplexed and excited at what we&apos;d seen. We asked ourselves a number of questions in an attempt to make sense of what we&apos;d witnessed  (i.e.: was it fireworks?...was it a satellite?...could it have been spotlights...missiles?) but, we couldn&apos;t arrive at a rational answer on what we saw that night. The entire episode lasted approximately 30 seconds and although I had a digital camera with me, unfortunately I could not retrieve it out of it&apos;s case, and power it up quickly enough to capture the event in the limited time as it happened. Afterwards, we started the engine, and quickly got back on the road back to our motel.", "Triangle Craft Spotted  in early hours moving silently above treetops.I have not spoken to many people about this sighting.  I am a commercial rated pilot.  Short and sweet, I saw a very dark triangle in the Merriam Park area of St, Paul, MN, around August of 2003.  I was picking up my girlfriend to give her a ride to work at about 5 am in a very populated area when I spotted a black triangle in the sky at approx. 500-1000 ft above ground level.  It moved from east to west. I immediately identified it as a ufo because it had only 3 lights, one at each corner of it&apos;s triangle shape. All three lights were white.  The lights were not bright and were pointed down. I opened my window and heard no noise, just silence.  I tried to follow it, but could not keep up in the city block grid system.  I estimate that it was moving at about 30mph.  I have heard that there has been ongoing activity in this area of the Twin Cities for some years.  Some claim that the river is an attractive spot to these craft.  The nearest airport would depart aircraft in nowhere near this direction and the departing airplanes would have certainly gained thousands of feet of elevation at this distance.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

There were a few visible clouds in that direction but I would not be able to tell how high they were but they were not low clouds..perhaps a couple miles or more in altitude.  As I was scanning the sky, I noticed an minimally bright object maybe a bit brighter than the clouds themselves against the night sky.  It was moving perhaps 2-3 times or so as fast as satellites I&rsquo;ve seen but in a north-northwesterly direction.  I could not tell how big or how far away it was but it seemed to go behind a cloud (as it dimmed).  The cloud seemed thick enough to obscure light though but I could still see the object.  It seemed to be a perfectly circular shape about the brightness of a cloud with fuzzy, out-of-focus edges.  It was about the size of a pencil eraser in an outstretched hand.  It moved quickly, in my estimation and then slowed a bit and changed to a more west-north-west direction and then appeared to speed up and head North-northwest again and it went out of my line of sight over some houses.  I had wondered if my vision was fuzzy initially but I changed my mind about that almost right after I saw the object because directly below the fuzzy circle (at a distance of about 1-1/2 to 2 diameters of the circle) was a small, intermittently flashing amber light.  It did not seem to flash regularly and if I were to guess, each flash was between 1 second to 5 seconds apart.  It seemed to be the same color of amber that I have only seen once before.  After 9-11, the Twin Cities skies were devoid of all aircraft, of course, but I went to look at the quiet sky a day or two afterward and remember seeing the same color of amber light flying above us in the night sky.  It was a couple F-16s patrolling the airspace around us.  We never see F-16s in this area of Minnesota so when I saw that deep amber color and read that F-16s were in the area, I knew it was a special military beacon. I heard no sound from whatever I saw.  My first thought was that I would describe what I saw as a fuzzy white, circular balloon with an intermittently flashing amber light beneath it.  I am curious if anyone else has seen something like this.", "Football-shaped-lit object moving in the skyOk,I went to look out the window for a minute,and then I saw it.It was shaped like a football,with light blue lights all over it, and one big light at the end.It was about 9-9;30 at night, and very cloudy and warm. It was moving kinda slow through the clouds..then it hovered for a moment.I could not believe what I was seeing..After a minute more,it kept going across the sky toward the nursing home.That&apos;s when I called my son to hurry, and he came running,and caught a glimpse of it.While it was still moving across the sky, my son and I ran outside to find it, but, strangely enough, it disappeared!

Had just finished watching  &ldquo;Touched By An Angel &ldquo; It was warm and a soft breeze had been blowing.  It was twilight, not light, but not dark, the stores had just closed and people were still out, most likely heading home.One of my cats, &quot;Patches,&quot; now deceased,  was acting strangely and wanted out, so I went to the door and followed her out and glanced at the sky in front of the house.Then I saw it.. a large craft kind of oval in shape, about the size of a car, could not make out the shape, it was diffused light, off in the distance, moving very slowly and seemingly very low altitude towards me.  My husband came out to see what I was looking at and I pulled him down the sidewalk, away from the artificial lights of the house, we were standing by the edge of the house, near the garage. We both noticed that the light in the craft was golden in color, and was flickering like a candle.  All the sudden, the entire craft, ship, blew up, I screamed.Pieces of it blew up, down, and sideways, we could watch the metal burning, and dripping, as I watched the pieces fall, still burning to below the tree line and out of sight. There was no sound..I ran for the phone and called 911 and reported a &ldquo; plane &ldquo; might have blown up.  Then I heard sirens and said &lsquo; Oh someone already had reported this to you? The 911 operator said  &ldquo; No, it was an accident on the bridge, &ldquo; I said, they probably saw what we did and ran into the wall of the bridge.  So I did report the explosion.Then I called our local airport tower, and no planes were reported in trouble.  I called the military in Portland Oregon because they have a helicopter wing NG in Salem , again no planes or choppers missing or in trouble.  I called PDX and reported it to the tower in Portland , and  then I called SeaTac in Seattle area and again reported the incident. Nothing, but they did take my name in case something or someone ended up not arriving at their destination. I even called Evergreen Helicopters which is located about 28 miles from Salem and again, nothing was reported out of the ordinary.Early the 2nd day / morning sometime after midnight, I was so frustrated that I decided to take a chance and called for the number of Cheyenne Mountain in CO.NORAD might be able to tell me something I called and was very fortunate to have a Air Force man take the call, and explained my reason for the call and he promised to look into it and call me back, I thought I would not hear from him again.  I said, &quot;it could be a asteroid or something&quot;, but I really needed to know what it was I saw.  So as promised, he called back several hours later.He said &ldquo; according to their reports/records, nothing man made entered the Earth&apos;s  atmosphere at that time.&rdquo; I said &ldquo; You mean it was a asteroid or something ? &ldquo; He said &ldquo; You are not listening to me,  NOTHING MAN MADE and he accented the words MAN MADE,  ENTERED THE EARTHS ATMOSPHERE AT THE TIME OF YOUR SIGHTING.&rdquo; Then it dawned on me he was telling me what I needed to know.  He asked if there was anything further he could do, I said no and thanked him and we hung up.  What was this sighting.. Was it a small craft? Did it blow up or was it shot down?  We watched the molten metal falling, where was it from?   Why didn&rsquo;t we hear anything?  It seemed a few mere miles away.. how far away was it?  Why didn&rsquo;t someone else report this?  5/30/1998", "fireball over brownsburg indianaAt about 6 am, my husband was leaving for work, when he saw a fireball in the sky. He quickly ran and grabbed the camara, and taped about a minute of video of what looked like a flame, or ball of fire, floating in the sky. There was no sound accompanying it. My husband is a very skeptical, CPA, who doesn&apos;t believe in anything he can not see, so for him to watch this, much less video the incident, is a huge sign that is was something very strange. He had to leave to get to work on time, but as he drove he kept looking for it. After floating along slowly, suddenly it was gone. It was definately nothing we have ever seen before, and doesn&apos;t appear to be man-made.", "Unknown amount of lights appearing over town of Stanardsville, VA then flying high and coming down.At approximately 10:00 pm flashes of light started appearing above a line of trees over the town of Stanardsville, Virginia.

I&apos;d just like to share my version in a hope it helps shed some light. On the night it happened I was outside our temporary accommodation at a site we were sharing with the Russian army. I was sitting at a table on a patio area we had knocked up watching a DVD on a portable player.The night was very clear and warm. Most of the other lads were either at the gym or the bar. Shortly before the event I was joined by a mate (I don&apos;t remember who unfortunately) who sat down to watch the DVD.At some point I leaned back on my chair and stretched my arms out behind me facing straight up at the sky. When I did so the first thing I remember seeing was a big patch of &quot;starless&quot; sky. This freaked me out straight away but within the next second it became apparent that the patch was triangular in shape because it was moving. This made me realise that it was not the stars that were missing but something massive, black and silent moving in front of them as at the front of the point of the triangle the stars were disappearing while at the back they were re-appearing.It was hard to judge whether the object was small and close or large and far away because of the lack of sound. My initial reaction and with hindsight I would say that it was a massive object simply because of the amount of stars it was blanking out as it moved across the sky and also the speed which it travelled. If it was a small object it was moving FAR too slowly to stay airborne surely. If I had to estimate, i would say that this thing was at least 500 meters and most likely a kilometer wide at an altitude of around 5-8000 ft.As it passed silently over the mountain horizon I turned to my mate who was also looking up and asked &quot;did you see that?&quot; he replied &quot;yes, what was it?&quot;. He had followed my gaze at the sky and witnessed the same thing.The next day I casually asked my commanding officer if there were any stealth aircraft being flown in the area and he said he didn&apos;t think so. I&apos;d seen stealth bombers and fighters before and I know it definitely was not one of those I saw. It had no navigation lights for one thing.I have only just got round to looking into this and just recently googled &quot;black triangle ufo&quot; and was amazed at the amount of reports I found. Although it would be awesome to know it was of alien origin, it seems to me (from what I have read) that it could well be a very secret military transport((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

As I was at about at the 15-20 mile mark south of the town in live in I noticed a weird sight  in the sky on the west side of the highway. I have always been  interested in aircraft and very much in touch with the sky and those things that occupy it.  I had seen the moon hang really low in the sky before in this part of the country and first thought it was weird for it to be out and so low this soon in the evening so I started staring  at it.  It looked like a planet or rock just suspended  in the sky and as I stared ,it appeared to begin moving upward and just when I started thinking it could be the moon rising or something of a rational reason it rotated and a reflection of light from the setting sun bounced off of what appeared to be a bronze window or panel part of it.  I kept staring at it and trying to keep my vehicle in my lane while watching this thing as long as I can and every time I looked at the road in front of me and return my attention back to where it was just a few seconds ago, I had to find it again because it had moved higher each time.  I was excited and also trying to reason as to why it would be hear and then I realized that it was directly east of the nuclear power plant that was about 10-15 miles west of me and the highway I was on. It was as though the plant was being observed.

As we stood at the &quot;Archery range Observation point&quot; My attention was drawn to the color effects on a cloud bank by the setting sun. In the sky at that time were several identifiable objects, two airliners with visible contrails and an ultralight aircraft. What caught my attention however was a very bright almost teardrop shaped &quot;light&quot; that seemed to remain stationary below the cloud bank. At first i thought it was the setting sun reflection of a third airliner, however the other two did not display such a bright reflection, nor did their contrails. The ultra light craft was on the opposite side of the sky and much much lower in altitude. I did manage to capture the light on my digital camera, though the photograph is rather inconclusive. I also had the opportunity to view it through my binoculars.It appeared to be somewhat spherical with what looked like an upward &quot;trident&quot; glow or aura. I have sketches in my field notes. the entire &quot;sighting&quot; took roughly 3 or 4 minutes before the object disappeared behind the distant tree line.

We had already witnessed two orange orbs in the same area about a month ago so I looked up and a few seconds later I saw one for myself except it was a &ldquo;boomerang&rdquo; shaped craft with 5 orange lights; one at the tip, one on each end and one on the center of each &ldquo;arm&rdquo; it was difficult to tell how high it was flying but I would guess approx. 3,000-4,000 feet, about as high as the local mountains. It was larger than an airplane; next to a full moon I would estimate it to be about a sixth of the size. It flew NW and disappeared into the clouds. I kept looking up into the sky when we both saw another (or the same, I&rsquo;m not sure) object flying NE, then from the opposite direction one of the same size and shape came towards it, I thought they were going to collide but they instead seemed to merge into each other and become one larger object which then changed shape; the orange lights on both objects began to sort of swirl around then the craft(s) took on a double diamond shaped appearance before flying off in a NW direction.We then went back to our apartment about 7 blocks away; once there I witnessed another chevron or &ldquo;boomerang&rdquo; shaped object flying south through the sky from our front patio. At that point we decided to get our digital camera to try and record the objects and went back outside. I saw the chevron shaped object at least two other times, once flying north and then south. At this point we went outside to the street for a better view. A couple of minutes later I witnessed another chevron shaped object that appeared to be larger and flying lower than the others. It also had the orange lights on the bottom, more than the first, however this time the lights seemed to be moving in a very coordinated pattern, as I watched the lights seemed to swirl around each other in circles.

I had seen the UFO heading south toward California and it was seen by the others over Medford near the California border, later that same morning.After this sighting when I heard others talking about it on the radio and read about it in the paper, I decided to call Peter Davenport,at the National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle, Peter had been up most all night taking reports with all the sightings in Medford and was very tired and did not have time to take the report, or at least this is what I believe that he said.  I took it personally and thought I would never call Peter again (not Peters&rsquo; fault, just my own judgment of the situation. I was helping out a friend in a small store here and told her about it and was still smarting at how Peter had treated me, or I thought he had treated me, and told her about that too.Anyway I was home watching TV, my husband was about to go to bed, he is needs lots of sleep.. he reminded me to lock the back door and put the stick in it.. that way if the cats get ancy we can open the patio door, put a stick in it and let them go in and out at will... anyway I said I would, and did, and he went to bed and I lay down on the couch and was out like a light, fully dressed/shoes too The next thing I remember was waking up and seeing it was time to feed the cats, it was about 7AM.. my husband was in his computer room and the back door was open, the stick had been removed, I got up, fed cats and my husband and was relaxing watching TV news with my second cup of coffee, when the phone rang and it was &lt;former boss&gt;, she was calling me to see if I was alright, and to ask me about the lights, I said you mean the ones I saw the other night? She said NO the ones you saw this morning.. I said I did not see any lights this morning and she said Yes you did, she again said are you OK?   I said YES I was fine, why wouldn&apos;t I be.. she said after your call this morning about the lights, I said what call, she said the one you made to me early this morning, she said you left me a message.. I wanted to hear it but she had erased it not thinking about it, but had listened to the message numerous times and had written it down verbatim&apos; and signed the paper.. this is what she said the message said... (my remarks)  &lt;name&gt;, this is CK, I&apos;m really sorry to call you at this time, it is 2:40 AM, in the morning, I am out by North Salem High School ( this is about 3 miles from my home) and I have been watching a bright light in the sky for about 45 minutes.If you know Peter Davenports number or one who does that sort of thing down here (In Salem) they need to be called. I am looking south and a little east and the large light is very bright, too big to be a star. There are 3 smaller lights in a line down one side and I can see two in a line down the other side, but there may be a third one, I can&apos;t see from here. It hasn&apos;t moved. If you know who investigates these please call them and tell them the information because there is no way this is stars..End of recording/message..I told &lt;name&gt; that she was kidding, right? she said &quot;No I swear its true&quot;  I asked her where I called from, she said she did not know, but that when I was done I did not say goodbye or anything, the line just went totally blank/dead, and it had a empty tinny sound.I called my husband into the living room and asked him when he took the stick out of the patio door? He said I thought you did, the door was open when I got up about 6:00 AM.. I ran to the front door, and it was closed but unlocked, it had been locked and a separate latch used, that was also open.. then I went into the driveway, scared of what I would find, and there was my car, parked on the opposite side of the driveway than I usually park.. I was terrified.. Where had I been, what had I done?  I asked my husband did you get up to go to the bathroom last night? He is usually up 2-3 times a night, NO he said for some reason he had not awakened till just before he got up..I grabbed my purse and drove over to the high school, I got out of the car near the football field and walked over to the fence surrounding the field, trying to remember what I might have seen, did anything trigger a memory, and all that happened was that I got very dizzy, but walked around looking for some clue as to what had happened.. I remember looking for a tan shingled roof I had been standing near and wanted to check that out on the letter from &lt;name&gt;and was very surprised to see she/I had not mentioned any such roof or color of shingles in the message so it must have been a memory of the event..the only one I have had of that night.I am fortunate to know a lot of UFO researchers and I immediately called my old friend Dr Leo Sprinkle who works with abductees, some researchers or psychologists make the event scary, but if Dr Sprinkle does the same interview the abduction becomes a positive experience not a negative one, a learning experience.I was terrified about what could have happened... what if I would have had a car accident? a flat tire? How would I explain being out driving alone at 2:40 AM?   Dr Sprinkle pointed out that I was likely totally alert and in control till I got home and that is when they took remove any  memory of what happened..This still haunts me and I still check the doors several times during the evening hours to be sure they are locked. For over a year I had slept fully dressed in a sweat suit complete with shoes etc.Note: Peter is always open and willing to listen to urgent reports. I just took his being tired personally and that was my problem, not Peters&rsquo; short coming.

My girl friend witnessed it as it passed to her front and above. If it was not a Tomahawk, (which is what I could have sworn it was) I have no idea what it was. The size was difficult to determine again due to the speed, but the fact I witnessed it and judging from the road and surrounding area I would speculate it was the same size as a Tomahawk or larger, most likely larger (it is difficult to see a Tomahawk at full speed passing directly in front of you). I looked at my girlfriend and she at me. She said what he fuck was that? I did not want to poison her thought process and simply asked her what she saw. She thought she saw a missile and kept asking me why would a missile be going over the highway and where is going and so on. I explained I did not know any of that and told her maybe it was a test rocket or such. To this day it troubles me whatever it was.

I felt a small charge of static electricity in the air, as if I rubbed a balloon on my hair.These details seem unimportant to me, but as you said to include everything, I will.The object appeared suddenly, without any prior indication of an approaching object.According to reliable sources aurora were particularly far-reaching that year.There is an EXTREMELY SMALL possibility that the object released a water craft, because I saw a long, thin object in the water, however it was mos likely a Barracuda.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We were talking, walking slowly, just killing time and he pointed to the sky in the distance (I&apos;d say about a half a mile away) at treetop level and said &quot;Do you see wings on that plane?&quot;  I looked up and saw a cigar shaped &quot;thing&quot; in the sky...it wasn&apos;t moving like any airplane I&apos;ve ever seen...it sort of hovered, going forward and drifting backward and side to side in no particular order, it just hung in the sky sort of. We watched it begin to move forward at a slow rate and moved ourselves to the middle of the track to get a better look...when we got there it was gone completely. I said something like &quot;we lost it&quot; and my friend said, loudly &quot;there it is&quot;  and pointed directly over our heads.We heard no sound, none of the distinctive &quot;trails&quot; that accompany airplanes...nothing.  It was the same shape, still &quot;hovering&quot; and an iridescent color...vaugely pink, sort of silver-metallic....kind of an indefinite shape, still cigar shaped but the edges weren&apos;t really defined, like a glob of mercury (if you can imagine...sounds crazy, I know)this time it was much higher in the sky than before. We stood  transfixed for about 5 minutes as it slowly drifted into one direction and was gone from our sight. We both sat down on a bench and asked each other what we thought it was, &quot;can you believe it?!&quot; and all that stuff.

Then it would go back to the original circle shape. I thought I saw what looked to be an orange flame or light emit from the bottom of the circle but I cannot be sure,it seemed to only last milaseconds.All the time I watched the object it only seemed to move slightly from left to right and possibly went slowly up over the entire time.There was no sound from the object as a plane or helicopter.It was dead silent.I took a couple pictures with my digital camera but they are not great photos at the distance was to far for this type of camera. I will send them to you anyway.After watching it for 45 minutes I went to my computer to see if anything was reported to be in the sky at that time but could find no info.When I went back to check on the object a few minutes later it was gone.I&apos;m a 55 year old retired male.

As I reached up to close the camper shell&apos;s back window, I noticed a bright light almost directly overhead. I also noticed it was moving slowly to the Northeast. It was brighter than Arcturus, which is also about overhead at this time, and brighter than the usual aircraft which fly overhead, so I listened for the sound of a jet, which usually accompanies &apos;normal&apos; aircraft that fly overhead. Although many are high altitude flights, the sound still should have been audible by that point. There was no sound, and the single point of light was not blinking, so I thought that perhaps it was something other than a commercial or military flight, perhaps a very reflective satellite - although I&apos;d never seen one this bright - and started counting about 5 seconds after it passed the zenith. I continued counting and moving across the street as it went behind pine trees to observe it until it disappeared over the mountains to the Northeast, at an altitude of about 15 - 20 degrees above true horizon. The heading (ref&apos;d to true north) was estimated at about 40 degrees. The speed seemed very steady throughout the sighting. Altogether the sighting lasted for a count of 127 seconds, from just past zenith to disappearance over the horizon. It took about 10 seconds to gather my tools, go inside and check the time on an &apos;atomic clock&apos;, which showed 20:33:45. There was no sound from the object at all, the apparent brightness was approximately between that of Jupiter and Venus in the early morning sky and did not fluctuate much, if at all. There was no discernable blinking light, just a steady white color. It did not change noticeably in brightness from overhead to disappearance, as a commercial or military flight usually does - i.e. when the forward lights are blocked by the rest of the jet or plane. The sky was clear of clouds, and although the sunset is &apos;officially&apos; at 19:40 at this latitude, the mountains su! rroundin g the valley give us a sunset at about 19:15 and dusk lasts about an hour .

I had just taken out my mums dogs for a last walk for the night.  I got as far as the driveway when I typically looked up.  It was a beautiful night and the sky was clear, no moon, no wind.  the amount of sky i was looking at varied considerably because of trees, powerlines other houses to include my own.  as I started to walk a blink of light caught my eye out of the west.  I didn&apos;t think much of it at first because it was quite a distance in altitude.  But then I saw what appeared to be the same blinking light again only this time it was in a different place in sky.  When I say blinking the light would momentarily go out and it would reappear in another part of the sky. So if you can imagine I was piviting from right to left watching this light make a perfect square in the sky.  So at every corner point it would reappear at the next corner. Finally upon completing a perfect square it shot off to the north at incredible speed to the point it left a shimmering trail that did not last long. The amount of sky that this light covered was to say the least amazing. The speed in which it completed the square no past nor present aircraft could make those kind of manuevers.  I was 13 at the time.  I have since completed 20 years in the Air Force and I can tell I know as I did then as I do know now the dynamics of aircraft.  This was no terrestrial aircraft.  I believe while watching this light I was encountering an intelligence.  This part in unexplainable on my part, but I just felt as if the movements of this light had a purpose.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Oval shaped orange glows / craft travelling in sky in slow straight linesWEIRD BRIGHT ORANGE GLOWING OVAL SHAPES JUST AFTER MIDNIGHT ON NEW YEARS EVE, 31.12.08.And no!! I had not been drinking alcohol to see in the New Year!!!!!  Just pulling the bedroom curtains to go to bed, looked outside (facing towards South) looking and listening for celebration fireworks for the occasion.Saw to my left (South by South East) 4 very bright orange glows, in a straight line, not line abreast, moving slowly across the sky, but not very high up, about a few hundred feet up, possibly a few miles from my location, as if from the general direction of Portsmouth or the Isle of Wight travelling towards Southampton and the Docks area. The glows were not travelling at high speed but fairly slowly in a straight line, spaced wide apart, so were not fireworks or flares as far as I was concerned.I had never ever seen anything like this on this planet. They had no flashing coloured lights like you would see on aircraft / helicopters.I couldn&apos;t believe my eyes, as I could not work out what this was. I did not understand it.I ran outside to get a further look, but when I got to the front of the house, they had gone, .BUT then I saw several more spaced apart to the east coming over the trees at the back of my house, again in slow straight lines generally towards Southampton city area and again, a few hundred feet up in the sky. I could not make out any solid shapes, like metalwork, they were just very bright orange glows.I ran in to get my girlfriend outside to look with me, but when I returned outside, again they had disappeared, BUT then I saw a few more much further away over Southampton, again travelling slowly across the sky in straight lines, not in curved arcs, until they too suddenly disappeared.The sky was clear with a few clouds.The glows travelled quite a distance, maybe a couple of miles before disappearing. If they were fireworks / flares then they were of a type I have never seen and how did they travel such distances in straight lines across the sky instead of up and down. The glows were very large, perhaps the size of a craft but very difficult to work out in terms of distance away and true size.I got annoyed with my girlfriend as she refused to come and look.That experience stuck with me for weeks, as it was so ,;extra terrestrial&amp;#8217; as far as I am concerned from my experiences on this planet so far. There was no noise with them either like you would hear from aircraft / helicopters.SO THAT WAS THE END OF THAT&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;UNTIL&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230; At about 22.30 hrs on Monday, 15.6.09. I was driving an ambulance from Southampton to Totton area, along the road towards the Rushington roundabout, having just finished my last job.I saw ahead of me a few hundred feet up, what I initially thought was an odd looking lamppost light, which didn&apos;t match the others along the road. They were bright white, but this was bright orange. I then realised that this glow was higher up and further away in the background, as if over Cadnam area.I strained to work it out as I continued driving, then realised that it was moving in my general direction across the sky, slowly in a straight line. I quickly wound the window down to see if there was any aircraft noise but it was moving silently AND it was the same type of shape and glow as what I experienced on 1.1.09. as described above.It was SO WEIRD that I suddenly pulled up on the side of the road. As I did this it slowly passed directly overhead at a height of about a few hundred feet only!!!!!!! I strained to look out through my windscreen at the top as it passed over, but as it did, I DEFINITELY SAW A VERY BROAD AND FLAT SILVER GREY METAL SHAPE OF SOME SORT OF AIRCRAFT WITHIN THE VERY BRIGHT ORANGE GLOW. THIS WAS NOT AN AIRPLANE OR A HELICOPTER AND IT HAD NO FLASHING LIGHTS AND NO ACCOMPANYING NOISE.I jumped out of the ambulance to see if it was still above me but it had passed by and I saw it continue moving slowly in a straight line away from me towards Southampton. Again, I could not believe my eyes. The colour and shape of the glow was the same as at New Year. I could not work out what I was seeing, but it was MOST MOST MOST DEFINITELY A FLYING CRAFT OF SOME SORT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I jumped back into the ambulance and continued to drive now along the A326 towards Fawley. I looked out and saw the orange glow now a much further distance away and higher up in the sky but it was now moving in a slow straight line as if towards Romsey from Southampton. Then it disappeared. A couple of minutes after this, I saw it again, but this time it was high up again, but moving from the general area of Southampton Docks, south and east as if towards Portsmouth or the Isle of White along the line of Southampton Water. I never saw it again that night.I cannot say whether it was the same craft on the three occasions seen this evening, or whether it was three craft in different locations over the area.This occurrence has stuck with me ever since, BUT THE FANTASTIC THING IS&amp;#8230;.on the radio the next day (WAVE 105 F.M.) I heard reports that other people had seen these orange glows in the Solent sky that same night before, SO I WAS NOT GOING MAD as there were other witnesses to it!!!! However, the report stated that this was being written off as a meteor shower!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I thought meteors were small white momentary streaks in the sky, like shooting stars up in space!!?? WHAT I SAW WAS ABSOLUTELY NOT A METEOR SHOWER, BUT A REAL LIFE EVENT INVOLVING A MOVING CRAFT OF SOME SORT!!!!!! DID ANYONE ELSE SEE WHAT I SAW???????????????????????????? I know what I saw and witnessed and I believe in U.F.O.s.The human race in my opinion would be very na&iuml;ve indeed, if we think that we are the only living life forms in the Milky Way, Galaxy, Solar System, Universe etc etc.If such craft as reported as being seen moving at incredible speeds across the sky exist, then that suggests to me that they are also capable of travelling FAR FAR greater distances in speed and space than we have so far achieved from this planet. So I reckon that far superior life forms on other planets we have not yet reached in travel, can reach us already!!!! Reporter is a retired police officer and current ambulance driver.

I am a housewife who has been interested in UFO&apos;s since young and my husband flies planes for CAP. My husband has never seen anything like this before. It was sometime between 8pm and 10 pm when I went onto the back deck behind my home and noticed a very strange light in the sky. I had seen it the night before in almost the same position at almost the same time.  Last night, it was again in almost the same place.  There are no towers of any sort in that place.  The light seemed to turn colors.  It seemed to change from white to blue to red and green.  It stayed in the same place for at least 45 minutes.  I went in after that as it was too cold to stay out and keep watching it.  I got some of it on video and I would be more than happy to share that with you if you wish to see it. When I zoomed in with my camera the light seemed to have a haze about it and it appeared to wiggle, although my hands were very steady. It appeared to be changing shape or size.  It was very difficult to see considering I was only using a camera. While taping the object, I noticed at least 3 other lights, perhaps up to 10 or more, going across the sky.  I cannot say for sure what those other lights were.  They appeared to be much smaller in size and white in color.  They appeared out of nowhere and would sometimes fly past the main light or in other directions in the sky.  They would fly very quickly by and then disappear or fly out of sight.  They blinked.  At one point, I saw a light fly across the sky that was bright orange.  It also blinked.  Later, I saw another light fly across the sky flashing red and white lights. I am not an astronomer, so I cannot say for sure what I saw.  I have tried finding this information on the internet to no avail.  I know that these lights are not like anything I have ever seen.  If anyone knows what I saw, please let me know.  It is bothering me.  My h! usband s aid that the main light was the space station.  However, I looked this information up on the internet and found that the space station does not sit still in one place nor does it change color.

We ran to the front of the house to continue to watch it. It was moving so fast I did not have time to grab a camera.The object seemed to be traveling around 20,000 feet in the air. It made no sound whatsoever. It had no noticeable wings. It seemed more roundish than disk shaped. There was no exhaust, but there seemed to be a very strange long object hanging straight down from it. Almost like the tail of a kite.

The tail was also very faint and hard to see in comparison to the very shiny object.This occurred on Saturday, May 30 at around 6:25 pm. It traveled the length of the sky in no more than a couple of minutes. It was heading in a southern direction from Yardley. It is a very clear day with sporadic white clouds.

I was on a Delta Airlines flight that left Mumbai and connected in CDG airport in Paris, France. I was in a busines class seat that had the option of watching the plane&apos;s location on a GPS map on the seat-back in front of me. It was dark and in the middle of the night; most everyone on the flight was sleeping at the time.I had a right window seat near the front of the plane. Since I have trouble sleeping on planes, I routinely looked at the GPS and then out the window. The route took us north through Iran, then turns left at Tehran and heads NW towards Europe. While still heading north through Iran (before Tehran), I noticed a light to the right of the plane, not too far away (less than 1 mile I&apos;d guess), and slightly behind us. It was a white light, but soon it pulsed into a green light, then pulsed into a red light. It alternated between those 3 colors, but sometimes appearing yellow. It did not change colors in an pattern (white, red, green, red, white, green, yellow, green, white, and so on), nor were the times in a patern...sometimes it would go 10 seconds before turning colors, other times it would go 2-3 seconds.It was definitely pacing our plane, but would sometimes pull even with us nd other times fall back a bit. It was flying at the same altitude.Since Iran is hostile to the US, I began to get concerned that perhaps it was a military aircraft with malicious intent. I got the attention of a flight attendant and pointed it out to her. She too was surprised to see the other craft. She said she&apos;d ask the Captain about it. At that point I&apos;d seen it for perhaps 15 minutes, and then we began the left bank to head towards Europe - we were over Tehran. The light fell back and out of sight. As we straightened out and began an even flight again, I kept looking back. Sure enough, about 5 minutes later the light reappeared, catching up to a spot in about the 4 o&apos;clock position. It continued to pulse and change colors.  As the pre-dawn light started to lighten up I thought I could make out a shape...it looked like a rounded triangle - kind of like a football, cut in half, tip up.  The lights apeared to be spinning with the craft, but very slowly.The flight attendant returned and said the Captain was too busy to discuss it at length, but he wasn&apos;t aware of any other aircraft flying with us and he couldn&apos;t see it when he looked (maybe we had just turned).  I pointed it out to her again, and she gave a &quot;hmmm&quot;, then added she was sure it was nothing to worry about.I continued to watch the thing for a combined hour....then suddenly it quite changing color and remained a bright white for perhaps a minute, then blacked out and I couldn&apos;t see it. As the sky totally lightened up over the next hour or so,I continued to watch for it but never saw it again.I&apos;ve done that flight route over 15 times, both before and after that event, and have only seen the thing that one time.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We were evacuees from Hurricane Rita. It was a  very rural area, our nearest neighbor was the Lutheran Church in Noack, which I do not believe is an official &quot;town,&quot; but more of the name of the area. All there is in Noack is a church and a bar, and nothing else. The nearest decent-sized town was Taylor, Texas.One afternoon, shortly after taking up residence, I was taking clothes off the clothesline, as we had no appliances yet. I was facing south, and when I turned around, there was something hovering over the house. It looked like a shirt box, like the kind you use to wrap a present. It looked EXACTLY like a  plain-jane, no-name shirt box. Nothing else. Just a shirt box. It looked proportionate to a shirtbox, and seemed to be hovering about 40 feet over the roof. It could have been larger or higher, but it is hard to tell with no reference whatsoever. It just didn&apos;t seem to be very high up.I looked at it for a minute or two, not believing my own eyes. There was no sound. As I stared at it, I realized it was not hovering, but very slowly moving from a Northeasterly direction towards the Southwest. The day was clear and crisp, and the sky was cloudless and very blue.I hollered at the other 6 other evacuees, who all came outside and confirmed the sight I was seeing. We stared at it a while, and the others  got bored, it moved so slow, and they went back in the house.I watched it glide at a snail&apos;s pace over the house, across the side yard, and off over the pastures to the West of the house. It took a long time. It was very boring, I admit, but it just made no sense whatsoever, and I was fascinated. It never sped up, turned, or moved up or down elevation. It just kept gliding silently over the house and yard, and over the pastures.It happened nearly 5 years ago, and I still remember it like it was yesterday.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We were on the beach in Milford,CT and watched the object move across Long Island sound starting at West Haven beach area moving towards Long island, NY and then disappearing into thin air what seemed to be half way across long island sound. The reason I know it was not a firework or a flare is because it lasted 10-15 min. around 30 min went by and then we saw the same thing happen again almost like a recording of what we just saw.

I could not hear any sound coming from it. I knew at this point I was observing something unusual and became excited. Then after maybe 5 to 10 seconds of it being in a stationary position the object then dimmed out in a what I can only describe as a controlled, steady manner, and I could no longer see it.Almost a day later I am still very excited over it.

It was now visible thru the front windshield of the truck by me and it was rising at an angle of about 30 degrees when there was a whitish flash and then it started slowing down and dropping altitude again. it was flickering in intensiity then the light just went out.

After another 15-20 seconds of invisibility, it slowly increased brightness until it was easily visible again with the sun shining bright and still plenty high in the sky (more than three hours before sunset).It was far too high in the sky to make out a shape. There was no apparent color (just white light). It moved approximately twice the distance of pinky to thumb spread as far apart as possible on an outstretched arm in the duration of our observation - approximately 15-20 minutes. This distance was somewhat consistent with the movement of some light clouds at high altitude in the jetstream, although it moved slightly slower than the clouds.

The 2 objects shot through the sky in parallel about a pencil length apart and appeared simply as flying dots of light in the sky no bigger than a large star before changing shape into a sort of bird like object.There is a crop circle formation that bears a striking resemblance to the shape of what we saw at the following website:  http://shrey27.wordpress.com/2008/05/24/crop-circles-art-on-crop-fields/crop-circles-014/  During the transition of shape the color began to look more like a glowing tan or yellow hazy, misty color  They were so synchronized in their movements and transitions that I wondered if one wasnt a reflection of the other.From my location they originated at a nearly 60 degree + angle and towards the NorthWest.  They moved in a sort of elongated V or sharp hook pattern and disappeared to the NorthEast.  They appeared to get larger until they were finally out of sight.All in all this sighting lasted maybe 5 or 6 seconds and was fast enough that my girlfriend completely missed it as she was staring a different direction and couldn&apos;t catch the glimpse.My reaction was literally &quot;WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT! Seriously, what the fuck was that? What was that...&quot; I stood there in shook as I was dumbfounded how my girlfriend could have missed something that obvious.While she watched the sky I ran inside to see what time it was and my PC said 11:28.So we stared at the sky thinking about how great it would be if we could both see it together and after about 15 minutes something appeared again.This time we both saw it.  2 &quot;dove&quot; shaped objects flying from the NorthWest toward the SouthWest.  These 2 objects were much closer together, approximately the length of an eraser tip on a pencil, and flew in a very strange pattern:  First they were side by side, then the synchronistically flew away from each other and back toward each other as if to draw out a vase sort of shape in the sky.Before flying out of sight I could see them veer a sharp &quot;left&quot; as if they were right on top of each other and I was able to follow these for a much greater distance than the previous sighting.My girlfriend and I were absolutely amazed and talked about how these objects had a very strange &quot;bird like&quot; appearance and almost glowed.I ran inside immediately after I lost sight of them to check the time and it was 11:43.  I grabbed a pen and paper and recorded a couple notes and the time and went back to watching the sky.7 minutes later at 11:50 we witnessed a mass formation of 5 to 6 objects flying in single file order but making snake like movements across the sky while maintaining a very tight, smooth, formation.  This was by far the most exciting and heart racing sighting.These objects seemed to appear out of no where and were spotted slightly lower in the sky than the previous 2 sightings.Last week I filed a UFO sighting with MUFON because I spotted a very similar object but it was much darker, more like a silhouette and not nearly as clearly defined and illuminated as these objects were.", "Object appears as flash of light in south sky, turns into rotating red light above Kingston OntarioOn the night of June 30th 2009 myself and my mate were walking our dogs at 12:00 midnight to 12:10. Always be interested in the sky and keeping an eye open this night was perfect, clear sky&apos;s the moon just partly lite in the south west sky, when I noticed a glint in the southern sky at about 10 o&apos;clock.I have seen lots of sat&apos;s give up there location to the setting sun glowing brightly and then going out. I watched this to see where it was going and how long it would last. It then got bigger and I figured I was looking at a plane headlight, but then it got longer so I asked my mate, what do you think of this light. She quickly looked up and we both watched as it got brighter and larger, looked like an hour glass to me how far off, no idea but it seemed a great distance, then after about 15 seconds it went out, just sort of a grey outline in the sky, so I thought wow that was some light show, it must be huge to look that bright down here and still seen as an outline (looked to me like a bus flying through space, from where I stood).Then I noticed that there was a red light on the object. I thought, what in orbit would have a red light on it that I could see from here? Then I noticed the red light was moving. It traveled a circular pattern as it it was mounted on the outside and was going around something. The object could not be seen, it was as if it was invisible, but the red light gave it away, It took about 5 seconds for the light to do one revolution, I watched 3, 4 revolutions as the object was directly over head moving towards the North. No sound, nothing, just then I noticed, it was glowing on the top, I could not see the top but the air above it was lite up like the color of a sunset, pink, orange, red, I mentioned, look it&apos;s glowing at the back on top, just then a small orb came off of the larger object, this orb looked like an ember from a hot fire, about the size of a star, and just as bright. It made several loops behind the object (like an ember in the wind) , seemed to follow, but I watched the larger object due to the fact that if you took your eye away you could probably not locate it again, the object continued to the north with the light rotating.The Red light was the red of a tail light in a car or a jet, how fast would it have to have been going to go from sunlight to over my head in 25 seconds, then to the north and back out of sight in another 35 seconds? The circular path the light took was very large, I would say that if you held out a 5 inch disk at arms length it&apos;s about the size of the light path when the object was overhead. The whole event lasted about 50 seconds or so. I have never seen anything like this and I am in my 45th year here on Earth.

It was around dusk, so I was starting to see some of the lights over on Long Island, but it was still too early to see stars. Noticing something out of the corner of my eye, I glanced up and saw a dim, flickering light, hovering about 20 degrees above the horizon southwest from my house. It appeared over the Saybrook breakwater, in the direction of Plum Island, but seemed so dim and distant that it looked much farther- maybe even over Montauk or the Atlantic.  I was confused, because it hadn&apos;t been there when I last looked, less than a minute ago, so it couldn&apos;t be a star.  But it didn&apos;t appear to be moving, so it couldn&apos;t be a plane.  As I watched it, I thought it might be a plane heading towards me. It appeared to move slightly up and to my left (further north from my perspective) and then faded away.  I didn&apos;t see it again.

I was looking at an unusual cloud formation that looked like a a contrail of some sort, that was nearly parallel in height to the jet plane we were in.  The white contrail at first just seemed to stop, which is why I thought it was just a cloud formation.   My daughter was in the window seat, so I asked her to look out the window and tell me if she saw anything unusual.   We both stared out the window and she said she saw 4 dark circles that seemed to be in a boomerang formation.   While she is saying this, I realized that the contrail didn&apos;t just end, it WAS behind 4 dark circles.   Whatever it was, it was flying slower than the plane, so we had had to strain to continue to see it.  Neither of us thought to get a camera and take a picture of it.  It did not appear to be that far away and the circles seemed to be about the size of a thumbnail at arms length.  They were large enough, that if it had been a plane, we should have been able to see some detail, like wings and a fuselage, but they were just dark circles.  It was strange.

Interestingly was it seemed to have a well-defined start and end from a direction of WSW to ENE or a heading of 60 degrees from north.  A very small of indistinguishable shape object in the front seemed to be the source of the smokey emission.After the passing of a minute or so, the apparent emitting object was a visual one-inch at 20-inch arm&rsquo;s length ahead of the trail. The trail appeared to be 4&rdquo; long.  To observe better, we drove under a cross-country power line to give us good visual reference at distance to observe two more features, one of which was the trail and the object appeared not to move for about 2 minutes and contact was lost with the object either as darkness was approaching or just too small to see.  The trail after 5 minutes of observation seemed to begin to break up.  Its total length never appeared to be greater than 4 inches at the 20 inch arm length.The color of the trail was much darker than a jet would have been.My explaination.  The dispersion of the trail gave the appearance of something at altitudes between 5,000 and 50,000 feet running an internal combustion engine with piston that had just broken an oil ring or an oil leak in an engine causing a black smoke to come from the engine until the engine exhausted all its oil and locked up or shut down.  Though the sun had just set, the sky was well bright enough to distinguish this event from a standard jet trail by virtue of the darkness of the apparent smoke.  The other unique feature was the sudden start of the trail and the sudden end to the trail and the extremely small object continuing with a 060 heading after the smoke trail finished.Observer: Twin instrument pilot 2,000 hours BS Physics Engineer 85 employees 64 years old First UFO sighting", "Air force jets trailed by something.At exactly 11pm ET a series of fast moving objects crossed the night sky East to West - counted at least 2 but maybe more...could have been air force jets from the sound that could be heard.

It was a very bright light and it was still stationary about 40 degrees over the horizon.I sat outside and watched the light, comparing it to the few other stars that were shining.

It was not a smooth bottom, it had some kind of curved ridge along the centre underneath.  I could clearly see the shape with the binoculars.

One came from approx. NE direction and the came from a more easterly direction.  I could hear them coming and see their blinking lights.  As they flew over, I could barely see the wing pattern.  They were clearly following the first object and moving very fast.If the jets were at the same altitude as the first object then I would have to say the first object was massive.

I live in a small city of 22,000, and the mercury vapor streetlights were on.  I was driving north toward my driveway when I noticed lights in the rear view mirror.The first thought was they were police lights &ndash; flashing red and blue, that they were at a distance since they were obscured, somewhat blurry, and their were several of them, perhaps seven in a group. By instinct I pulled to the side of the road to avoid the passing (what I thought must be) police cruisers, but there were none. I looked again and the lights were there having not moved.I parked in my driveway and exited the vehicle. Looking due north I observed a flickering group of seven lights in a formation that appeared to be hovering at the horizon what could have been several hundred feet in the air. They moved a bit in an easterly direction but generally were stationary. I heard no sounds of any kind from that direction, and probably the objects were too far away to have been heard.I observed the lights for fifteen minutes, excused it as swamp gas, and drove the car down the driveway and put in into the garage. I did not mention it to anyone, only several days later in conversation with an individual I worked with the topic of some strange lights came up, and she too had seen them. She described them as I had seen them, only she saw them to the north from her home in Akron, Ohio &ndash; some thirty miles northeast of Alliance. Multi-colored hovering in a group moving slowly.We &lsquo;thought&rsquo; perhaps the lights might have been over Lake Erie, but Alliance is too far south from Lake Erie &ndash; sixty miles, the curvature of the Earth too great &ndash; yet she observed them north of her location. I thought at the time the lights were swamp gas above the now closed Superfund site at Willowcreek, at the intersection of rt. 224 and rt. 225 in Portage County, Ohio where several large landfills are located. The intersection is about eight miles north of Alliance. Nothing ever was reported in the local newspaper, The Alliance Review, but that is considered not surprising as it would have been considered bad for advertising and well beyond the scope of the newspaper.The lights shimmered, were round but the edges were obscured and fluctuated. They were brightly colored white, red, and blue. A resemblance would be when a very bright light is refracted through heavy crystal or diamond resulting in brief flecks of pure color. The objects did not wisp away and were not dissipated by winds, but did seem to move in a slow easterly direction.

I took my eye off the batter to look up at an overhead plane, and on the way, I noticed a small object only about 30 feet away over the field.The item was charcoal gray, probably metallic, and in the shape of a toaster.  It was only about one foot in size.  It spun around in circles, but always remained parallel to the ground, and had something similar to a reflector light on a bicycle in the upper right corner, which shined like a dimmed light.  It also had a small amount of haze over it.The item must have came in over the third base side of the stadium, I saw it when it was directly in front of me, and continued its path over the first base side of the stadium, accelerating after leaving the stadium, until out of view.When I first looked at it, I thought it was a garbage bag, floating in the wind, but then realized it couldn&rsquo;t because a garbage bag would roll over rather than remain parallel.  It couldn&rsquo;t have been a balloon, because it was not going in the exact same direction in the wind, nor was it rising at a fast pace or going straight up.I did not bother taking a picture of it, because when I saw it, I thought nothing of it, and when I realized this could be something else, it was too small and too far away to get a good shot with my cell phone camera.

It was about 2 feet in diameter and between 15 and 20 feet off the ground traveling south when I saw it coming from behind my friend. I immediately yelled,&quot;look a boomarang, lets catch it.&quot;  He looked up and saw it and we both waited for it to come down but it continued traveling on a straight steady course and did not come down as we expected it to. We ran and grabbed our sling shots and ran after it. We ran into a large open field behind his house and watched it as it traveled over a tree, which was in the yard of a house about 1 block away.  We knew that a large woods was immediaately behind that house and so we ran across the open field to the woods and then ran about 1 mile through the woods to find out if we could still see the object. We peered out over what was then a city trash dump but could no longer see the object.  It was traveling at about 10 miles per hour when it came between the houses and made no noise what so ever.  The object guided itself to pass immediately over the tree of the house which was one block away.  The object looked to me like a boomarang spinning so fast as to appear as a solid disc, but it may have actually been solid, I don&apos;t know. I chose to classify it as circular instead of disc because I don&apos;t believe it was very thick at all.  My friend still remembers this event today, which is at least 42 years later.

They stayed lit about 20 seconds.About 10 minutes later, as we discussed what it could be, one light, same color appeared, then split in two  in a split second, horizontally, into equal sized round glowing objects stayed lit for maybe 15 seconds and disappeared at the same time.... at this point we knew it wasn&apos;t flares from a ship because the one light split into two horizontally not falling downward towards the ocean....we watched for about another 10 minutes then left the beach.Once we returned to our condo about 3/4 of a mile away we took the dogs out for a walk, and while looking skyward and discussing what we had seen, a pattern of  five white lights, which looked like stars from the brightness &amp; color, began a flashing pattern.  Five lights in no particular arrangement flashing in a sequence... we heard the sound of aircraft but this was no normal plane(s) whatever it was, was flashing  separetly and too close for normal multiple aircraft to be next to each other. The flashing lights appeared to stay in the same spot in the sky.We speculated it could have been some type of military aircraft ( multiple ) flying in some formation. But the rumble we heard was no louder than a normal single plane.This flashing white light pattern lasted about 1 1/2 minutes.. then they disappeared.Not into the distance..they disappeared right where they were.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I-75 southbound (near 96th street exit) I saw a VERY BRIGHT &quot;strip&quot; of white or bluish white light in the sky to the east. This is very close to the approach used for runways at Tulsa International (Rwy. 18L and 18R). I am use to seeing planes approaching to land at the airport in Tulsa, but this WAS NOT an airplane about to land at the airport. It appeared (as best I can tell) to be about 1/4 mile to my east (no way to reference this distance, just a best guess). It had a dark outline I could not identify well, but then lit up with a VERY BRIGHT strip of white light on it&apos;s bottom. The light looked a bit like the expensive xenon headlights used by teenagers in the import cars, as it was almost blue tinted a bit. maybe like a mercury vapor light, but MUCH brighter. It stayed on for about 3/4 of a second and went out, then back on for about 1/4 second. Then, as it was going dark, it started moving away (appeared to be eastbound, but was hard to tell). As soon as the lights went out, I lost sight of it&apos;s dark outline and the sighting was over. If i were to guess, i would say this strip of light was at least 100 feet long, but I could see no real shape except that the strip of light was a straight line below a darker craft. When i saw it I immediately got a &quot;fight or flight&quot; feeling as adrenaline surged through me and I was awestruck and scared at the same time. I continued the drive to work (no missing time on my commute) and sent this report.", "Triangle w/three lights flying very low, very fast and silent. Nothing similar that I&apos;ve ever seen.

(State Route 101) It was more over top of my view because I was now looking through power line wires and was getting a better reference as far as speed and how high it was , my best guess on speed was around 50 or 60 mph because of my vantage point following it between the power lines in my binoculars, it took some time to cross each line and then it started going into some clouds and it was becoming more difficult to follow and at this point, I went to look with my naked eye and I lost track of it.I&rsquo;ve seen various air traffic around the area before and after this, all were distinguishable airplane traffic, these other two objects were something completely different, And I would not be surprised if someone snapped a picture of this given the number people waiting for the fireworks looking at the sky directly over Clyde Ohio.Clyde is about 80 miles southeast of Toledo and 30 Miles south of Sandusky Ohio.The time we saw this was 9:45 P.M. dusk, not quite dark enough for fireworks, the sky was mostly clear with a couple of spotty clouds, I lost view at about 9:49 P.M.", "A shimmering dot like object seen thru binoculars at approx 45 degrees moving right-left eradically in field.Unidentified Object Sighting:  Saturday, May 9, 2009, WST: 10:44:50 Reno, NV On Saturday, the above date and time), a neighbor living at ((deleted)) Court, Reno, NV, alerted me of this unusual sighting in Reno, NV.  He was sitting on this front porch stoop (facing West) and noticed a silver sparkling object   appearing  to travel  up the side of Peavine mountain.  At first he thought it was a helicopter but ruled this out due to the rapid ascent and abrupt changes in directions without regard to being on a road or paths that were visible on the side of the mountain.  He indicated he observed this object for about 30 seconds then decided to get his binoculars and camera.He then observed this object going above the top of Peavine in a westerly or north-westerly direction.  He used is Canon digital camera with the 40 power  lens  and took three pictures, only two frames captured the object which  was just a small dot in the totally blue sky background.  He was so excited that he yelled at me to come and see the object which was shimmering in the sky at some distance, I used his binoculars then got my binoculars to observe the shinny and our US Postman also observed the object.While using my binoculars and observing the object, it sped different directions and reversed course very rapidly, unlike any normal flying craft.

They was in perfect formation and the formation they flew in was also triangle, and each point on the craft had a light. they flew west for a ways then they cut back heading to the north.

I was in the back yard of my brother&apos;s property next door, facing south, talking to my brother who was to the east side of the property. I turned to talk to him and when I did, looked up at the trees that separate the property. I noticed an object that I would describe as looking like a pill type capsule or cigar shape. This object was bright white and obviously reflecting the setting sun. it had no noise nor did it have a contrail like conventional aircraft. It moved at a steady pace in a north south direction. There were a few clouds but, they were to the south and as the object moved off, you could still see it reflecting the light while in the clouds. I would estimate it roughly at around 7,000 ft. altitude. When I first saw it, it looked to be about 3 inches long from my vantage point on the ground. As I said, it appeared first as a cigar shape but, as it went away, it appeared as a round shape as would be expected by something of that shape moving away from you.I am a former volunteer fire fighter and a trained weather spotter so, I am familiar with the skies. I grew up near an airport and had a father who was crazy about airplanes so, I am familiar with all types of conventional aircraft.My brother did not see it at first when I pointed it out to him due to the trees but, did see it long enough to file a report also.((NUFORC Note:  Date corrected by source of report.

By what we could only describe as a red light, with a little white light on the bottom, was going diagonally across the sky in a north western direction (very uncommon for out weather patterns around here).  I took a picture of the light, and when we looked at it later and zoomed in, it actually looks like multiple lights in no particular pattern.  We just wanted to bring this to someone else&rsquo;s attention, we thought it was awful unusual and none of the news stations caught it either.

As such, I am quite familiar with the sky surrounding my area. There are aircraft in their designated lanes, the occasional military plane from a nearby Air Reserve base, and countless satellites.  In fact, I see a dozen satellites visually each night out and capture a handful of their trails on each of my photos, to my dismay.  There are also bats and owls that fly by, hunting with their squeaks and screeches.  I am used to it all.Last month, I noticed a &ldquo;satellite&rdquo; moving east across the sky. I thought nothing of it and diverted my attention.  I then heard the sound of a military jet in a hurry to get somewhere, which sounds completely different from the usual passenger planes that fly by.  It sounded like an F-16 tanker escort from the military base. I looked back up to spot the jet and saw the &ldquo;satellite&rdquo; make a nearly 90 degree left turn as the military jet rapidly approached it from the south-west.  The &ldquo;satellite&rdquo; proceeded north-east, closely followed by the military jet with its wingtip lights flashing away. I watched the chase until they disappeared over and the horizon, during the time span of maybe 30 seconds.This happened last month, near April 18th, sometime around 9:00pm.  I did not take notes at the time because nothing can really be done about a sighting like this. I know I was in communication with another astro-photographer via email at the time, and I remember typing &ldquo;I&rsquo;m watching a UFO chase&hellip;  So what are you taking pictures of tonight?&rdquo;  To me, it was just another curiosity so I quickly returned my attention to the photographic task at hand.I don&rsquo;t know what you can do with this late report; maybe this can be useful as corroboration for someone else&rsquo;s report of anything similar to this around that date and time.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We were all talking when I noticed a bright white light in the sky straight ahead of my line of sight (in the direction of the Tennessee River). At first I dismissed it as a helicopter. In that general direction is Erlanger Medical and the Life Force helicopter is not an unusual occurrence. I watched this for a few minutes without comment. Then a second, much brighter round blue light approached slowly from further away to come close to the stationary white light.I said &ldquo;what is that?&rdquo; My neighbors stopped talking and turned around to look up at the two lights. We were all on our feet at this point, talking about how strange the blue light was. It moved like a slow helicopter with an atypical light, yet it was totally silent. The helicopters that fly around this area are never silent. Also, there wasn&rsquo;t any traffic that night. It was quiet out and we couldn&rsquo;t hear engine sounds.The white light winked out after six or seven minutes and the blue light flew away in the direction of North Chattanooga until it was gone. Roughly a minute later it flew back in our direction, performing a few maneuvers. I made an offhand comment that if anything &lsquo;came out&rsquo; of the light we should all hightail it indoors and lay low. The blue light headed off again across the river until it was out of sight.I&rsquo;m not sure what to make of this sighting. We have helicopters, a major airport in Brainerd, and the Riverbend Festival was still going on at Ross&rsquo;s Landing. Nothing matches what we saw. The light was too back and forth to be a plane and too quiet to be a helicopter. And nothing at Riverbend is an airborne attraction.

As I traveled closer I was able to see that the lights were part of an aircraft/mechanical object.  This object was directly above the southeast corner of the I-25 to C-392 interchange.  The object was comprised of square shaped beams making up a metallic silver cross of equal dimension on the x and y axis, with a circular shaped ring of the same silver metallic material that encompassed the outside of the cross and connected at the ending points of the cross itself.  The distance/size across the bottom of the cross/ring section was approximately 50 feet.There was a large dome light in the direct center of the &quot;cross,&quot; and four smaller lights at the end points of cross sections just prior to where the circular section met the square cross sections.  There was a dark, solid section that extended above the cross/circle, but I was unable to identify any specific details/shape of this dark colored area.  It&rsquo;s height seemed to be about one third to half the size of the width of the craft.  The five lights on the bottom of the craft were solid white, neither blinking nor changing color.  The large center light was the lowest part of the craft, with no type of landing gear or runners (such as seen on helicopters) being visible.The craft was perfectly stationary as it &quot;hovered&quot; in the air, neither tilting nor moving in any specific direction.  After I passed by/under it, and traveled for approximately &frac14; of a mile, the craft tilted on an approximate 30 degree slant and began to slowly travel towards the west.

The object&apos;s illumination was similar to a space rocket from a far distance except the object seemed to be accelerating at an unusually fast pace. The object seemed to fly a circular path before coming down to a similar height it took off from, except the landing site was a bit to the right. The object then proceeded to hover from left to right, giving no evidence of increasing its altitude (and at irregular speeds, sometimes it would move faster to the right then left and vice versa). This continued on for 15 minutes before the object stopped. This was when the shape of the object became clearer. The streak of light seemed to possess a spherical center with trails of light both above and below it. The trails of light seemed to contract into the sphere and extend back out periodically. This happened for another ten minutes before the object stayed still. Within 5 seconds of it stopping, rain began and the objected became less visible and dissapeared. The rain stopped and the object seemed to appear again with another just like it except with a darker shade.", "2 oval orange objects parallel then converging then disappearing after 45-60 seconds((ADDENDUM FROM ORIGINAL SOURCE OF REPORT))Mr. Davenport I do not know what happened to my e-mail to you but I am forwarding information to you in this format. This sighting is one of the most unnerving experiences my wife and I have ever had.  I was a private pilot fo 14 years and never saw any image such as we saw that evening when I did night flying.  The dual objects appeared to be at 35 degrees off horizon.  At first I thought it was one object, probably a plane but if that were the case it why did it have orange balls on its wing tips instead of the traditional green and red wing lighting?  The object was approaching us heading southbound and we were facing true north. Intially it appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed, 4-5 miles from us.  I cannot estimate the altitude but I&apos;m guessing 3000-5000 feet.After 30 seconds of from first spotting, what I thought was one object turned out to be two.  One orange ball on our right started to lose altitude and converge toward the other orange glowing ball.  It  the turned sharply to our right away from the other ball and disappeared. Just prior to doing this it appeared to us that both orange objects appeared to stop in mid air.  About 10-15 seconds after the first disappearance, the remaining orange ball vanished.  I would say our entire viewing was 1-1/2 minutes.Upon returning to our home in about 5 minutes I called our local Salem Ohio police department and recounted this experience to them.((END ADDENDUM))((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded to us to be quite serious-minded and sincere.

It is presently summertime and the sun goes down later on; so either it was the remaining illumination from the sunset or the illumination from Los Angeles; either way, this was a dark object with no lights, however there was still enough light in the nighttime sky to see this object, and I know that I did see something.  It was possibly circular in shape, however it traveled too fast and it appeared too dark to tell.The first time I saw this dark object (UFO), it curved in movement in the sky and then froze and went out of sight, and I shrugged it off as nothing at first.The second time, however, I see another similar dark object (or possibly the same one as the first time), and this time it flew across the sky and out of sight in about a second... which is when I feel stunned and realize that this was definitely something.No meteor or shooting star could ever curve and totally stop in the middle of the sky and disappear like that.... and no firework can ever travel miles and miles across the sky in less a second either, and neither a firework nor a meteor would appear totally dark as well, unless both are burned out or something.", "Flashing orb confuses and amazes people in Auburn WashingtonI was slightly away from the middle of our backyard, about to light a firework, when I saw something gold-ish orange in the Southern sky and I thought at first it was a firework, but it wasn&apos;t going off, it was flashing, and every time it dimmed, there were three smaller lights I could see.  The smaller lights compared to the other light seemed stationary and in the rough shape of a triangle.  I heard people saying &quot;What is that&quot; and people were scrambling to get a camera.   It was going in a straight line, and the light dimmed as it was heading away in a straight line towards the West.  It appeared to be solid, but also appeared to be made of light.  I felt confusion when I saw it, because I could not tell what it was.  The main reason I would not think of it as normal aircraft is because it didn&apos;t have those safety lights, and it didn&apos;t appear to blink, but it seemed to be fading in and our from the orang-ish gold color to the three smaller lights.   While I was watching it, everything seemed to be quieter than normal. Kind of like the same effect snow has - Where everything seems quiet.

Driving north on the service road of I35 toward Fort worth Texas at dusk after an ice storm, the northern sky was lighted from above in an arc shape to the ground covering a good portion of the sky.  It stayed that way for several seconds(it was lit up as soon as I turned on to the service road) and suddenly as if someone turned off a switch, it completely turned off.  The sky was then dark.

This time I was far from home and there was no way to explain away what I saw and when I blew up what I caught on camera, I definitely thought I recognized the shape from UFO documentaries.A friend and I were on a road trip in CA heading North on the 5 Freeway in the Fresno and Merced counties area.  At the beginning of sunset we both noticed four distinct very bright objects in the sky that seemed to be reflecting the sun&apos;s light.  From where we were they looked like grains of rice or possibly disks, they were angled diagonally but one seemed to be more circular (probably due to the angle we were looking from).  The objects were completely stationary for the entire time that we saw them- NO trajectory or flight path, NO smoke or trail- completely stationary for at least 4 or 5 minutes until stratus clouds rolled in and the sun went down.So far I have contacted two personal friends: one a military physicist and the other a formal naval airman- with both my story and photos.

My mother-in-law and my wife also saw this.  I could not believe my eyes and called my friend and his wife to watch what I was observing and I explained to them what I saw.  Then again in a minute or so the same thing happened and I saw a saucer like object about the size of aircraft that had blinking lights that moved toward the cloud and again the same kind of bright light came for about 4 mins and then slowly disappread.  During this time we also saw about 4 clouds, I guess that were illuminated with that bright light.  I called 911 regarding this and they asked me to report to local police.

They went from a box formation to triangle formation.This is for cross reference purposes to note more than one witness to this visual:  Description: My daughter called me stating that the local radio, 97.8 FM (website has audio recording of it) is talking about 11 to 16 disks in the sky above Chandler (she was driving to work and couldn&apos;t see). I went out my front door talking to her and initially looked in the direction of Chandler, NW, to try and see what she was talking about. Didn&apos;t see anything and joked with her about needing to drive into Chandler to try and observe what the radio was talking about. Said good byes. I then went back out and leaned on my Honda roof and slowly started to scan the sky in the direction of Chandler. I then came across 2 white/shiny disks/orbs at about a 35degree angle. They were side by side with about a pinky width between them. I then continued scanning the skyline, due to the reported 11 to 16, and ended up observing 7 more white/shiny orbs/disks at about a 45 degree angle that stuck out against the clear blue sky. This second set of obrs/disks were in 2 groups. One group of three were in a triangle pattern while the other was in a box formation (one orb/disk in each corner of a &quot;box&quot; and a &quot;triangle&quot; formation.

This was not a &quot;falling star&quot; because it moved at approximately 15 degrees along the horizon traveling north to south. it seemed to have a haze or halo around it.

I turned north to face it, it was high up but it&apos;s shape was clearly visable as it was heading south-southeast it moved slowly and pitched from side to side. I knew at this point that it was not an aircraft. There was no noise coming from the sky, it was shaped like a triangle with a slowly dimming red/white light emanating from the center. The light would at times, look like a dimming campfire. As it moved slowly across the sky, I called my mother outside and as soon as I looked back up we saw that this craft was being &quot;followed&quot; by an aircraft (military) which we could now hear. It seemed to be following this object from underneath because the object looked so high up. Then the object stopped and hovered for a second and it dropped a reddish white fireball toward the ground, after it fell the craft picked up speed, I guess it noticed it was being followed at this point. It moved faster toward the south, then dropped another fireball. We watched this fireball drop somewhere in the distance, it seemed to burn out before it hit the ground. After this last drop it disappeared rather quickly going eastward, maybe toward sonoma/napa area?.

So it takes about 5 minutes for these two lights to slowly move into the distance and disappear (we said they moved about as fast as helicopters do from a distance).  Once they disappear I am convinced that they were some crazy fireworks that someone launched somehow.

At about 11:00 pm Eastern standard time I noticed a strange looking craft flying through the big dipper.  My first thought was that it was just a plane. But upon further review it was shaped like a circle or a oval. The craft was all white. There were no red or blinking lights that you normally see with a airplane.I saw this craft making very quick turns and dips in the sky. I thought that my eyes were playing tricks on me so I moved away from the fire to adjust my eyes. I kept track of this object and my eyes got adjusted so I continued to view this object. The thing that made me want to report this craft was how it was making very quick turns and dips in the night sky. It flew and moved in a triangular flight path. It moved into this position in about 1 second. It did this about 10 more times.It moved back and forth between the big dipper and other stars so fast. I have never seen a object move this fast and take multiple positions in the sky. I do not think this was a plane. I have been observing the night sky since I was a child and this is the first time I have ever wanted to report an object.

The closer it got to us it looked more like a football or possibly saucer shaped thing, which was hot white/yellow in the center and got orangish gold toward the outside. This thing flew from a distance away toward us and above and beyond us across the sky. Approximately 500ft up?  It was totally silent. The size to our vision would be similar to if you held a children&rsquo;s &ldquo;nerf&rdquo; football out at arms length. Being at the height that I assume it was, it was very big. Bigger than my moms house easily. I have seen the EXACT SAME style craft on a ufo show. the one where craft hits the desert then bounces back up then hits again and explodes into a million firey lights, its pretty popular i think.Here is the weird part, we had my moms camera up there to use like a scope (kids ya know) it was an old 80&rsquo;s rectangular style one. Anyway with camera in hand I saw all this. Never once thought to take a picture at all. It was too strange for me to do anything but stare at this thing.It didn&rsquo;t move super fast either. 100mph? Now that im almost 33 im a better judge of visual speed applied to something at a distance and 100mph for an air craft isn&rsquo;t that much I think. We had our parents look through the news papers to see if a meteor had hit or other people reported seeing it. it was really big. There was nothing.Ok, years later, when I spoke to my friend about this again, he said something I didn&rsquo;t remember and still barely remember. Within 5 min of the sighting, he said 3-5 military style helicopters flew across in the same direction.

I could not tell how high it was or how big it was but I could tell it was white and appeared to be changing shape.  At first I thought it was a balloon or a plastic bag that had somehow got carried up by the wind to an unbelievable altitude but the object did not move.  It was unseasonably windy in L.A that day, which made the clouds coast by at a faster than normal speed but the object stayed stationary with out a sound.

I use a pair of binoculars to see that it was actually spherical...sort of shaped like a hot air balloon, but not nearly that exact in shape. It was extremely bright even in the setting sunlight. There were scattered high clouds, likely 30 to 40 thousands feet high and this object was behind them at times. While the clouds were moving briskly towards the NE this blob-like light was slowly drifting westward. After about 15 minutes it dimmed somewhat and (again through binoculars) then tiny little lights, almost like embers started appearing below the blob. Each one only lasted for 4 to 10 seconds. These lights seemed to &quot;fall&quot; from the blob, but some moved laterally...they were very small, but a couple seemed to move upward briefly, before dimming out.I continued to watch as this bright blob for almost 45 minutes as it slowly drifted west and dimmed to a pale blue color as the dusk became night time. Only after a deck of clouds obscured it, did I give up the watch.I have to imagine thousands of people in central and west central Arizona saw this thing. Again, it had to be very large, because it was above the high clouds and at a very low angle for me. At it&apos;s brightest period it was not homogenous, it seemed to have some motling (sp?)some variance in it&apos;s brightness or on its surface.If it was some huge balloon.

By the time I started filming the craft, I estimated its altitude to be at over 15,000 feet. The video shows the craft flying in a circular motion in and out of the clouds.

Second sighting was 4 lights (V shaped again)05/31/2009 Approximately 9:40 pm Fostoria, OH 44830 Latitude: 41&deg; 9&apos;39.59&quot;N Longitude: 83&deg;25&apos;15.38&quot;W Weather: Clear, 65&deg; F, no wind   My wife and I were sitting in our backyard having a campfire when I looked up to the sky.  I was just about to comment on how clear the night was when I noticed some lights to the north heading directly towards us.  Keeping my eyes on what I was witnessing I pointed to the lights and said to my wife, &quot;Look up, look up, look up.&quot;  What I saw were two banks of four lights.  Each of the lights was parallel to one another and they appeared to have a similar formation to a flock of geese, or the delta formation flown by military aircraft.  The individual lights weren&rsquo;t round, but linear in appearance.  They weren&rsquo;t bright white, but rather dim and tanish color. Each bank of lights was swept back to the next, as if they were mounted to the underside of the wings of a fighter jet.  Four lights on the starboard wing, four on portside.  The lights didn&rsquo;t blink.  They didn&rsquo;t get brighter or dimmer, just a constant, steady light.As the lights got closer, the formation became more disheveled.  When they were almost directly overhead, they stopped moving in a southerly direction, hovered for a few seconds, then headed northward, where they just came from, reforming the original formation.  Only this time, four of the lights were gone and the remaining four continued north.  As they flew away it appeared that they were either turning off one by one, or they merged into one single light before vanishing.  It looked more like they merged into a single light which then disappeared.Whatever the lights were, they appeared to be low enough for the campfire light to illuminate them (or at least appear so).  While my mind was trying to rationalize what I was seeing, I thought they might be a flock of birds with their undersides getting lit up by the fire.  My wife quickly told me, &ldquo;Those aren&rsquo;t birds.  Birds don&rsquo;t glow in the dark&rdquo;.  And she was right, those were not birds.  The whole spectacle lasted for what seemed like fifteen to twenty seconds and we didn&rsquo;t hear a thing.  The object(s) were completely silent.After witnessing this, I went into the house to describe what we had just seen to my kids.  My wife stayed outside watching the night sky for any more signs of anything unusual.  A couple minutes later my wife came inside and said that she had just seen a shooting star off to the east.  She said that she had never seen a tail on a shooting star as long as the one she just witnessed.  I don&rsquo;t know if this has anything to do with the encounter that we had just seen, but I figured I&rsquo;d throw it into this story anyhow.  We seen no more &ldquo;meteorites&rdquo; for the rest of the evening and hadn&rsquo;t seen any prior to this one.My wife, son and myself went back outside to watch the sky some more.  We noticed an unusually high number of aircraft flying in the sky.  I knew that they were planes because they had flashing beacons and the usual look of planes flying at night.  We saw three or four aircraft to the north, a couple more to the west, a couple to the south and east.  They all appeared to be flying in their own directions, no formation of any sort and they didn&rsquo;t go away.  You could look in any direction and see planes.About ten minutes after the sighting my neighbor got home from work.  I was describing to him what my wife and I had just seen when he looked off to the west and said, &ldquo;What the hell?&rdquo;  I looked over and I said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! That&rsquo;s what we just saw!&rdquo;  A bank of four lights was flying low, heading in a southerly direction again, coming from the north.  This time the lights appeared to be much farther away from us.  They weren&rsquo;t directly over us this time.  The lights were moving pretty fast and then they turned and traveled in a westerly direction before converging into one light and disappearing again.We all kept scanning the sky discussing what we had seen, trying to come up with some logical explanation.  My neighbor went inside to call some of his friends and he told his dad what we had seen.  His dad came outside and we talked about the lights.  While discussing the evening&rsquo;s events I looked up and saw a single light flying extremely fast through the sky.  There were no flashing lights and the object (which I think was a military jet) was flying in a southeastern direction.  I&rsquo;m assuming the light was the afterburner from the aircraft.  It disappeared behind my house and I lost site of it.  The same aircraft, or maybe another one, then appeared from the same general direction, moving slower and in a northerly direction as if the aircraft we just saw slowed down and turned left.What we had seen did not appear to be &quot;normal&quot; our geographical area.  We&rsquo;ve spent many nights outside with and without campfires and never seen anything like this.  The sightings of the unidentifiable groups of lights and the large number of aircraft in the vicinity made this evening very unique to say the least.We didn&apos;t get any video or photographs of the object(s).  They never reappeared once we had the camera in-hand.  I hope my MS Paint sketch at least gives a decent depiction of what I witnessed.", "Bright Pulsing object appears then disappears.I was pulling into the parking lot of my school with a friend. We had just gotten ourselves food and within five minutes of parking I look to the left of us in the sky. The object at first seemed to be a star, it was dusk so I generally tend to look out at the sky. I notice this increidbyl bright &quot;star&quot;. I tell my friend to look at it and he too thinks its abnormally bright. The object then begins to dim to the point where we can barely see its there, then immediately it gets bright again.I would say this happened for about 5 minutes or so when to the left another one appears and begins to do the same thing. Now a lot of people said to me that it was a helicopter or a satellite. I have never seen a helicopter flash so brightly and then another just appear, and satellites move across the sky very fast. Anyways the two pulse for about a minute then completely disappear. Since then I hav&apos;nt seen anything like it or heard of anything like it.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I focused on it and it seemed a lot closer as I had to adjust the focus.It was round and seemed to have something red sort of trailing around it.  The red part seemed to be moving around the disc.  I lost track of it after about a minute.  I went back to looking for the planet Venus and saw another object fitting the same description, at high altitude this time traveling in a westerly direction.  I watched it for about a minute.

We were on vacation in an oceanfront house and had an unobstructed view of these objects. Beginning at about 10:30, my wife and her mother as well as a few other family members saw lights begin coming on over the ocean almost directly off the coast from the house we were in.  The lights were approximately a mile off the coast and about 1000 to 1500 feet in elevation. They saw 4-5 white lights slowly come on in a row and then disappear after hovering 20-30 seconds. My wife then came in and told the rest of us to come out. At around 10:45 we saw 3 - 4 lights appear hovering about 2-3 miles up the coast from us and then disappear. At around 11:00, 2 sets of 2 lights came on near directly out from us at about the same elevation and distance at the first sighting. The 2 sets appeared offset and one above the other. The lower set after about 10 seconds, tilted or banked to the south and then moved under the other set. It slowly rose a little, and then both sets moved away to the southeast and disappear within a half second or so. This third appearance lasted several seconds. There was no sound.On the second night, May 28th, the lights appeared at about 9:30. They appeared in front of us much as they had begun the night before. Their second appearance was from the southeast moving toward the northeast with an almost vertical banking to the south. The object slowed to a stop as it leveled back out. This time lights appeared to be rotating on the top. It hovered for several seconds and appeared to return to a southeast course with great speed as to almost disappear again. Again, there was no sound. After this, there appeared to be 3 planes - with blinking wing lights that by speed, directional, and elevation changes we took to be military jets - come from the north and fly up and down the coast for at least half an hour. It was as if they were following or looking for something with the patterns they flew and the confined area they were in.Since this time, I have been in contact with several people who saw the same things we did that night.

We were heading East on I-70 in Kansas. We were driving a 4 door sedan so we could see all of the way around our vehicle without obstruction. We just passed mile marker 24. It was a very clear dark night not a cloud in the sky we could see for miles. There were off in the distance several antenna type (red lights) flashing sequentially, continuously in unison. We commented on the red lights and was wondering why so many antenna were in the area. While traveling aprox 70 mph heading East bound we witnessed a flash of light to our right near the outside of our car. It seemed to be just above the height of the car off in the distance about 20 feet out from the car behind the Passenger head/shoulder area. Then another flash light a huge very bright quick LED about a foot back farther from the first. Then a third flash closer in time  but further in distance toward the rear of the car. (as if it were a old fashioned photo flash bulb.) Only very bright and much Larger. We both looked at each other. I slowed the car. I said did you see that she said I saw the bright light flash 3 times but not at the same time as if it was in a delayed pattern. I agreed.  We decided to pull over on the side of the shoulder to see if we could see anything more. I looked behind us and there was not a car in sight for miles but could see an overpass ahead. We pulled over to the shoulder on the right side of the road just past the overpass. We stopped the car and pulled to the side of the road but there was nothing. Just the next Mile marker, Mile 25. We took off back onto the interstate. We were going about 50 miles hour increasing our speed when another bright flash occurred. Closer this time almost touching the car hood, in front middle. The light floated to the passenger side of the vehicle almost as if it was hugging or surrounding the car. As before it was off the ground above the car approximately at the height  of the rear view mirror. The second blink was 2 seconds later,with a short surge of light was directly even with the car at the passenger window. The third flash again in a later 1 second delay pattern from the first. It was if something was flying like a very large Lightening Bug only with a very bright LED light flash about the size of a volleyball. After each flash it appeared to have  a diamond shaped light or a cross formation as it dimmed out. We kept driving in disbelief as to what we just saw. We never did see an object. It was a very bright Orb like LED lights in 3 sequential flashes but with a delay between the flashes. 2 separate times. Driving at that speed we were just dumb founded as to what it could be,especially after the second incident. It was in front of the car and we were traveling over 50 miles an hour but it seemed to mock our speed and hang in the air right with us. We never heard any noise or odd sounds.

It made a couple of small turns to the left and right, but mainly followed a path from south to north.  At one point it stopped moving and remained stationary for a minute or so.   It then appeared to fly straight vertically fairly rapidly and the large round fiery looking light grew smaller and smaller until it finally disappeared completely.  The entire viewing time was three to five minutes in length.There was not a tail of flames, just a large round light with the color of something burning.  If it was 20-30,000 feet up, the size of the object would have been very large (many hundreds of feet in diameter if not 1,000&rsquo;).

It was about 11:33 PM.I looked up overhead and spotted a brilliant orange object, somewhat circular in shape.  It was about half the diameter of the holes punched in three-ring notebook paper held 30&quot; from the eye. I estimated its altitude at 25K feet or higher.  From my position near the intersection of the Shasta View Drive and Tarmac Road, at 40*34&apos;49N X 122*19&apos;26W, the object appeared to be at 85 degrees above the horizon to the SSW.  Judging by its altitude, it was probably directly over the southwestern margins of the city limits of Redding, California.At first, its coloration was steady and unchanged; the object was stationary.  But as I watched, it began to change shape, with several smaller orange objects coming from it, rapidly separating from the main object to a short distance then momentarily flashing and winking out, never to be seen again. This happened about  four different times.The main object would alternately appear as a circular shape then dim slightly from a bright orange color to a bright red and back again, and as it did so, it took on the appearance of multiple spheres clustered together; very much like the oft-cited theodolite camera footage shot near Area 51 some years ago.But then the large object quickly winked out itself, going from bright orange to red, then to a brownish hue and vanished completely. It was completely out of sight for about a second and would suddenly flash and reappear in another location a short distance away, where it again stood motionless.  This on-off-on and sudden relocation event happened about six times.  Held at arm&apos;s length, these &quot;jumps&quot; would appear about three inches from point to point.  At an altitude of 25,000 feet altitude or more, this represents a jump of about a half mile or more, (transitioned instantly).I debated whether to run and grab my high-powered binoculars, but was afraid that the object would disappear before I could return to view the phenomenon.  The object moved in several directions in this disappear-reappear sequence and finally, as I was on my cell phone yelling for my girlfriend out in Palo Cedro to go out and look, it began moving in a south easterly direction and vanished just as she was just stepping outside. The sighting lasted about three minutes.I saw the International Space Station (ISS) pass overhead moving in a northeasterly direction about an hour earlier, so I know this was neither a sighting of nor mis-identification of that.After checking with the administration at the Redding Municipal Airport, I was told they have a recently installed ARTS-3C radar system that is &quot;slaved&quot; to the TRACON System at the Oakland Bay Airport, but they have no provisions for recording the returns locally.  I checked the internet for live radar feeds, but I guess there aren&apos;t any available to &quot;mere civilians&quot;.  Maybe it might be possible to find out if there is some ATC radar tapes that could be examined for a signature on this.", "night, black, silent, round, oval, pulsating lights on edge, very close proximityAll my life I thought it was just a dream that was stored in a way real events are. Like recalling it as if it were a real event. Anyway, I didn&apos;t really  give it much thought until a couple years ago. I was at a party with my brother and he brought it up. I don&apos;t ever recall discussing it with him other then during the encounter. When he brought it up I was shocked. I really did think it was just an extremely realistic dream that i had as a kid. We both shared many feelings about it. The shared feelings are more strange than the encounter in my opinion. We both remember not being freaked out, it was if it was no big deal. After the incident and mostly during it, we did to seem to care all that much. In recollection, that is stranger to us more then the encounter. The encounter- We were out flying my black kite at about 8PM. We still don&apos;t know why we decided that was a good idea but kids do dumb things. As we were flying it (always looking upwards) my string felt strange. I knew it was up and that it was flying. I just didn&apos;t feel the kite on the end. It was very strange. We suddenly noticed a large object with multicolored pulsating or flashing lights off to the side where we thought the kite should have been. My guess it was more of a pulsing but its been a long time ago. We should have seen it coming in from further away but we didn&apos;t. One moment we were flying a kite, the nest we see an object about 300yards away heading right for us. It was about 50 -100 feet off the ground. It was fairly large. At first I thought it was the blimp and it just turned on its lights and thats why we didn&apos;t see it coming at first. It was moving about 25mph, maybe a little less. As it got closer we looked back at it because we then realized it wasn&apos;t the blimp, or even a silent helicopter (as a kid I thought those existed). It was making absolutely no sound at all. Lights still pulsing around it on the sides. As it got closer it was apparent that it was flattish and sort of rounded or oval. Its surface was extremely black. We strained to see &quot;its&quot; surface but we really couldn&apos;t. It was solid and not transparent. the lights on the edges sort of curved down the sides to almost the bottom edge. It was now maybe 75yds away and my kite crashed. This is the weird part. Most people would be freaking out at this. What did we do? We were worried about my kite. I reeled it in as fast as I could but it wasn&apos;t  fast enough. We both looked back at the object and at this point it was going to pass overhead. It was definitely lower now. Maybe 50&apos; feet. It passed directly overhead just to our right. it was perhaps 60-80 feet wide. Still making no sound at all. All we remember after that was making mention then we needed to get my kite back. So we walked to the crashed kite. It was like we didn&apos;t care about the huge craft above us. We walked over to my kite totally ignoring it. We examined the kite and noticed one of the sticker eyes was missing. It probably blew off but we joked that &quot;they&quot; took it.Then we decided to look again at the craft and it was a hundred yards or so away moving away quietly. We watched it for a few seconds at most because for an odd reason it didn&apos;t matter. We didn&apos;t care. That was the last we saw of it. We never saw it continue its journey away. It was just over. it may have continued or blinked out. I will never now. It left the way it appeared. This may not entertain some UFO or Alien enthusiasts but we both agreed that we must have created the story in our youth and it became a false memory. Its strange that we both share the  same exact memory, but I am sure its possible. I decided to send this in as a UFO report because it seems like a UFO encounter. Maybe it really was. I will never know. I wanted to make it public in case anyone else experienced this.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))", "Bright red ball to the skyIt was about midnight on 1st of July. We were on vacation in a seaside hotel. 8 adults and 4 children we were outside of the building. Suddenly kids started to scream to us to come and see what is flying in the sky. We turned north-east and we saw bright red ball to rise to the sky from the sea. Kids said that while rising two bright red pieces have separated and fallen down. We, the adults saw only the main ball. When raised in the sky, the ball changed his direction and started moving parallel with the ground. We were observing this movement about a minute while the ball was moving away and disappeared in the night sky.", "My wife and I pulled onto shoulder of highway to observing a hovering sphere of light for 2 minutes!  See long description.My wife and I (son was sleeping in car seat) were driving on I-275 South(east) towards Milford, Ohio, a suburb of Cincinnati. As I was driving south I looked up in the sky and a couple of miles ahead of me I saw a glowing orange sphere. I knew it was not a meteorite because I was driving for a good minute before I drove underneath it (and it was still hovering). I kept yelling to my wife in the back with the baby to look up and see it. She could not see it from her angle. I did not want to be the only person who saw this because the veracity of a sole witness is always a challenge. As we drove underneath the object I made the decision to turn on my hazards and hop on the shoulder. I have never pulled over for something like this before, as I have always been able to identify an object, until now. As I was slowing down I kept trying to look up and I almost hit the guardrail as I was pulling over. My wife yelled me to watch out. This did not make her happy since it was her car. As I stopped the car I opened the sunroof and said look! There it was just hovering above us. An orange glowing sphere. The time was 9:39pmEST. It was difficult to determine its altitude and relative size. She thinks it was &ldquo;too high for a helicopter&rdquo;, but I think it was only about 5000&apos;-10,000&rsquo;. It was the size of a (small) dime. Of course you need to know the altitude to determine its actual size. It did not have any other colored lights on it. Just an orange glowing &quot;sphere&quot;. I should caution in calling it a sphere as we were unable to determine if it was disc/egg shaped due to the glowing light. Sphere matches the best visual description. The light did change in intensity but it was a very small fluctuation and could have been our eyes playing tricks on us. My wife and I were going through a detailed Q&amp;A trying to discern what it was. It was not moving, on any plane (X,Y, or Z). There were no conventional Nav lights or beacons, there was no noise except for the highway, and my wife complaining to get us out of t! here bec ause I woke my son up and they did not share the same enthusiasm and excitement. I did not want to leave because I wanted to wait and see it move. I wanted to see its propulsion. Was it conventional or something unexplainable by our current understanding of technology? This would have filled in a great piece of the puzzle and possibly answered the question. Very frustrated, I decided to heed the wife&rsquo;s advice and get off the shoulder because we were not in a safe place on the road with traffic whizzing by us. After safely merging back on I-275, I immediately called my mother&apos;s house to tell them to run out front and look to the north a few miles and up (they are on the highest development around and would have a perfect view). My stepfather answered my call and ran to the front to take a look. He saw nothing. We reached exit 59 within a minute (Milford Parkway) and looked to our right (north). You could see a great amount of the horizon and we saw nothing. We arrived home about 5 minutes later, then I made calls to friends and family and now I&rsquo;m typing this report. The credibility of the witnesses (my wife and I) are impeccable, as well as the intelligence and scientific backgrounds to make an unbiased observation. We are also well known and respected in the community. In addition I am an amateur astronomer and private pilot (not current) with exceptional knowledge of ALL active military aircraft in service (except of course current black projects). If it warrants an investigation, you have all of my contact information and can Google and contact me. Thank you.", "I witnessed what appeared to be a faint star moving at a high rate of speed.  Then after the first one left our sight we witnessed two more with the same characterisitcs.  At first I thought it may have been a high altitude jet, but when the others appeared that scenario lessend.  Then we saw two moving towards each other finally coming together.  When they came together there was a bright flash about 6-10 times brighter than they previously were, after the flash there was only one left and it continued on until it left our sight.", "07/03/09 Oxford MI clear object with fire in the middle 1 minute Object appeared down the street and then dissapeared into the skyThe object appeared from what seemed to be the back of my neighbors back yard, it could have been farther but when I pulled onto my street I saw an object floating in the sky that appeared very suddenly. It looked like a balloon on fire but as I watched the object I realized it was nothing normal.  The object looked as if it was on fire at first but as I watched it I realized that the fire might have been in the center of it. It could have possibly had a clear shell on the outside of it.  But as I began to watch it, it started to float out into the sky at a very quick rate . Before I knew it the object was so far away and it looked like just a little star in the sky. This object floated into the sky around 500 feet away from me and had disappeared into the sky in just around 1 minute. I have never seen anything like this before. I have lived in the same house for 13 years this could have definitely been a ufo.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide little contact information.

They exhibited behavior not typical of airplanes or aircraft of any kind. They also did not exhibit behavior of falling debris such as a meteor or other object entering our atmosphere.I&apos;m hoping the video i did capture will be of some use, but i will admit it&apos;s not very good.it was taken with my Canon Powershot digital camera while in video mode. At times i tried to zoom in and the picture would get blurry so i would have to zoom out and recenter on the lights  A light would appear..and something would seem to &quot;shoot off&quot; from it and then another  would appear next to it...in almost a perfectly straight line. At first this was slow, then at the end the lights would appear more rapidly and closer together. And then it stopped.I did not count how many appeared altogether as i was in awe. I have never witnessed thes lights in this type of formation, appearing one after another next to the other in a line.Myself and my father have seen these lights, or something similar in the same area of the sky at different times for the past 15 years or more.They do not appear often at all or for very long. Sometimes they just appear in different places and blink off and on, and sometimes they move. Thats the best explanation i have for the events that i witness.I also would like to apologize for the end of the video because i did not capture all of the event. It started a few minutes before, and as i was attempting to capture, my memory card became full and i had to stop to get another. When i did, thats when they started appearing in rapid succession and closer together and then suddenly they stopped. At all times and during every occurence there has been no sound coming from the direction in which the lights appear.If you are interested in this video i could send you a copy on cd-rom or dvd format by mail, however the file itself is much too large to email.it is approximately 102 megabytes in size as i have my camera set to maximum video resolution.I eagerly await your response.", "The craft passed by my house about 200 ft high, 30 mph, silent, with 5 dim white lights outlining the leading edge of the craft, making a V, although it had 3 sides, it disappeared shortly after I spotted its dim lights going over my house.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was driving. 198 is a straight road. There is empty fields on each side of 198, until you get to the naval base.

It was already turned around and was headed back over 198 to the southbound side.I was driving so it was on my side. This thing was only a 100 ft from the ground .It had about six bright lights that ran straight across it. It was as long as a tractor, trailor. It turned right around on a dime when it made a turn it turned to the left. As we approched, the craft seemed to speed up. and was headed right for us. The lights in the front I saw start pointing downward right for us . We were so scared we thought this thing was gonna crash right into us. Right when it reached us I looked up the lights blinded us but looked up at it out my window and if i stuck my arm out the window i could of touched the bright lights on it as it went over us. thats how low this thing was. Right when I thought it was gonna crash into us the craft went up and over us then back down to the other side of the field.When the craft was about to go over our ford Ranger Truck, I looked up at it . It looked like one huge wing It was made of metal. silver in color.The lights were bright, but I could see the outline of the craft.the huge craft was very thin. The craft looked compleatly differant as we were comimg up on it , compared to what this thing looked lik! e from a side veiw. It was so unbelivable. This thing I know was messing with us . We saw this craft turn around an b line it right at us and speed up.We really thought we were dead. My boyfriend ducked just before it went over us. I was shaking for hours after that .

Approximately 5:40 PM, Harrison City, Texas - outside the city of Hallsville.We were expecting a storm to run through the area, it had not started raining yet and the power went out.My wife headed outside to watch the storm, as I shut down the computer equipment and turned off backups.I went out on the front porch which has a fairly good view of the North. We like to watch storms roll in from there.It was still day light out and the clouds were fairly high and white at this point of the storm.Just after the first or second lightning flash went off I saw something through the trees.As it moved into view it moved at a steady flat pace just below the clouds.It was in view for about 20-25 seconds, long enough for me to grab my wife and run to the other side of the porch for her to see it before it was hidden by trees &amp; clouds.I am not an aviation expert but I&apos;ll describe what I saw comparing it to common items seen in the area.Holding my thumb and forefinger out at arm&rsquo;s length it was about 2 inches long.A Cessna plane that flies over frequently at a similar distance would be about a 1/4 inch or smaller.I was able to see it very clearly at first as it was below the clouds and I could see 2-3 lights in back and the same amount up front. I saw the body of the object fairly clearly; it was a pipe or a tube shape.The angle it was at, I&apos;d expect to see wings or more of the object, but there were none.It is uncommon to have aircraft fly this low in the area and when they do, it is usually small private jets and Cesena type aircraft, all of which can be distinctly heard before being seen.This object made no noise and traveled at a speed (once again comparing to a Cessna), would be about 4-5 times the speed of a Cesena, possibly more. It&apos;s very hard to put a size/distance to it.As it moved across my line of sight, it entered the lowest parts of the clouds still fairly visible.The lights front and rear seemed to pulse, possibly flash, but it could have been because it was going through the translucent clouds. The lights were all white front and rear.It was traveling West to East approximately 5 miles North of Highway 80 and I saw it East of FM 450 travelling toward Marshall TX.The object I saw had 3 maybe 4 lights that appeared to be round, the number of them was not something I was paying attention to at the time. What I was trying to remember is that the space filled with lights was equal front &amp;/or rear was approximately 1/3 the total distance of the object.

One began heading up towards the sky higher and ever further left where the other shot at a quick enough rate where we missed it for a moment then spotted it again one more time before it faded from view heading right from the direction it was heading.

In different spots but not too far apart.And not in a straight line. I&rsquo;m thinking maybe there were two of them.Because I had saw it flash in the same spot that I had saw it the first time then again in another spot.Like they were signaling each other. I had seen this once before over Lake Pleasant here in AZ.But to nights sitting went on for about five minutes then just vanished.And in the lake experience it had moved so quickly it had left a like vapor tail of light but it was a flash at the same time.I thought it might have been a satellite but it did not keep moving across the sky in a straight line.I thought it might be the space station adjusting its solar panels and they were reflecting off the sun.But it would flash and move its position and then flash again in a different spot.And then again in the spot I had seen it the first time in the sky.The flashes were in 5 to 10 min intervals. It went on for about about an hour or more.This was not a normal pattern for objects of this world. But it was very abnormal in both sightings and I&rsquo;m positive that they were not of something we have.When I saw it out at the lake it was in the middle of the box of the little dipper region in the sky.

I would lay down on the picnic table on the patio with a tube pillow under my head,(to keep from getting a kink in my neck) and binoculars on my chest..I was watching the local ABC 11 o&apos;clock news, my husband was already asleep, having gone to bed several hours before, (his illness forces him to get a-lot of sleep) anyway I know I looked at the clock at 11:15 PM when I opened the patio glass sliding doors and went outside...I laid on the table for what seemed like about 10 minutes, checking out the stars and planets etc, and then I got up and walked around the patio to get a different perspective of the sky.. all the sudden I looked down the back side of the house (NE SIDE) back of house was facing North, and said out-loud but to myself, &quot;I need to go make sure my bedroom window is closed it might rain&quot;, keep in mind this was August our hottest month of the year, and there was not a chance in Hell of getting any rain..I came into the house and walked down the hall to my bedroom, to go in and check the windows, the door to the room was almost closed so I reached for the door handle to push it open and the door SLAMMED in my face with a loud noise, I thought &quot; it was a draft from the open window&quot; I put my hand on the door to open it and could not turn the knob, I pushed against it, and pulled on it, yelled at it and kicked it, the door was locked, then I remembered that we do not have any room locks on the bedroom doors....I remember yelling for my husband who is a light sleeper to come and help me, nothing... then I called him again, again nothing so finally I walked away from the door across the hall and went in and bodily shook him awake and he seemed that he was drugged I explained to him what was happening and finally got up and he too tried to open the bedroom door, pulling and pushing.. finally it opened..and one of the cats slipped into the room and came running out growling with a full bottlebrush tail, I went into the room and I felt a bit of vertigo but that&rsquo;s all... I looked at my bedroom clock and it was 2:15 AM, it had been over 3 hours since I went outside, but it seemed like only about 20-30 minutes.I checked the window and it was closed (no surprise) and then I noticed there was a box on the floor, it had been sitting under the window on the window-seat and it was about 1-2 feet away from the window-seat upside down on the floor, but the contents were not on the floor, nothing was spilled, I am not sure how that was done.. (all that was in the box was ET reports and information)  Finally I got the cats calmed down, husband went back to bed and I shut and locked the patio doors and laid down on the couch, I was barely dozing when my husband yelled from the bedroom... I ran in to see what was the problem and he said &quot;Something is touching me&quot;, I asked him what it was, cats were not in the room, he said &quot;I don&apos;t know but I could hear a buzzing sound and when I closed my eyes I could see blue and red lights moving around the room through the crack in my eyes.He said they were not totally closed. He also said &quot;I could not move&quot; I said &quot;Why didn&apos;t you open your eyes?&quot; and I think he thought I had lost my mind, he said he did not want to see them,he lay back down and about 10 minutes later he was in the living room standing by the couch.. I said &quot; what do you want?&quot; he said &quot; I do not want to sleep in there tonight, they keep coming back and touching me&quot;  The next morning except for the episode with the door he didn&apos;t seem to remember any of the happenings.. he had multiple small scoop ( bb size) marks on his arms.On several occasions my husband as I said who is a light sleeper did not respond to my calls for help or assistance, and he did not get up in the night and find me missing when I was not there..

My first impression was that it was the white wing lights of a large plane, but it made no noise which was odd for how close the object was off the ground. It appeared to have no red or blue blinkers on it like a normal aircraft which seemed odd as well. We could not make out a silhouette of the object, just the lights. The craft proceed on a southern path before it did a light curve and headed in a southwestern direction.At this two smaller white lights appeared under one of the &ldquo;wings lights&rdquo; and then another set appeared under the other one.

I looked up, and saw what I first thought was a low flying plane going through the clouds.  The reason for this is because there seemed to be a bright light with a ring around it, like a headlight looks going through the fog.  As it got closer, I realized it that the light looked more like a flame than a light.  It&apos;s hard to describe, but it was an orange light that seemed to change shapes as it went, and changed positions.  If you can imagine a small circle, it was almost like the light was going in a circular motion, but again, changing shapes like a flame.  The next thing I thought of was a hot air balloon, but again, it was going way too fast for a hot air balloon, but that is what it looked like.  Almost like a flame flying up inside a balloon.  This object was flying lower than the clouds that were out.  I literally watched it appear in the sky above the house next to me, and then walked to the side of my house to watch it continue as it disappeared behind the tree line, which is about a mile from my house.  I sit out on my patio many nights a week, and I have never seem anything like this before.  Like I said earlier, it almost appeared to be a hot air balloon from underneath, but again, traveling about the same speed I see planes flying after taking off my Nashville International Airport.  It also appeared to fly underneath another plane that was well up in the sky, I am guessing around 25,000 - 30,000 feet.  I&apos;m not kidding, it literally flew directly underneath it.  If they were flying at the same altitude, they would have hit each other.  It appeared to fly at a level low enough, that if it were a regular single engine plane, I would have heard a noise, but I didn&apos;t hear a thing.  I was also listening to some music on my computer, turned down low so that it wouldn&apos;t have covered up any aircraft noise, and I never experienced any electrical probl! ems.  It flew on a straight path from east to west.  I didn&apos;t see anything coming out of it, or any light beams radiating from it at all.  I am guessing at the height it appeared to be at, which was around 5,000 feet, it traveled numerous miles in a matter of less than 30 seconds.

At first I thought it were just my eyes, but after watching for about 10 more sec I knew I was definitely seeing it correctly. I immediately ran inside and yelled to my husband to come look at it.

As I stood outside, I was facing North and noticed a bright light moving across the sky at somewhat fast speed relative to my position on the ground. The light caught my eye from the Western sky and moved from west to east. The light was bright, white and seemed to grow and diminish in intensity several times during my observation.It&apos;s path seemed straight, made no noise, and bore no navigational lights. I had observed it&apos;s path as being approximately 20 degrees elevated from the horizon, and traveled a very approximate altitude of 10,000 feet. It may have been higher, but that would have meant the craft would have had to have been quite enormous. It&apos;s flight made it from the Western sky horizon to the Eastern Sky horizon until I lost sight of it behind some neighbours trees. The craft was just as illuminated whilst traveling from me; as it was approaching me. At that altitude, my best calculation of speed would have been several times the speed of sound. Yet no sonic booms or vapour trials were evident.Incidentally, this is an exact duplicate sighting of the same craft I saw one night in Stewartown, Ontario with a number of multiple witnesses 6 years ago, one of which was a MUFON representative. It was an almost identical flight path, and characteristics as this sighting. I&apos;ve ruled out any airplanes, test missile flights, or satellites/space station.

All estimates of altitude, speed, and size are educated estimates and are believed to be very accurate.  It was completely dark at the time with little to no cloud coverage.A very large triangle shaped object was sighted above Midland Michigan. The craft appeared over the roof of a two story hotel North West of my position at an altitude of roughly 500 feet.  It was traveling west-to-east about one mile north of my position.  The craft was completely silent and moved very slowly (no more than 20 knots) it suddenly accelerated (easily mach1, probably more like mach 10) and disappeared behind a line of trees to the east.   It accelerated so fast there didn&rsquo;t seem to be any acceleration period; one moment is was moving very slowly, and then in no more than a quarter-second, it was traveling very fast.  Even as it began to move away very fast, there was no sound or fuel burn at all, no sonic boom, no vapor trail, no exhaust, not even the sound of the displaced air moving about.It is important to note that on its present course the craft would have violated the class D airspace around MBS Intl. Airport 15 miles to the east.The craft was a dull black, almost the color of the night sky, but a few shades lighter, more like the black stealth coating on an SR-71 or B-2 military aircraft.  It was easily twice as big as a Boeing 747.  (twice as long and twice as wide)  It did not have any discernable wing structure or control surfaces; it was just a big solid triangle.   I could not identify any windows or a flight deck, but the only portion of the craft that I could see was the belly (which looked flat), and a small bit of the right side of the upper half.  There was no side portion, the top and bottom of the craft simply met each other at an angle.  There were no navigation lights, landing lights, strobe lights, or rotating beacon light on the craft, instead there were three whiteish-blueish lights on the belly of the craft, one at each point on the triangle.  They weren&rsquo;t bright or dim, more like a glow.  All of the lights were very large, each about the size of the groups of lights at baseball stadiums.  There were much smaller white lights somewhere near the middle of the craft, in a circular pattern documented in the illustration.The entire incident only lasted about ten seconds, but is was instantly obvious that this craft was not a civilian aircraft, and it was not a known military aircraft.  It was not using any type of propulsion used in human aircraft since it was completely silent and there were no discernable air-intakes or exhausts.  The extreme acceleration mentioned above would have generated such high g-forces that a human would not only be killed, it would probably be squished against the seat like a bug on a windshield.  Not only was the propulsion system very advanced, the pilots, or their equipment, were able to handle very extreme g-forces.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I went out with him and saw in the eastern sky a bright light that was similar to a rising planet but was maybe 5 times larger and GREEN!  The object was incredibly glittery and after getting the binoculars I could see a red light inside it that seemed to be pulsing around the object.  While it was there I looked up in the sky and saw a soft golden light traveling over head.  This object could have been a plane, but there were no other lights on it and it seemed to be floating in a different way.  As we watched it it slowly faded away into nothingness.

On Friday the 8th a retired Air Force vet told me of a sighting two 12-year olds who live in his apartment complex had the previous evening. He was able to set up a meeting with them the following Friday. The two witnesses, a boy and a girl, were in the parking lot of the complex at the time. The boy told me that he first noticed the disc to the west, towards the main entrance of the Beaver Creek resort,which is about three quarters of a mile away. The disc appeared dark and oval shaped with flashing white, red, and yellow lights at first. The disc darted quickly to the northeast, then slowed down and moved eastward down the Eagle River valley, passing to the north of the apartment complex. The boy pointed the disc out to the girl witness and they watched it as it fluttered down the valley before ascending into the clouds. At one time they saw an edge view of the craft which looked cigar shaped with the lights appearing along the upper edge. The sighting occurred as it was starting to get dark and there were broken clouds over the area. The witnesses said there was no sound coming from the disc. The kids immediately went and saw the Air Force vet, who is a neighbor of the boy, and told them what they saw.The kids are very creditable and I believe they saw a UFO. When I asked the boy how large the disc appeared in the sky, using his fingers at arms length, he held his fingers about two inches apart, indicating the UFO was quite low. Due to their age we did not do a report with MUFON. The AF vet said the complex has many hispanics, some of whom are illegal, and they are very closed mouth about things. We had two other sightings reported to me that same day along the I-70 corridor in Eagle County, one of which in Edwards was reported to MUFON CMS#16910.

M. on the morning of May 5, 2009, I saw a bright white light in the eastern sky. The light appeared to be inside the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere as I could see stars behind the object that were nowhere near as close.  From my position (in Magnolia, TX) I would place the object above the Woodlands, TX or just north of that location.  The objected appeared to be burning in some manner getting brighter then dimmer.  The fire appeared to be coming out of a central point at the bottom of the object. The object seemed to hover and remained stationary the entire time I watched. I went and got a pair of binoculars to see if I could see the object better, but the object was so bright I could not see past the glare. I then videotaped the object for a bit using the digital zoom to get as close as I could. At full zoom the object appeared to be a sphere; however I could not tell if this was an actual sphere or just a reaction of the camera to the brightness of the object.   I checked the web to see if maybe there was a natural explanation for the light but was unable to locate anything.  Clouds began to move in and I could no longer see the object.", "May 25th, 2009 1 00 AM, i was sitting on my balcony. Smoking a cigarette , and talking to my girlfriend.i have been staying up all night lately, because i have been seing and Filming Slow Pulsing UFOS for the past week.I believe what i saw may 25th at 2 30 am was one of these same crafts But closer, lower, and brighter.At 1 00 AM, my girlfriend stopped me mid sentence and exclaimed &quot;What the heck is that&quot; i turned around and there was a tremendously  bright yellowish white light...looked to me at the time that it could be a plane coming Straight at us...{i watch the sky alot and im familiar with planes and what we have in our skys} but as i  watched it i realized, a plane would have moved a bit more by now....this object was barely moving visible to the eye.That was the first thing that raised my suspicion about this light...we watched it hover for a few minutes...and i decided to run and grab my camera...just to get a better look at it...my girlfriend decided to go to bed...i felt compelled to stay up.When i got back outside. the light was no longer white/yellow, But it was Pulsating ALL colors green red blue white purple, {same as the other lights i have filmed} - when zoomed in these lights have a colored aura ive seen the aura double in size and pulse vibrantly...I noted in my log it looked like a contained Aurora borealis Over AZ...I watched this light and filmed it briefly...i noticed this light was pulsing Inteligently...with a pattern so to speak...this is the first time i have observed these pulsations in an intelligent pattern.every 15-20 secconds the light would pulse solidly blue then solidly red.i thaught this was indeed a sign of life connected to this object.after 2 minutes of filming this object i put my camera down...lit a cigarette and just watced it. This was at approximitely 1 30 AM    I watched it for about 30 minutes and at about 2 00am it seemed much closer and much brighter.I decided to take out my camera again. What i saw when i zoomed on this object at 2 00 AM may 25th took my breath away.What before looked like a pulsing sphere was now...a 2 toned sphere of light.by 2 Toned i dont mean.. 2 colors i mean the bottom 2/3 was bright light and the top 1/3 was solid object. when i zoomed on this orb You could see the top 1/3 of the object was dark...or solid,the bottom 2/3 had a Glowing Core of moving light with Red and Blue Lines of light shooting or swimming all around it, like NOTHING i have ever seen on earth. on the video you cannot see this...until i expiremented with color settings i found. sharpening this image and turning contrast down to eliminate any kind of glare you can see what i saw. here is a link to a clip i posted on you tube    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Vp6IEdhCRk&amp;feature=channel_page  this Light hovered slowly Moving twords me for a very long time i went to bed at 5 am because the sun was coming up and the object seemed to be moving Upwards after 4 00 am. it was back near that area -South of the Usery mountain range- May 27th 1am.but not this morning on the 28th.   I WOULD ALSO. like to note the strangest occurance...there is a point... i included it in my Youtube clip where i was about to adjust my camera. i remember my thaught prior i was thinking &quot;GOD this light is so amazing i wish i could communicate&quot; i thaught that right before i moved my camera....and in my footage ONLY i did not hear this noise... i did not notice it until i watched it the next day.There is a noise....right before the Easily Distinquishable sound of the camera rustling there is A multiple Octave STRANGE ...kind of raspy OTHERWORLDY noise...ive listend to it 100thousand times probably by now and it shakes me to my core everytime  i have no explenation for this whatsoever...and i hope you watch my footage and hear it for yourself", "Single reflecting object moving fast and changing direction.  bright, fast!I live in a suburb of the city of Alkmaar in North Holland.At approximately 10:30 p.m. today, the 19th of May 2009, I was standing outside in my back garden, when I noticed a particularly bright &lsquo;star&rsquo; moving very fast from the horizon to the southwest.

The rain had let up some and as I passed a place where the trees opened up, I looked to the left 45 deg., and up 45 deg., and beheld, in the sky, a beautiful group of about four white lights, one above the other of the most pure brilliance I have ever seen. It, the group, was not bright in that would hurt ones eyes and make them turn away, it was its purity that I marveled at.My first thought, and one I held for quite awhile, was that I was looking across a small valley at the top of a hill where someone had several fluorescent dusk to dawn lights mounted close together on a pole. It wasn&apos;t until some time later that I realized that there is no hill there, because I have traveled that road for years, and also that the lights were not all of the same uniform shape. One of the lights near the top seemed teardrop shaped with the point of the tear drop pointing up toward a 10 o&apos;clock position, the others were of a general square shape with rounded corners and sitting above one another. They seemed to be about 500 ft. up and about as tall as a baseball is thick when held at arms length, and as wide as a nickle would be. They were vertical and not leaning. Although they were not centered perfectly along the same axis, all the lights were touching one another and were nearly centered.For some reason I just kept driving like it was something that happens everyday, and that&apos;s not my nature, to be so cavalier about anything so unusual.The google earth co-ordinates of where the lights were located is, to my best estimate, almost exactly: 40-01-08.00 N, by 79-47-00.00 W. Extra details are that as I was traveling and looking up at the light it seemed that for a split second my car was sitting quietly on the road and not running as I gazed in awe at the light., I get an extreme case of goosebumps every time I visualize the light, but they are happy goosebumps.Several years ago I saw a single white light of the same descrittion from a location", "Blue humming and vibrating sphere in my roomI was awakened by a humming noise coming from the floor in the corner of my bedroom. I couldn&apos;t move.  I tried to call my father, but could only make a noise through locked jaws.  Maybe 5 to 10 seconds went by before I could force a loud enough noise to emit from my mouth that was loud enough for my father to come running down the hall and into my room to see what was going on.  I told him the was a blue ball of something that was humming and vibrating and undulating in the corner, but was gone when he busted into my room.  He said I was having a nightmare, but I hadn&apos;t gone to sleep yet.  I sure on this point.  After my father went back to his room I tried to go to sleep.  After I laid there for maybe a minute after he left.  I started feeling like someone was present.  There in the corner of my bedroom came the humming and vibrations again.  I was so scared, but forced myself  to look at it.  It was a blue sphere of light that was completely obscure and looked like it was throbing and vibrating and humming.  I yelled good and loud for my father again.  He came running back into my room only to see nothing when he turned the light on.  That&apos;s it.  That&apos;s all that happened, but it did indeed happen.  I&apos;ll take a polygraph or truth serium or whatever anyone wants me to take, but I was not asleep and this did in fact happen to me.

We were all together for a forth of July party sitting around a fire.  One of us noticed the light and everyone turned to watch.  It was a bright orange light that initially looked like a spotlight or landing light from a plane.  We soon realized that the object was moving to erratically to be a plane or helicopter and there was no sound whatsoever.  It did not move much but was making small quick movements from side to side.

It was about 3:00 in the morning and as we looked off into the distance and saw something big and redish-orange with two red dots above it. We got curious and went to check it out, but as we started to walk towards it, it went below the horizon slowly, so obviously it was farther away than we originally thought. I would like to add, there were no drugs or alcohol involved.  We know we saw something, just not sure what it was. We did not get a picture of the object.", "Three red lights that appeared to be the after burners of 3 craft flew silently overhead and dissappeared behind the tree line.II was taking my dog out for a final bathroom trip and I looked to the night sky as I always do as a matter of habit when I saw 3 red lights app. 2-3 hundred feet up, traveling at a high rate of speed, and were as silent as the grave. From the ground they appeared ovular in shape and were app. 5 meters apart. Again it&rsquo;s very difficult to judge this distance from the ground. This was my first such experience and I just felt that I had to tell someone.

The object appeared to be a long way off but it wasn&apos;t particularly high in the sky. What made it so unusual was that a part of the object which was also glowing bright white and approximately 25% in size to the main object, appeared to fall and move directly downwards at 90 degrees from the larger object, whilst the larger part continued moving to the right until my view was obscured by a tree at the end of my neighbours garden.

I witnessed an unidentified flying object traveling from West to East, across a clear starry night sky.  While waiting in my car and leaning out the window admiring the stars overhead and two distant aircraft strobe lights, one flying south toward Louisville, KY and the other towards the Northeast, cruising between 30 to 35 thousand feet, the object suddenly shot overhead.The UFO was an oval shape, burnt orange in color, altitude about 15-25 thousand feet, suddenly appeared overhead, traveled from West to East at an extremely high rate of speed. Its path was horizontal, straight and true, not a random entry of space debris, meteors or fireballs. The event lasted no more than 3 seconds to cross the night sky, and did not leave a signature trail, and then disappear from my view.I had a strange sensation that this was not a random object, but rather, a controlled object with an agenda to be somewhere in a hurry. I have worked with the Air Force at NASA with some very sophisticated aircraft and equipment (Top-Secret) and never seen an object move this quickly. I believe no human could survive the G-forces in this craft, and I have not witnessed anything in our arsenal capable of attaining its speed.The size of the object was very hard to determine, since many factors could have altered my perception, but best guess, was the size of a Learjet. No visible signs, or traces of propulsion, no audible sounds (its velocity should have broken the sound barrier and every window within forty miles?)  The object was not an illusion, reflection, or projection due to its relationship and trajectory to other objects in the night sky.It&apos;s sudden appearance, speed and controlled flight has bewildered my explanation of the object I witnessed.", "6 lights seen above local town slowly disapearingsix lights flying in perfect synchronisation in a arrow formation slowly moving west above Chesterton stoke on Trent for three to four minuets then one by one lights slowly fade away five minuets later one more light following same path also fading away after two to three minuets", "2 bright lights like stars or satellites; one following the other, then dimmed as they turned (toward space?)Near Maggie Valley / Waynesville.

Then, we saw one and about 2 inches behind it, we saw another one following it. It maintained the same distance from the other one. They were like very bright stars. They were moving from Southwest to Northeast; the opposite direction of satellites. They moved in that direction for a couple of seconds, then  appeared to turn to the left. They had no blinking lights like an airplane. Their turn to the left may have just been that they turned out toward space because both lights dimmed at that time.

In fact the object seemed to be at that moment a falling star that&rsquo;s how bright it became, and just has quick has it became large and bright, the object became smaller in size and then dimmed out like it was gaining altitude again then became the same size and color, and brightness has it was when I first thought it was a satellite.

The object also had no navigation lights such has the normal red, and green that all conventional aircraft including military air craft exhibit. This object was very strange in that it did not look like anything remotely conventional or terrestrial including in the way it maneuvered in the night shy.

I happened to look up into the sky as I usually do and noticed an odd shaped object moving from South to North at a fast pace. I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to give an actual figure as far as it&rsquo;s height off of the ground mostly because it was a densely dark object. One thing that intrigued me is that it was running silent and had no blinking lights whatsoever.Also, due to the fact that it was dark, it was fairly invisible in the night sky. The only reason I was able to notice it and distinguish its shape (fairly triangular) was because it flew just under some glowing night-time clouds. It flew right through a known air traffic lane. So soon after it passed the clouds it became invisible once more and then a passenger aircraft flew through the same airspace at approximately the same altitude, which allowed me to guess its size as roughly that of a large truck.It all happened very fast.  It was a partly cloudy night, so had it not been for the small cloud it passed under I would guess that I wouldn&rsquo;t have noticed it at all.", "White box, stood still, then began to fade with a red glow surronding it.Stood in one spot, not moving in any direction.

It became clear that this was no plane, nor helicopter, and was larger than most planes that fly that low in this area.  As we watched in disbelief, the object began to turn slightly as if to change its direction, but stopped instead.  I could clearly make out the almost boomerang shape, with lights at each corner lighting up each corners relative direction.  Its top apeared to be totally flat.  Below the craft looked like three enlogated footballs molded seamlessly to eachother and to the bottom of the ship. The center shape was glowing a dull blue, and had three evenly spaced small blue lights on its bottom.  At this point the craft is hovering right over the top of a small housing developement, only illuminating the surrounding sky along side of it and emitting a blue glow to the tops of the houses.  4 or five minutes passed and another vehicle was headed the opposite direction and also slowed to have a look.  The object then began to move in its original direction rather slow, before picking up enough speed to disappear in a matter of seconds.  I cannot believe what we had whitnessed, as I have lived in this area for over 22 years.  This was not of this world.", "Two round gold reflecting discs stationary over kentuckyThere were two objects stationary at about a thirty degree angle to each other apearing close to the half moon right at sunset.

We has started a camp fire on the beach and hung out for a few hours as it got dark. When we had packed up, I went to the mouth of the tillamook bay into the ocean and noticed a very elevated bay and thousands of ripple like bay, by far no waves I have ever seen. I called my brother and cousin and the other few friends that was with us at the time to look. At first we thought it was the beagaining of a sunami. One other we sere with saw a light about 600 yard out in the ocean were it was hidden by fog or steam like clouds. we all got alittle dissorientaed and watched the light for a few minutes, in awe. It was like we were spell bound as we were stuned and could not move, when the light had dissapered into the ocean, the ripples went away and the steam like clouds dissapated. My brother Had whent into the van to get the spot light, and shined it to were we seen this light. there was no sign of anything, no boat no light house nothing. One of my friends I was with looked down as he had peed his pants and said &quot;Holy shit, It is 1 in the morning&quot;. two to three hours had went by from the few minutes from watching this light. We all freaked out and left back to Tillamook. The next day watching the news this light was seen all up in down the west coast, from Vancouver B.C., Washington, Oregon, California and Mexico. With millions of call ins of the sighting no anwser was given to this date. I am courious as to were those two/three hours went that only seemed like minutes sent and what happen.

I appreciate your work. I&rsquo;m sending you an ancient sighting report for one purpose:  You may be able to compare the description I give with similar ones, or it may stand out as a different one. The event happened in approximately 1993 or 1994 in the summer.  My son, his girlfriend and myself were in the back yard of my house when the girlfriend said &ldquo;Look at that&rdquo; and pointed to a plastic shopping bag that had been kicked up by a gust of wind.  When I looked at the shopping bag my gaze was directed elsewhere and I saw 4 or 5 craft that I consider to be not only unidentified flying objects but non-Earthly flying craft. The craft were gold in color and incandescent, glowing with their own light in the full sun, with no part of the craft shadowed.  The craft had no windows, flight controls or other appurtenances.  They were identical, about the size of a thumbnail on an outstretched hand, and were shaped very similar to a football with one exception:  The points of a football are centered between top and bottom, but in these craft the points were slightly lower than the center. The craft maneuvered independently.  I&rsquo;m not sure of their number because they maneuvered in diverse directions and moved so fast I couldn&rsquo;t get a count of them.  I watched one in particular and observed it to move very fast, and to make sudden changes in direction, performance unlike any Earthly craft. All of the craft were located to the south-southwest of my position.  The one I watched most intently moved to just about due west of me and then changed direction suddenly and went back to the south.  All manuevers observed occurred in clear sky with no other background. The observation lasted only a minute or so.  Eventually all craft disappeared in one way or another.  The one I watched the most carefully went into or behind a cloud.   At that point I queried my other observers and they agreed, yes, they had seen them too. The area of my observation is a few miles west of the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport.  No Earthly craft would likely be in that area without the knowledge and permission of the Phoenix TRACON.  Seconds after my sighting terminated an airliner departed westbound out of Sky Harbor and climbed directly through the same place in the sky that I had seen these gold-colored craft maneuvering.  The airliner made it all the more apparent by it&rsquo;s difference that the craft I had been observing were not Earthly craft.  The airliner was larger than the craft, moved very much more slowly, and displayed clear areas of sunlit and shadowed areas on the top and bottom of the fuselage. I had a 20-year career as a Police Officer, was so employed at the time, and consider myself observant and objectively so. If you&rsquo;ve had other reports giving the same description, one that I find to be rare among my casual UFO reading, I&rsquo;d be interested in knowing about them.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

This object was brighter than any star I have ever seen, and it stood in a local position for what I witnessed to be at least 4 hours.   The light was a steady light, with no pulsations, no flickering at all. The orb was a solid white incandescent light, unlike the surrounding stars which seemed dull, as they flickered seemingly different colors, reds, blues, orange, or green. I eventually went to bed late at around 2 or 3 o&apos;clock in the morning.   I cannot say for exactly how long this object was in the sky, nor did I see it leave its location.

I thought they were balloons or papers flying high in the sky and being illuminated by the city lights.  As I observed I noticed the lights moving in and out of the clouds. I came the conclusion that they were much higher up about 13,000 feet.  They were not aircraft with blinking lights, these were brilliant white lights that lit up at the same place in the sky as they were traveling east and then they disappeared into the clouds again.", "On 12th June 2009, at around 21:25 on the Istanbul Meridian (19:25 on Greenwich), I saw moving rapidly with constant speed a big sphere (disc), that emitted neon light from within.It moved without making any noise towards the North, coming from the South, at about 5 degrees from the horizon for about 7-10 seconds.The light seemed smeared as if the sphere left a slight train of light. At the same time the neon light was not even (about 2/3 of its volume was constant and did not change, however, the remaining 1/3 throbbed). It was like a pulsing reflection inside its surface.The angular size of the body was equal to the size of a helicopter observed from a distance of 800 meters, as if it cabin is see-through and filled with soft neon light inside,I thought so the first 3-4 seconds.The sun had set so the flying object was easy to distinguish on the brown yellow haze above the sunset sun. Subconsciously I was looking for a wing or a screw at the back of it but there was nothing.The object was lowering slowly and I thought it would cross the line of the horizon so that it would see in front of the hills which are 15-20 kilometers away from where I was, and if this had happened I would have been able to approximate the distance between me and the object but this did not occur.Visibility was very high, there was no dust or smoke. I could clearly see the ridge of the mountain 50 km south from here. On that day the atmosphere was crystal clear after the rain from the previous day.The projection of the object&rsquo;s trajectory made it look like it was going to lower enough for me to see the mountains behind it, but this never happened. It disappeared, with a small slur before that. Right before it disappeared I knew this was about to happen.As soon as I could not see it any longer I went upstairs to get a better view but the object had long gone.I also thought possible of the disc making a horizontal circle and me seeing the trajectory that was closest to me because before it disappeared, its light became a little dim.It is also possible that the object is very far &ndash; its speed was like a meteorite&rsquo;s. Noiseless, quiet and very quick, but it flew almost horizontally above the set sun (with a small lowering to the South). However, it had nothing to do with a meteorite because the disc was very volumetric filled with soft bluish light with angular size of about &frac14; or 1/5 of rising or setting full moon.Actually, the terrain of the mountain hills was the same &ndash; going lower from South to the North so it is possible that the object was following the terrain of the hills.I am describing everything that I had in my mind for these few seconds and I compared it to things that I have seen before like helicopters or meteorites but I know it was neither of those.The place where I was standing has coordinates S 43.09605 degrees, E 2566973 degrees which is East from the city of Veliko Tarnovo. The object was on the West from my location and was flying from the South towards the North.For the 7-10 seconds that I saw this object moving, it had travelled 5-10 angular degrees.I directed Skyscout towards the point of the trajectory of the object and it displayed SAO141665 and HIP 85365.After 2 days of reflecting, I now think that it is more possible that the sunset played a role, i.e. the object reflected the sunlight for a few seconds.The question is what this big object is.Maybe it was a USA bomber B1, (which is a disc) but I have never seen those in the sky.If it was a B1, then many people would know that.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was a marathon drive and by the time my cousin and I hit Whitehorse in BC, we had been on the road non-stop for over 40 hours.  It was shortly after midnight, and I was driving down a long dark straight stretch of highway, about 10 miles North of Whitehorse, heading South.  I remember it being a clear night, as I could see the stars as I drove.  This section of the highway was heavily lined with Douglas Fir trees, so it was darker to the left and right of the roadway, and slightly brighter directly above, due to starlight and maybe moonlight.When suddenly I was startled by what appeared to my mind as a flash of lightning going directly overhead, straight down the highway the same southerly direction as my car, but what struck me as odd is that it was straight.  Not like jagged lightening.  Plus there was no sound of thunder.At the time my cousin was sleeping and the flash of light was bright enough that it woke him up.When he asked what that was, I simply said I thought it was lightening.10 minutes later, as we approached the outskirts of the small town of Whitehorse, we noticed that a police car was in the ditch on the left side of the road with his lights flashing. The officer was standing next to his car looking straight up.  I just continued to drive on (not sure why) and half a mile later, there was a fire truck in the ditch on the right side of the road, and the firemen were standing outside their vehicle look up at the sky.  By this time we were coming up to the first signs of habitation, which was a gas station. It was brightly lit, and there was another police car there with lights flashing, and about 6 people standing outside looking up at the sky.I pulled up to a pump and got out to fill up the car, and the attendant was standing a few feet away looking up, and I asked him what was going on?  He looked at me incredulously and said, &quot;You mean you did not see it??!&quot;  I shrugged and said, &quot;I was driving into town from the north, I did not see anything.&quot;  He shook his head and stated, &quot;How could you have missed it? The damn UFO was flying low enough to force the fire truck and cop car off the road, then it went and buzzed this station and then headed up the road you were just on!&quot;All I could say was, &quot;WOW!&quot;  My cousin and I just shrugged our shoulders.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Right before I got to my car I saw a light pretty much right above me at a angle. I stopped to see what it was. At first all I saw were the lights. There were two or three dots of light. The colors were red and blue. I stared at the object for a few seconds and then I saw the shape of it. It was like a Frisbee shaped object that was right above me. It started to move from side to side. I could tell that this was not an airplane or a helicopter right away.  It was fairly large at that time right above me. I ran back to the house and got my friend. When he came out the object moved towards the mountains a little bit and looked further away but was still fairly large. It was approximately the size of a quarter, maybe a little bigger. We watched it move from side to side quickly. It moved very fast. The object then after a few minuets took off down the sky line at very fast speeds. It took a straight path down to the mountain line near his place. The object then stopped and proceeded to move in strange ways. It moved around the sky at high speeds that of which an aircraft could not do. My friend then ran back into the house to get his brother.  When his brother came out of the house the object moved around a bit more and slowly seemed to almost fade away, like turning invisible. This object when it was over me made no sounds at all. It made no sounds when it moved around. I know what satellites, airplanes, helicopters and shooting stars look like and this was neither of them. When the object was over me I could make out the figure of the object, and what the bottom portion of it looked like. It was metal and had an odd shaped bottom. What we saw the other night was unlike anything I have ever seen before. I didn&rsquo;t really believe in UFO&rsquo;S etc but after seeing that I don&rsquo;t know anymore. All I know was that it was something strange. We watched the sky for about 30 minuets after the object had disappeared but saw nothing else. What this object did was physically impossible for any other aircraft to do. We think that this is either a top secret aircraft of some sort, or something else we might not have been meant to see. There are no military bases or anything near us for probably hundreds of kilometers. Nothing else can explain what this was. I feel crazy to have even seen something like this and I&rsquo;m sure no one will really believe this but I thought I might at least write somebody to just report what the three of us saw and hope to get an answer back.", "5 second sighting of rectangular objectWas driving on 91 north 1/2 mile or so from exit 17A/B and something caught my eye in the sky.

It did not appear to move sideways to me, but might have been coming towards me.  Approximately two seconds later the object &quot;dipped&quot; and the sun appeared to reflect off the object, turning the object bright white.  The object looked different as it moved/dipped, going from a rectangular object to something trapezoidal.

It was approxamaitly 6:30pm and my brother and I were driving north on I75.  It was a bright day so I wore my contact lenses and sunglasses..(very important key fact to the incident)  At the time, the highway curved northwest near the gave exit from 470 to I75.  I could see a shining metalic shape in the sky.  I couldn&apos;t say if it was more oval or teardrop shaped.  In a split second from seeing it, I removed my sunglasses to see it.  I could not see it but didn&apos;t have a clue as to why.  When I put the sunglasses back on, I caught a small glimpse of it and it just vanished.  I don&apos;t know if it seriously vanished or moved at such a high speed that I didn&apos;t catch it quick enough.  I scanned the skies and saw 3 planes in the sky.  They must have been comerical jets as there were no formation, which led me to believe there was no chase involved.  The planes were evident due to the contrails and they were visible with out the sun glasses.  After careful thought, I considered the idea that this metalic shape could not be seen with out the sun glasses because while with the sun glasses, the color mimiced that of the day time sky.  Sort of a camafloge so to speak.

Just yesterday, I filed a report about light that made a 90 degree left turn and was being chased by a military jet a month ago.  Last night, I was outside with my telescope, and saw something similar.My wife and I were seeing how many galaxies we could spot through the eyepiece of my little 6-inch telescope in the Virgo Galaxy Cluster.  We were also chatting about what we did during the day.  I relayed to her how I had filed a report for a UFO chase I witnessed last month (which I had told her of the night it happened), and how picky you guys were about spell-checking the report before filing it. She was telling me about a friend who had just died from cancer. In other words, just the usual talk.Here is what we saw. At 10:12 pm, PDT on May 14th, 2009, we both saw a very bright single light moving eastward, just north of the star Spica. It was as bright as any satellite we have ever seen, like an &ldquo;Iridium Flare&rdquo;.  I would say it was as bright as Venus ever gets.  I said to her, &ldquo;Do you see that bright satellite?&rdquo; while pointing to it.  She said she did. We watched it moving for a few seconds, at the typical speed a satellite moves. It then dimmed to the brightness of a faint star.  We know satellites fade as they enter the Earth&rsquo;s shadow, so it was expected.  What was NOT expected was that the &ldquo;satellite&rdquo; made an instantaneous left turn and headed north-east, passing next to the bright star Arcturas on its way.  I watched it fade in brightness until it was no longer visible, in northern part of the constellation Bootes.  I said to my wife, &ldquo;Satellites never change direction like that.&rdquo;  She agreed, as she has seen at least a hundred of satellites as well, and is familiar with the way they move across the sky.When we first noticed it, it was in the general area that commercial aircraft take, but it had no blinking lights. Commercial aircraft don&rsquo;t make tight turns like that.  And it made no sound whatsoever.  Commercial aircraft are very audible, both as they approach my area, and as they depart the area. There were no other aircraft visible, or audible, at this time.So there we have it, a second mysterious light over my area making 90 degree turns, silently, in a single month.  But this time, I have a witness.", "4 moving oval lights in the sky that became one and disappearedI was traveling in my van with my girlfriend to my home after returning from an out of town trip. I live in Powell, Ohio in an upper middle class housing development that is tucked away and surrounded by a large rural area. It was just after midnight on May 11, 2009 when we were preparing to turn onto my street. It was mostly cloudy with a bright moon that was at the time shielded by clouds. The moon was in the south east part of the sky. In the north sky we noticed, 4, almost round, but oval, objects of white light that were moving around and I think they were also crossing each other. The objects, at first, were moving at a consistently paced medium speed. The grouping of lights, as a whole, was also moving slowly away from me through the north sky. We drove around, followed and watched them for about two minutes and then stopped the van and I got out and watched for about 30 seconds more while my girlfriend remained in the van.  I decided to get my camera. I went back to the van and retrieved my camera. The area where the objects seemed to be was near a line of large electric towers. The objects seemed to stay together in the same part of the sky, but their moving around speed began to slightly increase. When I turned my camera on and was waiting for it to prepare to be able to use, the objects moved into the center of where they had been rotating and became one and disappeared. When they became one object, that single object did not increase in size or brightness. The lights did not appear to have been projected from the ground. Their intensity on the cloudy sky was not bright. They were not faint, but they were not bright. The entire incident lasted approximately 5 minutes. I then drove around for about 10 minutes toward the area where I had seen the lights. I don&rsquo;t know if this was related to the objects we saw, but when I got back in my van to drive toward where I had seen the objects, one street light went out as I was beginning to pass by it. No other lights went out and there w! ere no o ther incidents. After approximately 15 minutes had passed since we first saw the objects, I made an anonymous phone call to the Delaware County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office and asked them if there would be any reason why there would be strange lights in the sky in the area of Liberty Rd and Hyatts Rd.  The deputy said no and I then asked if anyone had reported seeing any lights in the sky. When he said no again, I stated that it must just be my eyes and hung up. I know what I saw and my girlfriend knows what she saw. When we got home, we wrote down the facts of what we both saw and I got on line to see if there were any similar sightings of the objects of light.

When I returned to my bedroom, there was a bright light solid blue light shining onto the carpet on the floor in my bedroom.  It was in the shape of a semi-circle.  It almost looked like a half of a spotlight shining on the floor. I am not good with measurements but I think the diameter was probably 8 inches long (maybe the size of the top half of a small personal pizza.) The light was still and did not move.  I did not hear any noise outside.  At first I thought maybe it was a car headlight.  Then I realized that this explanation was not possible since our bedroom backs up to a heavily wooded area and there are no cars around.  Our bedrooms are also on the second floor (we live in a townhome) and the blinds  were halfway down so there was no way a light could project into our room and shine onto the floor in the shape of a semi-circle. I began looking around to see if I could find the source of the light.  I could not see any blue light coming in through the window, but I decided to look out of the window anyway.  As I took a step forward, the light on the floor disappeared.   When I looked outside I did not see anything or hear anything.  I looked for planes and or helicopters that might have had search lights but I saw nothing in the sky.  The whole episode lasted approximately 30 seconds or less.  Today I called the non-emergency police number to see if there had been any other sightings of this light or if there had been any search helicopters in the area. I was told there were no other reportings of any lights but it was a possibility a helicopter was in the area.  However, the dispatcher was unable to confirm whether there was a helicopter in the area at that time.  I found the incident VERY unsettling!((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she sounded to us to be quite sober minded.  She was shaken by the experience.  PD))", "stange light in the night sky unlike i never seen beforeI was walking with some friends down garden street towards the Collin Bennet building.While walking south from Albany avenue in between Ashley street and Collins street I looked up into the night sky. I noticed a solid light ,  from a close distance I immediately thought it was a helicopter.So I listen for the noise of the motor but the object made no noise.I tried to alert my friends of this strange object with no sound but I could not because I felt in a trance or mesmerized by the sight.So I thought to myself it was heading in the south direction so it should pass over the Collin-Bennet building and the reflection of the light should illuminate the building and the object because it was passing at a low altitude so i stared. Continuing to walking down the sidewalk my friends was talking. I was so amazed with what i was seeing i did not hear a word they were saying. With anticipation the object finally proceeded to pass over the building and truthfully what i saw next is indescribable but i will try my best. The light hit at a very close proximity and it looked very dim and controlled the light illuminate a very small portion of the building almost like a beam unlike nothing i have ever seen before.I believed the object was no more than 10 feet from the top of the building.So the light should have been more visible. The light from the object was only visible within a diameter of no more than 5-10 feetin a controlled space. I never seen that in a beam of light.After the object passed out of sight range i immediately turned to my friends and said&quot; DID YOU SEE THAT &quot;?. They looked at me with such confusion it still effects me to this day. Its been seventeen years and i still think about that day.I cant get it out of my head so i decided to write you.This date has an emotional connection because a week later my uncle ((name deleted)) died of cancer so that&rsquo;s why i am sure that it was in April of 1992.No later than the last week of March 1992 for any skeptics.The object moved slow, steady, and balanced about 5 mph when it passed over the building there was no type of vibration or movement. I also remember that night the news had reported a strange light over downtown hartford.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

At that time I observed what looked like a large white flood light in a tree line, 1 mile south of RR. 6.  The light was moving at too great of speed and changed direction to sharply to be a vehicle or poacher.  I stopped on RR.6 and watched the light for approximately 12-14 minutes.  The light then stopped and split into 2 different lights, 1 the same bright white, the other a blue green color.  The blue green light stayed ststionary while the white light continued traveling east in the tree line.  The lights were approximately 1 half mile apart when I heard what sounded like an electrical snap.  At that time the blue green light streatched from it&apos;s stationary spot to where the white light was.  The whith light then stopped and the blue green light re-appeared on top of the white light.  The lights then moved slowly to just above the tree line.  At that time I heard the electrical sound again, and the lights streatched to the west and dissapeared.I am not a person who beleives in this kind of stuff. I am a former Police Officer, and currently a armed nuclear officer. I thought I was initially looking at a poacher until I realized how fast the object was moving.", "3 UFOs in Sacramento, Ca.  Viewed from Elk Grove, CA. the same night News Air10 Helicopter filmed UFO sighting.This is my report from start to finish as it happened.  My wife had asked me to come outside because she saw a bright light in the sky that was not moving and she wanted me to take a look at it.  When I saw the light another light appeared just below the one already in view.  Approx. 30 seconds later a third light appeared on the right side of the second light.  After about 2 minutes of them staying in the same spot, the third light started to ascending upward and positioned itself with the other two lights to create what seemed to be a perfect triangle.  The lights stayed in this position for about 1-2 minutes.  It is at this time that the third light started to ascend again above the other two lights.  Then it started to proceed towards my direction while the other two stayed in place.  I watched the UFO go directly above my head.  I could not spell out the shape.  It looked as if it was a square shape but that was because of the light formation I saw from the bottom view.  It had one bright light in what it seemed to be each of the four corners of the UFO.  The lights looked as though they were symetrical to each other.  As one UFO passed, the second light that appeared started to ascend and also moved in my direction mimicing the first UFO.  As the second one passed above me, the first light that was visible also took the same exact path as the other two.  This came to my amazement but didn&apos;t seem true until I came across a live news video clipping from Sacramento, CA.  News 10 Air Helicopter Video from the same night.  A few days later, News 10 aired an additional story about the video they aired a few days prior and it seemed to me that this was an attempt to cover up what they had captured on video that night.  They claimed that it was an air light show advertising a GRAND OPENING for BIG O TIRES IN ROSEVILLE, CA.

The lights were in a straight line, were colored red,bluish/green and yellow and were flashing one after the other continuously.Within less than 1 minute, in my peripheral vision, I noticed another identical object following the same path and with exactly the same flashing light colors and pattern. These lights never moved out of the straight line formation which makes me believe that they were on some sort of craft, but I couldn&apos;t make out the shape. The only thing I can give for measurements is BOTH were about half an inch if I held my hand at arms length.While keeping my eyes glued to the 2 craft, another set of lights came into my peripheral vision from the left( also traveling from NE to SW following the same path as the previous 2-which were still visable to me). This time there were 4 lights in the shape of a square-with one light on each corner. The 2 leading lights were yellow and the 2 back lights were red. These lights did NOT blink and the square between the lights covered up the stars it passed. Again, this object measured 1/2 inch holding my hand at arms length. There was absolutely NO sound associated with these 3 groups of lights and they all continued on the same flight path, one after the other. The entire episode lasted 5 minutes from the time I noticed the first lights until the 3 objects were too far away to see anymore.", "Red, circular, unknown craft over Auburn, WA on the 4th of July 2009 at 10:00 PMI was sitting in a chair in our back yard. I was waiting for my father and brother in law to shoot off the last firework.  I was looking to the South observing the neighbor&apos;s fireworks when a red light caught my attention.  I watched it for about 5 seconds, waiting for it to explode or disappear like normal fireworks.  I realized while I was waiting that I had never seen a firework sit for so long in the sky without disappearing.  It was a red light that about every 3 seconds flashed a gold light from the bottom.  My next guess was that it was an air balloon, then I realized I had never seen an air balloon at 10:pm at night.  The shape - the best way I can describe it is by calling it a circle.  I don&apos;t believe it was an airplane because there were no hazard lights and I don&apos;t think it was a helicopter either.  I don&apos;t really know what I would call it.  It was on a steady path and it seemed to be moving in a line. It didn&apos;t waver, and it seemed to be progressing quickly.  After about a minute and a half, I stood up and walked about three and a half feet to join the other 13 individuals who were observing its progress.  None of us were drunk or on any kind of medication.  We all noticed that it had a red light and seemed to be flying about the same level as a commercial airplane.  After about three minutes, the object was getting smaller and smaller and it finally disappeared.  One individual had a camera and was able to capture a few pictures. I am no aviation expert, and I don&apos;t know exactly what it was.  The above statement is true and accurate to the best of my recollection.", "A matte black aircraft with a large red light on the back hovers for 5 minutes then flys away at insane speed into space.It was 4th of July and I was watching fireworks with a friend of mine from my car out in a cow pasture. I began to notice one bright red light that appeared to be hovering about 3 miles away and approximately a quarter mile off the ground. I stopped looking at it until my friend pointed it out to me which made me inspect it more closely. It appeared at first to be a bright red football shaped light  hovering in one spot but by its light I could see a matte black object in the shape of a large oddly shaped airplane. From the point I had first noticed until we both started inspecting it maybe 5 minutes had elapsed with this object which appeared to be at least 50 feet long and wide hovering in one place but as soon as we both looked closer it appeared to get dimmer until we realized it was because it had left at such an amazing speed that the bright light just appeared to get dimmer. it took off at a 30 degree angle headed directly away from us and up into a completely clear sky until it disappeared from distance.", "Metalic Cylinder with Humanoid OccupantsWas working at my computer station late afternoon and looked up out the large picture window and spotted a 16 foot high round metalic cylinder in proportion to a soda can silently hovering over the parking lot of the adjacent office building next to the power transmission lines.

The upper half of the craft had a large clear window and had two male humanoid occupants in brown military like uniforms observing me from about 75 feet away.  I got excited and wanted to share the sighting with someone and went to the business downstairs and found the store owner.

I then try to zoom in and move around the tree but when I got a good shot my  camera screen turned blue like some sort of static water picture. I tried to take pictures but all it would take is blue images. I then called my friend to see if he can see it. But then it just  starts to faint away and becomes invisible but when a minute passes it comes back brighter again streaming with colors.

J. and C. were drinking beer, but still not nearly drunk. I was completely sober when this occured because I hadn&apos;t acquired a taste for beer at the time. I&apos;m more of a wine enthusiast, but I didn&apos;t have any alcohol in me at the time.We were stargazing, and there was an unusual number of shooting stars because of one of the meteor cycles. If I remembered the date, I could be more specific. Unfortunately, I don&apos;t recall the exact date or time of this occurance and I didn&apos;t have a camera handy because I don&apos;t just sit there with a camera expecting odd things to happen. Nor do I expect that any camera I&apos;ve ever had before my newest one could take a clear picture of what I&apos;m about to describe.Anyhow, me and J. were laying on our backs looking up at the sky while C. was laying on her chest facing the other direction. Suddenly, an array of about 6 lights flew overhead. Excitedly, both J. and I sat up.&quot;Did you just see what I saw?&quot; I asked.&quot;I&apos;m glad you asked. I thought it might&apos;ve been the beer,&quot; said J.&quot;No. It definitely wasn&apos;t,&quot; I said.&quot;What did you guys see?&quot; C. asked.J. and I just looked at eachother and we both said, &quot;A UFO.&quot;  &quot;Or maybe more than one,&quot; I thought aloud.J. agreed.Anyhow, C. was ticked off because she believes in UFOs and aliens and the like but J. and I are more skeptical but open-minded. Still, I can&apos;t deny that I saw something strange that night. It couldn&apos;t have been a usual airplane or helicopter because the lights were just wrong. They weren&apos;t blinking, and they were in sort of a V formation, but offset like a flock of birds and in the same sort of flight path (diagram below), but making no noise.*---*---* | * | * | *  I know there&apos;s a Gov&apos;t nuclear site called the INL (previously INEEL) nearby, so perhaps it could&apos;ve been something in connection with that, especially since whatever this UFO was seemed to be heading that general direction. I&apos;ve been on the INL site before, but it was in high school for a field trip and there were limits on where we were allowed to go because a lot of top secret research goes on there. I know they&apos;ve had connections with the air force before though, because of stories from a previous employer. I understand that seeing a unfamiliar aircraft can make a person uneasy as make us start thinking about aliens and all sorts of things because the members of his community had the same reaction when they saw the first airplanes flying overhead and then their first helicopter.Anyhow, back to my story.... As these UFOs came in, they slowed down and nearly came to a stop (though not directly over us, and I have the feeling whatever they were, they were entirely unbothered by our presence). They were heading s/sw, but shortly after passing over us and slowing, they abruptly changed course about w/sw. To me it seems they were either headed for the INL or attempting to just barely avoid it, or waiting for directions to a landing site. Whatever the case is, they made some sort of course correction, so I highly doubt it was just a group of shooting stars. In fact, that possibility is entirely implausible in my opinion.I think it&apos;s important to also state that there is an airport just minutes from my apartment, nearly due north, but this UFO appearance was heading the wrong direction to have either taken off from the airport or to have been heading for it. It was flying low enough that we should have heard noise and I could almost make out the shape of an object, but not quite, and any shape I might have seen might have been an optical illusion from the lights. My best guess is that if this was a single object though, it was either triangular or even in cube shape, though a triangular object seems more aerodynamic and thus more logical to me. It seems to me this was more than one object though and that they were &quot;connected&quot; but not by any physical means, if that makes any sense. Either by some magnetic field or a programmed flight path.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

As they got close, we could see a haze around the objects and would look like a round object with a light in the center.They were about 10 ft above us, and as the shifted away, a cloud or fog started forming and covered us.  She ran and I don&rsquo;t know how much time went by, but I could smell a strange odor.  I still don&rsquo;t feel right, my legs hurt and I feel strange.  My stomach is upset and repeated trips to the restroom.  I do not want any kind of media coverage, I want answer.

Please help me understand.", "Sighting while camping at Parsons Mountain SCMy cousin and I were camping and as we lay in our tent underneath the stars we start to notice a very bright moving object.  It would move slightly to the right then left and up and down in small movements. The next thing we notice is another bright object is near by and it would flash lights at this other thing also. This went on for three hours.I have pictures that I took and it is amazing what is in the picture. I was afraid nothing would show up since it was so far up but something did.The first one we saw was a light blue color.  The others were simply very bright. The night sky was very clear with all the stars out.I also saw three shooting stars. Most of the time these objects stayed a good distance away from each other,but then would move closer. Our radio would not play that evening unless we held it up high.  I lay there on my blanket scared out of my wits just watching and calling my family to tell them what I was seening.  We also kept hearing a noise every so often. It was  a low metal noise ,like if you had a big piece of tin and was moving it up and down.  Parsons Mountain is a wonderful place to visit and experience new things, if sightings don&apos;t scare you.

This object was first observed as a orange lighted object in the sky.  Once overhead the witnesses observed this object had a lighted circle around the orange light as it passed over in the sky. This object wasn&rsquo;t recognized as a satellite or airplane overhead.  This object moved through the sky without any sound in any way.  In addition there wasn&rsquo;t blinking lights to be seen, which is usual with most commercial aircraft.  This object moved through the sky with little effort quickly.

I was using a pair of 15x70 binoculars and the distance between the lights was about half of the viewing diameter of the binoculars. The objects covered approx. a 45 degree angle of sky from my position in about 15 seconds. The two outside lights were in a stationary pattern as they moved across the sky, while the third trailed slightly and moved back and forth between the two outside lights. This is approx. how they looked:  From this:  *            *             *                  To this:             * *                                  *   The trailing light moved back and forth between the two as they moved north.

My daughter was not able to see the lights herself with the naked eye, and by the time she got her binoculars focused in the direction of the lights, they had moved beyond our viewing range.Also, approx. 20 minutes after the first sighting, we both observed a single light moving south to north at approx. the same speed as the first lights, followed about three minutes later by another single light moving in the same direction and speed.", "Large orange fireball, turning to orange light heading North to South in central Idaho sky, hovering at times then disappearing.My daughter and her friend and I had just finished a little job we were working on and headed home. She said &quot;look mom a HUGE falling star&quot;  I looked out and told her to stop and we got out to watch it. I remember thinking that &quot;holy cow thats a huge meteor&quot;, and told the girls if it hits we are going to feel it. At that point it leveled off and slowed way down following a straight line directly south, actually slowing and hovering at times. The light seemed to fade and come back to very bright and after awhile it literally disappeared. Feeling like we had just witnessed something pretty strange we went on home.  The girls took off to go to a friends house and the called me and said &quot;its back!!!!&quot; I went to the front yard and there it was hovering over the southern end of town.

Me and my boyfriend where looking out and I saw a bright bluish looking star, but I had a feeling it wasnt a star so I watched it and it moved. And i told my boyfriend to look at it. It stayed in the same general area but it would move up and down side to side, it would move in circles and it was moving around in the sky for a long time. We got his parents and they saw it too. We also saw about 8 flashes of light across the sky that looked kind of like shooting stars.  We also saw about 4 other stars that were moving like this. But we mainly watched the first one.  I watched it for about 2 hrs.  Part of that time the light got dimmer and dimmer and eventually disappeared but then it came back and it was moving around the sky a lot.  It was too far up to be a plane or anything.  And it wasnt a satellite because it moved around in circles.

Its as if I was waiting for it to move past the power lines in the foreground but it was gone.  The strangest thing about it is the fact that I had so many things on my mind that I wasn&apos;t even scared or even excited when I saw it.  The object seemed to have been able to blend in with the clouds since it had that same exact &quot;cloud color&quot;.   It just happened so quickly, then 3 hours later it hit me and I was very excited about it.", "It was this past Sunday when I looked up and say what I thought at first was a hawk flying very high like they do when looking for prey.  The sky was clear except for very high brushing of clouds. I watch the object waiting to see the supposed Hawk flap his wings.

I watch the object which was dark gray or light black fly South South east in a Wooble pattern as best as I can explain. It didnt travel straight, more of a curve in the sky.  My best guess at the size would be about 20 feet long in an egg shape. The object made no noise at all.  Wind was blowing out of the west that day.

We left the inside of the bar to go outside and get some fresh air.  It was freezing out, and we were the only two people on the deck outside at the time.  I looked up at the sky to try and find O&apos;Ryan&apos;s Belt like I always do and noticed three glowing orange/red lights in the shape of a triangle.  It was above a thin layer of whispy clouds.  It was dark so I could not see  the actual shape of the object, but the lights led me to believe it was triangular.  Before I could say anything, the object moved very quickly across to the right and then curved straight up into the sky before it disappeared.  My friend and I looked at each other - he had seen it too - and both said at the same time: &quot;DID YOU SEE THAT?!?&quot;  We went inside to tell our friends but they were skeptical.

It was approx between 8:30-9pm and I was driving eastbound on highway 13.  I noticed through the upper right corner of my windshield HUGE lights.  At first I thought it was a blimp because it was moving so slowly SW to NE.  It was so odd that I pulled off the road so I could get a better look at it.  There was a football game going on at the Burnsville high school and so I initially thought it was a blimp that was going to hover over the field with a display like the American Flag?  But, it had rows of lights (one row of red the next row white with several rows) but after pulling onto the side of the road and I got a better look at it I saw there were only rows of red and white and it was a rectangle shape and wasn&apos;t a blimp.  It was enormous, I&apos;d have to guess it was close to the size of a football field at minimum.  I remember wondering how it stayed afloat because it was moving so slow.  So I rolled my window down so I could hear if there was any engine noise.  There was possibly a faint hum at best, but it was hard for me to tell because cars were passing by and it wasn&apos;t quiet enough.  I sat and watched it slowly move out of sight and there was one other car in front of me that had also pulled off the road.  I never spoke to the person/s in the car in front of me, now I wish I would have so we could have shared observations.I had been on my way to meet a group of friends at Burnsville Bowl, when I arrived they asked why I was so late.  I remember looking at my watch, but since it&apos;s been so many years ago I cannot remember how late I was or how much time I was missing.  I know I was confused because I had told them I saw some weird cool lights but had only sat on the side of the road for maybe 15 minutes.I never reported the sighting because I was convinced that HUNDREDS of people would have seen the same thing I had because of it&apos;s size and slow speed and surely many people would call it in!  I did faithfully watch the news for the next few days hoping I&apos;d hear about it but never did.  I&apos;m regretful that I did not report the sighting then because now I cannot provide an accurate date or time.  Now I think I understand why so few photographs exist, because while it was happening I was unable to take my eyes off of it and was completely mesmerized!

It was moving from right to left in downward slant and disappeared out of view behind a neighbor&rsquo;s house.  I initially thought it to be a falling/shooting star, but then it rose again above the house.  The light was far brighter than the planet/star that was also present in my view.  The light almost had a blue/white hue to it.  The light then continued to drop and rise in an extremely fast motion, followed by left to right motion, loopy motion, and more up and down motions, constantly appearing and disappearing out of my view because of the house.I ran in to get a camera; unable to find one, ran back out to find it still making the motions in the sky.  After calling a family member to find the camera I ran back in to get the camera, came back out and it was out of sight.  I stayed waiting outside when it appeared again, but staying still.

It was a bright white light. Made no sounds at all. Traveling faster then a jet fighter. I live in Gig Harbor and I have a good view of the Eastern sky. It took approximately 8-9 minutes for it to vanish into the deep horizon. I know this was not a satellite because it was much to bright and larger then a satellite. Satellites fades out after about 20 - 25% from it being directly over head. This never really faded out, it just got further and further away until it was past the horizon. I know what a satellite looks like as well as space junk. This was neither. It was hard to distinguish size and shape as well as altitude because it was too dark.

Last night I once again saw something strange by my house.  I was watching the sky from my back deck, looking for the lights that I saw on previous nights, when something red caught the corner of my eye.  I turned to my right towards a large tree that sits beside my house.  I saw the strangest thing I have ever seen in my life.  I watched a craft or light of some sort about the size of a kitchen table or slightly larger appear from just over the top of the tree.  It was not very large and I could not make out the shape of it as it was dark.  It looked like a circular shape, perhaps. I saw several lights coming off of it.  These lights blinked and were very bright in intensity.  They were red, gold and white with several blinking at the same time. They appeared to blink in almost a triangular fashion.  I noticed mostly the red color.  The craft drifted at a medium pace across the sky over me from the tree to my right towards another tree to my left.  Then, it disappeared from my view behind the tree.  The duration was about 30 seconds in length.  It made no sound whatsoever. I then became scared and ran into the house.  I got my video camera and came back out about 10 minutes later, but the light never came back.  Later, at night, I laid down to go to bed.  It was about midnight according to the clock.  I closed my eyes for a few minutes and then heard my son cry out, which is common.  I thought that I had just laid down and I was agitated that I had to get up right when I had gotten comfortable.  I sat up and looked at the clock.  Approximately two hours had passed from when I first laid down, only it had felt like only a few minutes to me.  The clock read that it was sometime after two in the morning!  I really do not feel that I fell asleep during that time and feel that I am missing about two hours of time.  I can not say for sure, though.  When I opened my eyes once I heard my son cry, my body hurt all over.  I! thought to myself that it was strange, that I felt as if I had been hit by a truck.  My entire body was very sore.  Today my shoulders hurt, but that may be due to the weather changes.  I am not saying that I was abducted during the night, however I sincerely feel that I am missing almost two hours that I cannot account for.  The other lights I have been unsure of what they are, however what I saw last night I am convinced was not of this world.", "On the morning of Tuesday the 05/26/09, I was in my bedroom and looked out my bedroom window and saw a very shinny object, very high in the sky.  I grabbed my binoculars and went outside and zoomed in on the object in the sky.   I observed the object as it went east, then turned and went north, at which time and then it turned and went west.  And after a moment it turned direction again and went south.  I continued watching it, I zoomed in on the object as best I could and what I saw was either a horse shoe or a lazy triangle, and it had white round circles kind of like cloudy circles on the bottom.Because it was so shinny that is all I could make out, and it looked like it was going higher and higher as it moved, and then continued south until it disappeared.  My self and my wife and daughter in law all observed the object and the same movements.  Called the local newspaper and reported it, and went to your website and reported it.  Duration was 25 minutes. It made no sounds , no vapor trails, as a commercial airline would.

I was returning to one of the cabins at the Caney Conference Centre in Minden, La., when I stopped to view all the stars in the nice clear sky.  I noticed a bright light in the eastern sky and was trying to figure out what star or planet it was.  I didn&rsquo;t have any of the astronomy books or magazines with me, but it just didn&rsquo;t seem to be in the right place.  It was about 30 degrees on the horizon.  All of a sudden it began to move around slightly.  At first I thought it was just my eyes playing tricks.  But then it moved again.  It did this several times in about 10 minutes time, very erratically.  It would move up, down, left, down, up right, left, down, up, right, up, right, down, etc.; very random, but not very far, only maybe with in one or two degrees each move.  Then it stopped.  When it stopped this time, it looked as though there were two other lights, right next to the main/brightest light.  The brightest one was whiteish, the other lights were reddish (one to the bottom right) and blueish (one to the top left).  I had my 10x42 binoculars with me, but when I looked through them, it just looked like one big blob of light.After about 5 or so minutes of stillness, it started to move around again.  This time it did basically exactly the same as before.  Also, both times, it appeared to wind up in the exact same spot it started from.  Now, there is a small airport just down the road, but it didn&rsquo;t move like any plane.  If it had been, and it was on approach, then the light/lights should have gotten bigger, further apart, and I would have heard the engine.  Not to mention it would have changed altitude gradually and not returned to the same spot where I first noticed it.  I continued to watch this lighted object for about another 30 minutes; so almost not quite an hour.  I stopped because I just figured it was some light/beacon, on a wire, or top of a pole, or something and the winds up that high were blowing stronger and moving it erratically like that.Well the next morning (being today) I went back to the same spot, only about 50 or so yards from my cabin.  THERE IS NOTHING AT ALL IN THE AREA OF THE SKY IN THE SPOT WHERE THIS LIGHT HAD BEEN AND WAS MOVING AR0UND.  I even took out my binoculars again to see if there was something further out and very narrow that I just couldn&rsquo;t make out.  Well, there wasn&rsquo;t.  So that is why I thought I&rsquo;d post this, just in case someone else saw the same thing.The coordinates of my position are: N 32 39&apos;52.0&quot; W093 18&apos;08.3&quot;, facing E 90deg.  This is the first time I&rsquo;ve ever seen anything like this in my life; and I&rsquo;ve looked for stuff out there like this.  I hope someone else out there saw, or sees the same thing in this area, and reports it here on NUFORC.

I saw something flying low, blackish-gray boomerang shaped, no lights, no sound, gliding slowly over the neighborhood around 2130 sunday night. I thought it was a flock of birds but it never broke formation and was to perfect of a shape, and there is noway it was a plane because it had no lights or sound, plus a plane flew over, in a different direction, maybe 30 seconds after in which I could hear sound and see blinking lights on it, at a much higher altitude.  Two other people saw the ufo fly over also and none of us have ever seen anything like it before.  Just checking to see if any other reports have came in.

Then I saw what appeared to be cigar shaped object above the moon from my perspective.  It was quite far away and moving quite rapidly across the sky.  If it was a jet at the size that I witnessed it, it would not be moving that fast.  There was no vapor trail, and it was silent.  We watched it move rapidly off into the distance.  Almost immediately following that, 4 F-16s followed and appeared to give chase.  That being said, it is also July 4th and sometimes the F-16s give air shows and the F-16s remained in the area for sometime after the object left which makes me question whether or not they were actually chasing the object or not.  I could clearly hear the F-16s but not the object.

It was white light, bright on the bottom of the craft, but the light was not radiating downward.  It seemed be flying too low to be an airplane, and as it approached (from the southeast), it was about the height of a traffic helicopter, but it was shaped like disc and larger than a helicopter.All I could make out was the bright white light on the bottom, but I could see that it was circular in shape and had a dome on the top which was not lighted.  As it neared my subdivision, it was definitely too large to be a helicopter, but it was also silent.  There were no noises last night outside, not even the hums of air conditioning units.  I waited about a minute to see if it was going to come closer or make a noise, and then it took a northerly direction and went over the house, out of sight.I found it strange that it was flying so low for its size and that it was silent.  We are near Scott AFB, Illinois, and planes often pass over but always make a sound of some sort.  I did not wake my husband to come and see and I was afraid to run to the front of the house and keep looking for it.One other thing; we are dogsitting this weekend and the dog was out on the deck with me when I saw this object.  When the dog saw it, it ran to the sliding glass door to be let inside.  I let the dog in and sat there for about another minute.I&rsquo;ve never reported anything like this, but since I did not hear of any other reportings on the local St. Louis news stations, I wanted to report it somewhere else to see if others saw what I saw.

She was excited about the Rolling Stones being on the Ed Sullivan show.  When she opened the back door so I could see the Stones, the song they were playing was &quot;Satisfaction,&quot; and that is how I remember the day and year, I was eleven years old at the time.  My friend went in to have dinner and I went  over to a darker section of  her backyard to twirl on the abandoned clothes line.Sitting on top of the  T section of  clothes line pole, I heard a whirring sound, have read where another witness to a similar ufo used the term &ldquo; electrical &ldquo; which does describe the sound, and is what I would imagine to be an  exceptionally well built electrical engine, like nothing on this earth. A very low whirring electrical sound.I looked up an not far above me, the height was of two garages placed on top of one another, the width was not as wide as a double car garage. What I say was UNBELIEVABLE, I was directly under the bottom of a  saucer shaped ufo, with multiple colored  beams of light pulsating around it; red, blue green yellow and an occasional white beam of light. It had a  bright white light in the center which went off for a spilt second and caused me to strain to see any details  of the bottom of the ufo. Which looked  like a dark gray silver color with a mid section slightly protruding, the beams of light seemed to emanate from holes on the bottom of the ship.I watched the lights for four to five minutes though for some reason time had seemed to lose meaning, when the ufo verved to the left of me, paused then moved away and disappeared in a blink of an eye. It  returned as I was still watching the spot in the dark sky where it had left and was above me once again for a brief period and left again the same way as before in a blink of an eye, as if it had disappeared, all of this was noiseless. I got the impression it wanted to make sure I knew what it was capable of doing.When my friend came out, I said that there was a ufo above me and she looked at me, looked up above me and said, lets go in the garage.This is something I never told many people about and suppressed the memory for obvious reasons.  When I began to hear reports of ufo&rsquo;s and shows on them, the memory came back very intensely and I began to speak about it to family member&rsquo;s who do not seem to know what to make of it.  I have also had to have cataract surgery, which had ophthalmologist shaking their heads that someone my age, without any family history of cataracts, had them as severe as I did.  Since then have been doing my own research and have read one or two reports of sightings in Bakersfield as well as elsewhere which describe the ufo I witnessed.  At the time this was occurring I was not fearful!  Though now it unnerves me to think of the power they have over us if they chose to use it.  I would like to be hypnotized and regressed back to that night to uncover details I might have forgotten.It does amaze me that our government has not done any survey of people that have witnessed ufo&rsquo;s.  Personally I know they are much more advanced than us, but my feeling is we may become just as advance if our civilization last long enough.  What makes me believe this is the whirring electrical engine/motor that I heard at the beginning of ufo sighting, was something, man here on earth could one day replicate.  One more thing, after viewing pictures and videos of ufo&rsquo;s, many seem to be near of above power lines, like they are taking energy from them?   There is so much more I would like to discuss, about what else they have been doing near power/telephone lines, some of it might label me a kook.  I also  would like to learn more, hopefully doors will open up so that we will not feel so ostracized.

The adults discussed what it might be and any kind of air craft of the date/time was ruled out.  No air plane no blimp, no helicopter.  You could not hear any sounds coming from the craft most likely due to the distance that it was from us.

Have been having these for 9 or 10 years.Anyway aside from that have had many curious and odd things happen.I would like to start with my sighting in March 2005 at 3:00am in Summerland, B.C.. I was visiting relatives in Summerland, B.C. and go there regularly, on this particular evening oddly enough we were discussing UFO&apos;s and my comment was, &quot;How could you not believe there are UFO&apos;s or other types of beings? The universe is so big we would be arrogent to think we were the only beings to exist.&quot;   There was some agreements and disagreements and the conversation fizzled out and eventually everyone went to bed.I was staying in my cousins house in the bedroom attic with the head of my bed facing south. I woke up looking out of the north window and it was very bright out and didn&apos;t think much of it then looked out the south window at the head of my bed to see if the light was comeing from the south. When I turned to look out of my bedroom window it was anything but bright, in the middle of the sky probably about 1/4 mile from me over the Okanagon Lake was a beautiful black triangle with lights on each corner. I pinched myself and patted myself down to make sure I wasn&apos;t dreaming and was stunned and frightened. It was really beautiful and smooth and black. I thought maybe for a moment it was a new type of plane like a stealth but I knew at once it wasn&apos;t. I wanted to run downstairs and tell my cousin but, #1. I didn&apos;t want to freak her out and #2. I was afraid to move.Anyway It silently hung in the air and did not move, I didn&apos;t sense it was hovering at all it was just there as still as anything. The triangle was probably about as large as a football field and extremely smooth and beautiful to look at. While I was looking at this UFO or whatever it was, this huge opalescent ball, (something like a bubble full of soap) came right up out of the top of it and hovered for a few seconds then flew straight up in the air and disapeared. By now I was totally freaked out and ran downstairs to get my cousin and of course by the time I could calm down and tell her what happened we ran back upstairs and it was gone. Naturally my cousin thinks I&apos;m a nut and had too much to drink. (for the record I wasn&apos;t drunk)  I have always been a believer of things that are unusal and strange to us that the majority of people refuse to think is possible, this event has totally solidified my belief in UFO&apos;s or whatever you want to call them.I know what I saw and regardless of what anyone thinks there is something going on here that our government is well aware of and has been for many years. My ex-husband and I have also witness ball lightning floating through our bedroom window in 1994. It floated around the room very slowly then left with an explosive crashing sound through our night light. Nothing was damaged, although it sounded like the light shattered . My ex husband is about as cynical and skeptical as they come, so, slightly happy that such a skeptic actually saw this strange phenonema. Further back in the 70&apos;s my aunt and I witnessed a huge fireball in the Nevada desert. We were on our way to Disneyland for a family trip (I think I was 10) I was in our camper on top of the higher bunk with the window facing forward towards the road. My aunt and I were the only people to witness this huge fireball that seemed to come toward us then blow up. The funny thing was that my aunt and I never talked about it until 20 years later. She has also been a witness to UFO&apos;s. Although, I have great interest in Ufology, she does not, but certainly cannot deny what she has seen. To tell you the truth this frightens me a bit and have read alot of books on the subject and have come to a few of my own conclusions, mostly conspiracy.I certainly hope letting you know about this does not open a can of worms for me but have wanted to chat about it for some time.

She said she didn&apos;t tell anyone because she got distracted by all the fireworks. She then said that she saw a red, circular &apos;space ship&apos; that she thought was a balloon at first, but changed her mind when it got closer and she saw that it moved more like a plane, not &apos;bumping around&apos; and there was no string.  She added that it looked to be made of glass with a bright red light inside it.  She said that she felt scared at first and then happy, and that she did not hear anything unusual.  I asked if it had a happy face on it, and she said it did not. I asked if it flashed at all and she said yes, a lighter red or orange, from the middle.  I asked her if she could see the shape clearly, and she said she could not because the light was bright, but that she felt as it went away &quot;In a flat line&quot; it seemed to her that it changed and became longer in shape. She indicated that she first saw it coming from the South at about the same level as the commercial planes that go overhead many times a day, but that when it got closer, it seemed lower and closer than a plane. She feels she may have thought it was higher at first but realized it was much lower when it came closer, not that it suddenly dove down.  When it left, she said it rose slightly and went up and to the West before she could no longer see it.

It seem to get low to the ground and something separated from it and I could see a small light flashing from the ground. When the separation occurred there was a red long light or beam. There was not any sound from the objects but I was hearing the sound of branches snaping or something like it ever so often. Than the light went back down to the ground it seemed to be out of sight, for about 2 minutes. Then I saw it comming back up, it was just a low pulsing blue light, (star blue light)and I watched it travel up high into the night sky heading south. I called 911 and the city of Kirkland sent out an officer. I also got a few pics that seem somewhat strange. One is of the separation and in the pic there are 2 objects from the main craft.

I pulled the blinds back and noticed a white hazy object, hovering above the treeline across the street from where I live.  The object was at a distance of anywhere between 5-7 miles away.  It was a particularly clear night and the stars were out.  It was a white light moving in a small circlular patter, very eratically.  I stared in disbelief and then walked outside to observe.

At approx 9:55pm my partner noticed three (3) individual orange-ish/white-ish lights in the sky. He yelled out, &quot;Oh my GOD, look at that!&quot; so we all turned to look. What we seen we weren&apos;t prepared for. It appeared to be a triangular &quot;UFO&quot;. These three (3) lights looked as if to be fireballs, with tracing firey tails. They were ALWAYS changing form, from a triangle, to a straight line, and back to a triangle formation. They flew acrossed the sky a bit, however toward the end of the event, they remained stationary. I ran inside to find my camera, and shot some of the final moments on film. The last few seconds they appeared to be falling, as a leaf would. As the &quot;crafts&quot; descended toward the ground, we noticed a plane flying around the same site in which the lights (crafts) were. There were many witnesses (15+).

It was a cigar shaped craft about the size of a Cessna or leer jet.  It was following the same trajectory that a normal plane would make on approach to landing, however it was not descending.

The object then turned 90 degrees away from me and traveled south.  When it turned it was like I was looking at the back end of it so it was now circular in shape and had no wings.

Glowing orb sightings occurred April 16-22 of 2009 the other 2 bigger ships showed the 16th and 17th only the one big ship returned April 19-22 but here is the best part on 4/21 between 12 o clock and 1 o clock at night I was actually getting very scared had no car or phone to get the hell out of dodge and I herd a jet so ran on the porch to see what was about to happen and thought I was gonna see something really cool  ha!! Nope the jet flying between 10 maybe 15 thousand ft. flew directly over the house with his burners on and a maybe a mile or 2 away was the UFO  the jet just flew by or just didn&apos;t see it either way I felt a little less worried because I thought somebody finally made the call it did take of about 30 seconds later or I thought that just a cloud covering it without the cloud.Me being irrational with the reality of the situation ran to the middle of the driveway with my binoculars I noticed this pain in the back of my head that me and my mother had felt on 16th but she was to freaked out by the whole idea and actually said she was scared she was gonna get picked up and dropped of ha!! so most every night I got my binoculars and watched the orbs circling each other but they came a little earlier each night the 2 orbs were never out with the other 2 UFOs that i could see they always came before the UFOs with red/white light&apos;s.Also I&apos;m 10! 0% sure they were not airplanes because most of the time I would be watching the UFOs and planes would go by. Also that area is flooded with air traffic day and night but those first 2 nights there was so many airplane there was at least 1 or more in my sight at all times and no noise at all from the orbs and flight characteristics matched none of today&apos;s jets/plains/helicopter hovered like a balloon but picked up to much speed to fast.It was not shooting stars very simple very clear. I also know a few people who live in that area a good chunk of their life who have witnessed UFO activity in the area years ago.These were not my first sightings in the area 2 times before to be exact witch leads me to my next words. 2 people told me they saw a UFO years earlier in the area.I look at the stars since the dish got cut off about a month ago I would not have saw any of it if i had not talked to my grandmother that day .At first it when the orbs arrived I could not be drag in the house all I wanted to do was get that awesome footage and watch it over every night.But each night was a little different but on the 4th day I was doing a lot of thinking and was also filled with excitement fear I just wasn&apos;t thinking strait.I would sometimes turn on the porch light before I would go outside or to let dogs in and out so eventually  what ever was flying those aircraft had to see me turning on the porch light the UFO,s returned every night for something they would hover for hours some nights so when they stopped in the sky right in front of the house and they got a little closer as they were circling and dropping altitude slowly closer towards the ground.They knew I was there I just didn&apos;t really think about it until the orbs chilled in the air for a couple hours and it was still 4/20 about 10 o clock to top it all of I was by my myself no running vehicle and I finally realized if they/it whatever could build aircraft such as the ones they/it/him/her what ever posses they probably have technology or something that lets them know ! I&apos;m ther e. I ignored my worst fears and the hurt in my head to see if the other 1or 2 UFO,s were doing their thing about a mile or so away the fear is the 2 orbs froze in the sky circling away.I tried to take more pictures worthless attempts the camera sucks so it was another fail.So I sat on the porch looking at the sky above a airplane was passing and a really bright light caught my eye from strait above it was the second UFO from the mountain it&apos;s lights shined bright white ember and red  for about 5 seconds then quickly cut of its lights. After that my brain couldn&apos;t let me watch any more i had seen to much it could have been right above me the entire time it had demonstrated it&apos;s superior capabilities. I couldn&apos;t take it I came close to calling the 5-0 to do what.But at 12:32 4/21 I heard the jet and I couldn&apos;t help to think what if those where aliens that would mean that this planet could be taken if so pleased seeing demonstrations 1 after another. now for but I know the Crafts could have returned again last night i could not tell you yes or no because i was typing this. I can take a chance and look like a fool or do NOTHING.  4/25/09   pss i wrote this on the 4/24 and 25th and i returned to my house at about 8 or 9 on the night of the 25th and the UFOs did return again about it seen much more UFO activity last night more than what is normally out actually.Not sure all how many or if any other people in the area know about the UFO  activity in the area . But I checked online to see if any UFO had been reported in the area  but nothing has ever been reported in that area till now.But i heard some people on a plane over North Carolina seen UFO in Feb i really wouldn&apos;t doubt it  or just t don&apos;t care.4/27/09 Saw 3 UFO&apos;s within 1 hour. I only watched for a hour or so then retired for the night.  4/28/09 OK this time i saw 3 UFO&apos;s circling near an airplane was pretty close to the 3 orbs glowing a ember or copper color . I honestly would not be surprised if people or pilots do not report seeing them.Also 3 extra! UFO&apos;s i n where in the sky last night. and I also seen the shape of UFO that was a  triangle it had 6 lights that shined a bright white and I now think it was one like the triangle UFO that landed or just hovered over neighbors yard but to be honest I don&apos;t really know the shape of the craft that hovered over the neighbors yard but because I took 6 pictures on the 16th and looked at them on my computer the 17th no good except for I could see something in 1 picture that was above the ground that looked like a silver line but thought nothing of it and deleted it because I thought it was just camera error and another pic with bubble light if that makes since looked like bubbles that were lite up from the inside out all over the picture and i didn&apos;t even mean to take a picture I turned around to go on the porch after many failed pictures and it just took a pic but now it would make since because I thought that was 1 of the 2 with the red and white lights I just couldn&apos;t say because I only seen the lights on them but now I&apos;m 50% sure that the 2 with the red and white lights were triangle while the other 2 were orb shaped but only from a distance I am still not sure of their  true shape yet but i will try to find out.I&apos;ve also seen more UFO&apos;s but these that i have written about have always came back and hang around in the area for hours or a few minutes at a  time. sometimes they leave and return the same night but there are also many others but are just passing through the area  i do know is that there is a air base or something around  4/29/09 also sorry for not sending this sooner but this is one of the biggest decision of my life and  i fear you guys will come to check it out and the UFO&apos;s will have left the area and I will look like A dumb ass.Just contact me by email if you have any questions.1 Last thing i have not really left any specific time records for sightings well I also didn&apos;t keep count but if i did it be about 30 just since April 16/09 and i would be happy to take a lie detector test if needed you can! imagine that i am very confused with what I am seeing and for a while after i seen my first real UFO right by house about 200ft in the air and the craft was at least 60ft to 70ft I was beyond petrified and terrorfied my mom was in the next room so I holler to show her and it was moving at about 30mph we got out on the porch and it was going right over the tree line at a near by mountain with only 1 dim white light on and i started turning the flash light on and off and it brighten it&apos;s light and froze in mid air over the mountain for a couple of seconds then faded from sight as it hovered the mountain I thought i was hallucinating basically I thought i was going insane my mom saw it to or she says she did.The 2nd time I was at the end of the driveway using the cell phone and this time I was alone but I was talking to somebody who I couldn&apos;t exactly tell there is a UFO and the front is visible and the rest is like not there.The guy would have laughed hung up and had me in a padded room within the hour plus I didn&apos;t tell anyone mainly because nobody could believe this anyway. So I thought to my self ? there was a front and it was black I thought it was some birds flying in like a formation but first of all it was to even if birds are flying that close together there is gonna be some birds getting ahead even 1ft  movement in fly formation it would look squiggly and no wings flapping and no space between the wings of the birds that&apos;s when I started thinking great another UFO maybe I&apos;m not crazy.It was also like 6oclock day time sunny not dark at all.It was only about 100yards in the air and it was moving to slow to some birds flying and I couldn&apos;t think of anything else that even looks like that did and still cant.I can only say the front was shaped like an ark it was black and if this was a UFO it was about 120ft wide at least and the rest wasn&apos;t even visible I&apos;M not sure why all of this shit is all within 3mile radios of the house.At first i thought they had their own private base somewhere in the mountains that ! was my o wn little crap theory so I remembered the direction the 1st UFO was headed then the 2nd then i figured out if there was a base I got the general direction it might be in but here is the interesting part there is a water fall in the direction I figured the base would be not a base but a person i know and his friend saw a UFO up at the water fall years ago.Another person i know said he saw one out the house window. saw diamond shaped UFO same kind I had seen at my old  house but in a different place 2 times and to top it all of A jet was chasing a UFO right above my head at about 20 to 35 thousand ft. I was gonna send a email to Ktox to show UFO hunters in April but to much pressure and I was moving so instead I just let it eat at my soul if i ever had one. I will fill out a crap report that people will laugh at anyway but if my best friend told me this shit I would have called the nut hut. I also found out that during the days of my April 16th/25th UFO sighting people all over the planet were witnessing the strange crafts I even watched a video of  2 orbs in a different place i didn&apos;t really expect that A month later but its crazy. also many left out details and UFO sightings.also temperarly disabled the DVD player with fuzzy black and white picture kinda twisted blackness on 4/20 weak also had 2 pretty weird dreams during those nights maybe caused by stress and fear.Also i forgot to mention April/16/09 I called my friend then called my grandma that lives in Delaware for the first time in 2 years i call her and talk till cell phone goes dead then charge up and go back to the end of the drive way to get cell phone reception.Anyway I didn&apos;t tell here about my second UFO sighting just my first and she told me her and her daughter saw 2 orb shaped UFO&apos;s that were as she describes circling each other kinda like they were just playing with each other so I was starting to feel not as insane after she told me that but she didn&apos;t know how twisted my mind was from the my 2nd sighting and we started discussing how we think the world is failing I said [to be completely honest i don&apos;t think the world is gonna make it to long at the rate its going and humanity will eventually kill itself with the pride in the nations starting pride wars  they wont just unit as people and just get it over with and start the road to mega science and eventually humans leave earth to go explore the universe] And she was saying now days it&apos;s scary to even consider having  a kid in the world today and I was standing by the mail box and it was starting to get dark but I was just looking up in the sky and i saw i just waited about 5 seconds to think see holy shit mum mum there are 2 orbs just circling each other just like mum mum said like 10 minutes earlier my mind was bent way to far then so i ran in the house got my mom and they were gone I knew then I had lost my fuckin mind i told mum mum they were gone and nobody seen them once again then I told her about my second siting and how crazy I am because i COULD HAVE SWORN i JUST SAW THEM 2 UFOs i said then she says your not crazy and if they just poped up from the sky they will be back I started telling her no they won&apos;t because I&apos;m just crazy but i waited a couple minutes and told her that&apos;s the biggest coincidence of my life but still not sure of reality untill the orbs show up again I got my moms and her boyfriend to check it out and sure enough they ! were rea l I wasn&apos;t crazy my mind untied for the moment just untill the 2 bigger UFOs were chillin over a mountain till later then me and my mom was trying to take the pictures of them in the sky then 1 of the UFOs flew over a mountain it was amazing to even be able to watch it just move at all to even see the damn thing then lights were flashing near the ground I knew if i didn&apos;t say anything just give it 10 seconds max and my mom said do yo see that light on the ground she say what the hell is that I was still focused on the other UFO in the sky mainly the lights because they were flashing the same colors and it wasn&apos;t the neighbors TV on in the camper.Looking at it threw the binoculars was making my heart speed and hands shake and could see the light on very clear as they flashed different colors purple red blue green i don&apos;t remember all the colors but at some point a truck went by maybe 100 to 125ft from the object from the road it lasted about 30 minutes and only got weirder as the lights in the sky were synchronized flashing of colors with those just of the craft that just hovered over the ground a quarter mile away then gone like nothing but it was back over a mountain after that mom wouldn&apos;t even go to check out the UFOs with me any other night except 1 more time to see a triangle UFO crawl across the sky and when it went over the mountain she was back in the house she missed the best part after a couple minutes passed the bright white light on the craft looked awesome as it went to fast for my guesses i just know it picked up and haled ass out of that valley and her boyfriend just wants nothing to do with any of that but now he is all about some gay brown mountain lights or something i told him this is maybe once in a lifetime thing you might never see anything this amazing ever again he didn&apos;t even respond.these events took place on April/16-17/2009 believe it or not this shit happened and still is happening all over the world is my guess it doesn&apos;t just happen near my house and my neighbors front yard! ...1 mor e thing I had a dream and all I really remember is seeing the alien face as i lay on a table or something and it was over me then i woke up and my right eye was twitching really bad I don&apos;t think it was an abduction more like fear and stress and some other issues coming out but the other dream well may have been a abduction because I&apos;ve never felt like i&apos;m awake with my eyes closed but couldn&apos;t move I felt paralyzed I knew I wanted my eyes open but I just lay there and I don&apos;t know how long but when i finally came to i knew that has never happened and i felt like I was floating and then i felt the couch i was sleeping on touching me and time could not even be measured in the stat i was in I felt violated with life and still do i haven&apos;t called any of my friends or spoke to my granny since 4/17/09 and every minute of every day most all day till i go to sleep than wake up with it on my mind it never goes away and not showing my friends was a mistake but what if they got abducted then how would i feel because when i would see UFOs I would give em the finger I used to say if i ever see A UFO I&apos;m gonna shoot at it.THESE ARE THE MOST OUTRAGES CLAIMS YOU HAVE PROBABLY HEARD well i don&apos;t care because every word of it is true.", "Bright moving light, no flashing from SW to NEFrom my hot tub on the East side of my home, I noticed a very bright light, similar to a satellite moving slowly from what would have been the Southwest to the Northeast.  Because of where my hot tub sits in relation to my house, I did not notice the item until it was almost directly overhead.It had no flashing lights like an aircraft and appeared to be too low for a satellite and too high for most conventional aircraft - also too bright.  This is also a highly unusual path for aircraft traffic.  It MAY have slowed, hesitated or varied slightly in it&apos;s course, but I can not be sure.Initially, I thought this may be the Shuttle or ISS catching the glint of the sun that had just set over the horizon, but the shining was FAR brighter than previous sightings of known space objects and the light did not fade or dissipate as it went towards the visible edge of the sky (we have mountains fairly close there).I had to exit the hot tub and proceed to the front of my home to maintain visibility as my neighbors home and shed quickly blocked my view. I lost sight of the item as it went past the rim of the mountains.((NUFORC Note:  Overflight of the ISS.

It caught my attention because one...it was BRIGHT! It was brighter than any light on a plane that I have ever seen.  Two, the entire object looked spherical and unlike a plane or helicopter of any kind.  Lastly, the way and direction it was traveling was odd. It was moving fairly slow, but somewhat sporadically.  It also changed direction rather quickly with no wide turns like a plane or anything like that.Another thing that caught my attention was the direction of travel. I live somewhat close to LAX Airport and often watch the planes lined up for miles on their decent. Rarely do I see aircraft headed at a 90 degree angle towards the line of planes. It was a good deal higher than the planes on their way in for a landing and was of no threat to them. But again, I do not see aircraft flying in that direction.After watching the craft for roughly a minute or two it seemed to start moving higher up and away from us. The once extremely bright sphere began to slowly fade away right before our eyes until it was completely gone!  There were no clouds in the sky at the time and no obstruction of our view.

On Sunday 17th May, 2009 I was taking photographs of radio controlled model aircraft at an airshow at my local club. The day was very clear, without any clouds, but was extremely windy as a cold front had just moved in from the South. The only full sized aircraft were commercial airliners approaching OR Tambo International airport at an elevation of approximately 2000 metres above ground level. No small aircraft or helicopters were seen in the vicinity at all during the day.There were several incidents the worst 2 being aircraft that went totally out of control and crashed into the ground. My camera, a Cannon EOS 350 D Digital fitted with a 300 mm lens, was consistently going into an error mode requiring switching off and on to reset. This was mildly annoying. Another anomaly was that where I was sitting, amongst the parked model aircraft, all of them switched off, I though I heard the electronic relays &ldquo;chattering&rdquo; occasionally but dismissed it as impossible.On the following morning whilst downloading to my PC all the photographs that I had taken I spotted 2 strange &ldquo;blobs&rdquo;. On closer examination after zooming the picture the &ldquo;blobs&rdquo; resemble disc shaped flying objects. Unfortunately the focus is not good as I was focusing on the model aircraft.The aircraft were about 150 meters away but the &ldquo;blobs&rdquo; are about 10 to 15 kM away.Could these be the typical saucer shaped UFO&rsquo;s that we read about so often?  I am a normal, educated and responsible male adult, 68 years of age. I am not prone to exaggerating and have an analytical approach as I am a qualified professional Electrical Engineer.This is the first time that I have actually seen something like this, although I have seen strange fast moving lights at night. I live close to OR Tambo international airport as well as DENEL semi military aircraft facility.If you require the original photograph please give me an e-mail address to send it to.

It then zoomed through the sky and eventually went out of sight.There were then 2 crafts moving parallel to each other very quickly.

The time was 2:23pm (local eastern) and the sky was clear and sunny.  The light appeared to me to be an airliner at first.  Upon further review, the altitude must have been 100,000+ feet and the distance from my location unknown.  The light did not move in the sky.  The intensity of the light is really what kept my attention; it was as bright as the sun.  I did pull my car to the side of the road to watch it because the size vs. altitude was not adding up in my head to be correct.  After about 1 minute, the object turned black/dark grey and seconds later I was unable to locate the object with my eyes.  Even when it turned black/dark grey, the size to altitude ratio would have made the object much bigger than an airliner.", "Bright White Sphere seen by 3 witnesses at Lake Leland, WAA bright white sphere was seen by 3 people while camping at the OK Ranch to the South of Lake Leland, WA.

The place we were meeting at was for me a former work place , but one that my friend still works at during the day; the parking lot of the Santiko Embassy theater located off of Bitters Rd near Hwy 281 in San Antonio TX (this location is about a half a mile or less from the San Antonio airport).  The movies had finished and I believe the only cars left were those of the employees still inside.We were standing at our cars just talking when I turned from facing south to the east, and as I looked at the sky I saw lights; as we are near the airport didn&rsquo;t think anything of it as I just assumed it was one of many planes that fly in and out all hours of the day.  But within what seemed less than a second the light zigzagged not only up and down, but sideways as well.  My first thought was &ldquo;what the heck&rdquo;, second thought &ldquo;helicopter&rdquo;, third thought, &ldquo;hell no they don&rsquo;t move like that&rdquo;, then I saw that there was more than one light.  It was partially cloudy and the lights would disappear and appear depending on if they were behind a cloud or not.  Because they did not all disappear and appear around the clouds at the same time it was hard to say if there was more than 4 lights or not.  I was not able to judge the distance or height but it appeared to be higher than the landing or takeoff height of the planes around the area of the airport.  Trying to be logical about what I was seeing I then assumed they were doing something at the airport or at least in the vicinity of the airport, something like floodlights; but to the best of my ability during a cloudy sky flood lights appear to shine off the clouds and of course have a trail of light to lead you to their location, not disappear behind the clouds without once showing a trail of light.  Understand that this all took less than a minute while I was just staring at lights; meanwhile my girlfriend (who was facing north towards me) was still talking.  I then shouted out, &ldquo;did you see that&rdquo;, and of course she said &ldquo;what&rdquo;.  I pointed up to the area where there was now nothing to see as they appeared to have gone behind the clouds; she again said what when suddenly one then 3 or more appeared and were zigzagging all over that one area.  I again asked if she &ldquo;saw that&rdquo; and she replied &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, and asked her what she thought they were planes or helicopters, she said no way, they don&rsquo;t move that way or that fast.  We just kept watching them zigzag extremely fas! t in and out of the clouds but always in the same area.  I thought maybe lights from the planes, but that didn&rsquo;t make sense as they don&rsquo;t move that fast or zigzag up and down.  We watched for several minutes and talking excitedly about we thought we might be watching and at this time I checked the time and it was 12:48; I believe I first saw the lights at 12:45 and then my friend said &ldquo;this is just to weird I&rsquo;m leaving&rdquo;, by this time I myself was getting scared and said &ldquo;me too&rdquo;.  Neither of us had a camera; her cell phone had previously be damaged and the screen would only show black, I had a new phone and don&rsquo;t know how to use it yet but to be honest didn&rsquo;t even think about it. Since I only first noticed the lights at 12:45am and stopped watching at 12:55am I have no idea how long they might have actually been visible. At approximately 12:54 I was driving off, went to hwy 281 and headed north towards hill country where I live 3-4 miles outside the city limits on a bluff overlooking the area both south towards Johnson City and north towards the airport and town.  As soon as I got home I went to the highest point near my home to look at the sky but saw nothing but sky, stars, clouds and the lights from the planes flying overhead.  By this time it was about 1:20 and as I tried to calm down and think of what I should do I went onto my computer and went to white pages where I looked up numbers for the airport and non-emergency Bexar County police.  I got in touch with the airport police and asked them if they were doing anything with lights at the airport which they responded no and asked them if anyone had reported seeing lights.  I explained what I saw and he said no one had called, took my name and we said good night.  At least he asked me my name and thanked me for calling, that he would check around, the Bexar county policewoman who took my call asked me nothing, just listened said no when I asked if anyone else had called then thanks for calling and we hung up.  I&rsquo;m still excited about what I saw and unless someone can tell me that there was some kind of light show going on at this time of the night on a Monday or anything in the least bit believable, I will always believe I saw UFO&rsquo;s; but they&rsquo;d have to be pretty convincing, since as I said there was no normal cloud effects with these lights, just extremely fast zigzagging in and out of them. This morning I got up with the knowledge that I was going to call someone else and report what I saw so I went on line an entered &ldquo;UFO Sightings&rdquo; and got you, next I&rsquo;m going to enter FAA and see if there is a number I can call. I&rsquo;m not crazy and in fact worked for 15 years with the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority before retiring early and moving to San Antonio.

I have worked in the travel industry for my entire adult life and I am well versed in aircraft and flight paths and this didnt fit either of those.

Once the light&apos;s brightness reached its peak, the light started moving up at a 45-55 degree angle and then the light started to dim and after a few more seconds, the light disappeared completely. I told my friend who I was on the phone with what I saw and that I couldnt believe it! Anyway, that was what happened. It was odd to say the least!

I noticed it was a half moon this morning, and my chickens were already up and making noise (the usual). As I stood there (and as I often do), I looked directly up from my position into the night sky and I was faced to the East (the Moon would be on my right hand side, the Dipper on my Left).I usually see airliners this early in the morning (one, maybe two), either coming from OKC to DFW, or from Tinker AFB in OKC, with their typical, and never confused, blinking red lights. The stars are out his morning, the moon not extremely bright, so I figured I might see one.I did see SOMETHING, but not an airliner/jet. It was moving directly above me, from West (directly above me) to East (directly in front of me, very slightly SE, slow, long curve), and did NOT have ANY blinking lights at all. In fact, the only reason I DID see it is because unlike a jet, this twinkled from time to time like a Star (and not steady like a jet or planet, and Venus is up (I think it is her), east of the Moon&apos;s position, which was to my front right, at about the 1 O&apos;Clock position, the Moon at my 4 O&apos; Clock position).The only reason I wondered about this, is that it left NO visible trail in a clear, partially moonlit sky (such as a foreign object, or meteorite), and was moving MUCH faster than any object I have EVER seen. It covered (from my view) directly above me, to almost Tree top in the FAR distance/horizon in less than 2 minutes, and to date, after having seen thousands of airliners/military jets move over us, I have NOT seen one cover that much distance in that amount of time. It was extremely high up, for me to not distinctly see the typical airliner lights (which you always see).It was a fairly steady blue-ish light, which twinkled, had no &quot;burn&quot; trail such as a meteor (that &quot;electrical wire/copper in a fire&quot; type of trail), and finally simply disappeared (faded), still no trail, and no airliner lights. As it moved, I shifted my vision 4-5 times to other parts of the sky to compare/confirm that it was (A)Not my vision playing tricks, (B)Not a Star I was mistaking, (C)Not an Airliner (I moved my physical position to confirm) and (D)Not a Meteor. It made ZERO sound (that high up, I would not have heard it anyway).No other airplanes were in the immediate sky (my vincinity) that I could see.I thought I had seen &quot;fast&quot; before, this morning proves I was wrong.

They were round like an upside down bowl hovering low over Staufen in Germany. When I first saw them I thought they were very bright stars then I realised how orange-red they looked. I looked for other stars in the sky but there were only a few visible and they were small and bleu. I watched them moving around   I went inside for my camera to try to film them. The only camera I have is digital the zoom was not strong enough, but I filmed 2 of the objects. I went upstairs to get a higher view. By this time just 1 object was left in the sky and appeared further away. They glowed and looked like they were spinning, they were quite low down.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

She pointed to the sky and asked &quot;What is that?&quot; Me and our friend looked to where she was pointing and saw a round object floating across the sky. It was flying very high, but below the cloud level.  I ran into the house and grabbed some binoculars, came back outside and focused on the object. through the binoculars, I could see the front of the object was red, the rest was either silver or white.  I pased my girlfriend the binoculars and she saw it. then she handed them to our friend who also saw it.  It seemed to be &quot;barrel-rolling&quot;.   I got the binoculars back to look at it, and it disappeared.  I scanned the sky for a few seconds before I saw it again, but it was all black.   I ran through the house to the front yard, but lost sight of it again.  When I went back to the back patio, we were asking each other &quot;What was that?&quot;  Then I pointed out 2 F-15&apos;s flying in the direction the object went.  They were followed by an F-16 and 2 more F-15&apos;s.", "10 orange/red round objects size of a large plane lights at night - this happened during fourth of July fireworks, July 7, 2009:On July 4, 2009, approximately around 9:30 p.m. my husband pointed out a moving orange/red glowing light. We were facing north and the light was coming towards us slightly to the left side of the north, and to see the lights we needed to lift our heads up slightly in the distance the objects were coming from. When the object reached about 90 degrees to the left of its location, the object started to rise upward. As it did, I saw two more objects appear from the same point as the first one. The same thing happened. By the time the other two objects&rsquo; reach the other on, two more came out and the first object was very high in the sky and diminished. The angle we had to look at the first object was at that 90 degree angle from the way we were looking when it was closest to us. The object had seemed to rise a little below the stars and faded away.  This happened up to about ten objects. Time frame is around 15 minutes. We did no further investigation because I am skeptical and we had guest over watching the fire works. However, we believe in &ldquo;anything is possible.&rdquo; Today I went online to see if anyone reported this. I did find someone in Bartlett, Illinois. This town is about 10 to 15 minutes away and east of our location. He explained it in a similar way then the way it happened here. That confirmed to me that these were coming from other places. If these were homemade, I do not think the person could do this in other location that far away and have these objects follow one another. The man from Bartlett said the object got to a point where they formed in a line together. Then, I remembered looking on the internet and seeing that it has happened in other places than Illinois. I have seen similar pictures on the internet of that formation of lights.The object&apos;s sizes were almost the size of airplane lights off in a short distance. The lights, to me, glowed ever so softly, but were powerful in brightness. When I was observing how they were approaching it as though they were dangling from something, like a tiny helium balloon. However, we could not see any object connected to these lights. There were other people there is well and they saw the same thing. They may come forward, but who knows. We will try.One last thing,  Back in the early 1980&rsquo;s, my ex-husband told me that he was walking in an old area by his house and saw a hovering craft. He said he was approached and told if he said anything that he would be killed. This happened in Carpentersville Illinois in a vacant area off of route 31 in Carpentersville, Illinois. The land used to be a race track. Which is technically North of where I live now. This is all I have to offer. I do believe that there is something. Are they spying ships for the government, UFO&rsquo;s? I will never say they are a hoax anymore. There is something. Thank you for your time.", "Bright object descended rapidly, leaving a shower of sparks, and turned in a J shape, then stayed the same.I woke up at 4:00 a.m. to behold a bright yellow light, about three times bigger than a bright star, even with the ridge top east of El Rito.  The ridge is about 500 feet above the valley floor where the town is situated.  I was looking east at this object.Within 5 minutes, it had risen about an &ldquo;inch&rdquo; above the ridgeline.  In two or three more minutes, it had risen about 2 &ldquo;inches.&rdquo;  (If I hold up my fingers horizontally and squint with one eye, it seems to have risen to two fingers above the ridgeline.Then, as I sat there watching it, it started to descend rapidly, throwing out a shower of sparks behind it.  A shooting star was descending at the same time, to the northeast, but this object was not near it, and it was bigger than the shooting star.  Suddenly it turned in a J shape, and began ascending again, then stopped and stayed in the same place.I continued to watch it for 45 minutes, until 4:45 a.m., when I became so sleepy that I couldn&rsquo;t keep watching anymore.  In that time, it had risen 6 finger-widths from the ridgeline, faster than the sun rises, so I think it was rising faster than the rotation of the earth.Part of the time, I watched it through binoculars.  When I did, I seemed to be able to discern a crescent shape, and through the binoculars, it appeared to be sending out rays in all four directions like a cross.Perhaps I was looking at Venus, which my almanac says is bright in the morning sky right now.  But if that was Venus, then why was it brighter than a shooting star, and bigger, and why was it rising so rapidly, and why did it descend, sending out a shower of sparks behind it, and then turn in a J shape and ascend?  I think this is very unusual.I spoke today to a local astronomer, who hadn&rsquo;t noticed it.  I&rsquo;ve agreed to get up at 4:00 a.m. tomorrow and observe again, and he has agreed to observe also, and I will call him at work on Monday morning, June 1, and we will compare notes.", "Bright/fast moving object in the night skyThe sighting occurred around the time of 10:00 PM, it was a clear night and I had decided to lay in my yard and view the sky. The sky was dark and dotted with stars, planes slowly moved across the sky. I continued to watch the sky for a good thirty minutes or so until I saw something out of the ordinary in the sky. What I saw was a sudden bright light; at first I thought it was just a bright star but the more I looked I realized it wasn&rsquo;t a star at all. The light was not a fiery white blaze a meteor would normally generate, it instead looked as though something was shining a huge bright spotlight in the sky towards my directing. The flying object was not bearing any strobe light or light a plane would normally carry and not giving off any loud chopping noise a helicopter would generate and was not giving off a roar a jet would normally create. The light it was giving was too bright and massive to be any airliner as well. As I strained my eyes to make out the light on the aircraft it suddenly turned to the left so I could get an almost clear view of its side. With the light no longer focused in my direction I strained to view what appeared to be a long cylinder-like object with a red light on what I assumed was its front. Soon the red light dimmed to such an extent that it was impossible to decipher where it exactly was in the sky.", "Bright light moving across the sky then vanishes as plane comes over.I was standing outside my back door having a cigarette. I saw a bright white light that i first thought was a star, but i noticed it was moving across the sky, over our house there is a flight path to birmingham int airport, which the planes take a regular path, this bright light was coming directly across the flight path which i thought was strange. As this light was moving a plane appeared into my vision from over my house, as soon as the plane got maybe half a mile from the object the light faded out. This could mean it faded or it shot upwards. A very strange and interesting sighting. I couldnt put a distance on the object but it was around the average height of a plane.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I thought it might be Venus- but I am not sure.  So I watched and over about 15 mins it did appear to be moving towards the west and slightly to the south.  The angle from me to the object increased.   At this point I went and got my digital camera and shot several pictures with the flash, until I could remember how to turn that function off and shot several more pictures.

We are both in our 30&apos;s with children and have never experienced what we saw that night. In the Northern sky approximately 30 degrees toward the West, was a bright white light, with a flash of red and sometimes blue.  The sky was clear and there was a full moon.  Upon further study with binoculars, this was not a star, an airplane nor a blimp.  I&apos;ve never believed in anything like this, and when I looked through the binoculars, I wanted to vomit.  We tried to think of what else it could be without stating the obvious.  Through the binoculars was an object with squared lights to the left/right, that towards the right side was bright white, and as you looked to the left the lights resemebled LED lights, flashing and moving.  This object sat above the water for approxiamtely 2 hours before it eventually turned and lowered.

We suddenly stopped talking as it seemed to just float by us.  I remember the bottom of the aircraft reminding me of the ship on &quot;Star Trek&quot; it was dark grey with rivets etc.  There was a light on each point of the triangle.

At the faintest, it was still as bright as most stars.Secondly, it appeared to be motionless for at least five minutes, if not longer as we first watched it.

Blue Fireball Impacted SouthWestern Virginia Valentines Day 197414 February 1974 at approximately 21:00 I was at Woodlwan Intermediate School in Woodlawn, VA. located halfway between Hillsville and Galax Virgina in Carroll County.  The event was our Valentines Day Dance. I was only 14 years old and in the 8th grade.  This event was so memorable and permanently emdedded in my memory because it was so dramatic.  It had a huge impact on me and has remained so ever since I witnessed what you are about to read.I was attending the dance alone- dateless- I was only 14 years old and not yet dating at full-steam.  Because of my singular attendance, I was bored and stepped out into the hallway adjacent to our cafeteria where the dance took place.  At the southwest entrance door peering outward, the night was very crisp, cold and a beautiful clear Blue Ridge Mountains winter night.  You could actually see the outline of the distant mountain tops of Mt. Rogers and White Top Mountain in Grayson County about 50 miles distant.  I was looking in the direction of the two mountains taking a break from the dance in the cafeteria adjacent to the hallway.  These two mountains are both exceeding 1 mile elevation, making them clearly visible and unobstructed from almost any position, day or night, within 60 to 70 miles radius of the area of SouthWestern Virginia and Northwest North carolina.While standing at the doorway I peered outside through the glass in boredom from the dance. I noticed a huge blue fireball with a white contrail descending through the clearly lit sky, streaking towards earth at an incredible speed. It approached the ground at approxiamtely 25 degree angle of approach to the horizon.  I remember thinking about how I could actually hear the roar of this fireball approaching above the roar of adjacent music from the dance inside in the cafeteria!   After about 2 seconds of visible and audible flight time, the blue fireball raced through the winter night sky approaching from the North at an incredibe rate of speed.  It impacted the ground with a huge flash of exploding blue and white light!  The explosion that resulted appeared to be in the vicinity of the 2 mountains I mentioned above- Mt. Rogers and White Top Mountain.Approximately 5 to 10 seconds (and possibly even as much as 20 seconds- seconds felt like minutes at that moment) afterwards, the resulting shockwave from the exploding blue white object shook the ground and door where I was observing. I remember thinking that it had to be a huge object to produce the resulting shockwave through the earth and thundering noise that I could hear over the roar of the music from the dance.  I initially had trouble comprehending what I had just witnessed! It was a very short, extremely dramatic and even frightening!  I can only specualate whether this huge object was a meteor; something man-made; or even extra-terrestial.  I don&apos;t remember hearing or reading anything about this dramatic incident even days after it happened in any local or national news media.  The impact must have occurred in an isolated area or unpopulated region in or near the two mountains mentioned earlier above.  That may explain why it went un-reported.I don&apos;t know why the event was not publicized?  It is a true mystery to this day.  Surely, there were others besides myself that witnessed this dramatic event?   But I never heard anyone else ever speak of the event.  I subsequently did not try to discuss the event with anyone for fear of persecution as a &quot;nut job&quot;  Regardless of what the objct may have been, it was a huge impact that produced earth-shaking dramatic results!   An observatory or other agency may have observed the event that night remotely?  Alternatively, I have never heard or read of the event in any newspaper or any other publication.  It may be catalogued obscurely in someone&apos;s astronomical log somewhere?  Surely, I was not the only person to observe such a dramatic event that night?   I was the only student in the hallway at that time.  All other students were in cafeteria oblivious to what I witnessed. I can only speculate as to the origins of the object that impacted the Earth that night.  But having a near-photographic memory, I remember this extreme event with more questions than I have answers.  I can only tell you that what I witnessed that &quot;Valentines Day&quot; night in 1974 was something very extraordinary and possibly Extra-Terrestrial.  It imapacted the Earth in SouthWestern Virgina with a flash and a bang that also made an everlasting explosive impact in my memory!.", "Four red lights travelling east out of San Diego south of El Cajon.At 2035 7.4.09 I observed four red luminous single red lights moving in an easterly trajectory out of San Diego.  The four lights were well spaced apart, the second and third running an almost parallel course.  Although red,  they were luminous like Venus.  The moon was in the sky,  full and in the SE sky.  The four lights passed almost directly overhead,  never flickering.  The flightpath to nearby Gillespie Field received two incoming light planes in that time that the lights were observed.

It was a very warm evening, sky was clear and sun had just about gone down. The sky was still quite blue, and the moon was very bright.  I had just gone out to my car at the front of the house, and I stopped to admire the evening sky over the river thames. There is a small open park in between my house and the river, and a lot of open sky without any obstruction. I immediately noticed a very bright flame in the sky, right above the park and not more than a mile high from the ground.  It was definitely not something that I had ever seen before, and it was obvious to me that it was something out of the ordinary.  At first, I was just watching it, wondering what it could be, and trying to make sense of it.  The more I watched, the less I could explain it. I went quickly to the park and also to the other end of the street to see if anyone was around to witness it with me, but there was nobody.  I hadn&apos;t really taken my eyes off it all the time.  I then took a photo of it, as it was raising further and further upwards and to the left, with my phone camera. I then knocked on my neighbours door, and before she answered, I noticed the flame had gone out and there was a grey object left, floating up and away to the left. My neighbour came out, and she looked up and saw it.  She said to me that it looked like it could be a UFO.  I said I had taken a photo of it, and I would put it onto my computer and see what it looked like once I could zoom in. I put it onto the computer later that night, and after zooming in on the object, I have no doubt it was a UFO I saw.  The object has an obvious shape around the flame, as though the flame was in the centre of the craft, and the craft looks like it is metallic and has definite angles. The next day, my neighbours husband said he heard someone in a local shop saying that they had seen something in the sky and they thought it was a plane crash.

This sighting lasted approximately one minute and 45 seconds, the time it took from 90 degrees when we noticed it, until it passed over the horizon. It was a constant speed going from South to North on a path toward Coeur d&apos;Alene, Idaho.

Amazing, no sound, and through binoculars as it approached the horizon it appeared to be a black object with the bright orange light leading it. The orange light dissipated as it neared the northern horizon.We were so amazed that we didn&apos;t even think to try to get video footage or other images other than observing it through binoculars...We can be contacted for more information if necessary.

This second light was not present during the first sighting.", "Triangular shape emerging from cloud spotted in NY.I was traveling east from the area of Saddle River, NJ heading towards Park Ridge, NJ when I spotted a triangular shape emerging from a cloud bank. It was black in color and approximately 200 feet from end to end (based on the size of the cloud it was emerging from).  The shape was not moving and just appeared to be poking out from the cloud.  I continued without stopping and did notice it again on another rise in the road, but could not find it again after about 5 minutes.", "07/03/90 Lake Tahoe Ca Circle 1-3 minutes It shot into our view  about 50 ft away and then shot out of sight after a few minutesThe time we seen this UFO, there was three of us girls on a bed and talking. We were in an A-Frame house. The bedroom had long windows that looked out into a grove of trees. The forest was pretty thick. I looked up and seen this circle object come into the sight of the windows. From the distance of the house it was probably about 50 ft away. The size of the craft was about 20 ft wide and about 4 feet in length. The color of the craft was a shiny silver. But the lights going around the outside of it were very bright and lit up the area where it floated. It just hovered there for about 1-3 minutes. I don&apos;t really know how much time passed but it seemed to be there for quite awhile. I got the attention of the other girls in the room and we all just stared and awed at it. Just as soon as it came, it jetted out of sight with no sound made. Even while hoovering in the grove of trees there was no sound.We ran across the street to my moms house and told her about it but she didn&apos;t believe us. This is the first time I have mentioned it. I was watching a UFO show on tv and wondered if it was too late to report this.  I am 34 now and this happened when I was 16. I don&apos;t even know if this is worth reporting now, but hopefully one more sighting even if it was almost 20 years ago will help.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Strange unconventional movement  within the formation.Formation of 5 or 6  very dim lights (at first they tricked me into believing I was looking at the Pleiades),was first eye contacted about 45&deg; elevation comming almost perfectly from the East; maybe 75 to 80&deg;azimuth.  Passed directly over zenith (90&deg;)overhead heading straigh West.  Total span about twice the diameter of a full moon; about 1-1.5&deg;.  Triangular formation.  No Noise.  No visible bird wing flapping (usually synced from my experience).  Extremely linear movement without any signs of change of direction.  Very interesting and what to me gave this out as a UFO sighting is the fact that the most southern speck of luminosity in the triangular formation(almost seemed light emitted phosphorescently and not reflected from underplaced city lighting displaced itself from the pack in a most graceful, smooth and harmonic manner.  This displacement was maybe equal to the width of the pack.  Once the diplaced light assumed its origina position the contrary one (the northern speck of light)repeated the exact same movement.  It was lost in sight about 15 to 20&deg; after passing the zenith due to physical wall and roof limits in my house.  No noise before or after its passing....no doppler effect, no low frequency noise.This sighting came to me at the moment I was talking through my mobile phone.  We were agreeing on the agenda of the astonomy observing night to take place next wednesday.

I know my celestial objects.  I am also a recording engineer...I Know about sounds. These were definitely not birds to me.  I have a perfect 20:20 vision.  I saw no movement withing the pack. All &quot;stars&quot; were the same color though they seemed a bit greenish reminding me of phosphorescent specks in wristwatches.  I figured that if a bird leaves a &quot;V&quot; formation while traveling at the same speed it would have ended behind the pack when it regained its position.  Its was also very suspicious to see the same thing happen on the opposite 180&deg; place of the &quot;V&quot; formation. I can assure:  It was not a meteor breaking up.  It was not an airplane.  They were not flying birds.", "strange flying craft in paralell formation that was followed by red craft at rapid speed.Object flying in formation from East to West across the sky.

The three of us were by ourselves and our parents and other siblings were inside doing who knows what.   ((name deleted)) was irritating me by jumping right next to me and I started to wrestle with him meanwhile my sister is laughing at us sitting on the other side of the trampoline.  It was a pretty clear night with just a few clouds in the sky with a gentle breeze which I remember clearly because it&rsquo;s so humid in Florida and it was one of the few evenings as a child that I was unsupervised and outside to enjoy the sea breeze.  The next few moments are hard to describe put I will do my best. Their was a bright flash of light so bright that I was blinded momentarily to tell the truth I&rsquo;m not sure how long it seemed like a long time but I&rsquo;m sure it was only seconds. It was almost like a strobe light you know how everything seems like it&rsquo;s in slow mo.  After the flash, it looked as if a bright ball of light fell in the woods maybe 30 or 40 feet away from the trampoline.                                                                    My sister, ((name deleted)), and I were stunned.  We scrambled off the trampoline and raced to the backdoor. Enroute I saw 4 different colored lights blink in the woods. (Yellow, blue, green and red) After that I heard a strange noise that&rsquo;s even harder to describe it was like a metallic computer sound with one beep after the other with each beep a different pitch. By this all happened in seconds I think. By the time we had heard and seen the different colored lights and the beeping noises we were at the back door pounding on it for someone to let us in. Meanwhile there was a rustling in the woods which could have been a dog or other animal but I&rsquo;m just not sure given the other things that had just occurred. Matty&rsquo;s older brother came and opened the door maybe a minute or two after we had started pounding on it and we all rushed into the! kitchen The three of us were hysterical and proceeded to report the events that had just happened to matt&rsquo;s brother and then told our parents who of course could not say what had happened and made it seem we were making it all up which to this day bothers me that my own parents think it was a prank or that we were flat out lying.

I thought for sure they were like satellites but they are moving around too fast and they do kind of look like they are dancing around if that makes any sense?? I know it sounds ridiculous but thought maybe someone might know whether or not we are just being crazy thinking that a couple satellites dancing around the sky are something more than that.  Just kind of the coolest thing we have ever seen but sort of freaking us out at the same time.  Just wondering if there was some kind of super camera that could scope in and see if they are satellites or something else??

I went out into the yard to look around to see if I could spot any stars at that time. I didn&apos;t see a single one.I went into the house, brought out my 7&quot; (dia) telescope and tried out various lenses. By this time the cone had gradually lowered in elevation, had maintained its brilliance, and moved slightly further south from where I&apos;d seen it (total elapsed time about 5 minutes).It stayed in our range for about 45 minutes or so. Toward the end of its visibility, it quickly diminished in light intensity, to the point where it appeared to be a faint star. We then lost sight of it behind a tree, and I had a hard time tracking it due to its dimming.The light itself appeared cone shaped. The upper left corner appeared a bit rounded, the upper right corner was more squared. The light color itself I&apos;d have to describe as what you&apos;d see when looking at a fluorescent bulb; nearly a pure white. When looking through my Galileo telescope, directly below the bottom of the cone I saw a very small point of light. Unfortunately, because I had to rely on telescopes to spot the object, I was unable to get a photo of it.There was plenty of air traffic around, but I saw/heard zero fast-movers, and having seen flares fired from both helos and fighters, I can absolutely confirm this was no flare.My younger brother flies AH-64D&apos;s in Mirana. When returning to base tonight he heard several aircraft communicating with Williams Gateway tower explaining what they&apos;d seen, and the word &quot;balloon&quot; was mentioned.

The friend who owned the home, noticed a strange object low in the air, across the mountain on the other side. I saw what looked like a balloon above 6 or 7 spherical shaped objects hovering above the ground, and moving northward.  The spheres seemed to move individually, yet seemed like they were all connected, as if a cable was attached to them.  The spheres seemed opaqueWe observed it as it continued to move northward, as if it was probing the area.  It would move upward and downward some, but wouldn&rsquo;t go very high in the air.  Numerous times, it would move through treed areas.  I thought it would crash,  But it just kept moving through the trees, as if the trees were non-existent.  I took a picture with my camera phone.

I almost looked away as I said this is nothing unusual, but it caught my attention suddenly that one of the lights was darting, then it would angle and dart again.

When I noticed the one light darting that way I wasn&apos;t paying attention to the other, it may have moved I don&apos;t know.

My grandmother was also in the kitchen, standing at the sink washing dishes, and her daughter (my aunt) was just off the side using the phone and looking out the sliding glass back door.Suddenly my aunt let out a terrifying scream and was pointing upward at something just outside that door.  My grandmother leaned over and was looking out the window in front of her and terror struck her face as she ran to that door.  They were both just standing there, with their mouths and eyes wide open.Frantically I was asking, &quot;What&rsquo;s wrong?  What&rsquo;s going on?,&quot; but I couldn&rsquo;t see &quot;up&quot; from behind them.   I knew something was terrible from the frightened looks of their faces.  Finally my aunt mumbled, &quot;It&rsquo;s a UFO,&quot; and I wanted to see too, but I was too scared to look then.  They began talking about the bright white lights surrounding this &quot;UFO,&quot; and how close it was.  And just as quickly as it came, it was gone.   By the time I got to the door there was nothing to be seen.Many questions later revealed that they believed it was a UFO because of its circular shape and the lights all around the exterior.  It was unlike anything that was normally flying in the sky.  They said it came real close to the earth; that it was just above the roof of the house and hovered in that one spot for maybe 10 seconds and then shot off like a bullet into the unknown.While reminiscing years later, I brought up that night during a family gathering.  My grandmother and aunt both had no recollection of the event whatsoever.  It hadn&rsquo;t been that long ago and they both had excellent memory.   I had thought maybe they were joking with me, but they really didn&rsquo;t know what I was talking about and declared innocence when I asked them if they were just playing a joke on me when I was a kid.I still ask them occasionally if they remember and always get an unsuccessful response.My memory of that night is quite vivid; I could never forget the sound of her screaming, and the looks of shock in their eyes.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

These objects could easily have been mistaken for stars.. they were that far away but you could make out they were changing colors red, white and blue.

I was parked, and by comparing it to other stationary objects, houses, poles, etc, it didn&rsquo;t drift or anything.  The white light was very bright, creating a sort of aura of light around it that was maybe double or triple the circumference of the central object.  In the center, it was looked like just a solid sphere of light. After perhaps 15 minutes of watching the object, it suddenly began to look like it was moving away from my point of view.  It appeared to be moving slightly, and the white aura of light faded rapidly.  It became a bright orange color, like the color of Mars, and it&rsquo;s size continued to diminish quickly.

It was a bright amber light.  The coloring resembled a bright light inside of a brown paper bag.  The light seemed to be too far off of the ground to be a spot light or new cell tower.  I grabbed a pair of 8X binoculars and went to the corner of my yard to take a better look.  I could see a larger version of the amber light through the binoculars with hardly any detail but the light did not appear to be just glare.  There seemed to be some type of object.  As I watched, it was almost like the small halo that changed positions around the bottom of the object the way a spot light would.  However there was no definitive beam of light.As I continued to watch and tried to figure out of it was some type of balloon or helicopter, the object VERY slowly continued to rise and rise.  I thought that the object may be some type of helicopter however I heard absolutely no noise.Next I saw random parts of the field light up but I could not find the source of the light.  This happened 3 times.  I glanced from side to side as I saw the green grass light up.Next The object began to move north and that is when I saw multiple blinking red lights under the object.  The amber glow was dissipating at that point.  There seemed to be 6 or so red lights in a triangle formation like bowling pins on the bottom of a single object.  I tried to record the object with my cell phone but it wouldn&apos;t pick up the light, all it recorded was black.As the object moved to north it picked up pace very fast.  The object moved rapidly over a nearby farm from my vantage point with all the red lights visible.  At this point there seemed to be a clear light on the front part of the object.There was only approximately 1-2 minutes from when the object began moving north until it was out of my sight.  As it moved on its course I could see another blinking lighted object that appeared to be further away than the initial object.  The primary object moved directly past the 2nd object from my point of view.  The second object appeared as a single blinking light of red, blue, and white.  I could see the second object long after the first object was out of sight.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

This set of lights and craft passed Directly overhead at an altitute significantly higher then cermmercial aircraft in the area. One of the unusual  issues here was the complete lack of sound, there were no contrails, and no burn trail like a shooting star. The craft continued heading east at a extreme speed, as it pulled away the light grew in intensity, simular to a jet going into afterburner except the light was pure white. There were no navigation beacons that could be seen, nor any navigation lights, or anti-collision beacons.

Cant be sure if no sound because fireworks in neighborhood.My friend and I (both in the accounting profession) were sitting at fire pit enjoying evening.  What was surprising was that it was so low it caught our attention right away.  We both watched as it just steadily went along.  No abrupt movements. It actually could have been taken as a normal flying object, nothing spectacular but for the shape, color and no outlines seen at all.Another plane was actually coming in (to O&rsquo;Hare) just to the south of the orb and at maybe the same height.  That pilot had to have seen it!  And, all night we could plainly and clearly see all other planes (their shapes, outlines, lights etc) without question.So, we are quite perplexed at what this was.

We decided to camp out that night, and head out in the morning.  All five of us were on the bridge that goes across the Cheat River, we noticed a slowly moving golden nickel from far away.  It seemed as if it was ice skating in the sky at a high speed, but it was so far from us that it was hard to really tell the speed.  It last for a few minutes and then it disappeared in the distance.  We all were baffled at what we just witnessed and couldnt believe our eyes at the time.

I had been traveling every weekend to the North country throughout the winter, always in the early hours of Saturday morning as I had a second shift engineering job and I would not leave my Massachusetts workplace until 12:30 am.  So, the times of my being northbound on US Route 93 was 2:00 am onward.On the early March Saturday morning in question,  there had been a terrible rain and snow storm.  This storm was typical of the type of late winter storm that occurs in New England.  Because of the weather conditions and the time of night, there were no vehicles traveling, or if they were, vehicles were few and far between.  As I proceeded North conditions remained treacherous.  I had just passed  the city of Concord NH on US Route 93 when the stormy weather suddenly stopped and driving conditions were back to normal.  No slush on the highway, no freezing rain or snow falling.  It was just me and the highway with a smattering of vehicles moving normally in both north and south directions.Suddenly, ahead of me, I saw a strange glow moving south heading towards and directly ahead of me.  This glow was below the very low cloud cover.  I remember I was watching the sky anyways as the storm had just stopped and the driving conditions had returned to normal. This glow was moving very quickly, like a blink of an eye.  Then, the low flying glow became this neon green light.  My view to the sky was keen as the car I owned then had a very large windshield that came up to almost my driving position and provided me with a panoramic view of the sky.  As the green glow quickly came to me, I suddenly saw a large number of what I would describe as objects in the shape of white corpuscles, only neon green.  There were, as best that I can remember, about a dozen of these objects all flying in formation, one after the other passing directly overhead of me.  The last three were abit a skewed to one side but still in formation, one after the other.  I saw these objects fly in total silence over my car moving just under the low cloud cover.My first reaction was to quickly stop my car.  I turned around and saw these objects continue on their southerly direction following the ribbon of highway and disappear into the low cloud cover.  The clouds reflected the green glow. Then they were gone as quickly as they had appeared. I remember thanking God for allowing me to see something that I could truly not explain. I also saw just a very small handful of cars stopped on the north and southbound side of the highway as I was.  I regret not jumping out to talk to these drivers about what we had just seen.I remember this experience as though it had happened yesterday, the vision still fresh in my mind.  I don&rsquo;t tell people about it as they would not be able to comprehend it.  I have a BSc degree from Dalhousie University on Halifax N.S.  My career has been in Engineering and up until last year I was a Unix Analyst for ten years with a major American investment company.

It was very strange as it seemed to be stationary.  I first thought it was a normal airplane beacon light but the light was too large, I would estimate at least a diameter of 200 ft.I told my friend to watch the sky and she witnessed the light too.  After a few minutes the light stopped blinking.  We heard no air traffic or other common flying noise.I watched the sky for another 10 minutes and then witnessed a commercial passenger (??) air plane fly over the area where we saw the light.  The plane flew over without issue but gave an account as just how big the light was as the plane seemed dwarfed by the size of the light we saw.  The light did not flash over the sky nor did we see any other attributes from a normal beacon light.We were approximately 8 miles from the firework show and alone at the base of a mountain.  It was very strange.", "UFO Followes us to Police Dept then disappeared then reappeared as we headed home. I stood under it for about 30 to 40 minutes.This was back in the late summer, early fall of 1978 in Bartlett, Ill. My mom, my sister and I were on our way home from Bingo in (Streamwood, Il), which was a Friday evening. We had just gotten to Rt 20 and a block from turning onto North Ave when my sister who was sitting in the front seat noticed some lights in the sky blinking. She pointed this out to both me and our mother. What I seen was BIG and saucer shape. When I say big, I mean bigger than a commercial Air plane. This UFO was about 100 ft just about above us. My mom , who was driving, became scared and did a U-turn on Rt 20 and drove down the road about 2 miles. The UFO continued to be just about above us. She then turned around again and she at this point decided to go report it to the police dept. She was scared and I guess she felt that she would be ok if we just went to the police dept since it was following us. It followed us all the way to the police dept (I know it sounds strange a UFO following you, but it is true). When we got to the police dept, it disappeared, just gone in a split second! We talked to a police officer and told him about what we seen. He told us that &ldquo;100&rsquo;s of people have reported seeing this&rdquo;. He just acted nonchalant like no big deal. The UFO that hovered above us did not make any sound what so ever. It was quiet, no vibration, the only way you knew it was there was the lights that went around the craft in a circular motion.  The officer reassured my mom that it was ok and when we went to leave we looked to see if it was there and it was not. The police station was about 10 blocks to our apartment on Wayne Ct, in Bartlett. We were heading down the road and as we got to the corner of N. Marion Ave, Wayne Ct and E. Taylor it suddenly appeared out of nowhere.  We continued on to our apartment on Wayne Ct. My mom pulled in the drive way and my sister jumped out of the car scared and ran into the apartment and told my boyfriend ( Derrick Fender, of Elgin, Il) and my other sister and her boyfriend (Mike ! Kessel l of Hanover Park, Il) that there was a UFO at the end of the street. They all ran out of the apartment and went to where My mom stood by the car. I walked down to the end of the street where the UFO was hovering.  Again no noise at ALL none. No wind, no noise just the lights making a circular pattern around the ship.  My sister, who had been in the car with me and my mom, came back outside and yelled at me &ldquo;Get back here they are going to take you&rdquo;. I was several months pregnant with my first child. I did not feel fear at all. I was more curious that fearful.  I stood under the ship, which I looked up to and it was about 100 ft above me and was much, much bigger than an airplane. As I stood there looking up I could not see what it looked like at all. It was as if it was transparent and I could see the stars through it. However I could also see the lights (green, yellow, red, and orange) going around the perimeter of the ship that outlined it circular shape.  I stood there looking, for awhile about 30 to 45 minutes, so I was told by my family. However, to me it was as if I was only there for a couple of minutes, it was as if time stood still. I know that the neighbors seen this also as some of them where outside watching.  Suddenly it just disappeared in thin air, did not fly off, just disappeared in a split second.  I stood there for a few moments and then walked back to where my family was.

He said it was like no plane he had ever seen as it was much bigger than anything of that time.Immediately, my grandfather and his friends ran back to a barn and stayed in there until they were sure the saucer had gone.For many years he thought it must have been a new German bomber, as he had never seen a German plane in the war at all as he was in such a remote location. It was not until he moved to Canada in the early 1950s and UFO hysteria gripped North America that he believed what he had seen was a spaceship.I am entirely confident that my Grandfather saw what he claimed to have seen as he was a very honest man and was a policeman for 18 years.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I wanted to take video of it to compare to my last sighting of a triangular object so I began to film it with my SONY HI8 Handi Cam model CCD-TRV65.This object had the identical light pattern as before. 3 dim white lights, one on each &apos;tip&apos; and a pulsing white light and a pulsing red light. There is one significant difference between this sighting and the others. This time I heard what sounded like jet engines.This object flew at the same slow pace across the sky from West to East as the last one.I have about 3 minutes of video of this sighting and the weird thing is that once it moved closer to the Eastern Horizon it seemed to &apos;hover&apos; because there was a point where the lights should have been disappearing but they didn&apos;t.I dont know how to transfer HI8 video to a PC but I will upload the video ASAP.", "item hovers over airport for dayshttp://www.ustream.tv/channel/Centennial-Airport  I saw this while looking at U-Stream.

At that time, when I lived in California, I was hiking between 25 and 35 miles each week, both after work and in the evenings. I was returning home from my walk, and was within one mile from my house, and cut across a supermarket parking lot. The supermarket had closed for the evening, the lights were being turned out, and there were only a few cars left in the lot. As I crossed the lot, I looked up at approximately a 30 degree angle, and noticed a tight grouping of 5 or 6 white lights with a &quot;floodlight&quot; shining down. There was a mist or haze surrounding the grouping of lights, which were in a non-descript pattern on this object.My first observation of this object would indicate that it was a helicopter with a searchlight shining down. I quickly realized, however, that the object was at a close proximity; approximately one third to one half a mile away, and there was no sound audible from the object. The object was completely motionless. I realized that a helicopter hovering at that close proximity would be distinctly audible.As I watched the object, a person was walking to their car across the parking lot.

I was amazed by its speed because any material subjected to that speed should have been burnt due to air friction.Once my view was blocked by the truck&apos;s roof, I got up and slid the sunroof open in order to get a view.  I was surprised that the light source suddenly moved back from where it was going without even slowing down.It continued flashing, and half the distance from where I first saw it and the point where it moved back, it made another sudden turn making about 30 degree angle.I and my son have got a good view of the flashing light from the truck&rsquo;s sunroof and I told him that we just saw a UFO.", "Light following space stationMy wife and I were watching the space station going across the sky when a smaller light appearing to be in the same orbit appeared approximately 10 seconds behind the space station.

So common sense and logics are the things I use for the most things of my life. I dont do drugs or any other thing that could cause hallucinations.It is very hot this time a year in Belgium. So like I do more, I open the windows ( 1 roof window, 3 normal windows ) the let cool air come in.This event happened at 4.30 ( was still kinda dark ). So that is from now 90 min ago.I was sleeping and I was dreaming. Nothing special... suddenly I hear a kind of hovering, god how can I describe it ehm Its like: mix the sound of bubbling water with a sort of hovering sound into it. I cant say it more clearly :s ( eng isnt my native language )  The thing is I woke up from this sound, it was not in my dream. I opened my eyes and before I realized that I was awake and looking I saw something near my bed ( floating , hovering but without reshaping the surroundings through air, like you see with a vehicle moved by air ).I get a bit scared while I am typing this ( bring back the memory rather lively ) but I need to tell, type it to let it out of my system.It was a bit bigger then a tennisball and it was making that hovering / floating / bubbling water sound just about a meter from my face. I coudnt see it very detailed. It gave a strong light green light on the surroundings. In a split second when the &quot; item &quot; noticed I was awake it moved in a ( like you see in spiral movements of comets etc ) such way past my door ( that was open ) to the right through the open roof window. ( what was open also ).I coudnt believe what I saw and was sure I was still asleep. But how longer I waited and tryed to explain this in reasoning how more aware I was of the fact I was awake ( I pinched myself in the arm, I felt pain, as far as I know you cant imitate that in a dream ) The next 20 min I was more or less paralyzed with fear and trying to explain what I just saw.Only &quot; logical &quot; thing I can analyze out of this experience is that I was dreaming when that &quot; item &quot; was near me. I will not make further conclusions cause those would only be based on stuff you see on tv smile.gif Like aliens of outer space only explore human life and how they their way of life is by scanning and analyzing the memories of peeps who are in REM state of sleep.

While sitting at the lake edge, watching planes and satellites pass overhead, I had seen one shooting star earlier.  I was facing approximately SE and my brother was NE toward me.  A bright white light, coming from the north, first caught my attention out of my peripheral vision as it passed by, approximately straight out over the lake, or at about 12 o&apos;clock.  It was at maybe 40 degrees above the horizon, or two to three times the height of the hills across the lake.  Initially I thought it was a meteor, as I saw two successive flashes, as sometimes meteors will do if they break up of &ldquo;pop&rdquo;.But then, as the light proceeded south at roughly the speed of a fast moving shooting star, it continued to pulse in a very constant and rhythmic manner: pulse-pulse...pause...pulse-pulse...pause...pulse-pulse, etc.  I called it to my brothers attention and finally got him to turn around and look to the south just in time to see it (thank you!).Total time of incident was about 10 seconds, and maybe 6-8 two-pulse sets.  The object went from about a 12 o&apos;clock position to just above the southern horizon in that time.  There was no sound heard during or after.  Object appeared to be moving in a straight line; however, just before disappearing it seemed to wander some, erratically and laterally.  Upon thinking about this a bit, it seems likely that this apparent lateral movement was most likely a visual effect of now looking at the fast receding object straight from behind, and that its path was not perfectly straight.  The lateral movement was only a degree or two at most.I have been a practicing geologist of 30 years and my brother is a university professional.  In all my years of star gazing, I have never seen anything of this nature.  In my mind this was clearly not any type of natural phenomenon.  Impossible to be a satellite by nature of its extreme speed.  It left no visible ionized trail as a meteor does and the rhythmic pulsing was dead constant like a strobe.  Would it be possible for a meteor to skip across the outer atmosphere, like a skipping stone on a pond and cause the observed effect?  I think that the rhythmic pattern of flashes eliminates this possibility and it went too far and for too long.  I have no ready and reasonable explanation what we saw.", "Witnessed 6-7 blinking crafts for the second day in a row.UFO Sighting in Tucson, AZ #2:  I was standing in my backyard with my mother, watering the plants like the case in my last report, when we saw a strange balloon-like object flying 5-6 miles away. It was large, and colorful, and seemed normal, except that it was in the area where airplanes fly. There was a helicopter that was moving in its general direction, and the balloon began to change altitude, moving lower towards the Foothills. I decided it was simply a normal set of stray balloons, but my mother was a little more suspicious, and decided to keep monitoring it. I went to keep watering the plants, when I returned my mother said that the balloon type thing had disappeared into thin air. I found this very strange and failed to locate it myself.3-4 minutes later, I spotted similar, if not the same, craft(s) as the day before. They were 30-40 miles away above the Catalina Mountains. They had a blinking that was visible even from that height. They stayed fairly immobile compared to the day before. There were more than last time, and they actually made several shapes. Several times, they formed a rhombus, an arrow pointing right, and various other formations that I could not understand. They seemed to be at a very high altitude, being at maybe 10,000-20,000 feet. After 4-5 minutes, 2 or 3 of the crafts descended and were maybe 4000-5000 feet directly above my area. They moved at a speed that was beyond anything I&rsquo;ve ever seen before.I have seen similar UFO&rsquo;s two days in a row. I believe this is not a coincidence. They might be monitoring humans, or giving a personal message, or they could be military devices that haven&rsquo;t been exposed to the public.

I have been seeing white star-like orb UFO&apos;s. These orbs can dim or get very bright. They are low in the atmosphere and appear at various times of the night and in many different positions in the sky. They speed up and slow down and make sharp maneuvers at times.  I usually see one at a time so I do not know if there is more than one or if the same one is appearing over and over in the sky cruising along.  I have been wanting to get one on film getting brighter but have not had that opportunity until on this night. At approx 10:45pm EST after I had just filmed the orb passing by some stars I sat back down and continued to skywatch. I was scanning the sky with my eyes and looked above me to catch a glimpse of a very bright, low, star-like object maybe a few hundred feet passing over where I was sitting.  It was very low and very bright. It was moving West to East.  I jumped out of my chair and began to film it. I was so astonished at the complete silence of this slow moving object!  I could not see if it was a structured craft or what it was at all.  All I could see was the bright light.  You can see how low and bright this object was when it passes the stars as it is moving across the sky. I am an avid skywatcher and have been involved with this UFO phenomenon my whole life. I have filmed airplanes, helicopters and satellites and other various explainable aircraft.  This was NONE of those things!  The complete silence and appearance of this UFO light was amazing and I am so very grateful I was able to document it!

Right after the sun had set we noticed a bright light in the sky over Wickenburg. It may have been there as we watched the sun go down but we didn&apos;t notice it.At first we thought it might be a balloon and the sun was reflecting off it, but it didn&apos;t move and it was way to high in the sky. There was some clouds in the sky but it was clear in the immediate area of the object. The objects light looked something like a blue flourescent light would give off only much brighter.I called 911 and asked if there were any reports of anything unusual in the skies over Wickenburg. She said no, but someone had reported something like a ballon over Cave Creek (north Phoenix). At the same time, my wife called a friend of ours in Morristown (halfway to Wickenburg) and had her step outside to observe it. She said there had been reports of lights in the sky, in the same area and at about the same time for the last few days.We continued to watch it and as we got to Wickenburg, we saw people on the sidewalks and parked cars with people outside watching it too.About 45 minutes had passed by now and I went to my back yard and continued to watch it. My neighbor was outside too, and I drew her attention to it. We continued to watch for another 15 or 20 minutes. I took a picture with my phone and the sky took but the object didn&apos;t. As we were observing it a jet flew by in the general area  of the object, about 30,000 feet or so, (the passengers must have hadf a real good view of it) and it looked to be 6 or 7 times bigger than the jet.I observed something like a red or orange glow and within a minute, it moved straight away from us and looked mlike a star ant then was gone.

Briefly it appeared to become brighter and then suddenly it shut off as if someone had turned off a light switch.  It never re-appeared after this.  According to the onboard navigation screen in the cabin, I estimate we were approx. 25 to 35 miles off the coast of Nova Scotia and approx. 50 to 75 miles North/Northeast of Halifax. We were at approx. 33,000 feet.  I estimate the object was at about 38 to 40,000 feet and approximately 5 to 10 miles off to our right (toward the east). The time was exactly 20:32 EST on my watch and it would have been 21:32 AST. The event happened so quickly that I do not know if anyone else on the airplane saw it. Most of the passengers were either sleeping or watching the TV screens in the cabin. In Brussels, I saw the pilots in the airport and asked if they&apos;d seen it.

It was moving around like a feather up and down, left to right, where ever it wanted to fly it was flying. Then the light faded completly out and we saw a flash across the sky and it started swaying on the other side of the sky. It faded out again and then reappeared in the spot where we first saw it.  Then it was just staying still blending in like a star. Then the tree line that we were looking over at the object, had a green glow that it was giving off. The glow stopped shortly after it started and then the light object was just moving slightly but staying in the same area for another 45 mins. After about 45 min the clear sky that we were looking at instantly became cloudy and the light faded and we didnt see the object again. It was a very strange object and not like anything ive ever seen before it was a bright white light that faded and looked like a ring light at times. It is something i will never forget.

It looked like a normal launch like the many I&rsquo;ve watched before except on this occasion I noticed a irregular object in the same vicinity of the shuttle just as the shuttle went out of view.  To the naked eye it looked cigarette shaped and was moving rapidly to from West to East.  As I focused on the object it appeared to be cylinder shaped and was moving horizontally.  I did notice what appeared to be fins towards the aft of the object but it was not identifiable to any aircraft I have seen before.  I short it looked like a missile (no wings mid ship) flying horizontally at a very fast rate of speed.  I&apos;ve watched airliners before thru a telescope and compare the rate of speed to be far faster than a commercial aircraft.  There was no vapor trail or any sign of exhaust.

I began to take pictures when someone said &ldquo;Look, what IS that?&rdquo; I watched and saw what I would describe as a fascinating ball of glowing orange/red color moving silently across the sky.

We could see it clearly through the left-back-seat-window, as it wasn&apos;t very high.  It was moving around quite fast, though smooth and steady enough for us to see that it was circular in shape, and had numerous blue lights on the bottom.  Furthermore it seemed to be of greyish/silverish color.  It was headed for the opposite direction, so we couldn&apos;t see it for long and make a video or even attempt to follow it.It is quite unbelievable to us that we may have seen a real UFO.  We have considered many &quot;normal&quot; explanations including: fancy spot lights, though if that were the case, we should have seen a beam of light under it, which we didn&apos;t; Likewise even a UFO remote control toy:  I have seen a remote control UFO toy, though I am sure it couldn&apos;t move around as fast, or over such a long distance in such straight strokes, besides be able to fly over buildings!  Plus it wouldn&apos;t be able to support the extra weight of the blue lights. We tried looking around on the net if anyone else had seen it, because there were many people in cars around, and some even on foot.

See full description.I was walking home from a movie one evening. I had just passed the Rubber Bowl on George Washington Blvd, in south east Akron, when the sky behind me lit-up. I thought someone had turned on the lights in the stadium, so I turned around to look.Out of the night sky(from the north) came a bright object. It was in a shallow dive. At that moment it seemed to have slightly elongated &quot;wing tips&quot; and a very bright - whitish glow. It was silent, but I could definitely feel its presents in the sky above me. It slowed as it passed almost directly over head.(Perhaps 2,000 feet above me.) Then it picked up speed and climbed away at about a 45 degree - upward angle, going south. It was gone in less than half a minute and the sky became black again.Estimated entry speed was + 600 mph. Over head speed was about 100 mph. And estimated exit speed accelerated from 100 mph to well over 1,000 mph before it was out of sight. Overall estimated distance that the object appeared visible was: Approach equals 3 miles. Over head about 1 mile. Departure probably 20 miles, before going totally out of sight.I have seen meteors, artillery shells, tracer bullets, and all kinds of aircraft flying at night: And there has been nothing that I&apos;ve ever seen that behaved like this object. Once over head, I could see that it was slightly curved all across the leading edge (from tip - to tip), and had two smaller curves meeting in the center, at the trailing edge. It had no distinguishable fuselage in the center. A guess at the size would be 100 feet tip to tip and 30 feet leading edge to trailing edge. It could have been 8 feet thick in the center area, but I only got a glimpse at that, as it was coming toward me and going away.There was a lot of very bright light nearest the object. The light was longer and brighter span-wise. It was smooth, with no exterior features, lights or markings. I was not close enough to determine if it was made out of metal, ceramic or other substance, but its surface did have a bright white glow about it.That&apos;s all I can tell you.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Then we noticed there was a second identical object following behind the first one on the same course at the same altitude.  They passed over our heads and when they were just south of us the leading one accelerated and dissapeared behind the trees.  Simultaneously, the second one seemed to go straight up.

Then the object turned where the wing was towards us and the nose of the object facing south. But the object was still hovering.  We also noticed there were 2 jets overhead that were leaving a vapor trail. A second object appeared from behind the trees and was much closer and same shape.  Second object only visible for 45 sec before it disappeared very quickly. There was no sound from either object.   They were both shaped like a bird but there was no wing movement.  We continued to watch the object for 10 minutes with no movement of the object. But what it did next was very strange.  Suddenly, the object &quot;took off&quot; shooting toward the northeast in a straight line.  No noise, no movement of the wings no swooping gliding movement like a bird.  It was too large to be a bird. It Looked much larger than a private plane.We then could observe this object hovering between two trees to the north We watched it for another 4-5 minutes before it shot off to the northwest.

As there are many beaches up North and it was not a holiday season, we were the only ones on the beach that day.  We laid out our towels to sunbath for awhile and when I laid down, I looked up to the sky to the left and I saw what I thought was a plane with the sun reflecting off it and paid no attention.  Approximately 10mins later I looked up again and it was still there and being a little bit surprised, I told my then partner and we both watched it and it did not move!  I started to get nervous and said to him that I was scared and that we should go, but my partner said not to be silly and that it was too far away and it couldn&rsquo;t harm us.  I then said well it can&rsquo;t be of this world and perhaps they were watching us and I wanted to leave, but he said for us just to watch it and see what happens, so we did even though I was scared.We watch this ship that I originally thought was a plane for approx. one hour and then it just shot off to the right and into the distance at incredible speed and disappeared.I say that it was cigar shape, only because it was a fair distance away and at first I thought it was a plane, all I can say for sure is that it was long and silver and stayed in the one spot for a least an hour that we were there, so it could have been there for some time before we arrived and when it disappeared, it shot off at incredible speed.I thought after all these years that I should tell someone, because at the time we didn&rsquo;t know who to report it to and thought that we would be ridiculed.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I have never seen anything like this in my life, and for a person who lives most his life by logic, this just gets to me. First off, this is all in Nags Head, NC, right on the Outer Banks of NC. So as me and my fellow employees go to stop the last go kart race and get the place closed down, we start seeing the lights come up just a couple miles from us(looked like it was coming from the ocean!, but maybe on the beach). It was kind of cloudy out, so all you could see is the lights. It wasnt a steady light, it was more like a flame going straight up, kind of fluttering. So the first that came were 4 of them, they stayed together in a 7 formation, staying so amazingly steady, it looked to form an outline of an insanely huge ship. The first thing that came to mind were those big imperial cruiser or whatever those huge ships that vaders guys rode in in the earliest star wars. Suddenly one of the ships darted off, and it became a straight line, then those broke up. If that wasn&apos;t weird enough, they kept coming. There must have been at least 20 of these. The rest did not fly in the same path like the first, more random. Then it gets to the last 2, this is the part that really made me confused. The last 2 were took off with what it looked like just mere feet between them! It was an amazing site, they were right next too each other, then one would get futher forward, then the other would dart out infront, and then the other would get ahead again. This definitely does not seem like a military formation...nor civilian or commercial. Also, for as close as they were, there were no sounds at all coming from that direction, but they looked to be going as fast as jets almost! It was really an amazing site, everyone working and the 15 people who just got off the track, just stood there for 15 minutes watching it. Overall though, I would say the lights lasted for a good 20-30 minutes total, but each one would go from launch to disappear in about 30 seconds to a minut! e, from launching around the ocean to disappearing right above us. Oh! Almost forgot to point out that the guy who owns the place, said the same thing happened last night! I will bring my camera tomorrow night in hope it happens again.

There where alto-stratus clouds that the objects where moving above and below.  The keep going in a circle over and over slowly going east.  I would loose them and pick up the objects 30 degrees away.I probably would not have looked up if not for the sound of two military jets.  They where circling around the area to the north east.  This is not seen around here too often as there are no major airports for 60 miles or so.  They looked like F-15s, but I don&apos;t think they fly those any more.  They were definitely military jets one seen very clearly, and the other jet was heard.  There are not any bases close by.  While I was looking up to see the jets something else caught my eye.  There where maybe a dozen or so objects to the east - south east possibly over Juneau, WI area.  The best way to describe them is to liken them to a school of fish.  They where going in a large circle moving fast and in sync like a school of fish.  I lost them once and went to get my wife to see them.  While looking up to see them again, I reacquired the strange lights due east from my position. The lights seemed to be very bright -9 magnitude and then change to very dark all while going in a complete circle. The circle seamed to be horizontal (side to side) and not vertical (up and down).

The second sighting did not last very long and my wife was not able to see the objects. It seamed that the objects disappeared and less than a minute or two later a jet was again heard at a very fast rate, and you can clearly tell the difference between military and civilian jets.  The cloud layer was very thin higher altitude clouds.  I would guess the clouds at the time to be 6000 to 10000 ft.  At least one military jet was heard again, but not see after the last ufo sighting.  Sounded very fast, but not super sonic.  Possibly super sonic at high altitude when jet was last spotted heading straight east toward lake Michigan.

So I set out around 8 at night and it wasn&rsquo;t dark yet.  I drove south on route 481 from fulton toward clay.  It was a beautiful clear night with only a few very well defined clouds in the air.As I get near the Phoenix exit there&rsquo;s a bridge over the highway and I notice two bright headlights on the bridge but not moving. I look up and I see that it&rsquo;s not a car and the lights are above the bridge in the air, way far off a few miles. But they are bigger and more intense than the headlights on cars coming in the opposite lane. And the lights aren&rsquo;t moving so I thought it was some sort of tower I wasn&rsquo;t close enough to see yet. The lights were white but tinged with that warm yellow light, not like the bluish headlights some cars have now. So I keep driving. I do not even think ufo-stuff because I just didn&rsquo;t think about that kind of stuff (back then!!!). My eyes go back to it a few times and in the back of my mind I feel a nagging feeling because I grew up here and have lived here forever and I didn&rsquo;t remember a tower there before or seeing lights like that. It&rsquo;s still not dark out but it&rsquo;s close to that time where it starts to get dark fast. As I get closer the lights don&rsquo;t move at all. They&rsquo;re very low in the sky so the trees along the highway block it momentarily here and there.After a couple minutes of driving I start being more distracted by it, because I&rsquo;m not seeing any tower, and there&rsquo;s absolutely no movement. I started to think it was a plane flying low, and that it was flying directly in my direction so it looked motionless, which I thought was cool. But as the highway slowly wound and turned, they were staying in the same spot.I finally have driven a few miles and felt as though I was getting close enough to see the tower or plane or whatever it was. I was a little bothered because I realized I was getting extremely close to it, and I could see a cell phone tower or something on the other side of it, and it was a lot smaller. At this point it was dark, but not full night. I wasn&rsquo;t noticing any other air traffic at the time, but maybe I just wasn&rsquo;t looking for it in all honesty.I finally came to a break in the woods (it&rsquo;s farmy-kind of land) and looked behind me because there was light traffic in the oncoming lane, but none behind me, so I could slow down to about 40 from 65. At that point I passed the clearing on the left and saw that it was a plane that was so low and huge it looked like it was coming in for a landing, but it was hanging completely motionless in the sky, and the lights were very, very bright. As I passed, IT STARTED MOVING AND CAME OVER THE HIGHWAY AND DIRECTLY OVER MY CAR. I checked behind me and slowed to a crawl, stood up and put my face up against the windshield half-standing over my steering wheel. I had stopped breathing and was completely fascinated, and then scared. It took about six seconds to cross the highway over me and it&rsquo;s only two lanes north and two lanes south. Someone could have jogged it about the same speed.The sky and cloud above it were a medium gray purple, and I got a pretty good look at whatever this was. I thought it was a plane coming in for a landing because it was huge, but made no sound (I did have my windows up, but it was directly over my car). There were actually three huge lights, one in each corner, and this thing had no wings, it was shaped like a perfect equilateral triangle, black. (or I&rsquo;m assuming it was black). In the center of this thing were some smaller red and bluish lights and all these weird panels and things. It was so foreign as to what I was expecting my eyes were having a hard time grasping that middle part. Nothing was blinking, no lights you see usually on helicopters and planes. When it crossed the road and got over the field, it banked to the left (south again) and CRUISED south. I sped up, and it was less than a mile to my exit and I was staying steady with it, I could kind of see it here and there through the trees. I got to the exit, there was a red light so I did down my window and leaned out and up over my roof of the car, then climbed back in because there were cars and I felt crazy. I watched to the right.Over route 31 there are a million chain restaurants and walmarts and things like that. This thing crossed the highway and kept going south toward Syracuse. I turned right toward wegmans and tried to keep up and see it. When I got to another intersection red light I looked left and saw it further away, and it had stopped and was motionless in the sky again. The light turned green and I didn&rsquo;t know what to do, so I just went and got my wife&rsquo;s bread while in a stupor. On my way home, I didn&rsquo;t see anything in the sky except three planes or helicopters way up in the sky in the same area flying around and around. I thought that was weird too. In all my life before or after I have never seen anything even closely resembling whatever this was.I was really thrown for a loop when I went home and searched &ldquo;triangle ufo&rdquo; and a million hits came up. I didn&rsquo;t see anything online as clearly as the thing I saw, but the three lights &ndash;one at each corner, was right. I wanted to call the police or an airport just so they could tell me what it was but I never did because I felt ridiculous-I didn&apos;t see anything in newspapers or anything so I kind of shut up about it. Hope I find out what it was someday.

I happen to live on the Eastern side of the city or just outside loop 20. By 10:00 P.M. much of the lightning and thunder had passed us by and only a few sprinkles remained. While observing the weather conditions outside, I noticed a white puffy cloud immediately to the west of my location.  As I stared at this cloud, I noticed four white lights chasing each other within the cloud itself.  I immediately called my wife so she could witness what I was looking at.  I also called my brother who happened to be visiting family in the vicinity of Nixon High which is located NW of loop 20 from where I was.  He was able to see the same lights inside the cloud going around in a circular pattern.  I tried to apply all logic as to the origin of the lights.  There were no airplanes in the vicinity nor was there any beams of light coming from the ground up. The airport beacon light is approximately 2 miles from where this cloud was. The lights seem to be chasing each other and never collided with each other.  At some point, the lights would come to a complete stop and would begin rotating in a counterclockwise pattern.  The best way to describe the lights is by imagining that your inside the cloud with a flash light and moving the light around or inside the cloud.  I could see where the light was hitting inside but the beam never broke through the wall of the cloud itself.  This sighting went on for approximately 30 minutes until the cloud moved out towards the East. I am a law enforcement officer and I have never seen anything like this in my 26 years of service.((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness observed.  We note that his description is not inconsistent with a four-element light advertising display, although we assume that the witness would have been witness to such a light display, during the course of his career in law enforcement.  We do not know what he witnessed.  PD))", "I saw a cone shaped object South East of my house in Golden Valley Arizona.

Then it stopped completely.", "Large Red Glowing Orb Seen Landing In VirginiaThis Sighting started around 2:00am when I was first awoke by a sound in the distance similar to a washing machine(wish wish, wash wash, wish wish, wash wash). I took a quick look out the window but didn&apos;t notice anything and soon returned to the comforts of my bed. Approximately 45 minutes to an hour later my dog jumped off the bed and ran to the front window. He started whining and running back and forth looking out all the windows from the first floor of the house. Since it obviously seemed something was bothering him outside, I got up again and looked out the back window. But this time I was startled to see a very strange large glowing Red Orb in the NorthWestern night sky gliding towards the East and seemingly descending into the woods behind my house.I will try to describe the scene and this object as best I can, so you can hopefully picture and possibly help me in figuring out what this object might have been.Looking North from my first floor rear window and Approximate 300 yards away there is a large tract of woods intertwined with a large creek and a field about 40 acres in size-including the woods it&apos;s  about 200 acres of undeveloped land.I first saw the object in the NorthWest sky(500-800 feet high)on a slow Easterly downward trajectory. The object had what I can only describe as a Reddish glowing Orb(half the brightness and size of the full moon)on top of a structure that you could clearly see was being illuminated underneath it. The structure looked to be cylindrical or rectangle in shape and was vertically suspended under this glowing orb. The size I would estimate was 20 feet long(up and down)and 8 feet wide(left to right).At this point the object was about 400-600 feet in the air and descending into the woods. Because of this I knew I wouldn&apos;t have much time to watch the object since it was descending in altitude. At this point I knew I had to make a decision and if I should try to grab my video camera. I knew it was a risk but I made the decision to grab the camera to document the sighting. I ran from the back window grabbed the camera and yelled for my wife to wake up and look out the back window(hopefully so she too could witness the event). I quickly grabbed the camera and returned to the window but was just briefly able to see it again as it descended deep into the woods. My wife made it to the window but unfortunately just seconds late.Please note-being around aviation for the most part off my life I can definitively say this object was definitely not a airplane or a helicopter of any kind. The only possibility that I have to consider and can&apos;t be 100% certain about is that this was some kind of unknown military drone-I don&apos;t feel this would be a very good possibility though. The light I&apos;ve tried to describe on top wasn&apos;t your conventional light and certainly not a beacon light of any kind-It was more of a bright soft red glow, quite strange actually.I spoke with Mr. Davenport at NUFORC and will closely follow his instructions on documenting this sighting. He suggested I contact The FAA, News Broadcasting Centers, Law Enforcement and anyone else who will listen. His instruction also entailed trying to locate the site where this object possibly landed. I will of course follow all of these additional details and therefore will keep you updated when any new details arise.I Thank You for giving me this forum to post this unexplained event and again will keep you posted of anything I uncover.Thank You", "Kings Dominion Circle, seen at night five years agoThis report is being resent since it pertains to the recent sighting in Virginia, Kings Dominion getting much attention now.  It was night and I witnessed small orbs of light moving like ballons up into the sky. Maybe twenty or thirty.  When they reached a point almost directly above my house, they formed a perfect circle, exactly like the one seen on the Kings Dominion video.  They hovered and spun like this for a few seconds before breaking up and moving off to the east. This episode then repeated two more times with craft coming from the west and moving off to the east.", "Lights spotted over Port Huron/Lapeer MIOn the morning of June 29th at 4:15 am a very bright light was spotted from Davison, Mi to the east between 85 and 90 degrees and between 35 and 40 degrees in elevation. The light remained in this position until it disappeared at 5:15. Light consisted of multiple lights in 3 rows, with 10-12 lights in a row in a bar like shape. Lights varied between being on and off, in color, intensity. They varied from glowing to being beams of light extending 5 times the width of the object. The lights seemed to rotate at times and sit still at other times, and sometimes flash at random. A red beam was often seen shining from the bottom of the object. 6-10 audible tones were heard while the object was visible. Tones were heard about every 15 minutes and lasted only a few seconds. The object seemed to move slightly in reference to nearby stars every few minutes but still remained in nearly the same place. A low hum was maintained at all times during the sighting but this could possibly have been local road noise.((NUFORC Note:  Star or planet, we suspect.

I am not sure of the exact year but it was most likely in the mid 1970&apos;s.  I grew up as an Air Force brat and my father was chief executive officer (director) for the Air Force Museum at Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton, OH for 5 years. Therefore, I am and was familiar with nearly every aircraft our military has flown. At the time of the sighting, I lived on a 98-acre farm just north of Denton,TX, and I was a high school teacher.The farm was located in a creek bottom area in a flood plain adjacent to Core of Engineers property. My mail box was located about 1/4 mile from the house on the blacktop road above (elev.) the creek bottom. As I got out to check my mail, the object flew directly over me and across the tree tops in a NW direction. My description of the object and event: Bright fire-engine red heart-shape like a thick, fat Valentine heart (the pointed end of the heart was the forward or leading edge); no visible windows: no noise; no vapor trail; air speed was about 50 to 60 mph; flew in a straight line only, no turns. I am guessing that it flew only about 100 to 200 feet above me and estimate it&apos;s size to be in length and width approx. about the same as an F-16 fighter jet, it was in a thick, heart-shape as I stated earlier. I knew immediately that this was not something I could explain or that it was anything I had seen before. I was excited, jumped back into my truck as I watched in cruising away, and raced to the house to ask my wife and a girlfriend of hers if they saw it or heard anything since the object had to fly almost directly over the farm house. They did not hear or see anything. I drove back to the mail box so I could see over the trees and of course it had disappeared. I don&apos;t know why I never reported this until now except that I have never seen or heard of a report of a UFO that describes something similiar or exactly what I saw. I know what I saw, it was a perfectly clear day, and it was too close to me for me to be mistaken or confused about its description.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was located on the edge of some high, flat clouds. Too large and round for a jet, was stationary, and very  illuminated with pure white light.About five minutes into my observation, called my husband and daughter out to look, and by then the cloud cover had moved away from the object which appeared to remain stationary.We viewed object with binoculars:  It was teardrop shaped with a bright light on the western most edge (in the middle). At some points it seemed there were two lights (one on the west edge and one on the right). And at one point in the observation it seemed as if a thin line protruded down from the narrow end of the object.I asked a neighbor to view the object with our binoculars and he was impressed with the amount of illumination given off by the object.  Took photo with our digital camera...Returned inside about 7:47 to write this report.

Neither of us has ever seen anything like this, and we both agreed on what we saw.We were at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, CA.  We were lying on the lawn, at a concert.  There were various ordinary looking airplanes in the air, all lit up normally.Suddenly, we saw two small swept wing shapes quite high up, in formation, but the trailing object was in very loose, and erratic formation with the leader.  This was unlike any kind of normal military jet formation I&apos;ve ever seen.  ( I am an ex airline pilot.)  The two were on an westerly heading, flying very, very fast, faster than any military jets would fly, and they were lit up on their undersides in a kind of feathery light, but the entire underside was lit up.  We could not see any detail, except that they were small, swept wing objects.  They made no sound at all.As I have said, my wife and I both saw the objects, and we did not disagree on what we had seen.  It was the first time in either of our lives that we realized we had seen something that did not look human-related.  We would very much like to know what we were seeing.", "Orange orb/fireball seen across sky.I saw it while I was on my deck. It was an orange orb the was moving at a slightly fast pace.

It was below the clouds or it was bright enough to be seen without any change while in the clouds. As it was about over the City of Erie it began to to get much smaller. It disappeared then reappeared a few times then it was gone.", "Very big bright white circular light flew away very quickly after I looked at it for a few seconds.My friend saw only part of what I saw.

After a few minutes, I saw, what I thought was a high flying plane or bird. I was amusing myself watching it go in and out of the clouds. Sometimes it never left the cloud it was in, which is what really made me pay attention.It was flying up and down and forward, never backward. I tried to capture the image on my camera but there was bright sunlight and it was causing too much of a glare.A short time later, a plane was behind it.. almost following. A regular craft. There was a marked difference in the way this one was flying in comparison to the first one. That&apos;s what made me think this was a UFO....then they both disappeared.

Then, I realized that it wasn&rsquo;t making any noise, and it was much brighter than a helicopter. I have lived on an army base that had a helicopter unit so I knew what helicopters looked like in the night sky.I had noticed that there was a row of windows about the center of the sphere.  I did go into my home to put away my groceries, but something compelled me to go back outside.  I stared at the object for at least 30 minutes. There was no movement.  It just hovered. After awhile, I started to feel frightened and I had a strange feeling of being watched.I decided to get my digital camera, and despite my fear decided to go back outside. I went back outside to take pictures, but the craft was gone.  It was a white bright light, but it is was obvious that it was a sphere.  You could see the outline of the sphere.

He describes it as circular in shape with three lights on the underside. When he looked up the ufo shone a light on us through some trees that hung over the road. The light was bright but not painfull even though my eyes were adjusted to the darkness of the night. The light was light blue in color and reminded me of the color of lightning. The craft hovered there for a second and without discontinuing the light flew in an easterly direction, it moved faster than anything i&apos;ve seen before, it flew horizontally and then shot straight up.

Not for a long distance but a short and quick little jolt. This intrigues me, so I keep watching. Again a quick jolt but now its changed form, almost like an arrowhead.  Now that shape shift could have just been my eyes going fuzzy for a second but as 15 minutes pass by, still staring at this arrangement of light, I am convinced this is not just a star for stars do not fade in and out for more than a second to two seconds at a time nor do they jolt in the form of triangles either.I asked my father to come out and witness this as well just to tell me if it was just me and that my eyes were just going fuzzy from the staring but even he himself was baffled at this sight we both were surveying; deciding this was definitely something that was out of the ordinary.(3:54 AM) Now as I write this it is still outside and doing its thing up by that same dim light I&rsquo;ve kept track of.

When we (2 adults) turned to look at where they were pointing (to the east) we saw a fairly large, brightly lit &ldquo;flying craft&rdquo; in the sky just above the treetops and houses moving towards us.  I first assumed it was a prop plane flying low, but immediately realized it was not the shape of an airplane (or firework or comet or military plane, etc).It was a boxy-circular shape (somewhat trapezoidal at first), very brightly lit with an orange-yellow light.  The entire craft was covered with a haze that seemed to diffuse the perimeter edges, which is why I can&rsquo;t put a name to the shape.    There was a brighter spot of light in the center of the object.It was moving towards the park clearing, but when the kids started shouting and pointing the craft stopped moving forward and began to hover.

We packed up and left at about five in the afternoon and went to get bait and snacks, then proceeded to our favorite fishing spot. When we got there we unpacked and walked over to a culvert and sat down. My ex was on my left, his father on my right, leaving me in the middle. The fish were biting good until around dusk. Then suddenly it got real weird. The birds stopped chirping, the crickets and frogs were quiet, and the fish stopped biting.  My ex&rsquo;s father looked at his watch and it was a little past 7 pm.Suddenly from the left side of the lake from behind the trees we ALL saw a bright huge ball of orange light. There was only the one ball of light.  It was about 200 feet off the water moving really REALLY slow. It kept at a steady pace though. It was not quite in the middle of the lake but at times seemed more towards us and at other times more towards the other bank.  I could see the reflection of it off the lake also. It light up the area around it but nothing more. It was like it got a little brighter in the area. The other thing that I noticed was it didn&rsquo;t make one single sound. Nothing, not even a low rumble. I remember thinking why isn&rsquo;t this thing making any noise also. The air got really thick as well. It was like it was slightly harder to breathe but there wasn&rsquo;t any smell in the air either. The other bank I would guess is only about a football field length away at the point we were at. On the other side of the lake are mountains that go straight up.  It kept going until it was a little past my ex&rsquo;s father and then made a sharp hook and came back the way it came.I jumped up and watched it slowly go back the way it came until it disappeared behind the tree line on my left side. When I looked back at my ex&rsquo;s father, we all noticed at the same time that it was very VERY dark out. My ex&rsquo;s father looked at his watch and noticed that it was well past 9 pm. It seemed to only take a few minutes for the thing to move across the lake and back. I freaked out and was really scared and couldn&rsquo;t figure out where all the time went to. We packed up quickly and ran to the car. We threw our things in the trunk and I sped back to our house.I remember both on the ride home and when we got in the house talking about what we saw. We all agreed that we saw the same thing but we couldn&rsquo;t agree on the color. I KNOW I say orange but my ex&rsquo;s father is insistent that he saw a big white ball.

I was able to get about 6 minutes of a steady camera shot with a tree in the background.I&rsquo;ve seen these objects here in Texas for over 10 years.

I posted a 6 minute clip here:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psBC8l2GcNM   The video rendering on youtube took away the ability to see the tree on the right hand side.The object did not appear again on 6/25 at 1:00, so it was not a star or planet.", "Cluster of lights appeared just before sunrise and travelled across the sky.A little before sunrise, I stepped on to my front porch to look at the twilight sky.  Looking south, I saw what at first appeared to be a very reflective airplane about 30 degrees above the horizon tracking smoothly across the sky  from south-southeast towards the northwest.  After a few seconds, I realized that I was not seeing an airplane-- at least not one like I have ever seen before.  It looked like a cluster of several very bright lights arranged in a tight formation, scintillating.  I became quite excited and ran inside to get my camera.  When I came out the formation had moved overhead and further along its smooth northwesterly trajectory.  I took video of the object as it passed by and receded.  I videoed for about two minutes.  The cluster is visible in the video, but the details of the formation are too small to be clearly discerned.   The formation was composed of two or three very bright lights along with a few smaller and dimmer lights in-between.  The cluster at first looked diamond- or cross-shaped, but after passing overhead it took on a more triangular appearance.  There was no noise.  The object did not leave a trail.  The whole event lasted about 3 or 4 minutes.", "NUFORC Home Page Web Report Indexes : by Event Date | by Location | by Shape | by Posting Date National UFO Reporting Center Sighting Report Occurred : 12/12/2004 22:00 (Entered as : 12/12/1904 22:00) Reported: 12/13/2004 11:33:08 PM 23:33 Posted: 12/14/2004 Location: Nashville, TN Shape: Light Duration:30 min.Lights circling inside clouds over Nashville  My wife and I were driving on I-40 westbound on Sunday night, coming back to Nashville from east Tennessee. After passing the Lebanon exit, I began noticing lights moving inside the clouds closer to Nashville. As we got closer, I could tell that they looked like spot lights shining down from above or inside the clouds instead of from below, and they were moving in large circles. This night we saw two of them moving in large circles and figure eights from east to west over Nashville. One of the main reasons I became so interested was that my wife and I have seen similar lights before.I filed a report back in 8/03 about lights we saw clrcling around inside the clouds during a big thunderstorm. We had pretty much conviced ourselves that this earlier sighting was a spotlight promoting something, or maybe lights from the Starwood Ampitheater, which we&apos;re kind of near (although I don&apos;t know why anyone would have continued to shine these types of lights during one of the biggest thunderstorms of the summer). These lights looked almost exactly the same and were moving in almost the same fashion, except there were only two instead of four. So now we had a chance to try to find the source of these lights and prove to ourselves that we weren&apos;t seeing anything out of the ordinary.We closed in on the city from about 30 miles out and the lights became increasingly obvious. I&apos;m sure other cars must have seen them, but there&apos;s no way to know. I had slowed down a lot because I was fascinated by these lights clrcling and seemingly swooping around just above the cloud ceiling. We kept expecting one to become more visible or distinct though a break in the clouds, but it never happened. They stayed very fuzzy and shapeless. The lights would circle opposite each other, then move together and back apart or do some crazy zig zag. However, we never saw a beam of light from the ground, and that was primarily what we were looking for.We got off the interstate on Stewarts Ferry Pk., when we thought we were finally getting below the lights, and went east. I was driving, but my wife could still see them northeast of us, so I took a left on Lebanon Pk and went north. Now we were very close to the Nashville airport, but the general movement of the lights seemed to be to the northwest and we could never get under them. We were also getting around more city lights and it was harder to see them, and they seemed to be farther away from us. We were tired from our drive so we went on home, but we satisfied ourselves that these lights were not originating from spotlights on the ground. I don&apos;t know that it proves anything about the first lights we saw, but it makes me wonder. I know other people must have seen these lights, as they were all over above the city, so I&apos;m hoping someone else will come forward.THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I SEEN 4/16/09 (of which I posted here) I feel so much better knowing someone seen the same thing 5 years eariler.  The cloud thing is interesting though.. It was like they not want to go beneath the cloud cover, but I could see them clearly once they connected together in the cloud clearing.The cloud thing is strange, it was between walmart and kroger on the busiest street in Nashville, near a communication tower... odd and very strange... I have calmed down a little since then but I cannot enter my apartment without thinking about what I saw.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

They both appeared at the same time then one disappeared followed by the other one, this pattern happened twice then two minutes later the two lights appeared then split into four.  Another two minutes later 4 appeared all in a row, there was a pattern to how the lights went out this time the second light would go out then the first, then the fourth light would go out then the third.  The lights continued in different patterns for the next two hours. the lights all  appeared for two seconds in the sky directly due south then would go out.

After fighting the urge to do so, I gave up, and got up to go take a look.  Outside the window, there was a spherical ball of light--about 1.5 to 2 ft in diameter, acting in a way that can only be described as conscious.  It was about 20 yards away from me; it was rising and disappearing into the sky, and falling gracefully back down in an arc so that I can only see it through the tall grass.  It spiraled in circles and it bounced up and down, drawing a wave with its movement.  I felt that it was conscious of my audience and that it was acting this way, strangely enough, for me: that it was playing and dancing around to make me feel that the interaction was a friendly one.  I grew frightened of the notion that it knew I was watching, and returned to my room, resolved to shut my eyes and not to open them again until morning.  In telling my grandmother this story in the morning, she got a strange look in her eye: she told me that there had been reports about 50 years back of children aged 12-14 being approached by a spherical ball of light, similar in description to what I saw, as they were walking in the neighboring woods.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We were hosting my son&apos;s birthday party and were in the backyard enjoying festivities.  There were about 40 people in attendance.  I was standing by the pool when someone called my attention to an odd orange light in the sky that was varying in intensity like a fire.  It was moving towards us at the right speed and altitude to be a small plane and was heading from south to north.  I then noticed my son standing next to me looking at it as well. I thought at first it was a plane on fire.  As I watched I noticed that there were no other lights on this object like an aircraft should have, just a chaotic dimming and brightening orange light.  We did not hear any sound from the object but we did have music playing outside that could have masked any sound. We watched the object travel across the sky, behind a large pine tree, and back into view.  A few moments later it started dimming and then went out entirely and we could see only dark sky.  The whole event seemed to last about a minute but my better judgment says about 30 to 40 seconds. There were no clouds in the sky, no unusual weather conditions, just a calm cool summer night.  I checked the news on both the internet and local paper today (the morning after) but have found no reports of anything that would explain what we saw.  A horizontal moving flare?  Ball lightning?  A troubled aircraft?  Others must have seen this which is why I&apos;m reporting it, so that perhaps it can be resolved as to what this was.", "10-12 objects seen in sky at late dawn10-12 orange colored, circle shaped objects going to the east at about a 45 degree angle in the sky from where I was standing.  The 12th one came up from the north-east from what it appeared to be the ground, shot up quickly to the others and followed them to the east and those other 11 objects were in a straight line like formation as it appeared to me.  The sun was almost completly set, there was still very little light in the sky, and it was partially cloudy.  I saw them go up into the clouds to the east and basically dissapeared in to them.", "Strange flashing whitish light that moved like a plane but then stopped and stood still for five minutes.My brother, mother and I were driving along North Phoenix Road North towards Medford.  We were in between Medford and Phoenix, perhaps the outskirts of Medford, around Campbell road, when I noticed a light flashing in the sky in front of us and a little to the right (East).  It was flashing in a strange way, so I pulled to the side of the road.  We got out and watched a UFO move steadily in our direction but somewhat to the East over the mountains.  At first I thought it might be a plane, but the entire craft was flashing, as I said, in a strange way. It was about 2:30 pm, so it was broad daylight, and the light needed to be fairly bright in order to flash that way.  The way that it was flashing gave me the impression that various parts of the craft were rotating.  The whitish light was continuously emanating from it, but in different intensities and from different parts of the craft.  So, the craft continued along and passed us, continuing South and a little East,! when it suddenly just stopped. I then knew definitely that it wasn&apos;t a plane.  It sat there stationary, and still flashing, for about five minutes.  We watched it for those five minutes until we had to go (we were late for something), so I have no idea how long it stayed in that position.", "this happened a while ago, a lot has happened in my life since then,but I could never forget this night,I dont know that what we saw that night was a u.f.o. ,I just know it was unexplainable.I&apos;ve always been the type of person that has to have solid proof to believe in things like u.f.o.&apos;s, well i&apos;ll just tell you what happened.I used to live in a apartment with my previous wife and our two children,I always worked graveyard,now for 27 years, I would always see this guy who lived in our complex coming home from fishing,I only knew him to say hi,or hows it going,but one day he came home with a 101 lb. sturgene fish that he caught behind the rice mills in west Sac.  We then started talking about fishing,he asked me if I wanted to go to a place on my night off where him and his dad used to go and catch tons of cat fish. I agreeded to go , he told me it was on private land ,that it was an eragation sluogh a couple of miles into this land ,we would have to go at night, but not to worry,nobody is ever out there,he was right it was prestine, and soon as your line hit the water,you would get bites. We probably caught 25 to 30 cat fish, it was realy buitiful out there ,there was&apos;nt a piece of trash to be seen anywhere,tall trees lined both sides of the slough.About two weeks later, I was telling my friend and my sister in laws boyfriend about this fishing spot they both wanted to go, I told them about the land being private, and that we would have to go at night. We went about 12:00 am by 1:00 am we where there starting to fish, just like last time we started catching cats like crazy ,we where using an electric lantern to see, it was mildly bright, while we were sitting there all of a sudden down the slough ,on the bank, about maybe 150 yards or more away, a bright light came on, it looked to be like one of those bright coleman gas lanterns, but we could&apos;nt see or here any people, we where instantly scared being on private land where my nieghbor told me he and his father never saw a soul out there, we quikly turned off our light and watched. Nothing was happening ,the light just stayed on, we waited a while and then thought it might be someone fishing like us, we thought we would try to be quiet and keep fishing with our light! off,we did. We fished for about an hour or 2, when my friend said he wanted to go lay down in the back of my nova, that he did&apos;nt care if we kept fishing,we did, though we kept looking down the slough at the light, we got so used to it being there we kinda stopped thinking about it, when all of a sudden the light got intencely bright, it scared the hell out of us ,when I say it got bright I mean like stadium lighting, we jumped up asking each other what the hell where we looking at?, before we could wake up my friend the light got giant ,it loominated all the trees and water,and I swear to you this light rose off the ground, it was so bright we could&apos;nt see any mass on it,just light. I then opened my car door and shaking my friend to wake up, by this time the light was at the top of the trees, My friend said what is it ,I told him it was the light that was on the bank, he then asked me if it was a u.f.o., it made no sound at all, I told him I have no idea what it is,we the! n stared throwing our gear in the car, and we jumped in,we did! &apos;nt know what to do, we had to drive towards it to leave, as we started near it ,it backed up, as we got closer it then moved quikly across the top of the trees,we could see it loominating the trees as it took off, it almost seemed to know we where watching.Im getting goose bumps remembering this night.  I have been through many things in my life since then, I remaried to a wonderful wife,but we suffered some great tradgedy in our life ,like the suicide death of my youngest son, the passing of my father who died fairly young,I dont usualy tell this story, because it sounds crazy, but I swear its true, I dont know what we saw, maybe you do. Many years had past and I lost contact with the 2 guys I was with that night, but one day my wife and I ,and my sister and her boyfriend went to the asparagus festival in Stockton Ca.,and while we where there amongst thousands of people I hear someone call my name ,it was my friend who was in the car asleep,he said hey ,hows it going ?,its been a ! long time, how about that thing we saw that night? I laughed,I thought it was funny ,that was the first thing he brought up .I was realy glad to see him and talk about it. Just for the record, when we drove over towards where it was there was no farm equipment no building no lighting of any kind,just acres and acres of corn field, we truely saw something that night ,and I think it was something we were&apos;nt supposed to see, I dont know if this story is helpful to you ,I just wanted to tell it,and its 100% true.((NUFORC Note:  Date indicated by witness is flawed.

I initially believed it to be a satellite since I often see satellites at this time of evening, however. I immediately realized that there was an area of solid cloud cover obscuring the stars at approximately 2,000 ft. AGL. The object was below the cloud cover. I estimated its speed to be 50-60 mph. The object made no discernable sound, and had no apparent shape or nagivation, wingtip or landing lights. After observing the object for approximately one minute, the object entered a cloud for approximately 10 seconds. When it emerged, it had changed color from white to solid red and had changed heading to north-northeast, about 060 degrees. At that time, I called my wife to come see it. By the time she came outside, the object was some distance away, but she was able to see the object&apos;s color and direction of travel. We continued to observe the object until it had passed out of sight behind distant trees.

It was moving much slower than the shooting star that I had seen 10 minutes earlier,  but much faster than the planes I see fly over all the time.  The green fireball had sparkles coming off it, and had a long green trail behind it.  It was a very strange thing to see.  I cannot say for sure how high up it was, but it appeared to me to be fairly low, certainly lower than the shooting star.The whole thing lasted maybe 5 seconds.I would really like to know what that was.

I am a Chemical Engineer and was getting ready to leave for my regular morning workout before work.It is quite common to spot satellites from my house and I enjoy tracking them across the sky and so am quite familiar with how fast they travel and what they look like (basically look like a moving small star). The ones I usually spot are typically moving in a West/East direction.As I focused in on the moving object in the southern sky I realized that there were actually 3 objects. Two were adjacent to each other and the third was following behind about 5 to 8 times the distance of the two that were adjacent to each other. They looked very much like a satellite would (like small moving stars) and took about 30-40 seconds to move across the entire visible sky.

Our friends were visiting from Canada and we were all outside talking, laughing and having a great time for hours.  At about 2:00 am, July 5th three of us looked up in the sky and saw an oval shaped, green luminescent light to the east.  Because it was dark and I don&rsquo;t know how big this object was, it was difficult to say how close it was.  My depth perception seemed off.  If I used the full moon as a guide for the size of this light, I&rsquo;d say that looking up, the moon was about the size of a quarter and this green light was about the size of a dime.  At first we thought it was some sort of firework because it just stayed in one spot directly over the roofline of our house for a couple of seconds. Then it started to move. We watched the light travel in an erratic pattern in a southerly direction for about 10 seconds. We were yelling for my husband and son to come out of the house to see this too when suddenly we saw the green light shoot up into the sky.  It went straight up until it was a pinpoint of light like the other stars in the sky. This only took a couple of seconds.At this point my husband and son came outside.  We showed them where the pinpoint of light was and the 5 of us watched the light travel in the sky for about the next 10 minutes.

Just beyond the clearing there was an intense Blue/White light that was pulsing.  At first I was thinking it might have been an airport light off track.

He doesn&apos;t drink or take drugs, but he called me to come visit to show me some pictures, so this is a second hand report.  (I live in Salt Lake City, and he lives 12 miles south of me.)  He explained, the moon was up and he went into the house to get his camera and take picture of the moon with his Pentax Digital SLR 6 MP camera, with his 70-300 telephoto lens.  As he was taking pictures of the moon, he noted a dark object slowly moving and hovering about 30-50 feet in the air toward the northeast, adjacent to an elementary school about an eighth of a mile away.  It was dark, and he could barely see the object, but noted it was slowly moving. He directed his camera toward it an got some picture.This evening, the 7th of August, I finally met with him and he showed me his pictures that he downloaded to his mother&apos;s laptop.  The picture quality was poor, but his pictures did appear to show a saucer shaped object, with some sort of a glow or reflection below it.  He said when he saw it, it gave him a &apos;chill,&apos; and felt like he was dreaming, he could not believe what he was seeing.  It was slightly above the trees, and the pictures did show that it had gained some altitude, but still was hovering, with no sound.  He managed to get several pictures.  Since this is a residental area, except for the large fields around the school, I would estimate that the disk or object, was only about 30 feet or so long.  He went back into the house, and didn&apos;t see where the object went, except that it was no longer there.  This may be something else, like a balloon, but even the pictures, as poor as they are, seem to show something unusual.  This may be nothing, but perhaps others saw it also, and perhaps worth reporting it to you. I served in the military as a pilot. (I got off active duty and became a part time civilian flight instructor and worked for the Fire Department in SLC, which I still do.) One clear early morning about 02:30, in July of 1983, over the starry night skys of Utah, my student and I did witness an unusual craft within 50 feet.

This is a rough guess but I would say it&apos;s height was somewhere between 2000 and 5000 feet.  I first thought it must be a plane as we are in the flight path of a major airport.  Started looking for wings, couldn&apos;t see any but that&apos;s not really unusual because sometimes the angle of the plane makes it impossible to see the wings.  Then I realized that the &quot;plane&quot; or &quot;object&quot; was in the wrong place for the flight pattern - too high for just taking off or landing, and too low for passing through. No contrail at all.  As I watched the object, which was flying east to west at about 65 degrees above the horizon, it appeared to just simply fade out. I was looking right at it (still looking for the wings on the thing don&apos;t ya know) as it slowly dissappeared! The effect was like a plane going behind clouds that are thin at the edges but get thicker towards the middle - I&apos;d say about 8 to 10 seconds from the time it started to fade, to completely gone. But there were no clouds in the sky. I don&apos;t know if my eyes were playing tricks, but at the last place I saw the object - the spot where it completely vanished - there appeared a faint dark smudge - like smoke - in an otherwise clear blue sky.

At it&apos;s closest I&apos;d say it was probably about 1/2 mile to a mile away and maybe just 100 feet off the ground.  It was blinking red.  And they were kind of mediocre timed intervals, almost kind of reminded me of a persons breaklight if they were to delay each compression for a couple seconds.  It kind of went up and down a bit within very short distances which was different for my eyes to see. I watched it not gain very high altitude at all.  It stayed really low to the ground around the area. I got my mom to show her.  And she watched it with me, and I couldt tell she knew that it was different.

And then it turned around, 180 degrees on that dime. Which was pretty amazing really.  Uh, I was very excited to see this variance in whatever this thing was. I could not hear any sound, if it was a nearby local cessna I could of heard it&apos;s engine from it being so close.  I am correct with my time, so the airports the only one that could deny my sighting.  This was a really awesome sighting.  I haven&apos;t seen anything in the sky this intersting over the last 4-5 months that I would waste my time talking about.  As I am a consistent star/sky gazer. Really different type of lights on this thing.  The way it moved was pretty different.  I don&apos;t think this could be related to any type of other flying aircraft.  Here&apos;s another big thing as well.  For the distance it traveled and as close as it was, I&apos;d have to say this thing was moving at no more then 20-25 miles per hour.((NUFORC Note:  One of many reports from same source of alleged sightings of UFO&apos;s.

It was a disk-like shape with many yellow-white lights moving in a circular motion around the craft.  The object also had one small red light near the top center of the craft.  I pointed the object out to my boyfriend and within about a minute, the object had moved all the way across the valley of Reno, NV, and could barely be seen anymore. We noticed that a helicopter came relatively close to the object several times, but the object seemed unaffected by its presence. We decided to attempt to follow the craft to investigate further.  As we drove across the city, the craft moved closer and farther away, sometimes hovering in one spot for several moments.  At one point, we got near enough to the craft that we could see with the unaided eye its true shape.  It was still disk shaped, but it had become apparent to us that there were two rows of lights instead of one, spin! ning around the craft in a circular motion.  At our closest, the object was a few hundred feet in the air away from us.  At this point, the object turned onto its side, much like a Frisbee rolling on the ground, then turned back to its flat side, and began again to move away from where we parked. We continued to drive throughout the city to get closer, but the object eventually disappeared from sight altogether.  In the dark it was very difficult to see the full shape of the object, but I and my boyfriend are certain that this was no helicopter, plane, or child&apos;s toy.  We attempted to both photograph and videotape the object, but neither method was successful in picking up the image. To clarify, neither of us have ever seen anything like this.  We are both young college students with no history of mental illness.  We have seen TV shows regarding these kinds of incidents, and have always found them to be exaggerated and quite unrealistic.

It was the same type of craft as before, in the same location, with a few differences. It was between I-265 and the watterson. I was observing it from LaGrange Road, in front of the Kroger, while stopped at a light.  It was again, an equilateral triangle of white lights, surrounding a red flashing light.  There were no other visible lights. This craft was heading right to left from my perspective. It appeared to be flying higher, or farther away, probably 500-750 feet. It was hard to judge because it was night. But this time, there was another craft following it, by my estimates, way to close to be 2 planes. It was closing the entire time until the disappeared behind some trees. The following craft could easily have been a small terrestrial aircraft. There appeared to be 2 other aircraft in the sky, but at a glace, they appeared terrestrial, and my attention was on the seemingly extra-terrestrial aircraft.

It was a very bright red and extremely fast flying object. Like nothing we had ever seen before. It was surely no army aircraft, at first it seemed as it was just a bright red star, but then it suddenly started moving with a very high speed. It was also fascinating to see that all those UFO&rsquo;s were moving towards the same direction. They were moving towards Jupiter which was over the sea so it was east.After the first one had gone we didn&rsquo;t see much for a while until a couple just flew in to view like from nowhere again heading eastwards.At that point I decided to bring out the small telescope we had in our position.Despite the objects very high speed, I pointed the telescope towards east in hope that another one might pass in to view. Three passed again in the same direction, but I was not able to capture them in time. I saw another one coming from a distance again just one bright light going into a straight line towards east. I was able to aim the telescope a bit ahead of its course then I managed to capture it just for a split second. One thing was clear to me that it wasn&rsquo;t a plane. It was just an extremely bright light moving in a straight line with out making a noise and moving in a speed I have never seen before and disappearing right in front of our eyes. Even with the telescope I wasn&rsquo;t able to identify the shape of the object as it moved very quickly and eventually disappeared.After that we saw even more of them all moving to the same palace, but not in a squadron formation like army planes would do.The four of us look at that same sky every night and never in the 3 years we have owned this house have we seen something like that.

It was being trailed by two fighter jets (I assume from Miramar Naval Airstation or North Island) that were shooting tracers towards it.  This obviously grabbed my attention.  I had never seen tracers other than in WWII documentaries.As the craft came to be directly in front of me (well above the roofline of the house to the north), it turned north on a dime and accelerated &amp; vanished in an instant.  I realized that it was a UFO when I saw it streak towards LA like a bullet &amp; disappear.  The two jets, which I could now hear, continued to follow by slowly arcing to the north.  The pilots had to be as totally mystified as I was. No man made craft then or now could have made that maneuver.  I thought about reporting this to some authority like the police or the newspaper, but it was late &amp; I just went to bed.  I told my family &amp; friends the next day &amp; I combed the San Diego Union to see if anyone else had reported this but found nothing.This is by far the most incredible &amp; unexplainable thing I have ever witnessed, and to this day I can still visualize it like it happened last night.  I have never witnessed a remotely similar event &amp; to my knowledge, no one has ever reported seeing a UFO over San Diego.I have always wanted to notify an appropriate organization to see if an investigation could locate a Navy report which had to have been filed by the pilots, perhaps two per jet.From that point forward in my life I have always had a tremendous interest in UFO sightings, documentaries, stories, etc.I have had a lifelong interest in the manned space program (I  still have an old scrapbook of news &amp; magazine articles about the Mercury, Gemini &amp; Apollo programs) as well as astronomy &amp; the knowledge constantly evolving about the Universe. I loved the movie Contact so much that I read Carl Sagan&rsquo;s novel which was just as awesome.I have watched some UFO programs on the Discovery Channel &amp; I believe there were several very well documented UFO sightings/encounters near Catalina Island or the Channel Islands around this time.  I have been wondering if there is a connection between those events &amp; the one I witnessed.  I would love to discuss my experience with a relevant organization in the hopes that it sheds new light or somehow furthers our understanding of this type of phenomenon.((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful to the source of the report for his having submitted.

After some time of smoking, listing to music, and just passing time.  I noticed a fireball off to the right.  It was in no hurry, and not high in the sky.  I told my date to look.  It was traveling the same route as the stream east to west.  It was throwing out what looked to be sparkles like the kids play with on the 4th of July.  I would say it took more than a minute and a half to pass from my right to left.  It did not lose any altitude, and just kept traveling towards WVa.I then left the woods, and stream, and went to a fire station on Mountain Rd., and Route 7, where I reported this as a plane in trouble.  They said it was a meteor, and I left it at that.In the years after, I thought if it had been a meteor the speed would have been greater, and it would be descending.  This thing maintained hight and speed over what must have been 40 to 80 miles.This to me classifies as a U.F.O. Until someone gives me an explanation I can live with.  I am not saying it was being piloted by little green men, but it defies the senses.

We watched as it slowly moved in a circular motion and went in all directions, and appeared to travel great distances in a short time. Then a second object appeared within a minute of the first.  Both were identical in shape, movement and flying patterns.  They looked as if they were dancing about, playing with and chasing one another.

At 21:36 PM, I placed a call to my boss who lives in far NE Heights section of Albuquerque with a view towards the west for his opinion on the events. He witnessed the object immediately with his naked eye and later with great detail via a telescope.The object appeared to be a structure hundreds of stories tall. As it was positioned stationary, the bottom light (which was what appeared to be the original cigar object)was approximately 15 degrees above the horizon in the sky. The top of the structure(what was the third light) was at the 25 degree mark above the horizon. The second light was at the 20 degree position between the two lights. Again, all three light were arced in a crescent shape, with the 25 degree light being the northernmost.The lit object/s was/were visible from my vantage point until 21:51 PM.

Of course, I say it is a UFO, not an alien because I believe it may possibly be able to be described. I was not the first person to see it, but it was drawn to my attention within a minute of its appearance.  The night was semi-cloudy, and there was a haze from everyone shooting off fireworks.  There were few stars, and the moon was not a factor given the objects location. It was probably somewhere between 1,500 and 3,000 feet off the ground, several miles west of Clinton, traveling south to north.  It appeared to put off its own light, and was roughly the color of fire. My first thoughts were that it was a meteor that was starting to enter the atmosphere, however I quickly dropped that idea because it did not leave a tail, did not seem to be breaking apart, and was moving at a slow, steady pace at the same elevation. It can only be described as a glowing ball.  It did not flash or change colors, and the brightness stayed roughly the same. I do not believe it was a conventional aircraft.  I grew up in the area, and it is only about 30 miles from Whiteman AFB.  This was not a typical flight path for the aircraft from that base, and it was too low to be a commercial jet.  It is possible it was a helicopter from an odd angle, but again, the speed and color make that highly unlikely. The object was moving probably somewhere around 150-300 miles per hour, as it was in the normal speeds of aircraft that I have seen.

It was a bright light in the sky, far away in the distance. It looked like a star, but it was red, and far brighter than any star I have ever seen (besides the sun). It was too bright and did not move like a plane or helicopter, too slow to be a satellite or a shooting star.  Similarly, the red light&rsquo;s movement was erratic thus eliminating any-other known celestial body following a constant orbital path.  It was just above the trees down the street, in the southwestern sky. I called back to my friend, who was walking back inside, to come look at the light. We watched the light for approximately 20 minutes. Over the course of the 20 minutes the light grew fainter and fainter.  It went higher into the sky for about ten minutes, then started moving further south for about five minutes. It moved very slowly. It moved like it was ! the first stroke of writing a &quot;Y,&quot; going up (from the base of the &quot;Y&quot;), and to the left.  After about 10 minutes I called another friend with my cell phone and told him to go outside and look at the light. He saw it too. After watching the light for fifteen minutes, it stopped moving. It was dimming faster than it was before. It would flicker, get slightly dimmer, then brighten again. Every time it flickered it would become slightly less bright. Then when it became as dim as the stars around it, it started flashing and falling towards the earth. It moved faster than it did when it was moving in the previous 20 minutes. It appeared to be in a free-fall. It fell for about 30 seconds then stopped flashing and we couldn&rsquo;t see it anymore. I could still see it for about 3 seconds after the light went out.

Sightings have been made by myself and 5 other people.  I have experience in astronomy, astrology, and physics, as do two other witnesses.  REPORT:  On clear nights the unknown objects have been seen flying across the sky as (apparently) tiny points of light--NOT BLINKING, with a constant glow--, about the size/brightness of an average star (from our perspective). At first we assumed they were planes or possibly satellites, but for how small they were--seeing as they were at extremely high altitudes--they were moving far too fast.  The objects moved at a seemingly constant velocity, but their independent trajectories are  not constant.  We have seen them travel in straight paths, in exaggerated arcs, and even move back in forth in a kind of weaving motion. What is peculiar is that the objects do not appear off the horizon, they simply appear at random points in the sky, sometimes along with barely noticeable flashes of light.  Some are stationary and then begin to move very suddenly with no detectable acceleration.  Furthermore, the objects do not necessarily fly toward the horizon as they move away from us.  Instead they either fade away or simply blip out of sight.  We assume that this means they are not following the curve of the earth, but moving on some kind of tangent.  One object was the most interesting.  It was much lower in the atmosphere then the others, appearing very large and bright, but with no obvious shape.  It was just a point of light.  It moved very quickly across the sky, and disappeared in a very sudden and almost undetectable flash of light.  It was nowhere near the horizon at the time of its disappearance.  The color of light coming from the larger object seemed to be a yellow shade, the wavelength being around 580nm. The most recent sighting was witnessed by myself alone at approximately 4:15 am, Wednesday, July 15 2009.  There was a small flash and then a poi! nt of li ght like others before.  This time, though,as the object moved directly over my position, the amplitude of the light it emitted greatly increased until it was very very bright.  It dimmed again, then brightened for a shorter amount of time, before quickly speeding up and simply disappearing at about 75 degrees off the horizon. ** I realize this report is not very well organized, but it is in all aspects completely serious.  I would very sincerely appreciate if someone were to look into this case.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I say the looked like satellites because they looked just like one at night only these objects we close to each other one behind the other and ive never observed two satellites travelling the same direction, same speed, so close to ach other.  I know these were not aircraft because the light that was given off was not of a strobe or landing light nature.  More of when light reflects off of metal and this makes since because the sun had set only an hour before so you only have to go so high before you reflect the suns light.  What makes this case interesting is after a minute of observing these two objects travelling north the began to change direction and over the course of about 30 secs went from travelling due north to due south.  About 15 secs before we lost sight my father and I both saw one of the objects split SE while the other object continued south.  Dont really care if this is credible or not i know what we saw.  No way it was a satellite because of the course change that was made by both objects and I know they were not aircraft because there was no strobe light and without that you cant see an aircraft at night with no moon:) 3rd sighting in 3 yrs for me here in SC KS and the 2nd for my father in 2 yrs.

As the evening was winding down, a few of us stepped outside for some fresh air.  After a bit of time the other individuals with me decided to go inside, but for some reason I thought I&rsquo;d just stay out there a little longer.I remember looking straight up at the sky, and marveling at the fact that it was so clear.  There were tons of stars out.  As I was looking up at the stars, something caught my eye.  At first it had blended in with the rest of the stars, but I soon realized that there were a set of white lights moving with each other, slightly rotating.  (Since the object was high up in the sky and it was dark out, the lights were the only thing I really saw).  At this point, the lights appeared as if they were in a triangle formation, equi-distant from each other.   The object remained in the same point of the sky, but started to &lsquo;revolve&rsquo; around it&rsquo;s vertical axis.   This is when I started to realize that it was a 3D object.   As the triangle shaped set of lights began to rotate at a moderate speed, the triangular plane created by those lights became slanted until I was looking at the very edge of the triangle (for a split second I just saw a line of lights).  As it continued to rotate, the! triangular plane appeared again as if viewing it from the other side.   All this was happening on/near it&rsquo;s vertical axis, but the entire object start to revolve around the horizontal axis as well.   As it continued to revolve it began moving slowly across the sky.   After moving at that speed for  a bit, it sped up considerably until it was out of sight in a matter of seconds.  It traveled a long distance in a very short amount of time.As I was watching this, I remember feeling that this object was way up in the sky, and very large.  My setting was almost void of any sound, and this craft did not add to it at all, there was no sound (but it took me a bit to realize this, since it was so odd).  I also thought the lights must have been very bright considering the fact they were competing with stars from my original vantage point.

He said that he observed one of them drop from the formation of the three - nearly to ground level, and the rise right back up and return to formation (it did this only once according to him).I asked him if he had gotten a cell phone picture of this - and he replied that he had, but it &quot;didn&apos;t turn out&quot; so he deleted it. He described the objects as large and bright.He went into the house - and I remained on the porch, and a short time later my neighbors returned home across the street. There were two cars of people - and one was a car full of kids (assuming his kids and their friends / relatives?).They got out of the car and were screaming about what THEY had seen as well. I yelled at them that my (male relative) had also just seen the very same thing - and I walked across the street to discuss it with them.They showed me a cell phone picture of a formation of three identical, ethereal looking boomering shaped lights (not lights in a boomerang formation - but each light was shaped like a boomerang or more accurately a chevron - like a wide letter &quot;v&quot;. I asked them if they were green and they said &quot;No - they were more whitish looking&quot;.They also revealed a detail that my (male relative) did not reveal, and that was that these objects were trailed by - or dropped from - a larger object or other objects behind them and just behind, or beneath the low cloud cover.These other - or this other object they described as three red lights in a &quot;smiley face&quot; type of configuration. They described it - and the other objects as being big.Both they - and my (male relative) confirmed that the original objects were lost from sight when they eventually dropped to ground level. And - both parties relayed to me that the objects first initially appeared &quot;out of nowhere&quot; to begin with.Inquiries to the Middletown Police department should be made - as well as inquiries to discover other potential witnesses as well - as the objects were apparantly noticed by multiple parties in the area, and were quite obvious. Although I wish to remain anonymous - a graphic of the photo - and a map of the area will be submitted to you momentarily.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report elects to remain anonymous; provides minimal contact information.

While sitting in my back yard, I noticed the objects first moving over our house in a V-shape formation. After about a minute of watching the lights, I then ran into the house to get my brother. Upon returning to the back yard, we both noticed that the lights had changed their pattern to a random configuration. No noise was heard from these objects as they moved overhead, a very thin cloud cover or haze was above and the lights seemed to emit a glow through the haze, their color was off-white. They moved off in a northerly direction and faded away into the distance. Each light was approximately the size of an eraser on a pencil held at arm&apos;s length. The entire V-shaped formation was approximately the size of two full moons.", "Strange bright Red light over San JoseOn the night of August 9th 2009 between the hours of 11:30PM and 12:30AM me and my girlfriend observed some sort of U.F.O. It was a red light that did not flash. for about 40 minutes it approached as if a plane would but took way to long to reach us which it never did. it rose upward very slowly glowing brighter and brighter, then very dim for a few minutes then bright again. Then this red light jumped over to our right at the same altitude it was at approx 2 miles from its starting point in the sky. It then began to flash very quickly and got brighter then dimmer flashing, then it decended the distance it traveled over the last 45 minutes or so in about 3 seconds flashing brighter and then slowing down and gettting dimmer, then getting brighter and faster again. at the end of its decent it got dimmer and turned a whitish color and as it was speeding off just disappeared.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I happen to look up because of the traffic and I saw this thing. It was the darkest black colour i&apos;ve ever seen and this thing was huge. It could have been anywhere from 1 to 3 miles long. It was moving very slowly with no sound, in three dimentional directions. It waited in mid-air and a much smaller round silver object appeared. With some kind of ant sticking out of the front of it. This round silver object looked like some kind of craft not from this planet. The black thing to this day scared my wife so bad. To this day i believed that the black thing was not a craft but something that was actully alive. The reason why I say that the black thing might have been alive is because the way it moved. It was able to move three dimentional and I believe that this thing defenatly wanted to be noticed. I believe with that huge traffic jam other people had to see what we saw. At least some of them. This black thing was so huge and so powerful looking that It could be mistaken for a god. I wanted to pull over to the side of the road but my wife wouldn&apos;t allow me to have a better look at it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The line was nearly vertical. It was angled 20 degrees to the right of vertical. I saw a series of lights - 12 or 14 pinpoint lights.  They were a bluish, light purple in color.

Incredible speeds and incredible turns.I was out in my front yard, talking on the phone with my best friend.  It was approximately 11:30 pm and the night sky was absolutely clear and you could see hundreds of stars.  I noticed what I thought was a shooting star but it blinked, so then I thought it was some kind of aircraft.  I realized in just a second or two that there were three objects alike, in the same general area of the night sky.  All three were darting here and there, many times turning on a &quot;dime&quot;.  More than once, making a 90 degree turn.  As they danced around a large portion of the sky, they would blink realy quick, sometimes.  But not constant.  They seemed to almost be playing &quot;tag&quot;.  Their speed was phenomenal, and much faster than anything I am familiar with.  Plus, they could change direction in a blink, and &quot;we&quot; have nothing that can do that, at that speed, to my knowledge.  I was describing all I was seeing to my buddy Gary, and we were both trying to come up with an answer th! at made sense for what I was seeing.  I sometimes did not talk when he was asking me questions because I was entralled with what I was seeing.About two or three minutes (maybe less) into watching this, they &quot;zipped&quot; away in different directions.  I kept talking with my buddy and kept watching the sky.  About four or five minutes later, I observed one of those same objects, heading north at an incredible speed.  Behind it but far back was an obvious airplane, probably a military jet because of its speed, going in the same direction.  I had the impression that it was trying to catch or keep track of the &quot;object&quot; in front of it.  The airplane was going really really fast, but was &quot;dusted&quot; by the object in front of it, which seemed to be traveling at approximately 1 1/2 to 2 times the speed of the airplane.  They both disappeared to the north. When I was observing these three objects in the beginning, they often would blink really quickly, a white light with no discernable colors, but would not constantly blink.  The blinking was very fast.  Faster than helocopters of airplane lights blink. But sometimes they would not blink for a second or two.  When they were not blinking, I could still make out an object in the direction of travel at any given moment, which appeared to be a dull grey or silver in color, streaking. These objects were very high in the sky.  What I would describe as &quot;outer space&quot;.  I can not explain how I could see them when they were not blinking, as there seemed to be no light other than that which blinked.  Maybe it was a reflection from the moonlight.  I don&apos;t know. I have never before observed something I could not explain, prior to this.  I served 8 years in the U.S. Marine Corps and 4 months in the Navy.  I am 56 years old and a retired Cleveland police officer.  I retired as a Lieutenant, and I was recognized by the U.S. Congress (108th Congress) for my service and career.  My buddy who was on the phone with me at the time, is currently a working police officer in Cleveland. I have spend 24 hours or so, replaying in my mind and recollection, all of what I observed last night, and can not come up with a logical explanation.  I have told no one except my wife, who is visiting our son in Texas, and my buddy Gary. I will add that in my area, we get a lot of military aircraft that conduct manuevers above our home.  There are usually two but sometimes three, always in the daylight hours, apparently practicing.  On one occasion, my wife and I actually observed one of the planes shoot an object, but we do not know what it was or where it went.  This shot object disappeared into some clouds.  Every once in awhile these military aircraft break the sound barrier and rattle our home.  We just assume these military jets are from Wright Patterson AFB, which is not to far from us. Oh, one more thing.  When I was observing the three unknown blinking objects, there was absolutely no sound.  When I observed the one streaking north, it was also silent but I could hear the loud coming airplane that was way behind it, going in the same direction.  My &quot;feeling&quot; is that the airplane was a lot lower in the sky, than the object it was following behind. I don&apos;t have anything else to add.  Please let me know if you get any other reports frm my area, during that same time period. I am just amazed and confused.  I need glasses to read but my long range vision is very good.  I can not come up with a logical explanation for what I observed.", "Intense bright light thru bedroom window, tree next to window bent over and touches ground.Very intense light observed penetration through one of two bedroom windows.The light did not penetrate through the second bedroom window.The light appeared dim at first then intensify very quickly.

We were about 15 minutes into our drive when I glanced out the drivers side window to the east and saw a teardrop shaped object that appeared to be falling in the sky, and left absolutely no trail outside of the taper to the teardrop &quot;point&quot;. The object was about 3/4 white and the center of it was a dull black, almost a matte black. I was watching the object, about 30 seconds after I saw it we heard fighter jets flying. we saw 4 jets flying directly at the object, and the closest air base is about 100 miles away in Brainerd. The jets flew directly at the object, which appeared to be slowly descending about 30 degrees above the horizon. At this point the jets had appeared to be closing in. Suddenly we heard another jet, and looked to see 3 more (i think) jets flying toward the object. I would estimate that the object was somewhere above central Wisconsin. As the jets are flying, we looked toward the west and saw a bullet shaped silver craft that appeared to be burning atmosphere. Then another fighter jet flew toward the west. The object descended past the tree line, where neither of us could see it anymore. The object in the west has taken a turn and headed south where we lost track of it in the sun.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

The Milky Way was overhead and extremely brilliant. It must have been a new moon and I lived in a small country town so there were no lights and lots of stars. My father was in the garage working on his car when my boyfriend and I came back early from a date. We parked in the yard away from the house and decided to lie on his hood and see who could find and name the most constellations. We were parked facing an easterly direction. I was looking toward the south and my boyfriend toward the north. Suddenly he grabbed me and said, &quot;Look there.&quot;  At first I didn&rsquo;t see anything.  Then my eye caught a movement under the starry sky.  No lights, no sound.  It appeared to be 7 disc-shaped objects flying in a tight V formation.  There were 3 discs on one side and 4 on the other, so not even.  Or at least it appeared that way.  We weren&rsquo;t sure if it was one object or seven.  The only reason we could see it was because the star light reflected from the bottom and the fact that it moved across the star scape. Since we had no perspective we could not tell how far above it was.  But I saw it at about 11 O&rsquo;Clock (my left) and it moved very quickly to the south.  After it left, we listened for a few seconds but heard nothing.  I yelled for my Dad but he didn&rsquo;t come out in time.  Something that I feel is very significant is that the Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville at that very time had the Apollo missile.  I remember a big to-do about transporting it to Florida.  Also, my father who worked for IBM had just been told he was being transferred with the contract to Cape Kennedy.  I have always felt there was some kind of connection.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))", "Bright light appearing low in Southeastern sky.  Wobbles and tracks across the sky for hours.  Been watching it for 2 weeks now.My wife and I have noticed a bright white light in the southeastern sky almost every night for the past 2 weeks.  It is low in the sky.  From my second story bedroom it appears just above the tree line.  The trees are about 20-25 feet off the ground.  Not every single night but probably 60-70% of the time.  It appears around 11pm-12pm and appears as a bright light.  At first, I thought it was a bright star but as we studied it, it appears to wobble, move up and down and side to side.  I am a very novice star watcher but I am not aware of a bright star in the low southeastern sky.  This all happens as it hangs in the sky basically in the same location for long periods of time &ndash; hours.  I watched it until 3am a few times before going to sleep. I started watching it again last night.  I picked a land based reference point and watched its movement across the sky. Over a 45 minute period it moved very slowly across and higher in the sky appearing to stop along the way and continuing to wobble. The movement was very subtle but it is definitely moving &ndash; miles &ndash; very noticeable distances over the 45 minutes.  I can&rsquo;t estimate the distance because it is so far away.  I have been thinking it is a star but based on my limited experience, stars don&rsquo;t track across the sky this fast (based on the Earth&rsquo;s rotation) It is not like watching a constellation like Orion or anything like that.  Also, it appears much closer than a star.  It is above the cloud deck but appears to be well within the atmosphere. My wife thinks it&rsquo;s a satellite but again, based on my experience; it seems much closer and again does not move like the satellites I have observed crossing the night sky.  It appears in almost the exact same spot every night we see it.  Not sure what it is but it definitely is something we have not seen before.  We have been living in this location for almost 8 years now and I have been observing the sky out my bedroom windows at night for years now.  It&rsquo;s something that I have never seen before.

The objects seemed to be a triangular-shaped light with 2 round lights close below it. The group of lights were in the same position for 20 minutes from approximately 4:45 to 5:05 AM.I spotted this when I took several bags of recyclables outside to place them in the car bay beside my house. The house is located on the east shore road of Lake Carmel. I consulted a Google map so that I could verify that the position of what I observed was in fact in the northwest sky.To the naked eye, these objects seemed to be at an elevation one might expect to see jet aircraft.I went outside four times during this 20-minute period. The objects appeared to be in the same position.

We were about 3 miles west of Post, TX, driving eastbound on US HWY 380.  It had been a clear day, while I was smoking, I caught a glimpse of light due south of us, nearly all the way to the horizon.  I made a comment to the effect of &quot;wonder if we&apos;re gonna get wet?&quot;  I had time to say that and roll up the window of the 4spd manual Jeep Cherokee.Immediately this thing was right on top of us, it turned everything red, like we were driving inside a laser, I could feel weightlessness, specifically I recall feeling my penis lift up off of my testicles(sorry to be graphic).

It appeared to be the good year blimp, way far up in the sky.   By the time I took three pictures, it was hard for me to see the object anymore.  The odd thing was, all of a sudden this object created a noise like a large plane (I am not into aircraft but the sound I described at the time was a B1 bomber sound).  Its as if they were floating above, enjoying the peaceful landscape, and then they saw me watching them and they wanted me to think they were a common airplane.It is as if they flipped a switch to create the noise.

Me and most of my friends have had UFO experiences either on or near Sohn Road in Vassar.  In fact, I use to live on Sohn Road until March of 2000.  I have seen some crazy stuff while living on that road!!  Mostly circle shaped lights at night/early morning.  Some orange, some white, and some that even changed colors.I have had two experiences in the past month to month and a half while driving down Sohn Road in assar, Michigan. Both experiences were with an orange colored circle. The more recent experience happened on Friday, July 31 of 2009 at about 1:00 am in the morning as I was returning home from a friends house.I was heading down Sohn Road (from Vassar heading towards Frankenmuth) when I approached the &quot;S&quot; curve.  Anyone who has ever driven down Sohn Road knows what curve I am talking about. The road curves to the left, dips down and then back up, and then curves to the right.  As I came from the &quot;dip&quot; and started to turn to the right again, I noticed an orange ball just above the tree line beyond the farm field to the left of the road.

It was not moving, or blinking, nor was it making any noise.I thought that it might have been a satellite or something similar to a satellite, so I started to take off down the road again. That is when things got really strange for me. The orange ball started to move too. As I am driving down the road, I noticed that the orange ball is moving with my car. I stopped my car in the road again, and the orange ball stopped too. I said to myself that I needed to get the f**k out of there, so I started to drive down the road quite fast.

While we got jupiter in focus we noticed a couple of its moons and could faintly see a couple rings.  We sit in the lawn chairs and began to talk at how clear the sky was and all the stars we could see.  As we talked my step dad asked me to look at a group of stars and pointed for me to look at the bright one in the center.  It was not Jupiter.  As we looked at it it flashed like a camera had just took our picture.  It never moved and only took 3 seconds to dim again.  This happened 3 more times during the night to other faint stars we looked at.  I don&apos;t know what it was, if it was other objects crashing into eac! h other.  I just know it was wierd to see.  Like someone was taking our picture from space.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provides no contact information.

I called my wife out and she also saw it as it was already passed our house but we both watched cruise North until it was out of view.  It probably lasted nearly a minute for the whole sighting.We&rsquo;ve had rain tonight and I checked the weather and the clouds are at 3,700 feet so it was somewhere below that level but at least 2,000 feet I would guess.  There was no sound whatsoever so I know it wasn&rsquo;t a plane or helicopter.  I called local police to see if they had any reports, he mentioned meteor showers tonight but there was no way that was a meteor, moved way to steady in flight in straight line and height and too slow across sky and below the clouds.First time I&rsquo;ve ever seen something like this and it was most incredible!

A middle cluster of 5 (2 on left side of cluster, 2 on right side of cluster and one that seemed to move around the other 4 making different shapes even a triangle with 3 together).  A lone object was farther to the right farther than the distance of any of the other groupings together.  No noise, very high in sky drifting North.  Immediately in 20 minutes 9 aircraft from MCAS Miramar launched and headed North (usually launch West over ocean).

My parents went to bed and I stayed up to watch TV.  I noticed a bright light outside our front door.  I went to the door and looked out expecting to see a patrol car making rounds, or something to that nature.  What I saw was absolutely amazing.  I will try to be as precise as possible.  The craft was about 200 feet in the air above the field and an adjacent house.  The shape was circular and rotating.  I immediately called my mother in to see the object.  She was speechless.  There was no noise.  There were several lights, however, it was more of an ambient light that what you would expect from a flying craft.  It was not the beam lights from any sort of spotlight.  The craft was at least the size of a football field and was not completely smooth.  There appeared to be several points on the underbelly and even one that lo! oked like a platform.  As we observed it rotating, we called for my dad.  The rear, or what I assume was the rear, came into view as we called for him.  It was different from the rest of the craft.  It was square shaped, and had three large white lights that changed to red.  At that point my mother and I both turned to yell at my dad again.  When we turned back, it was gone.  Just 1-2 seconds that we turned away it disappeared.  I can remember this encounter like it was yesterday.  My mother and I still talk about it behind closed doors.  I had to share this to help ease my mind and see if anyone else has seen something similar.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

I walked out to put the dog out to do business when I glanced up and noticed a star like object.  I thought it was moving but seeing how the mind can play tricks and stars appear to move sometimes  I was really shocked that it really was moving very slowly. It was bright white.

In about 90 seconds of observing, I heard the running of something with the sound of tennis shoes; which suddenly stopped or disappeared as soon as I looked in its direction followed by an evanescent light relation.I noticed in addition, that when I looked at this travelling light in the sky from the side of my eye, there appeared to be a long beam stretching seemingly all the way back.  However, this sight was quickly lost, and could not be seen straight on.  I tested this 5-6 times, and everytime I got the same result.  About 1-2 minutes later, I saw the light qucikly dim.

As I was scanning the sky and watching these &quot;smoke trails&quot; I began to look at a small area of natural clouds, directly overhead but out of the general area of flight of the aircraft, which was one of the very few places left uncovered by the smoke trails and it offered a glimpse of the clear blue sky. That is when I noticed a solid white object hovering in the sky right under the natural cloud cover. It was just stationary in the sky with no movement or sound,Just sitting there as if it was observing all these aircraft which were laying down smoke trails.! It was solid white just the was the same color as the cloud it was near like it was using it as a camouflage.I handed the binoculars to my wife and she was unable to find the object. I grabbed them back from her and I spotted the craft once again. I handed them to her to let her see and she was unable to spot it due to her vision and inability to focus the cheap binoculars. I took them from her again and looked at the craft and it disappeared into nothing. The aircraft made one or two more passes from horizon to horizon and then I didn&apos;t see them again.I believe the UFO was there observing the aircraft as they lay down the smoke trails or possibly the aircraft may have been hiding the presence of the UFO from the sight of the public by laying down smoke to obscure the sky..Whatever the purpose was I know the two were connected to each other..((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I found this interesting and decided to transmit signals using my 2 meter ham radio (ten watts) and a cubical quad beam antenna to see what would happen.   I was transmitting for several nights on 146.520 FM (national calling frequency). I would transmit a series of mike cliks while aiming the antenna about 50 degrees off the horizon pointed at the south southeast direction.  This antenna was mounted on the roof of my van and i was doing this nightly from about 2am to about 4am.  I was also transmitting the audio from a digital timex 1000 program (sounds like a bunch of bees).  Then one afternoon around 3pm I was dialing in Michael savage out of san francisco on my radio shack shortwave radio.Suddenly the series of cliks i was transmitting around 3am in the morning were heard in the shortwave receiver.  The receiver was sitting next to the transmission cable leading to the cubical quad beam antenna on the van&apos;s roof.  I figure it inducted the signal into the small portable radio receiver. I was not able to figure from which night the signals were returned as I had been doing this for several nights.If it was from the night before it would have been about a 12 hour round trip if from 2 nights before it would have been a 36 hour round trip and so on.Then 9-11 happened and since I was sitting across the bay from Naval Air Station North Island coronado I decided to take the antenna off the roof so as not to be consider spying or anything as that.

We both smoked cigarettes and i had decided to go outside to smoke this time.We were on the second floor and it had a railing right outside of our front door and i leaned on the railing with my forearms and lit up my cigarette.I had taken a drag or two when i just happened to look up at the sky at my 2 o&apos;clock position and saw this enormous black triangled craft float overhead approximately 2000 feet up.  The craft moved at a slow and steady pace from right to left.  If it had been a plane it would have fallen out of the sky.The craft made no noise and was PERFECTLY triangular.I yelled for my girlfriend Dana to come outside.  When she came out i pointed to the craft and asked her, &quot;what does that look like to you?&quot;.  She replied, &quot;Oh my god, look at that thing, it&apos;s huge!&quot;.  I was so shocked by what i was seeing that all i could think to do was run in, grab the wireless phone, and call 911.When the dispatcher came on the line i told her this, &quot;I can&apos;t believe what we&apos;re seeing, my girlfriend and i are looking at a huge black triangle floating over my apartment right now!&quot;.The dispatcher, not apparently upset that i called, said, &quot;really?  You&apos;re looking at a UFO?&quot;.  Something to that effect.  I told her i was not kidding that my girlfriend was right there looking at it with me.  I also told her i wasn&apos;t on drugs or alcohol or anything like that.  I was just witnessing an unidentified flying object.She told me there were no other reports of the craft and that maybe i should try contacting Nellis Air Force Base.  She also was genuinely interested in what the craft looked like and what it was doing.She never dispatched any cops or anything.My girlfriend and i then proceeded to watch the craft climb slowly up and away.The craft never made any sudden moves or turns or attempted to speed up until the very end of the sighting, it looked as if it was moving faster as it gained more altitude up and away.That&apos;s my story.  It isn&apos;t the most exciting, but it was a real triangled craft &quot;plain as day&quot; and there is a 911 call out there with my voice reporting it.I just can&apos;t remember the exact date.

The night before an in house officer was shot and killed by intruders.  We were stting in a prefab guard house about 15 ft by 15ft and I turned off the lights so we could see if anyone would come over the outside walls.The unarmed officer sat diagonaly from me in the shack and neither of us could see each other&apos;s faces. (we were both caucasions).  Suddenly the guard shack filled up with a translucent blue light and at that point I could see the other man&apos;s face.   We were both amazed.  I looked up at the florescent lights and they were off for sure.  I looked outside thru the windows and could see no source of the blue light.After the light was gone I called the LAPD, asking if anyone hit a power pole in the area that could cause such a light to happen.  They stated no.  I added this incident to the nightly report and we continued the shift.  I have no idea how this light came to be.  It lasted about 15 or 20 seconds or so.  I did however find that my ability to play the electronic keyboard was greatly enhanced and later i was tested for IQ due to an accident in an armored truck when my attorney filed a law tort.  My IQ had increased from 117 (measured in the USMC in 1959) to 160. To this date I can not figure out what that light was.  I did not see anything in the sky due to being inside the shack.

It was larger then a star but very bright white.  It was far off but seemed to just stay in one spot, like a star.  I took a picture of it but it only came out black as it was still dark.  (later I took a picture in day light but at this writing the white light does not seem to show in the picture)   As day light turned brighter and became full day light, the sky was clear light blue with only the bright light in the sky.  The light seemed to be moving away from the earth. I got my binoculars and then view two separate lights close together.  The bigger light, 3/8 inch in size was on the right and looking with the binoculars the left side had a much small 1/8 inch white light on the left, just next to the bigger light.  With time both had slowly moved 2 inches away from each other all seen using the binoculars.  Looking at the light without the binoculars appeared to be one light.Now this is the strange part, the 1/8 inch light on left appeared instantly with a group of about 24 lights, smaller then the 1/8 inch light, which formed a 12 inch diameter circle.  Inside the circle the 24 lights each seem to be spaced very evenly, like a diamond display or a 4th of July fireworks that spreads out in a designed circle.  That 12 inch circle stayed behind the smaller light, on the left, and stayed at the 2 inch space from the light on the right.  After about 15 minutes both seemed to be moving further away from earth. A little later, the bigger 3/8 inch light on the right then also instantly produced the same type circle with all the arranged small lights only this circle was only 4 inches in diameter.  We viewed this 2nd circle for about 10 minutes along with the 12 inch circle with the small light on the left.During this time the sun was not up, just day light, all clear blue sky when some clouds from the south came and finally blocked the sight of the two white lights.  After the cloud came, we never saw the lights again.The strange part, in summary, were those two perfect circles appearing with the small sparkling lights all neatly arranged.
