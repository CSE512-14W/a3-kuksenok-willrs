["Daylight observation of a fast moving bright circular object below a 10,000 ft cloud level.Driving home from work southbound.  Lots of cumulus clouds.  Cloud bases about 10,000ft.  Visibility unlimited.  About 35 degrees above the southwest horizon a flash caught my eye.  Size: 1/4&quot; circle at arms length.  Shape: Circle. Color: A very bright silver.  At first I thought it was a high flying airliner reflection until it moved / flipped under the dark base of a cumulus cloud.  It got brighter and a little larger then disappeared.  This was a distinct circular object. Not a reflection, not a balloon, not a bird, not a conventional aircraft.  I know aircraft, I was an Air Traffic Controller for 11 years.  The outstanding characteristics of the object was that it was a perfect circle and the color was a very bright liquid silver.((NUFORC Note:  We presume the witness means a time of 16:41 hrs..

We realized later that it was actually moving at a very slow speed, much slower than the planes that were flying that night. It moved from the southwest to the northeast direction passing overhead us. The v-hsaped lights has its pointed part pointing to the east while moving at very slow speed. It took about 4 minutes to pass us overhead. As it was moving, the object was rotating very slowly, too. It completely rotated 180 degrees during the course of its flight such that it&apos;s v-point was now pointing west after it passed overhead. All the time, it never changed it&apos;s northeasterly direction. After passing overhead, it&apos;s speed gradually decrease and it&apos;s lights began to grow dimmer and dimmer like it was going away from us or moving up. There were no clouds that night and it was not like the clouds were covering it making it&apos;s lights to fade. It took about 2 minutes for the lights to completely fade out. When we reviewed the video I took of it we counted about 6 lights total making the v-shaped object. Other people who was there watching the fountain show were able to see the object we were looking at.During the length of observation, there were no sounds heard that would point to the object as the source. There were planes flyng that night before, during and after the sighting. The lights are of one color which is white. The course of flight was straight and constant.", "Silver object following plane formation.This was a sunny afternoon.  The date is approximate.  But it was before the Mt Comfort Air Show at the Mt Comfort airport which is about 3 miles from my house.  I heard the sound of planes coming over the house. Since some pretty old WWII planes come over I wanted to get a closer look. I was on the screen porch, so I went out in the yard to watch the formation of planes go over.  There were 3 planes lined up going overhead.  They were going southeast.  I noticed a silver object keeping up with the last plane.  Then that plane did a turnaround heading back to the object.  When it got near the silver cirle or round dot the object just disapeared. As the planes were going southeast it seemed to keep up to them at the rear.  But when that plane turned around, it held back and went up and disapeared.  I immediately went in and told my husband that I saw something I couldn&apos;t explain.

I looked up into the night sky to see what if any stars I could see when I saw the following:  From my vantage point I could only see the shape of a square bottom surface about seventy five feet by seventy five feet and nine circles in a 3 x 3 grid. Each circle was protruding from the bottom like a squared edged donuts about 5 feet deep. All were the same size and equally spaced apart. The object seemed to be floating above the south edge of the airport at about one hundred to one hundred fifty feet. It moved very slowly across the sky about five to ten miles per hour toward the west. The object had no lights at any point during my viewing. The only way I was able to see any details at all was due to the light reflected from the surface. I felt no magnetic or electrical fields, but I was never directly under the object. As I watched the object float by, I moved to get a better view, it never picked up its pace or altered its altitude. I heard a door open and saw my friend come outside to say good bye to me, I ran up to her and pulled her into the street to show her.She did not see what I saw because as I showing her the object, it became blocked by the trees. I ran futher down the street with her in tow and although I could still see the object, it was hard for her to see it as it had no lights. I ran us back to the house and jumped in my car and tried to follow it but as it was not following a street it soon was gone from my sight as well. I can give no reason why this airport would be of interest because as of now, it&apos;s closed down and a new airport is in operation. The only US Air Force base was just a reserve station at the time and shut down soon after Desert Storm. It became Austin&apos;s new airport. I finally writing about this because I&apos;ve never seen anyone else describe a square object, and I thought someone else may have seen something similar. It has always made me wonder exactly what it was that I saw. I know I&apos;ll never know but the experience was awesome. I keep looking up in the night sky to see what I can find. As for me, I have spent most of my life around US Air Force bases. My father served and I served as well. For the first 28 years of my life I lived on or near a base.I watched SR-71&apos;s lift off from a California base, U-2&apos;s from a Florida base, I was on the Cape to watch a Shuttle launch, seen countless air shows, and once I saw a F-117 take off from a Texas base in broad day light. The F-117&apos;s profile was so strange I thought I was seeing my second UFO, but then it banked I saw the wing shape.My job during active duty was in electronics and communication devices, during my reserve years I loaded aircraft, C-130&apos;s to C-5&apos;s. I like to think that I know aircraft, I&apos;ve built many models and continue to keep up with new aircraft design, as best as an ex-military man can. Generally I know what I&apos;m looking at when I look up into the sky but on this occassion I did not have one clue.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I thought the plane might just be pulling something as a joke, but then I asked myself how could it spin and have lights? I was sure of what I saw after a person fishing saw it and yelled &quot;Look a UFO!&quot; About 15 minutes after I saw it, a orange light shot up behind a mountian in the same area (lasted less than 3 seconds). About 2-3 hours later, I witnessed an object falling and buringing up in a blue flame. I could feel the heat from it and was far away.

The sky was completely clear and free of cloud, and the horizon in my view was the calm Mediterranean Sea to the West of my hotel balcony. The event itself took the form of two intensely bright lights (one a pinpoint and the other a streak or slim cigar shape). Both were located a few degrees to the upper-right of the setting sun. The pinpoint was at approx &quot;2 o&apos;clock&quot; to the sun. The bright streak (slim cigar shape) of light, was situated a few degrees to the right of the pinpoint (also at around &quot;2 o&apos;clock&quot;) with its left end slightly inclined toward the horizon.  Both lights remained stationery and continued to emit an intensely brilliant white light for several minutes, both before and after the sunset. The pinpoint then suddenly dimmed and disappeared.  Approx two minutes later, the streak of light dimmed suddenly and disappeared, leaving behind it for a few millisceonds a brownish streak of exactly the same proportions. However, some ten seconds later, the brilliant streak of light reappeared in roughly the same position (possibly a few degrees to the right), and it remained intensely bright for approx. half a minute more. At this point, the streak of brilliant white light suddenly dimmed and disappearing as before, leaving for a fleeting moment, a brownish imprint of itself against the turquoise sky. Soon after first noticing the lights, I attempted to film them using my camcorder. However, the camcorder refused to give me a clear picture, even though it was switched to auto-focus. I therefore switched it to manual focus, but the image didn&apos;t improve.  Frustrated, I then discarded the camera and decided to watch the event with the naked eye. As a point of interest, my partner Jenny also saw the above mentioned lights and, without prompting from me, she independently described them in exactly the way I have described them to you. I reported my sighting by telephone to the Cyrpus Mail newspaper office in Nicosia on the following Tusday morning (I spoke to a reporter called George).  However, he&apos;d had no other reports at that time. I gave him my hotel address and invited him to contact me if he required additional information.  I had no further contact from him. Nearly three weeks on, I am now back home in England, but I am still deeply puzzled as to the nature of what I witnessed on June 14.  I am a writer by profession, and I&apos;m always keen to get to the bottom of a mystery.

The object had a row of three lights--but we could not make out a shape.

Off to the left, about a mile or two away over some low buildings, I saw what looked like a large, gray, cylindrical shaped object with no wings and no lights that looked like it possibly could have been descending into the airport, going down behind the freeway sound wall after several seconds of observation. I thought maybe it was a blimp that possibly had been flying over the nearby arena, but I called both the Oakland Airport and the Coliseum/Arena today on Monday - and both people I spoke with stated that there were no blimps in the area at that time that they are aware of. The time was definitely 7:53 PM PDT, as I looked at my dashboard car clock and noted the time on purpose. It was just about sunset, and there were some scattered &quot;marine layer&quot; clouds in the area, but these were much higher than the object that I observed. I saw no other traditonal aircraft in the vicinity. I would estimate the object was at an altitude of several hundred to a thousand feet when I saw it and then it descended fairly quickly out of sight toward to the ground at a seemingly sharper angle than a plane would have. Anyone else driving north at that time on 880 would have been able to possibly see it also, so there may be more witnesses out there as traffic on the freeway was fairly busy. This object apparently landed or went down very close to the ground, and it was much too large to have been one of those advertising mini blimp balloons on a string. I didn&apos;t even try to listen for a sound because the object was too distant, and any sound it made would have been obliterated by all the engine noises on the freeway.", "((NUFORC Note:  We believe the witness describes the event quite accurately, but that it was caused by the flash from an Iridium satellite.

We were sitting outside late in the evening when we noticed an apparently low flying yellowish orange light (circle) traveling from a south to north direction. The object might have been within a mile or ess of our position, but it was  difficult to judge the distance or size of the object itself.There was no sound, vapor trail, or navigational lights. We did observe a short time after the object came into view, a jet travelling at a higher altitude and with navigational strobes on in an east to west direction.Midway through it&apos;s path, the light changed. It becamea very bright white light. The source of this seem to begin in the center and then radiate outwardly to encompass most of the sphere. I did see just a small amount of yellowish orange,but the white was more overpowering. It was a bright sharp white light. One might compare it to a car&apos;s bright lights.During this time, the object continued at it&apos;s usual speed and altitude until it vanished over a hill.In the past few years, I&apos;ve seen similar objects going over at low altitudes and from different locales in the region (see reports filed on : 8/3/99 and 3/8/01 in data base}.  There have been a couple other sightings of these in this region since then, but I did not file reports at the time.It was too low to be a satellite, but I did check the Iridium satellite schedule.

It appeared at first to be someone on a parachute, and this formation was quite clear.  While observing the object, I noticed that it did not move.  Therefore, someone on a parachute would be impossible (besides the fact that no one would be on a parachute around there).  It was rush hour, so I assume other people saw this formation.

I have been taking pictures for quite some time with a Sony digital camera. I love to photograph rain storms, clouds, sunsets, and things of this nature. This may seem really wierd, but it is true and I am willing to take a lie detector test if necessary to support my allegations. When I am photographing the sky, the naked eye doesn&apos;t see anything but clouds, rain, and rainbows. But, after I download the pictures to my computer, it is very noticable that their are foreign objects in the sky. They look like oval to circle shape objects. Some look like jets are in pursuit chasing them. The pictures I have taken are always in the eastern part of the sky during the storms. They have been taken over a 3 year span. In most of the pictures, the objects appear and are visible. When blown up some of them look like they could be flying saucers with what could be jets. I live very close to Cannon Airforce Base. I was wondering if anyone is interested in seeing these pictures. I swear these pictures are authentic and untouch photos. They are not super clear in nature and could be questionable, but I would like to know what other people think the objects could be.((FOLLOW-UP REPORT FROM SAME WITNESS))Unexplained objects appearing in my photos taken with a Sony digital camera.The other day I sent information on pictures I took during stormy weather with unexplained images appearing on them. I tried to send you the pictures that were taken, but my i.p. address or mailing client is blocked from your site. So, I&apos;ll try to send them through here. Hopefully it will go. I filled out a form under ((name deleted)). I haven&apos;t actually seen the UFO&apos;s. I like to take pictures of the sky, weather, and nature. I have taken several pictures over the past three years. When I&apos;m taking the pictures, I don&apos;t see anything in the sky. After I download them to my computer, wierd images appear on my photos.  At first, I blew it off as something on the lense, etc. I take these pictures with a Sony digital camera. Recently, we bought a new Sony digital camera, and I got the same results. These UFO&apos;s seem to like the rainy and partly cloudy weather. Especially, if there is a rainbow or light cloud cover. I live in Clovis, New Mexico, and I often take pictures of the eastern sky because that&apos;s where the rainbows appear. I swear these pictures are untouch and there has been no digital enhancements. I find it wierd that they appear in so many different photos. Some look like jets are taking them. They are not clear, but when you blow them up you will be surprised what they look like. I&apos;m just curious if it&apos;s possible that they are UFO&apos;s or space craft of some kind. Lately, they seem to be appearing in my photo&apos;s more and more often. I live really close to Cannon Airforce Base. I&apos;ve been thinking about contacting the base and showing them my photo&apos;s. No one but family members and friends have seen them. I work most of the time so I rarely have time to spare. I&apos;m sending you the photo&apos;s I have taken. They are very credible and I would be willing to take a lie detector test to validate that they are not retouched photos. I hope you enjoy looking at them and you can see what I&apos;m seeing. I&apos;ve shown them to other people and they say there&apos;s diffently something showing up in these pictures. I&apos;m sending you all the ones I have. They have been taken over a 3 year span. I&apos;m including the pictures that look like helicopters in the sky, which appeared right before the other objects. I&apos;ve also included pictures with rainbows showing nothing at first, then changing to the objects appearing, and exiting at the other end of the rainbow. That&apos;s why I believe these objects are real. Some of the picture I had were lost because my computer went down and I didn&apos;t have them backed up.I will check to see if perhaps they might have been saved on zip discs, but I&apos;m sure they were not.

I noticed bright lights in the sky North of my house. Our house is on one of the highest hills in the area and we are at least 20 miles from the nearest city, and have no close nieghbors. To our North is nothing but low lakes and swamp lands that is almost totaly deserted because of rouch geography. In the middle of that rough impassable land is also 16000 acres of wild public lands that are seldom used except for a few duck hunters and some fisherman, but never that late at night, and never in the sky. The object was a group of about 6 lights in a perfect line that appeared to be at least 200 yards long. While watching these lights just sitting in the sky another light came straight down from what appeared to be outer space, and disapeared into the other lights. At this time I called for my family to come out and see. My smaller kids after seeing the lights ran back into the house and hid under the bed, they had just watched Signs. After about 30 minutes the object began to move very slowly to the North, and looked like it was settling over the Lake as it was looking for somthing. We then climbed to the top of our house as the object was sinking lower in the sky and getting harder to see due to the trees. We started filming the object then and and have some footage of it. This was not the first time we have seen somthing odd in the sky here. About a month after moving to this house I walked outside about 2AM in the morning. When I walked out I saw an object at tree top level with red lights around it, and a red strobe light shooting into the trees below. This object was moving about 20 mph over the trees and disapeared over the hill to out east. 2 Nights latter at 3am we saw what looked like a rip in the sky to our south. This by far was the strangest thing I have seen. The rip looked as though it was an opening to another place. Out of this opening flew what looked like hundreds of small objects ! like streemers. We ran in the house for a camera but by the time we came back out it was gone. Another time around December of 2002 my parents who live 25 miles to our north called and told us to run outside. They said they saw a series of lights flying in circular paterns and moving south toward our location. We did not see them at that time but about 30 minutes latter they appeared in the sky to our north. These were round cylinder shaped objects flying in round circular formations around the sky. I have a police and fire department scanner at my house. While watching these lights I heard the dispatcher ask where one of the Sheriff deputys location was, he replied &quot;just sitting here watching the UFO&apos;s&quot;, so many in our area had to see these things. We have also found strange human looking footprints in the mud at the lake to our north. They appeared to be human except for the fact that these prints come out of and lead into thick brush with lots of throrns and stickers. These prints are also way out in the woods, miles from a pathed road or houses. My feet would be nothing but bloody nubs if I did what this person is doing, even the Native Americans wore mocosins on their feet in this area.

There was some generalized fog and there was a cover of clounds above the city. We observed a very dark cigar shaped object move repetitvely back and forth from one end of the city to the other, occasionally dipping into the clouds but never decending below the cloud cover. The object did not appear to be movong fast but it was covering considerable distances in a short amount of time (moving back and forth acros the city in appx 45 sec). The object was signifaclty larger than a plane or helocopter as it appeared in relation to the city scape to be longer than the width of two buildings. The movement, shape and speed was not consistant with any modes of air craft with which I am familiar. The nearest airport is located some distance from the city. We observed the object for appx 10 minutes during which we noted an intersting cognitive phenomenum in which as we ruled out aircrafts that were consistent with our contextual schemata, we became increasingly aware of the unfamliarity of the object.

I looked around to see if there was anybody else seeing this but there was no one in the area. Even if it was a clear nigh I could not see any stars around the moon. Except for this very bright white light. I stood there starring at it for a few minutes before I noticed it seemed to be moving very slowly and was changing color from a white pulsating light to a bright orange then back to white. I ran back into my apartment to get my camcorder and digital camera... I took nine pictures but you can&apos;t really make out anything except a small white dots. But I managed to take about 40 minutes of video before my battery died. I had a hard time zooming in on it because of the moon being so close and so much brighter my auto focus kept zeroing in on it. After my battery died I stayed out there for awhile to see if anything else would happened. It just kept doing the same thing over and over. I then went back to my place to view the tape. I could clearly see on the tape the white light change to a bigger brighter orange light that seemed to pulsate for a few minutes then it went back to the white light and started the whole thing all over again.&hellip;((NUFORC Note:  Probably Mars.

The area (if he is describing it correctly) is smack dab in the middle of military property between Alamogordo and Carizozo. I travel in the relative area quite a bit, and there have been many strange, unexplanable sitings including silent, laser-like light shows in the middle of nowhere, light orbs, and extreme brightness in the middle of the night lasting anywhere from 1 or 2 minutes to an hour or two. People who live in the area complain of unexplainable noise and light disturbances as well as earthquake-like ground vibrations. One siting I can remember quite clearly was about a year and a half ago, I was driving my (now ex) brother-in-law back from Ruidoso to Albuquerque (I lived in ABQ at the time), and we witnessed a WILD laser like show over the horizon in the exact area the caller described. We watched this unexplainable light show for approx. 45 minutes, eventually passing its location and watching it in the mirrors of the car until arriving in Carizozo, in which we could no longer see the area (it was too far behind us). The lights appeared to be only white and very sporatic, but coming from the ground and very bright, lighting up the whole sky around us and extending very far up into and through the clouds. We estimated the distance of the source to be approximately 15-20 acres from the side of the highway. We (the people of Lincoln County) believe there is a military base under ground, but I am not sure, as there is strict security along the gates, and no one can explore what is really out there without military clearance. There are signs along the fences that read &quot;no trespassing, military personnel only&quot;. The local accepted theory is that the military is participating in technological experiments with air craft and laser weapon technology. Some local military personnel I have spoken to have suggested that this theory is real, but they will not say much more than &quot;you&apos;re close&quot; or &quot;you&apos;ve got the right idea&quot;.

I immediately grab my 8 power hunting binoculars and looked at the object. I noticed that the object was metallic, silver and shaped like a cigar.

The witness who is a radiology technician, was driving north on hwy. 6 and looked off to the west and saw 2 objects hovering above a field. She states that the objects were between 30 and 45 degrees above the horizon from her viewpoint. The witness stated she slowed down and rolled her window down to see the objects clearer. Her description is that the objects were disk shaped, and had extremely bright white and red lights that flashed in sequence around the craft(s). Witness states no stars or other aircraft were seen, (This area is within the ATC area for Altus AFB) Altus AFB tower reported no air traffic in the area at that time. The objects were seen for approximately 3 minutes before vanishing, as the witness watched. Weather at the time of the sighting was reported to be good. No noise associated with the objects reported  Witness tried to find a farmhouse to stop at to try to get another person to see these objects, however this was in a very desolate area and she was unable to do so. She did stop and contact 2 police officers in Elk City when she arrived in town, she states she asked if anyone else had seen the objects, the officers laughed at her, and then advised her to contact me.

We had just returned from a day trip to Fire Island and I was on my back porch (lived basically next to 231 a north / south traffic artery on long Island) and I noticed a very strange object flying about 40 or 50 feet off the ground north along the wooded area between my house and 231. It looked like a boomerang and was black and was moving at about 10 miles an hour. There were no jets, windows or lights. The wing was about 40 feet across, but the height (floor to ceiling) was only 4 feet. It seemed to flex a little at one point as if it were of a flexible material. It looked like and was moving horizontally like an aircraft though (not baloonlike). I told my wife to run in and get the video camera. It began to rise vertically quite rapidly at that point. By the time my wife got the camera (abot one minute) it was at about 3000 feet. I began filming the wing. A commercial jet flew past, and it kept rising vertically until it disappeared straight up. The video ran out of batteries before it disappeared completely out of sight. I have seen stealth fighters, as some have suggested this might have been but it was not like any of the ones I have ever seen or read about. The object seemed to turn one wing slightly at one point so it did not appear to be a completely rigid object. Are there man made objects that can behave like this? We have no idea what it might have been. I have not seen the video in many years but if I had to it might be possible to locate it in some closet but this is not a guarantee. The video doesn&apos;t show much detail unfortunately anyway because the sky is bright behind it and the bommerang object is fairly small in the image because it had risen to such an altitude by the time I had the camera running.", "Blinking/fast moving light in clear skyMy family watched the firework display from a local baseball game.  My parents live a short distance from the ballpark, so we were not affected by the stadium lights.  The light show is intense, similar to a 4th of July display.  The sky was fairly clear, stars visible.  After a huge starburst of fireworks, I noticed a light emerge from the starburst.  I thought it was an errant rocket from the show.  But it moved MUCH faster and moved away from the lights emitted from the display.  And much faster than a private plane. It was moving horizontal and staying at level altitude..south to north about 60 degrees in the western sky.  The light was blinking on and off at an inconsistent rate.  When off, a small object could be seen blocking the view of the stars.  It could also been seen moving erratically.  It must have been about 500 to 1000 ft. in altitude because it was cutting through the smoke of the display.  There was no sound AT ALL.  I don&apos;t think it was a charge gone bad because there was no sound and it was not emitting a trail of any kind.  Also, such charges do not fly perfectly horizontal.  My brother-in-law also saw this.  I have an elec. engineering background and have my own business.  My brother-in-law was a technical manager for chip fab at a high tech company.  We were not drinking anything other than water and sodas that night.

We will contact him to inquire on that point.  He has forwarded a still photo to NUFORC, which indicates two parallel light-colored strips of light against the dark night sky, and the (apparent) length of which is approximately equal to the (apparent) diameter of a full Moon.

The witness reported seeing an extremely bright flash of light in the southwestern part of the sky. The fellow then saw a bright white light traveling to the northeast coming from where he saw the bright flash. He mentioned that the light took approx: 5 minutes, traveling to the northeast from where he first caught sight of it in the southwestern part of the sky.  It finally just disappeared. The witness also said the light was very high up, but mentioned it was twice as bright than any satellite. Still another light, not as bright was noted coming from the exact position the flash was observed, but this second light was traveling to the north. No sudden moments were noticed. No sounds was heard, mainly due to the lights being so far away.

About 6:35AM i had just passed outside the village of elbridge,ny on rte 5,approaching the hill going towards camillus,ny. i approached  some high power lines going across the road (near pirro brother&apos;s ford dealership,feeks rd) and i see a large object between the 3 suspended wires. at first i thought it was a large balloon craft,but there was no basket attached. i looked at it trying to figure out what it was? my mind was searching for a familiar object to answer my question. as i got closer to it,i discovered that the object was a &quot;PERFECT TOP&quot; shape(like a kid&apos;s top) and it was a beautiful copper color like polished copper pipe. to give you a idea of the size,stretch your arm out directly in front of yourself and spread your fingers out wide. it was as tall in the sky as the distance between your pinky to your thumb(8-9&quot;high). i estimate the distance away, at 1 mile, and a about half mile high to the right and away from route 5.so,it was quite large. size was very hard to judge because there were no wheels,antennae,pipes,etc,it was just a &quot;DIVINE SHAPE&quot;,a perfect example of &quot;SACRED GEOMETRY&quot;. the most divine thing i&apos;ve ever seen. then,my mind continued inquiring&quot;WHAT IS IT?&quot; then,the hair on the back of my neck started to stand on end. &quot;OH MY GOD,IT&quot;S A UFO&quot;!. this is a very creepy feeling to look at something that big in front of you and not know what it is. it&apos;s very twilight zonish.then my mind said ,&quot;duh!,that&apos;s why they call them&quot;UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS&quot;. at that moment i realized the very &quot;meaning&quot; of those words. i didn&apos;t know if it was a craft,an entity or what.i continued to drive up the hill.looking back and to the right and seeing it. i felt safer driving and watching it,i didn&apos;t feel good about stopping the car and getting out and looking at it,i think i ! was worried about getting beamed onboard. another unusual thing was it was perfectly &quot;still&quot; in the sky,it did not move an iota. anything manmade moves in the sky.this was strange also,i was the only one on the highway that saw it,i kept looking to see if anyone else stopped or slowed down. there were cars ahead of me and behind me on both sides of the road. NO ONE ELSE SAW IT ! . i got farther down the road to route 690 and finally got to work. i couldn&apos;t wait to tell my 4-5 co-workers i knew i could trust in confidence. when i walked in to the office we had a group meeting,with 25-30 guys,so i couldn&apos;t say anything immediately,there were too many guys. during the meeting  a &quot;bizarre&quot; thing happened to my memory. I COMPLETELY FORGOT THE UFO AND DIDN&quot;T REMEMBER IT UNTIL APRIL !5TH. my mind went completely blank for 2 and a half months!  On april 15th,i was home watching &quot;unsolved mysteries&quot; and all of a sudden it &quot;clicked in&quot;,i told my nephew jim that i had seen a large MOTHERSHIP and had never told anyone! i couldn&apos;t believe i had forgotten it for 2 and a half months! i called the state police and reported it,also i wanted to know if anyone else had seen it. no one had. i also called a lady(an abductee) in syracuse that took UFO REPORTS. she told me that my memory lapse was completely normal and that it happens all the time. i didn&apos;t have any &quot;missing time&quot; that i&apos;m aware of. this is not the end of the story. in october of 1999 i met a clairvoyant in border&apos;s bookstore in syracuse,she had just recently written a book on future incarnations called&quot;sparks through time&quot;. i went to her booksigning and lecture.at the lecture i won a free clairvoyant reading from her. i told her i would call her at a later date after i figure out what i wanted to ask. i gave her no previous information. on december 13,1999 i called her and carefully phrased my questions. i asked if she could give me the significance of an incident that happened jan 30th 1995 at 6:35 AM in elbridge,ny. she contacted her guides and paused for a! few moments and then announced,&quot;YOU HAVE BEEN SHOWN THE PRESENCE OF ALIENS!&quot;. i was completely flabbergasted,it was so absolutely true,it just blew my mind she said that! she had verified my experience. she also told me that this was my 3rd experience(i don&apos;t remember the 1st two,it may have happened when i was a kid).but,it was also not my last either,i have others coming up in the future. this is not the end of the story. in february of 2001,my artist friend jack and i went for a ride and retraced the original ride and area so that he could do a painting of the original UFO site. we took many pictures from different angles,i wanted him to capture what i actually saw that january 30th morning. i told jack let&apos;s take a ride to the area a mile away which would have been exactly and directly under the UFO. from route 5,we turned right on lynch rd,went about 3/4 of a mile to the &quot; t &quot; and turned right on to halfway rd(i had never been in this area before). i told jack the that the UFO was still a ways a way and the very next left and half mile up that road would be where the ufo would have been. as we approached the next road,a tingling sensation went up my back and jack&apos;s also.THE NEXT ROAD WE WE TURNING ONTO,WHERE THE UFO WAS, WAS&quot;CAMPBELL&quot; RD(my last name). the topped shape-UFO had hovered over CAMPBELL RD like a gigantic exclamation point pointing the way. jack and i took this as a major sign and and confirmation of what i saw. after i saw this,i never had any doubts about my &quot;vision&quot; and that i was supposed to see this as part of my spiritual growth. this story is the absolute truth as i know it. WE ARE NOT ALONE! harry", "I saw a large black triangular object overhead which resembled a stealth bomberI was in junior high school, standing outside waiting for the bell to ring when I happened to look up into the sky.  I don&apos;t know what drew my attention upwards, but despite the fact that there were hundreds of other students around, no one else seemed to be looking up.  I saw what appeared to be a very large, trangular aircraft.  What interested me was the fact that it appeared to be flying at an extremely high altitude, yet nonetheless appeared extremely large.  It was all black and a perfect triangular shape.  While I didn&apos;t know this at the time, it looked just like the modern stealth B-52 bomber. I listened and could not hear a typical jet engine sound.  It was silent.  It was also moving very slowly.  I saw what appeared to be windows on the bottom of this craft though they could have been tiles.  I watched for about a minute until the bell rang and I had to go to class.  I questioned what I had seen and frankly was embarassed to tell anyone else about it because I thought that they would have made fun of me for certain.  It was all I could think about all day.  The strange part occurred when I got home from school that afternoon.  After I had convinced myself that all I saw was a plane and that my imagination had gotten the better of me, I spotted the Detroit Free Press.  On the front page was a black and white photograph of four or five triangle shaped lights taken by someone in Michigan the night before.  The headline proclaimed that these were unidentified flying objects.  This was too much to be a coincidence.  However, I remained reluctant to tell anyone what I saw becuase I was certain they would have thought I was making it all up.  It haunted me for some time.  However, upon the unveiling of the stealth B-52 Bomber, I realized that most likely what I had seen was a prototype of the stealth or the actual stealth before it was ultimately unveiled to the public.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Now keep in mind that my location is close to sevral airports and military bases, but what I, my brother and friend of 18 years saw could be in no way mistaken for an airplane. It first appeared as a bright steady whitish blue light in the sky to the north. It cought my attension because it was much brighter than any star, especially with the glare of the street lights making most lesser stars not visible. My brother and I watched it for about 3 minutes when It began to blink. In all this time it made no noise and remained stationary. It would blink steadily for about thirty seconds before it stopped and returned to steady light. It did this for about 2 minutes before it abruptly shot upward in a C pattern curving to the left and then back to the right as if tracing a C from bottom to top at a very very fast speed then blinked out and was gone.I wish I had a camcorder.

The next thing I rememebered wss our car being stoped alongside the road and the object behind us turning extremely bright and taking off. When I got home I told my mother what we had witnessed. I was overcome with extreme sleepiness I lay down and went to sleep until the next day. It was approximaly 9pm. One of the things that still puzzles me, is why my ex-husband and I never spoke with each other regarding this experience. years later when my son went to visit him in Kansas he told him that we were not the only ones who were pulled to the side of the road. I do not remeember that. When I was in college I told my physics teacher  regarding this experience and a symbol I kept rememebering. he told me it was a Greek letter and a physics symbol that stood for &quot;electro-magnetic self propulsed&quot;&gt;. There is a few things whcih I seem to rememeber about this night but I have never been able to determine wheather I dreamt them or not....This experienced has NEVER left me and there has been times when I try very hard to rememeber and rememeber....to re-live it....My son who was only 2 at the time kept pointing att he pbject and later rememebered the experience until he was 3 or 4 and then forgot never to regain that memoy again..((name deleted)) Lesemann NY 2203  ((sic--zip codes have four digits.))((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Please read my whole discription.I was driving on a new divided highway heading east at 13:00 hours. There was a large field on my right. I was going about 50 mph and eventualy got up to about 85 mph. I had a glair on my windshield. I think it was a reflection from the craft. When I looked for the origin of the reflection I saw a triangular shaped object about 1/4 mile or less to my right. It was gray in color with out any markings or windows. The craft was going a little faster than I was going and I speeded up to try to keep up with it. The craft moved towards me slightly and banking like an airplane would. That is when I saw that it did not have a vertical tail like an airplane. I followed it for about one mile when it flew over  the crest of a hill which was covered with mature trees. They were about 60 feet tall. The craft was only about 100 feet above the ground. When I got on the other side of the trees it was gone. I turned around and retraced where I had seen it and made sure about my bearings. When I got to my sisters house I told her about it and of coarse she thought that I was crazy. This happened on a Saturday and the following Friday on the local tv news they said that the radar at the Albany County airport recorded an object heading south from Saratoga Springs at over 4,000 mph and made a right angle turn towawds the east. They said that it happened a week before which is when I saw what I saw. They also said that there were about 40 sightings of ufo&apos;s that same day. They also said that it was not reported on the news until the airport could verify that there radar was working properly.

At this time it had retreated back into the cloud and was just a dark spot again.she noticed it right away. As we watched it moving up and down and side to side with no aparent disturbance from the quickly moving storm cloud it became completely visable again. I have no idea how big this was.

The object appeared silvery/white in color and was about the size of a 1/8&quot; BB at arms length. I estimate it was 1-2 miles away at the time, and about 50-60 degrees high in the sky. It was moving slowly to the southeast away from me, and at one point appeared to slow and stop, before continueing to the southeast and fading away in the blue sky. I had it in view for 5-6 minutes and had time to get my 35mm camera and take two pictures using the telephoto setting, which unfortunately is not too powerful. The sky was mostly clear with a few wispy clouds. There was no apparent wind at the time, but about 20-30 minutes after the sighting the wind did begin to blow and I saw that the clouds were moving to the northeast, which is at a right angle to the direction I saw the object moving. My first thought was that the object could be a large balloon but the fact that the UFO appeared to slow and stop, and move at right angles to the wind made me discount this.

I was on the way to an overnight camp in the wilderness with my backpacking class in a car that included my instructor and a roommate. We had left Bradford and were driving along a road that was parallel to the state park we were planning to camp in, and I noticed that there were two small jets (military?) flying at about 5000 ft overhead (leaving small jet trails), and there was a small circular metallic object following closely behind the second jet. I told my car mates there was a UFO and they laughed, but my roommate then checked it out by looking up out the window and confirmed what I saw, and my instructor pulled over to see it. We got out and the object stopped following the jet and hovered above us at about a mile up (not moving for about 5 or 10 seconds) and then within about 1 or 2 seconds slid back to the tail of the second jet. It was far away but we agreed it looked metallic and seemed to be nearly circular but with many edges like a polygon with many (20? or 30?) sides (I seem to remember it reflected sunlight helping me to discern it had edges and was metallic). It left no jet trail and did appear to be able to hover and then accelerate quickly to a speed that was many times that of the jets it was following. They were headed I believe North into the state park which I remember was about 200 square miles of wilderness. That was the last we saw of them. I do remember after returning from the overnight hike, we read in the news that there had been many UFO sightings in NY north of the park at about the same time we saw ours.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It occurred 1 week ago, and at the time, my companion and I were so freaked out that we just drove around and talked about it, making phone calls to anyone we could think of to see if anyone else had seen it. As I was on vacation in Brazil, it was very difficult as an American citizen to figure out who the hell to call in the first place. My friend, a Brazilian, had no idea either. We searched the web the next day but found nothing. I vowed to return to the States and make sure that anyone else looking to see if someone else saw this particular &apos;whatever&apos; could at least have a chance of finding me/this account. I would like to further predicate this report by making the all too common declarations of &quot;I&apos;m not crazy, and this isn&apos;t b-s&quot;. I am a licensed attorney in Florida. My friend is a genius and was admitted to both MIT and Harvard. In short, we are sober, sane, intelligent people not given to mistaking blimps, planes, helicopters, weather balloons, the aurora borealis or gases from deep within the bowels of the earth for what we saw for about 6 or 7 minutes last Wednesday, the 9th of July, 2003 at approximately 11:30 p.m. I hope that someone contacts me to get a better account, clue me in to other reports of this incident,  or to give me a lie detector to find out that we saw something, and I seriously doubt that it was &apos;one of ours&apos;. Unfortunately, it is not as spectacular as being a description with photos or a definate shape. We actually started racing back to the hotel to get the digital camera when we lost it, ore rather it lost us. All I know is what follows: My frind and I had just dropped off his brother at a restaurant in the City of Barra (do Tejuco) about 10 minutes south of Copa Cobana in Rio de Janeiro. We were driving north towards Copa and were about 4 miles south of the tunnel that takes you under a mountain separateing Barra and the Ipanema, Le Blon, and Copa area. It was somewhat overcast, I beleive, at least it was hazy, you could see a pinkish orange haze in the sky reflecting the electric lights of the area below. I was in the passenger seet, and was looking at my friend in mid sentence when I saw whatever it was in the sky behind his head. I&apos;m pretty sure my exact words were &quot;what is that thing, dude?&quot; to which he responded &quot;the mount---&quot; as he turned to look, assuming I was looking at one of the numerous mountains in the area. He never finished the word mountian, instead switching immediately to a decidedly excited &quot;what the f is THAT???&quot;. We immediatley pulled over to the side of the road, in front of a guard gate with a private security guard who started toward us to investigate us as we were hopping out of the car. We immediatley started pointing at the &apos;thing&apos; and he joined us in trying to figure out what we were looking at. More accurately, I was making sure of what I wasn&apos;t looking at, that I was indeed seeing something worth reporting here. Hanging in the sky to our west, in plane sight, was a huge cluster of lights. I apologize for the banality of the description, but as much as we strained to focus on it, we couldn&apos;t see any dark shape upon which these lights would be affixed. It therefore made it very difficult to determine how far away it was, or how big it was. My best guess was that it was about 1/4 to 1/2 mile away, probably about 500 feet in the air. It seemed to be totally silent, but the traffic noise or the direction of the wind could have masked sound. I can&apos;t even say that it was 1 of 100 things, although it seemed to be one object or cluster moving together. It was covered in red and greenish blue lights that pulsed and flickered. Some would get really bright. while others would disappear completely only to seem to grow bright out of complete darkness in almost but not exactly the same place as before. This was a lot of the reason why we couldn&apos;t figure out what we were looking at or if there was more that one. I&apos;d say that there was 40 to 50 of these red lights and blue-green lights in a kind of sideways L shape. The at times seemed totally disjointed, and at other times they seemed to pair up. All around this cluster were another 30 or 40 pure white flashing strobe-like lights. They weren&apos;t flashing in any kind of pattern, it looked more like machine gun muzzle flashes in the dark, only pure white and 500 feet in the air. It was moving slowly north and we watched it dumbfounded for about 5 minutes, when we stupidly figured we could make it the 3 miles back to my friends condo and grab his digital camera. I wish I had sat where I was and watched it more carefully, but it didn&apos;t seem to be in any hurry to leave, or very concerned about being seen. You could see other people along the sidewalk looking at it and pointing to. We hopped in the car and started racing back to get the camera, all the while watching this cluster in the sky. My friend, driving, was watching too, which had me a little distracted because he is a lunatic behind the wheel when he&apos;s watching the road and not racing to get a camera to capture evidence of something we know was not supposed to be there. We weere in the car for about 45 seconds and nearing the U-turn to go back when the lights started popping off. Some would flicker and fade, then come back, then go altogether. The red and green/blues seemed to come together and then go. Less and less of the white flashes were visible. We were coming into a more ligthed area, so I thought for a second that that was the problem. However, as we got into a little bit of a darker area (between us and the cluster) we could see that there were definatley less lights, and withing another 10 seconds we were down to one final white light that was no longer flashing, but pulsed out one final time and then there was notheing but the orange-pink haze and the outling of a nearby mountain. SO,,, am I crazy, is there another explanation, because we are not making this up, and I&apos;ve seen enough of our own manmade stuff to know that this wasn&apos;t.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate, even though the event had occurred less than a week earlier.

I was the driver in my Jeep Wrangler with the top down, so the lights were easy for me to spot.  What was interesting was the position of the lights - they were almost completely vertical. Eventually they became obscured by a tree line and I continued driving for about 5 minutes when I came upon an open field and realized the object was descending.  It just seemed odd and I was curious, so I decided to pull over and try to get a better look at it (much to my friend&apos;s dismay!) As it descended, the 3 lights leveled out and it descended to just a few feet above the ground.  As soon as it was level and was skirting across the field in my direction, one of the 3 lights, the one in the middle, faded out completely as though it had been switched off.  It continued in our direction and it looked as if it would quickly overtake us when suddenly it shot back up in the air, again sideways, the third light came back on, and it seemed to cover quite a bit of distance in a short amount of time heading southeast.  Then, apparently following the same course, it repeated the above...  again it descended in the same field, light went out, came toward us, again it shot upward and sideways, and again headed southeast along the highway.  It did this 3 or 4 times, and then it finally headed southeast and  disappeared fairly quickly.  By this time my friend was freaking out and wanted to get out of there, so we continued on our way.  At first I thought it was a glider of some kind because it made absolutely no noise the entire time.  But I was under the impression that glider pilots generally fly during the day and at higher altitudes, and I don&apos;t think it would hav! e been fast enough to cover as much ground as it did when it gained altitude and headed away from us.  It also didn&apos;t look like any glider I&apos;ve ever seen - it was dark, almost black and it was hard to discern its shape until it was almost right on top of us, and even then if it wasn&apos;t for the position of the lights we may have had a harder time noticing the outline as a sort of flying wing similar to a stealth bomber or something.  By this time my friend was freaking out and wanted to get out of there, so we continued on our way.  I have absolutely no idea what it was, but I always assumed there had to be some logical explanation, like maybe some kind of crop duster, an experimental aircraft, or maybe some crazy guy flying a home-brewed glider in the pitch black of night.  Whatever it was it was wierd.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "It was like someone ripped a pefectly shaped whole in the night sky.My fiancee and I were returning from San Diego and had been traveling North on 85 towards Phoenix, when a bright but complete solid and opaque white diamond shape gradually appeared and then abruptly dissappeared in the sky due west of our driving position.  A train was directly East of us and we had been watching it for a number of minutes because between the almost full moon above it-it was quite beautiful-and not much else to look at in the Arizona desert at night on a long drive. The reason it probably caught our attention was because it was so very very strange and large-larger then the moon is size in the sky.  But what was so incomprehensible is that it appeared like someone or something had simply ripped open a whole in the dark sky leaving a huge opaque white diamond shape, then in just a few seconds-just enough to comprehend somewhat what we were looking at-it slowly but perfectly evenly from the top down disappeared!  It did not fade out-nor just &quot;turn off it&apos;s light-because it didn&apos;t glow, but more like something rolling back up perfectly.  I did not write this report before-because it didn&apos;t appear to be a flying saucer or anything of the more common UFO shapes, and didn&apos;t know if it would fit here.  It had perfectly straight edges-no variance in color or intensity of color and only white.It also did not appear to be 3-D. I have traveled the Arizona roads at night probably about 50 times at least and never seen anything like this.  It was so incredible a thing to see-it&apos;s easier to understand the flight of unknown objects-then wrap your mind around the sky doing something like that!", "Coming from the woods, I saw a UFO very close and it passed over my friend&apos;s house and over me and went into the woods.I was walking from the woods back to my friend&apos;s house. The street I was on was very dark, almost pitch black, my friend&apos;s house up the street was dimly lit. I noticed lights above his house but thought it was a plane, and thought nothing of it. Soon I came to realize that it could not be a plane, it was flying too slowly and too low to the ground for that. The object had lights on it, I did not count them but I am pretty sure that there were 2 red lights and 4 white lights. The object was about 250 ((corrected by witness)) feet from me, and 75-80 feet ((corrected by witness)) in the air. It&apos;s shape was the combination of a disk and a diamond, it could have just looked that way from the angle I was at. I thought of going to get my friend to get another witness but thought that if I did that when I came back with him it would be gone. I was unusually calm for such an encounter. My mouth was open and I was watching and studying the craft in awe. After I dismissed the idea of the object to be a plane I considered it could be a blimp, but it couldn&apos;t have been, it was much too small and oddly shaped. Also, it did not have one sheet of metal over the entire object, it had rectangular silver plates on it. The object flew by me and over the trees across the street from my friends house, I could still see it and it was still fairly close. One thing I noticed what how the craft would go fairly slow, then come to a stop, and hovered there for a while. This was the eeriest thing about the object, on account of how unnatural this looked from any other type of flying machine. Later on I would consider it to be a helicopter, but it did not have a tail or blades, nor did it make loud noises. It did make a noise however, a quiet stealthy humming, as if an engine were in it. After the craft passed over the first set of trees it came to a house across the street from my friends house. It hovered over the house, and suddenly a white light came out of the bottom, the bottom was like a hatch, the light wasn&apos;t like a beam, more like an airplane light. I became frightened for a moment, thinking that the UFO had spotted me just then, but then the light disappeared and the hatch closed. The craft continued on from the house, it was starting to get far away, soon it stopped behind a tree and kept moving. When I lost sight of it, I started to run to the other side of the street so I could see it going over the trees from the right, but I was at my friends house so I decided to go in and get him real quick. I told him to follow me and that I had seen a UFO and he had to be quick, so him and his girlfriend ran outside after me, they both looked very reluctant to really look for the UFO, like they didn&apos;t believe me. I wanted to show I wasn&apos;t lieing about the whole thing by acting completely serious, so they could see I wasn&apos;t really kidding around. We ran down the trail by the house the object had hovered and set it&apos;s light from the hatch out over to see if it was still behind the trees. It was gone, so I went back inside with my friends. No one really believed me and I really regret on not having a second witness with me. My background description is that I&apos;m ((personal data deleted)) intelligent, and very interested in music.((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE FROM WITNESS))I wrote my report a little less than a day ago, it was posted 7/16/2003 and the location is Rolla, MO. I was very, very tired at the time I wrote it, and when I read it the next day, I noticed how many mistakes I had written in the Full Description part of my report.

A daughter and her mother (ages 38 and 58) were driving home to Dubuque, Iowa from a concert in Cedar Rapids, Iowa after midnight on Tuesday April 8, 2003, when a golden-bronze light descended to the right front of their car (the daughter was driving, with the mother in the passenger&apos;s seat) and passed through, and perhaps alongside their car.  (Investigator&apos;s note:  It is important here to note the weather conditions:  Light snow; OVERCAST WITH 1100 FOOT CLOUD BASE; 26 Degrees Fahrenheit; Wind NE 12 mph.)  As the light passed through the car, both witnesses felt unusual physical sensation.  The driver (daughter) felt a burning, tingling sensation along her right side - and felt as if the light, which was a bit to her right, had affected mainly that part of her body, and stated that her &quot;insides&quot; felt as if they were being pulled to the right as the light passed through.  The mother also felt physical sensation which, because of the medication, Oxycodone, which she&apos;d taken an hour before the incident for a condition called neurofibromatosis, she thinks she should not have been able to feel.  The mother saw the light first as it began descending toward the car, with the daughter then able to perceive it as it appeared in front of the car and moved through (and perhaps along the right side) of the car.  (Keeping in mind the 1100 foot cloud base, we at least know that the light would have been below 1100 feet when the mother first saw it descending.)  To the witnesses, the duration of the sighting and passage of the light seemed like no more than perhaps 5 seconds.  The daughter/driver remembers her head whipping to her right briefly as the light passed through.  The next thing she knew she was staring straight ahead at the road with her hands tightly gripping the steering wheel, with the words, &quot;Focus-focus-focus-focus-focus&quot; going through her mind as the car moved along at 55 miles per hour.  She immediately looked at the car clock and saw that it was 1:36 a.m., although neither witness is aware of the ti! me when the incident began, and so the question of the length of the incident goes unanswered.  At no time did the witnesses see a craft, but both of them perceived some kind of energy they find it difficult to describe.  The mother sketches a series of horizontal and vertical marks within the light, and the daughter mentions a kind of swirling, fluid black mist in the light.  Oddly, it was later found that a gold T-shirt purchased at the concert, which had been inside the mother&apos;s bag in the front seat prior to the incident, was now, following the incident, on the floor in the back seat.  Physical effects on the daughter/driver continued to manifest, i.e.: for 3 days her husband noticed the hair on her right arm would &quot;stand up,&quot; with the hair on her left arm lying down normally.  She also had the sensation of heat on the right side of her body, at the same time she felt normal temperature on the left side of her body.  When the daughter related the incident to a friend from out of state, her friend advised her to check her body for marks, and she and her husband noted a puncture mark about an inch below her navel.   Whether this is related to the incident, of course, is not definitely known, but the witness says she doesn&apos;t know how it got there.  About 10 days after the incident, the daughter/driver&apos;s lymph nodes began to swell (Whether this is at all related to the incident is not known; it is simply something to take note of).  The daughter/driver witness has now been to the doctor several times, with blood tests being taken, and nothing found amiss.  The swelling persisted at high level for about 6 weeks, then began to decrease somewhat, although there is at this writing (June 29, 2003) still some swelling of the nodes. After the light had disappeared, mother and daughter say that there remained a golden glow on the clouds as they made their way on the rural highway toward Dubuque, Iowa.  When they came to the Dubuque airport some 25 miles further on down the highway, they noted that the airport lights could not have been the golden light they&apos;d seen because the airport lights were definitely white instead of gold.  Iowa MUFON personnel continue to maintain frequent telephone contact with the daughter witness as she continues to have her health assessed by doctors in her area.((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Iowa MUFON State Director, Beverly Trout, for requesting the case for follow-up, and for submitting the report to NUFORC.  PD))", "flattened black diamond cruises over Denver in bright blue skyI was sunbathing in Cheesman Park in Central Denver (zip code noted is best guess)and decided to skywatch.  Because there was a bright blue sky with the sun almost directly overhead, I was lying on my back with my arms stretched out in front of me to block out the sun.  In this way, I could see all the insects and drifting cotton from the cottonwood trees darting around at different levels.  I watched them for awhile, thinking about how &quot;rods&quot; are photographed using a similar sun-block technique, and wondering how the closer, faster insects would appear on film, and if they were at times mistaken for UFOs/rods.  Above all of this activity, I noted very high in the sky a solid, steadily-moving object flying over from the SW to the NE, directly over me as I was lying in the same direction with my head to the NE.  The object would have been next to impossible to see in the bright sky without looking at it directly. It was a smallish, dark-grey or black flattened diamond, appearing to be about as high as a jet might fly at cruising altitude, its speed perhaps a bit faster and its size a bit larger than a jet would appear at the earlier-stated altitude.    What I found odd was the shape, of course, but also that the length of the flattened diamond was perpendicular to its path!  Also, while periodically there were other planes in the sky, it was completely quiet and peaceful in the park, with no aircraft sounds audible, when this object flew over. The object never changed shape, nor speed, nor colour.  I had to strain my eyes to watch it while it gradually faded as I looked further back, my eyes watching for as long as possible.  I was afraid if I tried to sit up and watch it as it continued off to the NE I would lose sight of it.  I regretted that I didn&apos;t have my binoculars, which I generally carry with me, so that I could have examined the craft more closely.((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to this MUFON member for submitting the report.  PD))", "Low flying green orbsI was riding my motorcycle east when out of the corner of my eye I was a flashing green light.  I turned to my right and saw a green flashing orb of what looked to be a half mile away.  Actually there were 2 or 3 of them.  They were moving away from me but thinking maybe the local airport had some type of runway approach lights I didn&apos;t think too much about it.  A few minutes later I was coming back on the same road and I saw them again.  This time they were on the other side of the road from before and coming towards me.  They passed to the right of me about 150 yards away.  They were about 20 to 30 feet above the ground and were green in color and flashing like a strobe about one flash every two seconds or so.  They looked to be traveling at about 75 to 100 mph.   I stopped to get some gas while keeping an eye on them.  One stopped about a half mile away.  It was hovering and flashing.  After I filled up I went toward it and it started moving again but was gone by the time I got into position.  I called the 911 center to inquire if anyone else had reported seeing these things.  The dispatcher told me no one had called that night but about a week earlier a policeman reported seeing the lights and just as he was about to point them out of a fireman the lights disappeared.", "A bright stationary light in the ski and physical abnormalities shortly later.Hello,  I am a 45 year old semi-retired computer guru of sorts. I do believe that we are not alone in this universe. To many events in the world&apos;s history as well as sightings around the world point to this fact. My Envent: (Don&apos;t know if it is UFO)  Place: In Southeastern Oklahoma Approxiately 30 Miles north of the Texas border and 20 miles west of Durant Oklahoma, United States of America, I observed the following events. Actual Event Description: On a whim I went outside my house and looked to the eastern sky. A bright light &quot;Not Bright White - more like cream in color&quot; was stationary in the ski. It was 10 - 20 times the size of a bright star. Compared with the width of my index finger held 1 foot from my face, the light was approximately 1/8&quot; wide.  It was not moving from what I could tell as I continued to watch this light for some 15 minutes. The intensitive of the light stayed constant. My best unqaulified guess of altitude of this light was 3,000 - 5,000 feet based on aircraft flying at an altitude of 15,000 feet in the area. During the observation of this stationary light in the ski, I said to myself, if you are an alien ship you are asked to land on my farm land, your are welcomed. I did not chuckle as I was serious. Approximately 1 hour later and just after falling asleep in my bed, I was awakened by a quick jerk of my head to the right and some type of pressure was pushing down on my head with just enough force to cause me some panic and then the pressure rolled accrossed the right side of my head toward the top of my skull. It felt like a long loaf of bread was being dragged accross my head but with pressure against my head. This occurred over a very short period of time. What I estimate to be some 2 - 3 seconds and it felt real as if someone or something else was in the room with me. But, I was alone in my room. Shaking and chilled all over, I went back outside and there were clouds throughout the ski and I could not locate the light I had seen an hour earlier. When this event occurred I did not have any unusual stressers in my life. I do not drink or take any drugs of any kind. Nothing. I do work at night as I sleep during the hot days of oklahoma. I will look at the ski ever night from now to see if the light re-appears and will forward any other events of this type. This is the first time I have ever seen a stationary light in the sky as such and never any spirit or ghostly occurances in my house. Although, this house was moved to this farm about 7 months ago. Let me know if anyone else has ever reported any similar event.

I was outside monitoring him ((deleted)) and I happen to glance up in the sky to check out the weather.  It was a clear night and going over the house, at a moderate speed was a HUGE triangular shaped object.  It was going in a North Westerly direction. I knew it was a triangle as it had three white lights on each of the three points.  At the base of triangle (in the middle) there were two red lights.  The lights did not flash nor blink and were on constantly.  No other features could be seen. What was interesting about this vehicle, along with the massive size, was the fact that as it flew over the house, it did not make any kind of noise at all.  As I observed the craft going overhead, I looked around the sky and noticed off to the South West a small plane flying in a North Easterly direction.  I am not sure how far the plane was away but I could hear its engine running.  I could also make out the flashing strobe on the small plane as well as the red and green port and starboard lights. The next morning, I told my wife (she was working nights on the night in question and wasnt home and I also told our neighbors who lived in the upper part of the house...they too were not home at the time otherwise I would have called them out to witness themselves). A couple of years later, I was watching the television show &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; on NBC and they ran a segment on some sightings in Vancouver...a local radio talk show host had seen some strange flying objects in the sky and had mentioned it the next day on his show - he received quite a few calls into his show from other witnesses. I remember commenting with a great deal of excitement to my wife that I was certain that that was the same sighting I had seen though I couldnt remember the specific dates. I have told numerous people over the years and most are interested in the sighting. No one has ever been critical or made fun of my story...I think that bodes positively for my reputation. I have thought often about filing an official report but didnt know where and eventually, I considered the time lag too much to report. While still living at the address where the sighting was, I used to watch large airliners go overhead...they could clearly be heard and were substantially smaller then what I saw flying overhead.  To this day, if I hear an airliner flying overhead (if the weather is clear) I will have a look; I always think back to the sighting and marvel at the difference in sizes. I dont want my personal information to be released - thank you.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was a Junior living on campus in Shasta Hall. I had just arrived at a party one cold night and did not really know many people there. I went outside to the backyard where I stood on a wooden deck. As I was looking up to the very clear, cold, and starlit sky; I saw a faint object out of the corner of my vision. As I looked up and towards my left I saw 3 grey/silver triangle objects exact in size flying in a line, one in front of the other. These objects had no sound, and no lights. They seemed to be in exact distance from each other.They also appeared to be very high in altitude My sighting lasted about 20 seconds before the crafts moved across the sky and then out of sight, behind a large oak tree. Something very strange happend as I was viewing these objects. Everything seemed to go silent as I watched them fly over me. As I remember everything went silent as I viewed them. After they moved out of sight all the party noise(music, laughing, people talking) returned in an instant. I was astonished! No one else had witnessed what I just saw. I felt amazed, confused and a little scared. I had never seen anything like this in my entire life. Later that night as I walked home to my dorm I could not stop thinking about what I saw that night. When I got to my dorm, I went to my friend&apos;s room, woke her, and told her what I had witnessed. Since that night I have only told a few people about my expierience until now.

What stands out the most is how big it was, its bright colour (green), and how fast it was falling before it disappeared.  We reported the sighting to NASA soon after it happened.", "The most critical thing is how fast and the angle it went at before disappearing.Last night I was sitting in my backyard and looked almost striaght up at the stars for a few seconds. As I started to look down again I noticed 2 lights kind of low on the horizon barely moving west. My first thought was it was 2 helicopters following each other at a very slow speed. Since it took a minite or so to come to that conclusion I decided to play a joke on my wife and called her out to see. I just kept looking at them because something was just not right with my conclusion. Mainly because for as close as they appeared I couldn&apos;t hear anything. When my wife got outside and about half way to where I was I told her to stop turn around and look up. She started questioning them right away asking me what they were. Shortly after she got outside it appeared as the first one seemed to have sparks fall from it and seemed to have turned north as if the light came from the front because it became real hard to see so I focused on the second one which kept going west.Then the second one kind of stopped for a couple of seconds and also turnin the same direction the other one did. Since there wasn&apos;t anymore I really focused on this one as the light got further away. This time noticing the direction was north but it also was climbing in altitude kind of like when watching an airshow and watching the plane as it climbs to a point until it stalls, but this kept going. Then the light seemed to disappear and I remember saying it&apos;s gone right as I said that it faintly reappeared and (this is where I really started to question what we were seeing) We both saw it shot up and I mean up and in two kind of swooping motions (the dot of light became a trail slowed down and did it one more time) and it was gone nothing like we have ever seen before nothing. I am 31 y/o and I have alwayed watched our airforce jets as they fly around that are based in Miramar, seen all that latest tv shows regarding the usa&apos;s technology in jets, been to many of sky shows (blue angels) and never seen anything take-off like th! is did. The only thing I can think of is maybe there is a top secret aircraft that nobody knows about except for the select few. For some reason I just don&apos;t think that we have the technology, just by the way we send the shuttle or even satalights into orbit. They go up quickly about at the same angle these did, not even close to the same rate of speed.", "Only one craft, travelled at high speeds, Bright glowing, low humming in UtahMy wife and I were relaxing outside our ranch when the sighting occured. A night on the ranch is usually quiet and calm but not this night as I felt the cattle were a little uneasy. I was the first to witness as the wife was inside making some drinks. It began with cattle bcoming more destressed and as I went to investigate thats when it happened. A low but very clear huming noise coming from northern hills, myself I was feeling alittle uneasy as the cattle were never like this. The noise incresed to an even deeper hum although nothing was visible at this stage. The wind began to pick up and from over the hills came something moving in the distance. A very bright object traveling very fast, it moved over my head at a low altitude. At that point I called the wife. As she arrived I had my eyes fixed on the object, I heard my wife ask what was wrong but then I could feel fear coming over her as well. Our eyes were both fixed on this single disk shaped object which moved off into the distance. At that point I thought our sighting was over but how wrong I was. The craft not only returned in our direction but also reduced its speed. The craft almost came to a standstill about 150metres away from us. The ship just hovered for I am guessing a time 7mins. THe ship then took off at a great speed and then circled back over our heads and that what the lsat we saw before it travelled south.", "I was irrigating forty acres,it was a clear non windy night in July in 93,I was up at the house waiting to turn in the the water into the east end of the grapes,I had about an hour to wait when I looked to the west and saw beams of light fanning over the almond orchard,I didnot think much at first until the lights started fanning over the grapes comeing from about two feet over the trees panning down to about two feet over the vines.At this time I said to my self this must be a sheriff helicopter so I walked around the side of the barn to see where the source was comeing from.From the side of the barn,out of blackness,approximately 200 feet above the ground came the orange beams of light,I couldnot see anything emanating the lights.At this time the beams were about one third the way across the west end of the nad now I knew that this wasn&apos;t normal.I watched the beams comeing at me at about one to two mph.for about one min.when I started to get scared so I went back to the gameroom and looked out the window.After observeding for about two min.I went back around the two the same side of the barn with the same results.So I went back to gameroom and looked out on the event.At this time the five beams were about two thirds across the west twenty and I could see that these were no ordinary beams of lights,for one they were bright orange,two they didnot fan out,they were almost laser like,three,no point of origin.At this time I was scared but entranced so I called my friend to relate what was going on and to go out into his yard to see if he could possibly see anything at his location in Modesto,he said no,I said I would call him back because the first beam was entering the yard,I went and stood at the west side of the barn to see once again if I could see any point of origin just as the first beam struck the barn,to my surprise the beam went threw the wood of the barn(which is solid wood sideing)and the my house to illuminate the neighbors house 100 yards away!I said at this point,good,now the! neighbors will get up and witness these things,but they didn&apos;t.I went back inside the game room to watch,then I said to my self,this will never happen again,get out there so I called my friend back and went outside to describe what was happening.As the first beam came out of the barn I observed that the beam was perfectly cylindric,about five feet in Diameter,bright orange and as it passed over my head it looked as small peaces of paper floating around inside.This was the first of five and I had to go check the levies and this going on.Well haveing no choices I went out to the canal to the east(the same way they were comeing in the barn!) As I drove up on to the canal I looked to the west I could see that the beams were still moveing east at me.The major surprize was to come,as I looked down the canal to the north-west a huge black object,about the size of two football fields moving east also.No lights,no noise.At this point I went back to the road because I was not going under this thing.It was about 1000 yards away from me at the road as it passed in front of me the beams fanned out about 500 feet in front and rear of the object,so as I watched the object the first beams were comeing over my head.I waited until this thing went down the road before I went into the field,and let me tell you I DIDNOT WANT TO GO!Anyway these lights reappeared three months later,no &quot;ship&quot; just lights over my back yard in Delhi Ca.and they were up much higher,about 2000 feet but cars on hiway 99 were stopping on the side to look at them.At this time there was ten spikes of light.I see these things about three times a year and it&apos;s only one at a time,I wish to know of anyone else has seen things,I wish I had called the police on the first time and had a witness to my story.I tried to write Siteing show but no response.

Nothing special, while playing in the car, one of my friend judt looked outside the window. Accroding the him, he was just simply look outside. He saw something outside. It was a egg shape plane. So bright. The special is, the egg is not moving, it was stop near the ground. Later on, 2 more egg shape come from the sky. But these 2 is not so bright. It was just a little bit brighter then star.

We so surprise. We dont have enough time to take photo even thought we have camera.", "I received a telephone call on the UFO Hotline this morning from a gentleman who resides in Verdun, Quebec. Before he went on to tell me his story of what he witnessed, he first wanted to make it clear by telling me that he is a well grounded fellow. On the odd occasion when with a group of friends someone might bring up the idea of UFO, or that they may have observed one. The witness told me he would walk away and talk to some else, not believing there are unusual flying crafts out there. In other words very skeptical about the whole issue. The man now explains to me that he has been re-thinking the whole idea after what he saw, which was very strange indeed. On July 7, 2003 at 10:30 p.m. the witness took his dog out for a walk last Monday evening. He reached the corner of the street he resides on, heading towards the park which is across the street. Running diagonally from the witness, just above the streetlight poles at approximately 40 to 50 feet high the witness described seeing a Smokey gray colored object traveling slow over top of one of the homes in the area. He went on to say he had a good look at it due to it traveling slowly. The fellow described it as being approximately 25 feet in length with the head of it being wider than the tail and traveling maybe 10 miles per hour. The fellow also mentioned that it was not a bird, because he had such a good view of it as the sighting lasted for approximately 5 to 7 seconds. The witness said if he could sense anything about the object was that it had a slight whirling sound coming from it. (HBCC UFO Note: When I heard about the sound in which I object was making, I then asked if his dog took any notice of it, he said no). He went on to say he couldn&apos;t be 100 per cent sure the sound was coming from it due to the sound being so faint, but he was pretty sure. This sighting, he said stopped him dead in his tracks. The fellow mentioned that normally on his street folks sit out late when it is really nice out, but this evening of the sighting he said it was oddly quiet. The witness said, what I saw &quot;I could not explain&quot;. I would like to thank the witness for reporting their sighting to HBCC UFO.

The Record Courier in Portage County and the Akron Beacon Journal in Summit County.  Sorry I didn&apos;t keep the clippings. My 10 year old daughter and I were departing my parents hillside home after a tremendous blizzard had layered three to four feet of snow over the ground.  As we pulled out of the driveway onto the street I looked back up at the house marvelling at the clarity of the sky after such rotten weather, and saw a small bright white light descending slowly toward the horizon.  I stopped the car and pointed it out to her, thinking it might be a shooting star, but realizing at the same time it was traveling too slow...appearing to be a controlled approach. As it approached the treetops it decelerated more rapidly and the bright white light took on an increasingly blueish tinge that appeared as a ring of light below the craft.  It slowly settled behind the treetops probably not more than 1500 feet behind the house in a woodsy uninhabited area that we used for riding horses.  There was a large treeless hill back there which must have been where they landed. I was late getting home to fix dinner so I didn&apos;t return to my parents home but drove straight to mine in Twin Lakes.  I immediately called my parents and spoke to my mother telling her something landed behind the house and to send my teen age brother out to investigate.  She just laughed and said he wasn&apos;t home.  I said send pop.  She said no way will he wade through this deep snow.  In my frustration I didn&apos;t think of calling the police.  Rather I called a reporter friend, John Fowler, of the Record Courier, and asked if he&apos;d had any other reports of a similar sighting.  He also laughed (I&apos;m getting used to it by now) and asked if I was sure it wasn&apos;t the moon.  (Note:  I am a licensed pilot and have several other sightings at various times).  When I assured him I knew the difference between a controlled craft and the moon he asked if he could report it in the paper.  After all this laughter I acceded but qualified it by saying just don&apos;t use my name. (I was running my own business at the time and there are closed minded people you know!)My little news article appeared on the front page the following day headed, &quot;Twin Lakes Woman Sights UFO&quot;. The following day, as I picked up the Beacon Journal and read the front page report in the local section of large numbers of people in Shalersville watching a large cigar shaped mother ship hover over them for over an hour at the precise time I saw the scout ship, I wondered how John felt missing out on that news?  Those folks watched the scout ships leaving and arriving the mother ship, entering and exiting. What puzzles me is the total lack of reporting on the investigation of incidents such as these.    We all know the famous case of the sheriff&apos;s deputy from our County Seat...Ravenna, Ohio, sighting and pursuing a craft into Pennsylvania for a couple of hours chase.  That poor guy, when he tried to provide the information he had at hand, was ridiculed and eventually lost his job...and maybe even his sanity.  I understand he had lots of problems in his life thereafter. You can check on my report through the newspapers&apos; microfiche files.  Sorry I&apos;m not positive about the date. It&apos;s approximate.  I have other sightings and experiences that occurred at different times and other locations if they would be of interest.((NUFORC Note:  Witness is currently a very experienced pilot.

It was a foggy night and all of a sudden we saw bright neon green lights (beam-like) flashing from the sky. They were linear, and went in different directions (diagonal, horizontal) and were very long (over 100 feet long) and high up in the sky (like the height of a plane).  There were about 6 total, lasting approx. 3 seconds each.((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the beams could have been generated by a laser-based advertising light.  Just a guess.

The object was in site for about 10 seconds and it did not make a sound. Furthermore, there was no vapor trail. It was traveling east to west, but not traveling toward the setting sun: rather it had the sun about 15 degrees off its right side.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

This event took place in Vista California somewhere around 1955-1958 when my father was around 10 or 11 he said.  They were listening to an Oceanside Ca, radio station called KUDE AM, when it reported a huge cigar shaped craft motionless above Oceanside.  When my father and grandparents got outside, they said the craft was gigantic.  my father estimates the craft to be at least 3 miles long and 1/2 mile wide.  It was bright orange almost neon, and appeared to have some sort of structure to the bottom.  several spaces along the bottom were black and square like in appearance.  the radio was reporting that some fishing boats and commercial shipping were reporting the craft to be approx. 1 mile off the Oceanside pier.  after 10 minutes of observing  the craft, 10-15 small craft which were described as looking like bright stars, emerged from the bottom and began flying all around the cigar shaped craft.  This went on for about 6 or 7 minutes, then the smaller craft docked with the cigar shaped craft one at a time.  Then after a few more minutes, the cigar shaped craft began to slowly gain altitude and then as if a light had been switched off, it was gone.  Not one word of this was printed in the papers, or discussed on the radio the next day  My grandfather worked on B-24&apos;s and B-25&apos;s during WWII, and was later a manager at a local drug store. My grandmother installed and repaired radio equipment on B-17&apos;s during WWII, and worked at the same drug store as gramps. My Father was with the 101st Airborne in Vietnam, and is now an ((deleted--medical)) technician. I have over the years been intrigued by this sighting and have been largely unsuccessful in finding out any info.  I hope by reporting this, someone will come forward.

In the corner of my eye as I was in the barn I saw some kind of craft, but not taking much notice I continued my job. What really got my attention was the high pitched noise that followed. I came out of the barn to investigate the noise and there it was. About 100m away the craft I had seen before, A perfectly shaped egg or sphere. The craft had no markings, It was just a white shpere but it did make a ear peercing screech. The craft remained at that distance for a few minutes before moving off slowing over the hills to the east. I was always a sceptic about whether other life existed but now I know for sure.

The day was bright and sunny, with a blue sky and fluffy clouds.  The temperature was approximately 70 degrees.  It was a breezy day. Upon exiting the store, I glanced across the 4-lane divided American Legion Highway toward the small Getty gas station directly across the highway from the donut shop. My attention was immediately drawn to a solid black sphere, approximately the size of a large beach ball (about 5 feet in diameter) traveling no more than 30 feet in the air, coming from the direction of the Bell Circle traffic rotary. It was traveling in a straight line, at approximately 20 miles per hour, and its path was located behind the Getty station, heading in the direction of the 11-story Comfort Inn Hotel which is located just past the Getty station, if one is facing in a northerly direction in front of the station. At first glance, I thought it was a child&apos;s large balloon, but the day was very breezy, and this object was traveling in a straight line, never once fluttering or wavering in its flight toward the gas station. The object was a dull, solid black in color, with absolutely no protrusions, or any other type of irregularities on it&apos;s surface... it was just a solid, dull black sphere. As I watched the object, it continued its straight-line path toward the Comfort Inn Hotel. The traffic was light on the highway, and with the absence of vehicular traffic noise, I noted that I could hear no sound at all coming fron the object. As it approached the Comfort Inn Hotel, its altitude was at about the 3rd story level, and as it got closer, it began to climb at approximately a 50-degree angle until it cleared the roof of the hotel, at which time it leveled off for a few seconds, then began climbing again at the same angle. To get a better viewing angle, I crossed the highway and positioned myself directly behind the object, and I could see that it was still traveling in an absolute straight-line attitude, with a total absence of flutter or wavering, even though the tree branches and foliage were swaying with the breezes. The object once again interrupted its climb, and began to descend at an approximately 40-degree angle, heading for the roof the New England Confectionary Company (NECCO Candy) building, located in the next lot north of the Comfort Inn, again if one is facing in a northerly direction next to the Getty station. When the object came within 15-20 feet of the roof of the NECCO building, it again leveled off and traveled along the length of the roof, until it cleared the building. At this point, the object once again began to climb on its 50-degree angle, in its straight-line attitude, heading for a large cloud.  It&apos;s speed never wavered from the approximate 20 miles per hour it was traveling when I first spotted it. Still behind the object, I watched it climb toward the cloud until it was no longer visible. The time-frame from when I first spotted the object, until it disappeared from view was approximately 1 1/2 minutes, as best I can recall. There were no people on foot in the immediate vicinity, and no people in the few vehicles going by seemed to notice it, even though I was quite conspicuous in my observation of it, even pointing toward it to try and get the attention of someone in one of the vehicles.  As far as I could determine, I was the only one on the highway who saw the object, but I&apos;m positive that someone MUST have seen it as it flew over the always-busy Bell Circle traffic rotary. I passed the rotary on my way home, but could see nobody on foot who may have seen the object. To say that what I saw that day was strange and very highly unusual would be a monumental understatement!  It was a very exciting thing to see, and I can say without a doubt that this was no beach ball, child&apos;s balloon, or ANY balloon for that matter. This object, or craft, ot whatever it was, seemed to be intelligently controlled, in my personal opinion. An exciting day in my life, and one that I&apos;ll never forget. I assure all of you that this story is absolutely true.((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes self as working in an industry that requires a substantial technical background.

It couldn&apos;t of been an airplane, because it was too far away and it was going too fast. My friend and I were terrified by the experience, and we still are to date. It was really light out. Most of my friend don&apos;t believe us, but even though we are 13 now, it still haunts us to speak of it.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I noticed what I thought was an airplane moving very fast across the night sky, I followed it because it was moving so fast and there were no blinking lights on the bottom, when all of a sudden it stopped and moved in the opposite direction. It did not make a banked turn, it stopped and backed up. Then the object started to do circles in the sky, and sharp 10-15% turns. I watched for a while, then I got scared and went in the house.", "What was that cigar shaped object ?It was a very clear night at about 10:10 p.m. and I was hungry.  I decided to go to an Circle K store which was nearby where we lived.  Without disclosing exactly where I live,  all I can say is that I live nearby Mountain, on the south side.  When I went outside to my car something attracked my attention that I thought it was an helicopter hovering low.  We get many helicopter rescues due to people climbing this Mtn. and they either get stuck or fall and injure themselves.  I looked up at this cigar shaped just hovering there, the lights of the object had attracted my attention and it was hardly moving at all.  There were pinpoint lights alongside of it enough to show that it was a cigar shaped.  I watched it for at least ten minutes if not more, trying to make sense of it, and to make out the exact location of where it was hovering over.  It was hovering North of the Mtn., seemed to be at an height of at least 800 to a thousand feet.  I&apos;m not good at distances but it was close enough for me to rule out that  it was not a plane, helicopter, hot-air balloons and a blimp.  We get blimps flyover during certain times of the year depending on the events.  We have airliners flying over and the airport is about 2 1/2 miles south of where I saw this object.  As I watched this object I observed some of the pinpoint bright lights sometimes flickering.  At the ends of the cigar shaped object there were slightly larger red lights.  It never moved, made noise, it just hung in there the whole time I watched it.  The lights around where I was did not interfere my sight since my house lights were off and the street lights are a distance away.  Then suddenly at about at least during the ten minutes I was watching it .. it just took off upright toward the sky so fast and but it seemed like it just disappeared as it zoomed off.  I went to the Circle K and there was a man standing at the corner of the store, staring at the same area where I saw this object.  I ignored him and went inside the Circle K store! After I bought some items and came outside, he was still waiting at the corner still looking up at the sky and my car was parked next to him.  He was very quiet and seemed a bit shook up.  As I was starting to get into the car the man asked me if I had seen anything strange.  I asked him why do you ask me?  He said he&apos;s familiar with me since I come to the store often, and assumed I lived nearby.  I asked what does that have to do with my living nearby.  He said &apos;you had to have seen it, you just gotta have to seen that thing, it was just there and then it took off&apos;.  I told him, whether if I had seen it or not, no body would believe it anyway.  I admitted I did see it but I didn&apos;t go into details, I just got into my car and went home.  All that night, I laid outside in my lounger, watching the sky, wondering if it&apos;d come back which it didn&apos;t.  I know what I saw was real but I can&apos;t explain it since of all the airliners, blimps and hot air balloons I&apos;ve never seen anything like it except, last week I was watching a TV show and it was about UFO&apos;s.  I was shocked to see the portion of the show where the daughter (in Colorado) goes outside to play and she saw this cigar shaped thing in the sky, called for her father, and he had video taped it.  The object I saw was so similiar to that object seen in Colorado, except it was closer.

I said to myself I&apos;m going to bag a UFO tonight. Watched planes flying around the valley&hellip; all had blinking, or strobing lights.

Ah, what&apos;s this? It stopped moving. Now its moving again but swaying&hellip; swaying right, swaying left. It stops. It goes down (relatively speaking from my LOS), sways right, sways left, goes back up and continues on its pathway toward W. Now it turns, not a sweeping turn, but a sudden 90-degree turn. It does a maneuver around a fixed star (again relatively speaking), and continues on it way, now in the southerly direction. Eventually, it fades from my view.

It was already warming up that morning as we had been experiencing over 100&ordm; days, and there wasn&apos;t a cloud in the sky. The object caught my eye because of its intensity. I thought it odd that a light could be so bright during the daylight hours. As I pulled out to exit the store parking lot and get on the street I lost sight of the object momentarily as there was a building in the way. Once on the street and proceeding in a westward direction I again was able to see the object that appeared to be heading in a north to southard direction. The speed reminded me of a helicopter that is very common to the area whether they be a news helicopter of sheriff&apos;s traffic helicopter, i.e., it was moving slowly. I wouldn&apos;t guess the altitude, but it was lower then the commercial jets seen coming and going from the Sacramento Airport.

The fireball had a diameter of about 10 yds with trailing flames some 60-80 yds long.  It then flew directly over the highway at Bozeman Pass (the pass has an elevation of 5780 ft) by not more than 1000 ft.  It then rose in the sky at a low constant angle to disappear in the distance in not more than 10 seconds. The fireball covered a distance of 1-1/2 miles, measured with vehicle odometer, in an estimated 2-3 seconds, suggesting a speed in the range of 1800-2700 mph.  It was silent.  The speed of sound is about 750 mph.  The fireball should have produced a loud sonic boom. One possible explanation for the oft-reported silence of UFO&apos;s might be connected to the incredible accelerations and decelerations of which they appear to be capable.  Some witnesses have claimed UFO&apos;s make no-radius 90 degree and even 180 degree turns at speeds estimated in the 1000&apos;s of  mph without decelerating at all.   The g-forces involved must measure at least in the 100&apos;s.  One possible way to protect the crews from these maneuvers is an anti-gravity system, perhaps in the shape of a torus in the rim.  If such a system existed, it might be omnidirectional, that is, it might have the same intensity outside the craft as within.  Hypothetically it could be so powerful that it could repel air around the craft.  In otherwords UFO&apos;s may fly in a self-made vacuum.  If this were true the craft would not contact the atmosphere and could not produce a sonic boom.  Other advantages to such a system would be the absence of heating by air friction when flying in the atmosphere at high speed, and the repulsion of smaller objects out of the path of the craft when flying in deep space. If a torus did exist in the rim of a UFO, then a possible structure exists for a propulsion system.  (I am not suggesting that an anti-gravity system and a propulsion system are the same, only that they may be in close proximity and possibly share the same structure.)  Cyclotrons require a torus.  One account of the vimana or flying machines of the gods in ancient Indian tradition that I read stated that the machines had mercury in them.  So we are talking about a cyclotron which spins up a mercury plasma to a relativistic velocity. Thrust occurs when mass is lost at velocity from a vehicle.  We are all familiar with rockets ejecting hot gases to produce thrust.  There is nothing in this definition of thrust which requires the loss of matter.  All that is needed is the loss of mass.  When plasma at a relativistic velocity decelerates it loses mass at velocity.  It may be mathematically derived mass based on relativity but it&apos;s still mass.  If this deceleration occurred in a vehicle such as a UFO it ought to produce thrust. Suppose a UFO is headed north.  If the torus in the rim had a shunt come off of it pointed south, then plasma might be directed into the shunt, where it could be decelerated and produce relativistic thrust.  Perhaps then the shunt loops back into the area of the cyclotron where the plasma in the shunt could be accelerated to the operational velocity of the plasma in the torus, at which point the shunt rejoins the torus and dumps its contents into it.  In this way the plasma could be used over and over for propulsion.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Please see other report from San Diego for December 29, 1995.

It was a warm night, there weren&apos;t any clouds in sight, and the light pollution was low. I was looking for Polaris, the North Star, by following the stars Dubhe and Merak of Ursa Major. I was having difficulty finding it, and I blamed this on a stray cloud, even though it was a clear night. Suddenly, something caught my right eye and I realized that a small pinpoint of light was moving across the constellation Bootes toward the area I had been searching earlier, to the North. At first, I thought it was a shooting star, but I continued to watch it and it did not fade or disappear. I knew it was not an airplane, either, as it was far too high in the atmosphere. It was about the size of a small star, and had a reddish glint to it. As I watched, it made its way across the sky, then disappeared from my view once it got too low to the horizon. I shrugged this off, and continued to stargaze. But it hit me as a real shock when I realized that there was another one, following the same Northern path in the sky. I watched this one, and then a third, for it appeared shortly after the second.

We were thinking you know, that satellites don&apos;t fly in formation do they? They seemed to be going too slow, it took a full 5 minutes for them to traverse the piece of sky we were looking at, which was limited due to surrounding trees. If you held your hand out at arms length and measured the distance between the three objects with your fingers, it was  about an inch between each of the three lights making a triangle. That would translate into a great distance relatively speaking. There were definately 3, I could see between them as they passed stars.Just before they got to the trees and left our sight, a real satellite shot from the north and crossed their path and proved beyond a doubt that the three objects were way out in space, because the satelite was between us and them, and infact was rediculously close to us in comparison to the  UFO&apos;s.

it&apos;s not smoke. i just keep asking him this. i suddenly see a small perfect rectangle in the sky.and directly off to the right the &quot;smoke was somewhat visible still.but oddly it had became a burnt orange color.fading from a see through grayish color to this orangish color. i began raising my voice some because of the small rectangle opening, my friend notices more the color changing area off to the right.i see what i thought was a bird.so i point up ,because he could not really distinguish the rectangle opening.mind you, my story is becoming longer,like this was a great span of time.but actually only about a minute has passed .so we are kind of a little in disbelief that we are seeing something ufo-like.i point to the bird object and tell him to look close.he half leans towards me to follow where my finger is pointing. and he kind of stretches his neck forward as you do while straining to look at something far away.then the &quot;bird dissapeared into the rectangle opening.i don&apos;t know that he fully can swear ,like me, on seeing the opening.then the opening was gone.immediately the orange color to the right appeared off and on for about a half second at a time.shimmering is how i&apos;ll describe it.there was no more grey/white smoke at this time.it was large orange object then the blue sky behind it.back and forth.this happened for about 6 seconds. then the sun reflected off of an object.my friend really lit up.at first he was passing it off as smoke,non caring at all.we all know any ufo sitings are generally at night.and i have never seen any unexplained anything.so i was unsure it was anything either.he exclaimed&quot;wow.thats a big parachute&quot; it looked like material of a parachute or a hot air balloon.the sun suddenly reflected off of the object for about 4 seconds.the best way to describe it.s shape is the size and shape of the large sail on a pirate ship.as if we were veiwing it not from the front,as to see its full width,more as if you wear looking at a boat sail from the side. it dissapeared again.shimmered 2 more very brief times.then the smoke gradually appeared,but less visible this time.and it slowly moved away for about 10 seconds and the smoke gradually dissapeared in about 30 seconds,we saw no more.meanwhile the planes are still buzzing the general area.i have thought about this near every day.i have told about three people in my family,because they had told me of some things they had seen.my sighting of this object,i have been trying to compare with other sightings but to no avail.my friend is non believing in anything he has no immediate answer for.i have been trying to find any other ufo story similiar to mine to try and figure out more what i saw that day.i&apos;m leaning more towards a government type of project.due to the show i have seen on invisible clothing on tech tv.and the new 007 movie with the invisible car.because the object had same type of appearance about it. in both of these instances,cameras projected images gathered from surrounding area of object and project it onto the item to make it appear invisible..also the movie with eddie murphy and the olsen guy.where the bad guys were selling the top secret jet that was invisible,for transporting the nuclear weapons.a chamealion type of cloaking device.i realize these are movie tricks.but to describe the appearance of what i saw in real life.i&apos;ll use those movies to create a visual for you.that is it.i hope to read some accounts from others who may help shed a light on this sighting i had,of an unidentifiable flying object.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

What we both thought was very odd was how the object sailed all the way across the sky in about 30-45 seconds and than dissapeared and ended up turning around while repeating the pattern 5 or 6 times. then all of a sudden it came really close to the ground and paused for a couple of seconds. when it came down close enough to see, it for a minute looked like a plane  but then i noticed running lights: red and orange.

As I watched it for about 30 seconds it began to moved to the Northwest and very quickly became smaller and smaller until it was not seen anymore. It was gone in about 10 seconds.

I even saw the silver color hit the ground at the ridge. Therefor, I say it was 2 that i saw, though not at the same time. seemed like one came and the other left.

It came directly overhead and hovered completely silently for 3 minutes.  It was a clearly visible disk, 20-foot diameter, with multi-colored lights ringing the underside.  Then it tilted and revealed its top side, which had a solid white light ring around it.  Then it flew away continuing in the direction it had been moving, rapidly accelerating until it was out of sight within a few seconds.  I would estimate the speed to be greater than that of a conventional jet. Several people in the seats around me also witnessed this and all believed it to be a UFO.

The weather was sunny to partly cloudy. I stopped the engine to the car and could hear what I thought were fighter aircraft maneuvering overhead and possibly practicing &quot;dog fighting&quot;.  We hear that on occasion in our area.  Then I heard something different. What I heard was a distinct and momentary whooshing noise.  The tone of the sound was in such a low frequency range that I &quot;felt it&quot; as well as heard it.  Indeed, I thought that maybe one of the aircraft was in a flat-spin and was plummeting toward the ground. I remember thinking, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if the aircraft wasn&rsquo;t going to crash.  Indeed, I was anticipating an explosion.  I paused for an instant after getting out of the car and wondered if it was headed for the ground how any one could get out of the way. The lower frequency sound stopped.  I began walking toward the main entrance of the Credit Union but could still hear jet engines.  So I stopped to look up.  Most of the time when you hear jets maneuvering in the day you can&rsquo;t see them but I looked up because of odd initial sound I had heard. What I saw first was a disk-like object suspended just between a high cumulus cloud structure but above the mountain ridge.  I estimate the altitude of the object to have been at about 600 feet.  The object was at least &frac34;&rsquo;s of a mile away (SSW) from where I was standing.  The profile of the object&rsquo;s shape reminded me of an aluminum garbage can lid.  It was a dull aluminum color rather than bright and shiny. Momentarily the aircraft, I believe it was an F-14 with its wings extended, appeared out of the bottom of cloud cover in a relatively tight nose-down turn.  Within a second after F-14 came out of the cloud cover the disk-like object vacillated or vibrated from side-to-side for an instant and then flipped on its side.  There was a brief flash of light that came from the disk when it flipped to its side (like the sun&rsquo;s reflection bouncing off of glass). As the F-14 straightened up from its nose-down attitude, I had a brief instant&rsquo;s view of the aircraft&rsquo;s profile and a clear view of under-belly of the disk (it appeared as a circle).  The disk suddenly disappeared and appeared in another location (about 15 to 20 degrees to the left of where it was &ndash; but at the same relative altitude) but the disk had shrunk at least half in size.  The re-sized object looked darker and more cylindrical.  I didn&rsquo;t actually see the disk travel to its new location although I was looking right at it.  The entire change in location and size occurred in a time frame that was less than the blink of an eye. The F-14 leveled out and vectored toward the disk.  The object, as if in response, simply shrunk further in size and vanished.  I saw motion whatsoever.  The object neither moved up, down, right or left.  The object simply disappeared as if a rheostat was &ldquo;turned down&rdquo; on the image.  Shortly thereafter I heard the sound of the engines of the aircraft that had been throttled up in pursuit.  I also heard the throttle down &ndash; as there was nothing left to pursue. I don&rsquo;t know what the disk-like object was.  However, I&rsquo;m 100% certain it wasn&rsquo;t operating under the same rules of gravity under which we operate. (I heard the aircraft for more than 20 seconds but only physically observed them for 10 seconds or less)  I went into the Credit Union, stunned.  I told the lady behind the counter what I had seen.  One of the ladies next to her said, interrupted and said, &ldquo;What did you see?&rdquo;  I told her.  She said, &ldquo;I heard it over the speakers&rdquo;. I will NEVER look at the sky again in the same way.  Everything that I knew about physics and aviation went right out of the window with what I observed today. I&rsquo;m now forced to reassess all that I knew to be real.", "Object over Lake Ontario - Toronto areaJuly 12, 2003  My wife and I were eating our dinner this evening at a restaurant at the corner of Renown Road and Dundas Street West (northwest corner - just about 1 block east of Kipling Avenue)in former Etobicoke, now part of Toronto. We were sitting at a table facing an east window. I was sitting in a south direction.  The window was quite large and I was enjoying looking out the window in a southeast direction towards the lake. Between 6 and 6:30 pm, I noticed in the distance, in this same southeast direction, over the lake a hot-air-balloon-type object or a blimp-shaped object.  Sometimes, it even looked eye-shaped or oval-shaped.  It didn&apos;t look a plane.  It caught my attention because it seemed to stay stationary for a number of minutes. I asked my wife what she thought and she agreed that it didn&apos;t look like an airplane.  I was keeping an eye on it during our dinner conversation.  I noticed that it moved slowly eastward and out of view due to a southeast building a couple of times, then back into view.  Again it appeared to stay fairly stationary for a few more minutes.  Eventually, it moved westward out of my view. I sent an email to the Toronto Island Airport this evening to find out if maybe there had been a slow-moving object over the lake towards the Etobicoke area of Toronto around this time, but I haven&apos;t received a reply. It was dark black to silver colour against the clouds on the horizon.  It didn&apos;t appear to be a cloud because it was staying somewhat stationary.  The wind was gusty at the time. I could see the upper tree branches moving around Dundas Street West along with the clouds (they appeared to be moving south).

At first, I assumed it to be a helicopter with bright lights on, so I turned off my radio, put my window down, &amp; slowed down to investigate further. There was no sound, and if it was a helicopter, it would have made a noise, judging by the fact that it was no higher than 200 feet or so above the trees.

There were lights on top, which we did not find unusual, as this is (was) the case with many buoys. They are frequently placed at a distance close enough for swimmers, and far out enough for boaters. I was soothed by the motion of the lights. After a few minutes, I couldn&apos;t say exactly how many, the lights lifted and hovered. They stayed in that hovering position for about 30 or 40 seconds, then flew off. It was not a lazy, slow type of flight, but very fast. They took off to the left of us and were out of sight before I could even blink an eye. I had never, and have not to this day, seen anything that fast in my life.At first I thought I must have been imagining the whole thing, but when I asked my boyfriend, he confirmed to me that he had seen the same thing.

I looked at it for several seconds trying to make out what I was seeing before I tapped my boyfriend and said do you see that, I should mention that I have never believed in aliens, or bigfoot or anything of the sort I am a graduate student majoring in forensic science and have always been taught there is an explanation for everything, he looked up got quiet for a few seconds and said &quot;oh my god, what the hell is that.&quot; We continued to drive north and the craft simply hovered there, the night was clear and silent and we both noticed that whatever it was it emitted no noise, we continued driving and the object began to travel north but at a slow pace. My boyfriend began to feel uneasy about this round object which was most definitely not a plane or a helicopter or any other flying object either of us had ever seen before and turned right, at this point we were traveling east but were still looking back at the odject, maybe 4-5 minutes had passed by this point. Now we had to look back and to the left to keep the object in focus, at this point the object began to tavel in our direction rather rapidly however it was now slightly tilted with the bottom turned toward us, the closer it got the larger it appeared and the more detail we could make out (at this point the object was only about 2 blocks from us,) we co! uld not understand how those around us could not see this, it was so close, but the drivers around us did not appear to be looking in the direction of this craft which could easily be seen by looking through the back seat window on the driver&apos;s side but rather straight ahead.  At this point the craft was traveling behind a set of buildings, once again I commented on how low it was, it wasn&apos;t flying over the buildings but behind them so that its view would be blocked for about half a second everytime it went behind a building,( the buildings were apartments I estimate to be about 15-20 stories high)the object suddenly took off in the opposite direction and we lost sight of it.", "Black triangle surrouned by silver sphears moving south towards Pittsburgh, PA.While taking an evening walk I noticed someone in a car near me point up to the sky.  Wondering what they were looking at, I too looked up into the sky.  I saw what appeared to be a black triangle that was standing upright.  Altitude could have ranged anywhere from 10-12,000 feet.  This black triangle in the western sky puzzled me for several reasons.  As it was in the direction of a seeting sun on a clear evening it did not reflect any sunlight as I have seen airliners do thousands of times.  The strangest thing about the whole event were the other objects that appeared to be with this black triangle.  On each side of this triangle appeared 3-4 silvery spheres.  From my view they appeared on each side of the triangle lined up at 45-degree angles.  My girlfriend who was with me noticed the triangle, but because of poor vision could not see the spheres (they were smaller than the triangle).  I witnessed these objects for a total of about 5-10 minutes.  The objects appeared to be heading South-South West and it seemed as though they were following along the Beaver River and towards the Ohio River just north of Pittsburgh.  After rushing into the house to grab a pair of binoculars I could not find the object again.  I&apos;m an airplane enthusiast and I can identy almost any civilian/military craft with just a glance.  This was neither a civilian or military craft.  The objects in question emitted no sound, lights, or trail.  On a similar note, while watching CNN the following night at around 1 AM there was a report that strange lights were seen that night over the city of Pittsburgh.  I have found no written reports in any newspapers about this event and only saw one mention of the event on the news.", "Four of us were driving on Reno streets trying to find a hotel, I noticed a big pie shaped object hanging above the Circus Circus parking lot.

We were driving to a late night store downtown, travelling east to west down one more or less direct route/straight road. Near the downtown grocery was also a water tower and a police communications tower which were probably high points/tallest objects in the immediate area. We saw a metallic saucer-shaped object with red, green and white lights that appeared the size of a small plane not much higher than the water and communications towers. We noticed it as we headed toward these towers then watched it approach them, hover in a stationary position and then head back east. We attempted to follow its path in the car but lost it fairly quickly. We thought it seemed to head further east toward other communication or radio towers. My mother was educated, I have two degrees, father is an attorney. We had no reason to disbelieve the existance of a UFO and we had always been star-gazers in the spring and summer months as my mother had taken an astronomy course. We never really told anyone outside our family because at that time there were already so many stories that seemed unbelievable. I guess we just assumed ours would seem just like all the others. But it was as real as  could be. Just like anything else we might have looked at that night, there was no reason not to believe what we saw. I do not know the exact date or year. I have said March of 1972 but it could have been 1973 and could have been May or even Sept-Nov. I know it was a school night! and not middle of the winter.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We had received mortar fire recently upon our dug-in position in the &quot;Catcher&apos;s Mitt&quot; area of South Vietnam. This area had never been occupied by U.S. forces until our arrival late in November of 1969 by air assault. While scanning the treeline I saw a saucer shaped craft flying above the trees. It tracked slowly from south to north and as I followed it a dome-like structure came into view sitting on the side of a hill. In the view from a 1969 vintage starlite scope any light source appeared green. The dome slowly pulsed and as the saucer approached, it appeared to enter the dome, no details were discernible, only that the saucer disappeared into the dome. I continued to watch, and sent the second guard to get the battery commander, an artillery captain (Captain ((name deleted))). As I watched, the saucer, or a second one that was its twin, left the dome and &quot;launched&quot; into the sky. About that time the captain arrived and I said &quot;Take a look at that sir.&quot; He did, watching for five or six minutes then he straightened up.  &quot;What should we do sir?&quot; I asked. He replied we were to do nothing and no report was to be written up. I watched the dome all night, it continued to pulse, but when I left guard duty a few hours later the saucer had not returned. There was never any discernible sounds, I listened for the &quot;whomp, whomp&quot; of a chopper or the sound of jets and never heard anything. I mentioned the incident to the guard releaving me, but he was unconcerned as long as it &quot;Wasn&apos;t VC&quot;. The following night I took a look through the scope to where the dome had been the night before, but it was gone.

I was really tired so I decided to go to bed. When I went into my room, I looked out my window to see the stars. This is something I do every single night. The thing immeadietly caught my attention because I had never noticed it there before. From the angle I was looking at it from my window, I saw 3 orange lights spaced at consistent intervals. From what I could tell, the object(s) were quite high in the sky. I became very excited and ran out back to get a better view. When I opened the back door, my mom heard this and woke up. She was amazed at it as well. She figured it was something to do with Ft.Lewis (the gigantic forested army base within 1 mile from our neighborhood, Northwest Landing). I made no reservations as to what it was. The shape changed, rather, the angle changed as I went out back to get a better look. From then on, it just looked like a blob of vaguely 3 orange lights in a triangle pattern. Within about 15 minutes, it had moved somewhat to my right. I noticed this because when I went back to my room, it had become obscured by the roofline of the house, meaning that it moved to the right. Another interesting thing is that the orangeness emmitted a glow. Together, the 3 oranges formed a saucer shaped halo in the sky. It looked so much like a street lamp just sitting there. That is what mostly caught my attention, the aura of it. I knew it was not a star or a satellite or a helicopter or an airplane. It was completely unique. I will watch out for it every single night from now on. I really hope that somebody else saw it, besides my mother.

I&apos;m not sure how many witnesses there were since we had to keep driving after we saw it. Many people who were able to pull over did pull over to watch it. The UFO was VERY CLOSE to the ground, it was perhaps 60-70 ft over the freeway. It hovered in one spot and rotated it self in circles and on its side. The UFO was circular and the bottom had lights in a design that looked almost like a flower of some sort. It was spinning. The bottom was spinning one way and the top part was spinning the other. The UFO was of a grayish color with yellow lights. Only one was seen. After we had passed the UFO, I quickly turned around to continue watching it. It hovered for about another 10 seconds, and then it started to light up and emit a bright light, and then all of a sudden, I saw a blue streak of light and it was gone. The speed at which it traveled was beyond imagination. There seemed to be no noise coming from the UFO, as thought it was just floating there and there was no engine that was helping it fly.((NUFORC Note:  We are unsure as to whether the sighting occurred in the morning, or the evening.

In the air, over Great Slave Lake, Northwest Territories, Canada, I saw motionless, a long silver cigar shaped object in the air. The sky was very cloudy with dark grey clouds. There had been a thundershower about a half hour earlier. This object stood apart from the the clouds as it was shiny, but not like chrome, more like the stainless steel of a medical instrument. It was definatley not flat-colored like the backing clouds. I could hear no noise, possibly due to my distance from it. I could not tell at about what altitude it may have been at, I am not a meteorologist. It was clearly, in my opinion, not a conventional aircraft. There is significant aircraft activity in this area. Helicopters, float planes and passenger planes of all descriptions. One often looks up to see the aircraft coming and going, and gets to recognize many of the regular aircraft, by their paint and markings. There is no air polution in this part of the country.This was not a weather balloon, it was motionless.It was not a helicopter, float plane, or regular aircraft, it was silent, and motionless. I advanced up the road to see if I could get a better look at it, and it moved slowly into the clouds, and did not reappear.

I don&apos;t remember the exact date.I was taking an evening graduate level chemistry class on the north side of Indianapolis. Class had finished and I was walking through the parking lot to my car. It was about sunset. The sky was clear.Some bright, moving objects in the western sky caught my attention. I remember three objects. Two of them were tracing out a more or less circular path about 180 degrees opposed to each other, as if they were orbiting around a common center and trying to stay as far apart as possible. The third object was moving in its own oval path to the south of the first two.As the objects moved, they would reflect the setting sun, then the reflection would fade and a dark shape could be seen. This is similar to how the sunlight plays off an airliner near sunset, and at first I thought the objects were planes in a holding pattern. However, something that&apos;s hard to put my finger on held my attention - something unfamiliar about the shape, or maybe the way the objects seemed to glide or float, different from the way a plane flies. They also didn&apos;t seem to bank as they turned. I could hear no sound or see any lights on the objects.As I continued to watch, the third object, the one farthest to the south, started to move east, directly toward me. It passed almost directly overhead and continued east until it was lost in the dusk. As it passed overhead I got a good look at it. The main part of the object was crescent-shaped and seemed to be made of a dull-finished material. It looked dull red as it was overhead.Projecting back from the center of the crescent was a sort of stubby rectangular &quot;fuselage&quot; that was highly reflective, like polished metal. This was the part that reflected the sun. There was no sign of a tail assembly of any kind or engines. There was no sound, contrails, or lights, nor could I see any windows. I remember the object seeming to be in the size range of an asprin tablet to a dime held at arm&apos;s length. It&apos;s hard to estimate the object&apos;s altitude and true size. As I said, it was about sunset, but due to buildings and trees I couldn&apos;t tell if the sun had actually gone below the horizon. My first impression was that the sun was down, and the object was very high to catch its last rays, which meant it had to be huge. If the sun had still not set, the object could have been lower and smaller.As the object went out of sight, the first two objects were still circling in the west. I&apos;d guess the whole observation lasted about five minutes. I don&apos;t know if anybody else in the parking lot saw the objects or not, and I was too fixed on observing to call anybody&apos;s attention to them. I never reported the incident, only told a few family members.While this is an old sighting, I thought it might be of interest.((NUFORC Note:  Date in September 1971 is approximate.

I ran outside and saw a light move quickly from N to S running parallel with the Big Dippers&apos; handle. After about 20 seconds it disappeared, in that time span it had moved nearly the lenght of the visable sky from N to S.About that same time I spotted another light moving S to N at about the same speed in the eastern sky about 30 degrees east of the first light, this light disappeared behind some high clouds and I lost track of it, less then a minute later I saw another light move very quickly from W to E but also lost it in high clouds.What I thought first was a meteor shower was certainly not that ! Neither was it commercial aircraft because there was atleast 4 in that time period flying E to W to land at either St Paul Holman field or MSP and they very easy to see and follow because River Falls is in a landing corridor for both airports, although the jets all usually  fairly high up yet when they pass overhead. I can get three others to confirm this and probably much more because they have been watching this for several nights now!

We looked to the sky to look at the stars, when we saw this red object moving across the sky from west to east. We immediately looked at each other and said &quot;what the hell was that?!?&quot; Momentarily, we came to the conclusion that it must have been a shooting star, because there was no other explination. Before we could say anything else, the object made a 170 degree turn back towards the west. We were freaking out at this point  thinking what the hell... and it disappeared. Two seconds later we looked up again, and there was a huge bright white light with a haze around it in front of us. I ran back into the hotel room cause i didn&apos;t know what to do.

Me and my boyfriend were looking up at the stars and I noticed what looked like a star in the sky.  It was moving at very high speeds and sporadically. I pointed what I saw with my dad and boyfriend.  None of us had any clue what is was there were no blinking lights like a jet and it looked like it was to fast to be anykind of plane that we knew of.  After about 30 or so seconds of whatching it, the object grew or produced a very big blue light around it.  The bright light went away after a couple of seconds.  After the bright light we saw another light.  It was traveling the exact oppisite direction as the other craft we first mentioned.  We watched both of these lights until we couldn&apos;t see them anymore about 1-2 minutes total time. Note: this incedint happened before any fire works went off in the sky.  This was not a firework for the fourth of july, nor any human made aircraft that we know about.  I am sure it was not a shooting star, the duration of the light and sparadic movement of the crafts prove this.", "Saucer shaped UFO, lights, no sound, 20 minute observationAround 7:20 p.m. I left a friend&apos;s house in the 700 block of Commercial Street to head home after having dinner and chatting. I was carrying my toddler daughter (15 months old) out to my car when I noticed what I thought was a small airplane preparing to land at a nearby airfield. I put my daughter in her car seat and started my 1963 Dodge Dart and the non-factory installed car radio came on. When the radio started, I heard three electronic beeping sounds (like a microwave oven beep) and the KRTH-FM music was heard. I drove home, heading south, and parked the car at the curb. As I was getting out of the car, I looked up and saw an object over the house. I shut the car door, and stood in front of the car door, then leaned against it. I saw a dark, non-reflective saucer shaped object, over the roof peak. The object and a red, green and white light along the bottom. The lights did not strobe or twinkle. They were solid in color. Trained as a reporter, I made a mental checklist and started making observations of what the craft looked like and what it did. I noticed the dark metallic color, the lights and the lack of sound. Then I thought I myself, if you are a UFO do something to prove it. At this point, the UFO shot straight up in the air and hovered over the house. It did this three times moving up and down over the house. Also, the mostly full or full moon was to the left of the craft (south of it) and should have backlit the UFO. It did not. The only sound I could hear was faint fanlike sound. I had to strain my ears to hear that. By this time, I started looking for a neighbor&apos;s house to go stay at, but no one was home. I live in housing tract and usually someone is home. I finally got scared, after the third time the craft shot up in the air, and grabbed my daughter to make a run for the house. At the front door I fumbled with my keys but finally managed to get inside the house. I then ran and turned on the television for comfort and heard the final minutes of the Jeopardy game show which would have bee! n around 7:50 p.m. I used this to estimate the time of the UFO sighting. Once inside the house I did go to the back sliding glass door but was afraid to look outside. I was able to give three points of where I saw the UFO and the distance was estimated between 85 to 100 feet. I&apos;m nearsighted so for me to make out the craft, etc. meant that it was close. The weather was cool, clear with no wind. The following information was reported to MUFON and they have most of my UFO sightings in the 1980s. After the incident I suffered from chronic neck and back pain. I still suffer from the pain, although it has abated with time. I did see a doctor about the neck pain approximately one week after the incident. Before this experience, I was a skeptic of UFOs, but always said I would believe in them, if I ever saw one.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

I can vaguely remember a small open field area that may have had a swing set or some kind of park equipment located on the Officers side of the base housing area.  Because I was only ~7 years old at the time, I only remember that to this day I believe I saw a UFO at very close range.  It seemed to appear out of nowhere, as I don&apos;t remember having any feelings of fright that something was coming towards me.  All I can remember is that while walking towards the housing from the Non-commissioned officers housing side of the road to the officers side, I crossed a small open grassy/weedy space when I felt different and I believe I heard something when this huge &quot;thing&quot; seemed to appear out of nowhere impairing my ability to see straight above me. I remember it seemed to be hovering just above tree line straight above me.  It displayed moving colored lights.  At one time I could have said what colors, but the only color I am mostly sure of this many years later is blue. You would think at age ~7 I would have been horribly frightened.  I was quite the rascal when I was young, so I was likely analyzing everything and at the same time I was a little afraid.  I remember feeling uncomfortable and a little scared, and I did run home after about a minute or so of being awe struck.  I can&apos;t remember if I told my mother or father upon my return.  I have made mention of this to my father over the years, but I think he believes it was just a childs memory of something easily explained. My father was an A.F. pilot - ((rank and name deleted)), who was ((deleted--military and flying career officially and formally acknowledged)) for his honorable military career. I can say this much, since that time; I have never written about my experience nor really spoke of it much to others because I don&apos;t think I was ever taken serious. I know the experience was real. I know my feelings while it was happening, and trust what instinct and intuition I had at that time.  I know it was an event that I will remember for the rest of my life, and that children don&apos;t remember events all through their life unless there is good reason.  I remain to believe to this day that I saw something that was technologically impossible for that time.  It just took years later to understand that as a child I didn&apos;t have much of an idea about technological abilities for that time. I couldn&apos;t sleep so thought I would finally see what I could find about Luke AFB around 1967 with any links to UFO sightings.  I found one specific link that summarized a UFO being right above Luke AFB.  As soon as I saw this, I felt compelled to write something about my experience no matter if it fell into the abyss somewhere or not. Really the sighting itself has not been that big of a deal.  It&apos;s only that I have wondered about things all these years:  What was it, who or what was inside, why was it right above me, was something watching me?  One strange thing too is that since I couldn&apos;t really remember how it appeared when it did without me noticing anything before, I had often wondered about the sound or the feeling that something was wrong before it actually happened.  Like I had some instinctive alarm that there was some impending danger, but then dismissed it and ran off.  Or, if something affected me in some way prior to its suddenly appearing above me.  If it hadn&apos;t been so fast at seemingly coming out of nowhere, maybe I never would have questioned what it was.  I don&apos;t know, and never will.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The lights never changed in intensity, color or distance from each other. There was 1 in front and the other 2 were behind and to the sides.

I was 7 at the time.  We left the KFC that was on Northwest Hwy going NW in our car.  As we got closer to the intersection of Northwest Hwy and Euclid, I spotted an object that hung in the sky and was getting brighter.  It was &quot;dropping&quot; out of the sky in the north.  I pointed it out to my sister who was in the car.  She then asked my dad to look at it.  I then replied that it was a UFO.  My father, refused and brushed it off as an airplane.  To quite us he turned at the intersection prior to Euclid as to keep us from jumping around in the back seat since the streets he was taking had trees that over hung the road and obscured our view.  As was were going down Sigwalt St. the craft was now closer to the ground, 100 ft or so.  as we drove west on Sigwalt St. to the 7-11 store to get soda pop for dinner.  We pulled in and my father still refused to look up and cater the whims of his children.  He went in and as we stayed in the car, one of the other children and her frien who lived up the street from us saw the UFO, hovering with no sound, only the wind had picked up.  The wind was strange, blowing almost upward in direction and in a circular motion.  The face that she made was horrific, as in disblief that this could not be happening.  Her knees caved in and her friend dropped to the ground.  What I thought at the time was a &quot;neat&quot; thing now was burned in to my memory forever as a horror.  My sister and I were now wanting to go home, not in a panic, just a rush to get home.  The disk moving slowly was now above the intersection of Sigwalt St. and Wilke St.  My father exited the Store, as did the attendent.  My father finally looked up to see the disc and was amazed and puzzled as to what he was seeing, as we all were.  It moved over Rolling Meadows and slowly climbed upward, as fast as it came down.  It was about the size of one and a half houses (for the area I live in) it was black on the underside, blacker then the nig! ht and not reflective of any light, other then the lights that it had moving on its edges.  All diferent colors, but mostly yellow, red, orange.  As it climbed it the night sky, it was tilted in a way we saw the top.  It looked like a classic &quot;Bell&quot; shaped saucer, and the top was reflecting the lights on the edges so we were able to see the surface reflecting and giving away the top sides shape.  It never moved quickly and as far as I know no one else saw it.  At the time in Arlington and Rolling Meadows when evening came most people were inside, I am not sure if this was covered at the time in the papers.

We watched them as they formated into a perfect triangle and moved over a certain amount of sky.

I went outside on my parent&apos;s bedroom blacony (4th floor of an appartment) to look at the Ottawa city lights and the stars in general. Then I looked up and saw 3 orange circles, that look like when you turn on your stove to high.  The 3 circles formed a large dark triangle shaped object.  I immediately called my younger brother and he also observed it with me.  It was flying directly above our heads without making a noise what so ever. It looked very large, larger then a commercial air plane but flew to low for a commercial air plane.  I can&apos;t say how high it was, but a guess would be 500 to 750 feet. 1 year later, I saw on the &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; show, a person who submitted a live video tape of a UFO, in Ottawa and it seemed to coincide with the time of year I saw the object.  The video showed a craft that was landed on the ground with a lot of lights, and it&apos;s hard to determine if it was triangle shaped. So I don&apos;t know for sure if it&apos;s the same one... Could be a coincidence or maybe not.  Then later on I did research as I got older and this triangle shaped object with 3 orange glow lights has been seen in different countries.  At least I&apos;m not alone. Another strange event, but not a sighting, which happened perhaps 5 years ago... Is that I dreamed I was having sexual intercourse with an alien.  Didn&apos;t think of it much really.  But then 1 week or 2 later I see a special report on aliens on FOX and in that report, a man was being hypnotised because he claimed he got abducted by aliens and had sexual intercourse with one of them.  They showed what he was describing and that freeked me out really bad and I didn&apos;t know what to think. It wasn&apos;t one of those deja vu&apos;s because I was involved in the intercourse instead of watching it on TV.  Just too weird for me.  Probably not even worth mentionning and don&apos;t know why I wrote about it.

I&apos;m not sure if NASA has anything to do with my sighting, but I thought it might be pertinent information. I consider myself a very level-headed, skeptical person not given to delusions or hallucinations. I have always had an interest in the so-called &apos;paranormal&apos;, but UFO&apos;s were never really a huge interest and my approach to unexplained phenomena is that of an open-minded skeptic, seeking out logical and most probable explainations before launching into metaphysics and talk of aliens or elaborate government conspiracies. At the time of the sighting I had been attending community college for graphic design, and working at a bookstore. I am currently between jobs and college, and plan to attend Flagler College next year to major in psychology. I have no respect for people who tell tall tales just to get attention or for laughs at other people&apos;s expense and at the expense of legitimate investigation of this phenomena, and I have nothing to gain by reporting this other than adding to the body of information you are collecting that might lead to finding similarities and patterns in sightings for better understanding this phenomena. My sighting happened three years ago, in 1999, but it is still burned into my memory, it was so shocking and out of the ordinary, like nothing I&apos;d ever seen or expected. Sometime in August, in the early morning (around 2-3 am) I awoke from sleep in the condo I live in with my parents. This wasn&apos;t a usual occurance for me, as I usually sleep soundly through the night...but this of course might not be directly connected to the sighting and just a coincidence. I went into the kitchen to get a glass of water, and I sat down on the couch for about 5 minutes, sipping the water. For some reason, whether it was on my own whim or something else that compelled me, I felt that I wanted to step out front. Maybe it was a completely self-willed decision, simply a desire to enjoy the night air, or the more unlikely scenario which has crossed my mind a few times that something/someone else compelled me...I don&apos;t rule that out but I find it the more improbable of the two possibilities. I remember opening the front door, closing it behind me, and just as I stepped away from the door I heard an extremely loud sound, exactly like or very similar to the whine of a jumbo jet. A split second later I looked up to where the sound originated, and above me was a huge craft which seemed to be flying very low, coming towards me from (I think) the east. Incidentally, it was coming from the direction of the indian river lagoon, across which is Kennedy Space Center. It was so large and that I couldn&apos;t get a proper perspective on its exact proportions relative to how low it was flying. My best estimate is that it was at least one and a half or twice the size of a jumbo jet and only 100 to several hundred feet overhead. It seemed to be going rather slowly at first. It blocked out my entire feild of vision of the night sky and covered the roof of my condo unit which was to the left of me with its shadow. I couldn&apos;t tell what shape it was, it seemed flat on the bottom with lights, which I think were white. I only had about 10 seconds to take it all in, and it galvanized me, I just stood there dumbfounded. As it went over my head, I turned around...and this is the most puzzling thing...it had completely dissapeared!  I have heard that certain UFO&apos;S can dart from place to place with amazing speed and precision, so maybe this is an explaination for the mysterious &apos;dissapearance&apos;. I also cannot rule out the possibility that it was all a hypnogogic hallucination since it had been about 6 minutes since I woke up, but as I said I am not normally given to visual or auditory hallucianations, especially of such a vivid nature. After the incident, I was literally shaking, and I went in the house. I expected my mother (not to mention the whole condo complex) to be awake by then since the jet-like noise the craft was making was loud enough to wake everyone within a block or two of me. But my mother, and everyone else it seemed, was either sound asleep or still in their house. I found that very odd, because it would logically follow that whatever it is I saw would have woken people up, it was so loud. One detail I do not recall is whether I felt a vibration or not...for a craft of this size and loudness, if it was following the known laws of physics, it would have shaken the windows and I would have been able to literally feel the vibration in my bones. I was so astounded and shocked in the few moments I encountered it that I simply cannot recall if I detected any vibrations. But I tend to think there wasn&apos;t since if there was, as I said, it would have woke people up, possibly even shattered some windows. I debated whether to wake up my mother, and decided not to. I also debated with myself whether to call the police or not, I was curious if anyone else had reported sighting this craft. At the time I thought NASA might be test flying something but it would have had to have been using technology only science fiction writers dream of, and that didn&apos;t seem logical to me. I didn&apos;t report my sighting to the police because I felt kind of absurd about the whole thing, and couldn&apos;t picture myself calling in the wee hours to report a UFO sighting with lights and all, I was afraid they would assume I was a prankster,  and there is really nothing they could do about it anyhow. Living so close to the Space Center, I am familliar with the effects of the space shuttle launches, especially when it breaks the sound barrier...our windows shake and you can hear and feel the vibrations. When the shuttle lands here in Florida, one can hear a very loud sonic boom. Of course, this craft was not traveling at any speed great enough to break the sound barrier, and it was flying low, but it should have been equivalant to one or two jumbo jets flying very low overhead, as if they lifted off moments earlier. I am thouroughly puzzled by this and its one of the main reasons I cannot logically rule out that it was a hallucination. So there is my report. I swear by all that is sacred to me that this is not a lie or a joke. I respect what this organization is doing to collect information on legitimate UFO Sightings without dismissing us all as cranks and lunatics. Ever since I experienced this sighting I have always been curious if anyone else has had a sighting similar or identical in nature to mine. I&apos;ve heard and read about several types of UFO sightings, but have never come across details of any sightings that completely match mine. Most of the sightings I have heard/read about involving craft of the gigantic size I saw (perhaps it was one of those triangular shapes?) was not accompanied by any loud high-pitched jet noise, but were completely silent. If anyone reading this knows of similar sightings or has experienced one themselves with many or all of the same characteristics, I would be interested in being informed of this.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although witness does not indicate that fact.  Time indicated by witness is illogical.

I quickly followed her out to the back of the house. I saw an object hovering in the sky nearby. I was amazed because i had never seen anything like this. It was saucer shaped and had lights that were rotating around the edge of the object. It was emitting a deep humming noise that remins in my memory to this day. It vibrated the ground and surrounding buildings. I was not frightened but more awestruck at what I was wittnessing. It remained for quite some time and we stayed and watched it. But the thing that my ex husband didnt remember was that it flew off about a half mile away and began flying in an erratic fashion, that no man made object could match. It was almost a zig zag, back and forth, up and down motion. It was like a housefly moves. It went in this fashion very quickly and erratically. A few minutes later the object left our sight hurriedly. Again, i hope this helps you, as i was amazed to hear of your interest in what we saw so many years ago. I feel very special to have been visited by something unexplainable.((NUFORC Note:  Please see other report from the husband for the same location and date.

Triangular in shape with flash in the rear, greater on the outer edges than center.  The entire shape seemed to be lit.   It may have been white flame shooting from the back of the object and I am certain there was a flash of blue in the center.  There was no tail to speak of so I am fairly certain it was not a comet, afterall.  Maybe a military vehicle?  So peculiar.  I do wish I&apos;d had my camera. I live 3 1/2 miles south of Spencer on Pottersville Rd. Is there anything you know about this that you might share with me?  No sound.  So strange. I watched it pass with amazement and wonder.  Because we are surrounded by tree lines on all sides the viewing area was limited.  After it passed beyond the treeline, there was some distant flashes in the sky but this could have been heat lightening, although I did not notice them prior to the sighting. Thinking about it all night makes me certain it was not a comet at all (my initial thought) because there was definite structure to the object.  Were I to associate it with something familiar, that something would be a stealth because of form and light that would resemble fuel flash feathering from the rear. As well, I did see what appeared to be a comet after turning away from this sighting, shooting off in a different direction, from a different direction..  if the two sightings occurred simultaneously, they would have made an X over my front yard!  The second sighting did seem to be a comet, lower than most I have witnessed, but definitely the shape, oval, with a short tail, white, without any deviating signs of being otherwise. What a night!  I hope you will reply.", "UFOs spotted coming from behind the moonI am not sure of the year, between 1960 and 1963, the date was April 1st, time about 8 PM. The moon was full or close to being full and was in the north west sky. It was a clear night. Myself and two friends were sitting on our porch  just talking the way pre-teens do.I think we were discussing basball. One of us, and I do not remember who, it could have been me I am not sure, yelled out, What are they? And pointed to the moon. Three small bright dots were flying east in an upside down &quot;V&quot; formation. They came from behind the moon and traveled at a slow speed eastward when the one on the bottom right of the upside down V broke formation and flew back and disappeared behind the moon. We watched the other two fly  east and out of sight.I remember saying that we should tell someone, probably our parents, what we saw. But we decided against it because the date was April 1st and we thought and knew that if we told anyone they would think it was just an April fools joke. Remember back in the early 60s if you said you saw a UFO, then called flying saucers, people thought you were nuts and we also had our young age going against us. To give some perspective of how this looked to us, see the moon about the size of a quarter and the lights about the size of a small pea. I testify that what I said here is true and that what we saw was not in our atmosphere but had to be in space because of the one light disappearing behind the moon.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  The full Moon rises in the eastern sky.  We have asked the witness for clarification on the latter point.

I was watching T.V with my wife girlfriend on a saturday night. It was 11:40pm and it was stormy outside so i decided to go outside and get her cats in. Anyway,after getting a drink i went outside and boy was it getting windy, not to mention the thunder. I looked into the sky and was fascinated by the shape of the clouds which were illuminated by lightning strikes. There was a enough of a break in the clouds to see a large portion of the sky and the stars were clearly visible. Then something strange happened, from the left side of the sky i noticed a bright white circular shaped object moving at a steady speed, i immediately thought it was a satellite, then i noticed a second bright white circular object moving in the same direction, the object caught with the first object and they were now one on top of the other however they were still flying individually. I have never seen two satellites flying together like that and they weren&apos;t planes, they were silent and they had no flashing lights. At this point i called to my girlfriend to have a look, i then saw a third bright white circular object move out from behing the same clouds as the other 2 objects and then the object trailled the front 2 at the same speed thus creating a triangle shaped formation. Once again this object imitted no sound and no flashing lights, the objects then slowly disappeared over the clouds.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

As i tracked it over a few minutes it appeared to move across the sky in a westerly direction eventually going out of sight, as i watched it another much dimmer object seemed to sail past it in the other direction travelling much faster at about the smae height it diappeared after maybe 20 seconds. one other person saw both objects while a 3rd person saw only the bright object. so - anyway i was explaining to two friends what i had seen and was pointing in the sky to indicate where i had seen the object and the path it had taken.it was by contrast 2-3am - or thereabouts and a dark cloudless sky. it was very quiet.as i moved my finger away we all noticed a very bright object where my finger had been it was like an aircraft light and very bright - it seemed to be at between 5-10,000 feet maybe higer - it was strange as the fact that no sound accompanied its travel made us all stop and watch more closely. it passed overhead travelling quite slowly and as it passed in front of us you could clearly see that it was long like an aircraft with green tail lights.  as it passed us it continued its way east and  as it passed us its path began to change - not like a normal aircraft would by bsnking - it seemed to maked stepping stone movements in a zig zag pattern - quite subtle but very obvious- it seemed like an optical illusion as it seemed to hop from one place to the other like a skimming stone - it continued in this way until it dimmed and disappeared out view. it was a very neutral ufo sighting and one that i have always wanted to see, perhaps a bit closer would be nice next time.it was my birthday :)", "Two ships, 500 feet away, over Tradewinds Park and as large as 2 to 3 football fields eachI was driving north on the Florida Turnpike and saw the 2 ufo&apos;s hovering overhead. I turned to my passenger and told him to look up and tell me what he sees.  He asked me to pull over quickly. We stopped and watched for about four minutes two disk shaped objects about 500 feet over Tradewinds Park.  There were fogged windows on each saucer and we could see shapes moving past them.  The top was silver and the bottom was a glowing orange.  After awhile, the left saucer slowly moved south and blinked out of existence.  About thirty seconds later the second did the same. When they departed, there was no sound whatsoever. I am a general manager of an office in Ft. Lauderdale and my passenger worked with me.  I also called the Sun Sentinel and they said there was already over a thousand calls about this sighting.  Then, I called the Washington State UFO Bureau and they wanted a response from me.

At first I thought it was coming from the Yakima Firing Center but after watching for about 30 seconds, started doubting that idea. It was oval in shape and pulsated rainbow colors around the oval shape.  It moved straight to the right, than straight down, back to the left, back straight up and than ro the right again.  What was unique about this was when the object moved, the rainbow colors that were pulsating around the oval shape, extended into what I can best describe as &quot;butterfly&quot; wings on both sides of the object.  It was very pretty to watch.  I could only see the rainbow colors in the &quot;butterfly&quot; wings when it moved, not when it was stationary.  I was watching my puppy who got me up and went back inside for a few minutes.  When I came back out it was gone.

The lights appeared for 1 to 2 minutes total and did not disappear except from view by going behind some trees. They appeared to be single lights, not multiple lights seen from a distance.  They looked like stars except for they were moving or twinkling.  They were about half or two thirds the brightness of Jupiter.  They moved about as fast as a commercial jetliner does but I&apos;m not sure of the distance, they could have been moving faster.  I don&apos;t think it was cold outside so it must have at least not been in the winter.  It was about 1982.  I saw them above Tullahoma Tennessee.  There was an air force base and a space institute nearby at the time.  I think that they are still there.  The triangle and  lights formed was about the width in the sky as an outstretched palm at arms length.  There was no audible sound.

Five us went to the light show at Uxmal in Yucatan, which took place at about nine in the evening. There were about fifty people there. During the show a disc appeared in the air about 50 yards to the right of where the audience was seated. It was about 80 to 100 feet across. It revolved slowly, counterclockwise as seen from below. It was no more than 100 feet off the ground. There were yellow and orange lights around the outside of the disc. When we first saw it, there were things that looked like long thin neon tubes hanging from the edge of the disc. They changed color, and were retracted into the edges of the disc, as it spun around. The top side of the disc was slightly domed, and gave off a red glow. As we watched the disc moved forward, and gained altitude. Then we noticed that there was another one, very high overhead, also rotating and giving off the orange and yellow lights around the rim. We watch the first one climb and then join the other one, and they both moved off toward the west in the sky, until they were so far away we lost sight of them. Some people may have actually thought that it was part of the light show. After it was over everyone moved out of there as fast as possible.

The Moon was very bright and it inveloped the haze in a dull light. First, let me say that my wife and myself did not see any type of craft. I am filing this report to see if anyone else in my area may have spotted something or had a similar experience. My wife and I went to bed around 11:15. I noticed a rolling sound very similar to thunder. I asked my wife if she thought that the noise was thunder and she did. I looked out and saw that it was rather clear but the humidity had created a haze at ground level. The moon lit everything up and our yard and cars were clearly visable. I related as much to my wife and she suggested that there might be a storm in the distance. Possible I suppose, but this rolling thunder noise was sustained. I found it unusal but possible due to the atmospheric conditions. I was not timing the noise but I could not sleep because of the humidity. About 10 minutes elapsed with the sound still constantly in the background, at times becoming almost mechanical in nature, sort of like a muscle car. The volume also seemed to raise and lower. The last time I looked at my watch was around 23:35. Then I fell asleep. Somehow I ended up on the couch down stairs. I woke to my son crying. He is 29 months old. He sleeps with us (we have a king-size bed) and he had apparently fallen out of bed. I ran upstairs my wife held him until he calmed down. I looked at my watch and saw that it was 2:05 AM. I could hear what I think were Tractor Trailers in the distance. I laid there, unable to sleep for about an hour. I ended up going back on the couch. It was strange that the air was really still, hot and thick in the bedroom (yes, there were 2 windows open upstairs.) I even stuck my hand up against the screen, and it just felt so hot. But downstairs, the air was thick and cold. It was also slightly breezy at times. I laid there for about an hour and could not sleep. As I did enter a state that would best be described as a Twighlight type state (somewhat aware but VERY relaxed)I was startled by a noise - I&apos;m getting goose bumps at this point - that sounded almost electronic, and, for lack of a better adjective, evil. It almost seemed like one of those voice changing kids toys, or a distorted Nextel phone. I could not determine what was being said. It sounded linguistic and not just noise. I was completly awake at this point, laying, waiting. I heard it again and bolted up and looked out of our picture window that over looks a flat field that is about 100 yards. I heard it again as I made my way to the picture window which is about 5 feet behind the couch. I distinctly heard this &apos;voice&apos; 2 times, and it was distinctly different both times. I went upstairs and asked my wife if she had heard it. I was kind of dazed and didn&apos;t realize that I was waking her up. She sort of freaked out. At this point, I am completly awake, so I head back downstairs to investigate. I look around out of the window. I enter the kitchen and notice that our dog is completly asleep, I make some threatining comments out of the window trying to call this person or thing out. Nothing. Silence.

I immediately noticed an area about the size of a helicopter with lots of white blinking lights (strobe-like with no real pattern)and some non-blinking red colors mixed in that seemed to be fairly close, right above the mountain.  There are a lot of helicopters flying here all the time (the police patrol use large search lights to scan the ground and condos), so I assumed that&apos;s what it was and looked toward the beach enjoying the view.  When I  looked back,  the lights seemed to be coming closer as they were getting larger. I was thinking it was just a helicopter flying erratically, although I heard no noise.  All of a sudden a bunch of , perhaps six or so of them.  It looked like some sort of fireworks display.  They floated down slowly leaving straight trails of white light. (just like fireworks do)  My husband was sleeping and my 16 year old daughter was IM&apos;ing friends back home.  I ran to my daughter&apos;s room and finally got her off the computer long enough to come look, and when we got back outside, the leading edge of some of the rows were still visibly and very bright white as they went out of sight behind some condos in front of the mountain. (looked like maybe some small pieces of wreckage, very hot, white coming to earth and not burning out before hitting the ground) However, the flashing lights were still in the sky, in the same spot but not as bright.  There are fireworks here all the time and at any time of the night and my daughter was like &apos;big deal, more fireworks&apos; and headed back to her computer.  I sat down and watched the flashing lights, and they seemed to get farther away and not as bright fairly quickly. Then they started to get bright again. That&apos;s when I finally realized it wasn&apos;t a helicopter and got excited.  Should I wake my husband? Should I not? When the lights got brighter and seemed to be right above the mountain where the other display occured, the flashing started to alternate between a very bright white strobe and lesser bright white strobe still with no identifiable pattern, I ran inside for my husband. I ran back outside screaming for him to hurry up. During this time, the lights were very bright white and seemed close with some red and now green. (The red and green never seemed to be actual lights but more like the light that would be given off by red and green lights)  Appx. five or six separate bright, same sized, green with some white lights broke off in a sort of bow shape and maintaining that shape, started very slowly floating down to earth (except the original light which was whiteish green and not as bright, but in the same place). Unlike the first occurrence, the green lights started to fade sooner as they went down.  By the time my husband got outside, there were 2 or 3 green light trails floating down and the original in the same place.  The green light trails faded before hitting ground and the original, blinking more bright white again with a faint reddish seemed to get farther away but remained in the sky for about ten more minutes getting progressively fainter until it disappeared. My husband was outside for an additional 10 - 15 minutes after he saw the 2 - 3 green lights falling and also observed the odd strobe-like flashing, the odd way it seemed to sit in the same place for long periods of time and the gradual disappearance (fading) into the sky.(at points, it looked like a large, medium, small red star) At times it seemed to be coming back and the stobe effect would be visible again and then it would fade. As it seemed to get further away and mostly invisible, my husband and I thought we saw something very dark and faint falling behind the mountain. (like a large piece or several tightly packed smaller pieces of debris) However, this could easily have been a shadow of something as there are lots of street light, cars, planes, helicopters (although I didn&apos;t see any flying during the event), etc. I kept checking back every 15 minutes for about 3 hours to see if would reappear and it never did.  Never during this entire episode did I feel scared, threatened, nervous or as if I were being singled out in any way.  This was all happening for anyone to see.  I only felt excited and puzzled as to what it was.  I am still expecting to find some logical explanation on the internet.  ***While writing this, I use &apos;bright&apos; and &apos;close&apos;, &apos;faint&apos; and &apos;farther&apos; away interchangably.", "the object hoverd then droped and split into 2 different craftslooking out my kitchen window,when i say something in the sky. it looked like a buloon very high up. whan all of a sudden it droped out of the sky.just as it drops behind roofs if you slow the video up you see the craft split into 2 and 1 shots of straight up to the sky very very fast.", "We were followed by 4 dancing lights for over 70 milesWe were chased by 4 dancing lights.It was a long time ago.  Probably Fall 1995 or Spring 1996.  The date and time I have listed is just for the purpose of being able to write this.  My husband and I left New York City heading east on Long Island Expressway.  Time was about 8 O&apos;clock at night.  The sky was hazy with a low thin cloud which was faintly illuminated by city lights hanging may be about 1000 feet or less above.  About 5 miles after leaving the city I noticed four lights that at first I assumed are exhibit lights beamed from the ground.  The lights were formed in a shape of rectangle, each at one corner.  They each were doing a nervous kind of dance like circling an imaginary axel rapidly and every so often they all join each other at the center and cross over and go to the corners again.  At the same time the entire formation kept moving from one place to another with no pattern. At first when I saw the lights they were about 100 ft. diagonally to the left of our car.  Then they moved up above our car and start moving in the same direction with us.  For the first few miles that the lights were moving with us, either directly above us or a little to the left or to the right, or a few feet ahead or back, I still looked at them thinking they are exhibit lights.  As we kept putting distance between us and the point when I first noticed them, I started to wonder what kind of exhibit lights would move this far without changing shape or losing brightness.  Furthermore I could neither see any beams nor could I hear or see any object in the sky to be source of these strange lights.  I started looking at them more intensely now and I mentioned to my husband that we are being followed by some lights.  Of course he laughed at me and refused even to look at them (he was driving).  The highway was at times very slow and at time it opened up so we could move faster.  The lights kept up the speed with us.  25 miles later, they were still with us.  Now I was quite aware of something strange going on and I felt having kind of a connection to them that I cannot even explain.  Another 10 miles a car very much like our car passed us and then where the highway forked ahead of us (right fork leading to another highway going south) drove quickly to the right heading south and the lights started following that car.  I was really very disappointed and told my husband that they lost us (of course he made fun of me again).  The lights went southward for about 1/4 of a mile and looked like they realized they have made a mistake and stopped, then started looking around by coming back a little and then going south again a little and stopping and just moving around.  Finally they gave up and kept going south and then eastward on the parallel highway to the south of our highway.  I could see them from distance.  I finally lost sight of them and we went to exist 63 (which is 55 miles from New York City).  Then we! wend south about a mile and picked up my stepson and two of his friends (ages from 9 to 13) and started heading back toward the Expressway.  I told the kids about the lights and they had a good laugh about it and made fun of me.  When we reached the Expressway, I saw the lights again.  They were standing right above Exit 63, I firmly believe waiting for us.  Our destination was heading West to Exist 41 which is about 35 miles from Exit 63, then going up North to Oyster Bay, about 9 miles.  Sure enough as soon as we got on the highway and headed west, the light started moving with us again.  They kept with us all the way to Exit 41.  When, at Exit 41, we got off the highway on the service road, I asked my husband to stop the car.  I wanted to know if the lights would stop.  And they did stop.  Now everyone else, even the kids were amased and exited by this and we all started waiving and talking to the lights and they stayed right above us doing their dance.  After 15 minutes we had no choice but heading home, we couldn&apos;t stay there all night and shouting without getting arrested.  As soon as we started so did the light.  We headed north and so did they.  They came north for about 3 miles with us until they had to stop.  The sky ran out of cloud and became clear with stars shining.  The lights stood at the edge of the cloud.  I kept looking at them for a few miles.  I could see that they gave up and finally went a little south first and then west toward New York City. When I came home I was extremely curious also afraid to tell anyone without being suspected of being crazy.  I finally gathered up my nerve and called channel 12.  I wanted to know if there were similar sightings.  I spoke to the person who claimed to be the night eitor.  He did not take me seriously and brushed me off by saying  there has been report of light exhibits in the area.    I immediately hang up and since then until now I haven&apos;t told anyone.  We don&apos;t even discuss it among ourselves.  But this never left my mind.  I think about those lights often.  I recently logged into this site and I noticed some of the reports were not that far away from what I saw.  This is why I am writing.  I don&apos;t remember the day or the time exactly but I vividly remember every moment of the time lights moved with us and every move they made. I saw the same lights again once more (even though I don&apos;t think they were the exact same lights) about 2 years later in Greece.  I was traveling on the highway by the water in Attiki.  Around Anavisos, which is about 20 miles east of Athens, I saw similar lights.  They came across the water and passed over us and kept going northward until they disappeared behind the hills.  Again no ground beams or anything in the sky (such as helicopter) that might have been the source of the lights at all. I am a logical person and I have been trying ever since to explain this to myself but I have not been able to come up with anything.  I don&rsquo;t think anyone else can either.", "Three U.S. Navy personel witness triangular shaped object in day time sky outside popular Thailand tourest area.We were on a picnic in a jungle clearing approx 1 mile outside Padia Beach, Thailand our party included 3 U.S Navy personel and 3 local women. We had finished eating and were enjoying a swim in a stream that ran along one edge of the clearing. The clearing was about 150 yards long and varied in width from 10 to 30 yards.  The weather was warm bright and sunny when we notices a shadow start to pass over us we looked up expecting to see clouds forming, however what we saw was a large dark grey metalic object triangular in shape with sides that appeared to be approx. 80 to 100 feet in leangth. The underside surface had some irregularly spaced protrusions of an unidentifiable nature. No windows or artificial lighting was observed. The object was moving at about a slow walking pace.  No sounds could be heard coming from the object, however as it passed overhead at an estimated altitude of less than 250 feet, a low subsonic humm could be felt more than heard. As the object passed overhead our tape player died. we assumed at that time the batteries had died. After the object was out of sight we noticed that the two digital watches in the group were no longer functioning, the one analog watch was still working. Upon returning to our submarine we put new batteries into the radio/tape player even with freash batteries and later pluged into an outlet the divice refused to function. The same thing with the digital watches.  Also all of the audio tapes that we had with us were now blank and we were unable to record on them in the future.Two of us had cammeras and attempted to take photos.  The photo lab that attempted to develop the film told us it looked as if the film had been exposed to x-rays as all the film we had with us was &quot;fogged&quot; and no prints were possable this included film that had been shot earlyer in the day and was no longer in the cammera and new film that had not yet been opened when the incedent occured.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I am not sure of the actual date but it was Memorial Day Weekend 1997. I did not actually see an object so to speak. There were just several pulses of greenish/blue light, one right after the other for several minutes. Followed by a short break of a couple of minutes then another series but not as many as the first. Lighting the sky in a northenly direction, mainly reflecting off some scattered clouds. There was no lightning activity on this night nor enough cloud cover to produce any, and they were not white. I would estimate they were traveling between Yosemite(approx.) and Lassen(approx.) in less than a second. Faster than one could imagine. I wasn&apos;t counting but I would have to say there were about 20-30 in all. I would not rule out experimental aircraft, which I feel is the most likely scenario in this case. I have my eyes checked regularly and still have 20/15 or better vision. I was not drinking or under the influence of anything.

All three investigators were impressed with this 50-year old witness&apos; willingness to be as objective as possible in his quietly thoughtful assessment of his sighting.   He had taken a short break from his office and was sitting on a bench at 2nd Street &amp; 3rd Avenue in Cedar Rapids wearing ray-blocker sunglasses when he sighted what he at first thought was a flock of birds.  However, as the formation approached to nearly overhead (moving from north to south) he realized that he was seeing at least 5 shiny metallic objects (no further apart in the formation than their own diameter), and to his amazement he saw that the objects constantly switched positions as the &quot;tight S&quot; formation rather slowly moved south at an estimated 30-50 mph INTO/AGAINST the wind. (It should be noted  here that weather conditions were as follows: Clear; 87 degrees Fahrenheit; visibility 10 miles; WIND OUT OF SSW AT 26 mph, GUSTING TO 35 mph)  With 5 objects moving against such a strong wind, it seems reasonable to rule out balloons as an explanation for what this witness saw. Witness estimates that objects were perhaps at around 2,000 feet when first sighted, but that they may have elevated somewhat as they drew closer to overhead.  (Whether this perception is accurate, of course, is not known.)  Witness observed a military jet a couple of miles away heading in the opposite direction as the formation, but it is not known if that pilot was aware of the formation. Local police and sheriff&apos;s departments received no reports, and the FAA had nothing on radar. This, of course, remains an anecdotal, one-person account, but Iowa MUFON investigators are impressed with this individual&apos;s careful attention to detail as he sought to satisfy his curiosity over what he was seeing.

This is Brian Adams of the Missouri Investigators Group (UFOMIG.com) and I was assigned to do a followup investigation of this NUFORC sighting report&gt;  Occurred : 5/8/2003 00:45 (Entered as : 05/08/03 00:45) Reported: 5/16/2003 8:20:26 AM 08:20 Posted: 5/27/2003 Location: Clinton, MO Shape: Circle Duration:3-4 minutes circular object with 5 lights seen in Henry county  I reached the witness finally by phone on July 15 the after leaving two phone messages and emails that previously did not get a response back in June.  The witness, a female hospital worker/student, then apologized saying that she was busy with her wedding and honeymoon last month. We then discussed her NUFORC report and the specific location where she on May 8th she described her UFO encounter on Highway 13 south of Highway 2 just inside Henry County, Missouri. She was driving home from work in Warrensburg back to Clinton, Missouri after getting off her hospital shift just after midnight. When she first observed the craft lights that she assumed was a life flight helicopter over a field to the west heading north to Warrensburg but it suddenly moved right over to the side of the highway as she drove towards it.  She said she slowed down to less than 10 mph keeping the object in view through her windshield as this craft hovered above. She said that the craft was hovering no higher than a large tree above the west side of the road but no trees were nearby.  The size of the craft was as big as a house but she really only saw the bottom left side of the craft perimeter.  She said that the perimeter reminded her of an octagon shape as it curved with four small yellow/white lights on the perimeter.  It had a larger nonpulsing red light in the middle underneath and she could tell of a metallic structuring at her vantage almost underneath it. It was at this point she decided to call somebody to rationalize what she was witnessing.  She decided to use her cell phone to call her supervisor whom she new was still on duty at the hospital.  She explained to her what the craft was doing and her supervisor asked if the craft was making any noise.  So she turned off her car radio that had been on and rolled down her window but she didn&apos;t hear any noise at all.  She then kept describing the following moments to her supervisor. A yellow/white beam of light came down out from the red light shining first in the roadside grass then it moved across the road.  It was at this point she said that the craft actually began to sway slightly back and forth causing the light beam to go back and forth across the highway 5 times.  This is when she noticed an approaching car from the south as it stopped just in front of the light beam in the road. The craft then began to move back the direction it came from slowly heading over the field then it suddenly vanished like the lights all blinked out at once. She was still driving slowly forward in her car and drove past the stopped car with  a man in the other car looked over at her as she drove past.  She didn&apos;t stop to ask him any questions and drove on home to Clinton. For some reason she didn&apos;t mention her sighting to anybody and had to be reminded later by her supervisor about the incident again.  Thus resulting in the delay to report it to NUFORC eight days later on May 16th. She said that now she keeps watching the sky and she has a camera in her car just in case something strange is possibly seen again. She promised to complete a questionnaire that I emailed to her that may give some more details of her encounter and return it back to me.((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Adams of the Missouri Investigators Group, and Bark Becker, its Director, for following up on this case, and sharing their findings.

As soon as I got a good fix on it it suddenly drifted straight up, and within ten seconds I could not find it anymore.Before I lost sight of it I am pretty sure it changed to an orangish color. 1.

I was looking up at the sky for falling stars and I noticed the planet Venus (at least I think it was Venus) to my right (South). Then as I turned to look in front of me (East) I noticed a very brilliant scintillating round, kind of almost diamond shaped looking object. It was very bright (like lights through a crystal) and colorful red, blue, yellow, purple and green. I stared at this object for a little while and I noticed it began to move rather slowly then stop( it moved a distance of about 24 inches if I measured the distance an arms length in front of my eyes) it also would get brighter then dimmer. I thought it was a weird sort of star at first until it moved, what really freaked me out however was what I saw next, something caught my eye to the right (South) not to far away from the position of the planet Venus. This was a small bright pure whitish blue light which was moving toward me and at a low altitude almost to the top of a tall tree in my neighbors yard. This light was round, about 6&apos; in diameter and very bright. It was able to start and stop at incredible speed it was moving side to side sometimes in a circular motion starting and stopping like it was looking for something? It stopped almost over where I was at I was scared somewhat by this time because I thought I was losing my mind and I did not know what this thing was and it was coming toward me! The light stopped almost over my position for about 1 minute maybe a minute and a half. Then it began to move East in the same type of start/stop motion I described this is where it got weirder it moved right into the big scintillating thing and came out like twice moving around the larger object. Then it went back into it and the larger object then slowly moved off to the Southeast until it was out of sight.

By the way I have a highly technical occupation am a college graduate and have gone to many an airshow. I have logged quite a few hours flying and have seen aircraft, satellites, balloons and falling stars on many an occasion both day and night, these things were not like anything I have ever seen fly before.

PD))While packing to leave my beach house, I looked up and saw a large, odd-shaped cloud that was very clearly glowing with a blue-green light.  It looked kind of like a trail left by an aircraft after the aircraft had been gone and the trail had widened, but this cloud did not move with the wind or dissipate.  I had the impression it was extremely high up (dozens of miles, perhaps).  The cloud/trail varied in thickness, and described a roughly 270-degree &quot;swoop&quot; or semicircle about five times the circumference of a full moon..  As it was an otherwise clear night, and I was intrigued by the trail, myself and two friends went over to the beach to get a better look and benefit from darker sky.  The cloud was very clearly glowing (not reflecting light) and the light was a pale greenish-blue.  It kind of looked to me what I always imagined aurorae might appear like.  Anyway, at the beach, we saw four people who claimed to see what caused the cloud.  They saw a very bright ball of light, the same color as the cloud, come tracking in quite quickly from the southeastern horizon and seemingly &quot;higher&quot;, it appeared to follow the curve of the earth.  Then, almost directly overhead, it kind of &quot;ricocheted&quot; and appeared to dissipate, the fading light flying very quickly toward the opposite (western) horizon and leaving the strange glowing cloud where it &quot;bounced&quot;.  In the darker sky, I could see a faint, very straight trail leading to the cloud from the direction which these other folks said the object originally appeared.  To me, it looked like the straight, slanting trail leading to the cloud was emanating from &quot;deeper&quot; into the sky, like the path of an object which &quot;fell&quot; from deeper space to the point of the cloud.  The other observers had claimed to see shooting stars and fireballs before, and that this object was a different color and moved much more slowly.  After about 10-15 minutes of observation, the cloud very slowly seemed to lose its &quot;glow&quot;, though it didn&apos;t really dissipate, and never move! d from its position almost directly overhead and just a bit out to sea (east).  My hypothesis at the time (and which I still believe, but would love to have confirmed) is that some sort of meteor, fairly large, struck the upper atmosphere and glanced off, leaving a &quot;bruise&quot; of ionized gas very high up, which slowly faded out.

At about 20:25 we began walking towards the area that I had seen the craft. We were in a large open field and I began looking towards the sky. There were no stars out, and the sun was going down. Soon I saw a small white dot far off in the distance. I showed it to my friend, and we sat and watched if it would move, thinking it might be a craft. It was moving slightly and soon blended into the sky. Then I noticed another odd thing in the sky, close to where the first craft had been. This one was much larger, possible closer than the first and it resembled a cloud or as if it was reflecting the sun&apos;s color. It was orange and did not move. We became aware it was not a cloud for the fact that it disappered. Now something was definitely strange about this part of the sky. We were still a bit hesitant to if we had seen anything out of the normal. Another white dot much resembling the first appeared under another cloud than the others, it soon disappered. So we knew something paranormal was happening and I started to search the sky for more objects. When suddenly, I looked directly above where me and my friend were sitting, it had a triangle shape on it, and a circlish-ovalish part on it. It was hovering and wasn&apos;t too far in the sky, definitely no star, which not one was in the sky. It started moving slowly away so I pulled the camcorder out of my backpack and recorded what I could of it before it completely disappeared. We packed our camera up and started heading back towards my friend&apos;s house where I had seen a craft the night before. I then noticed a rocket had appeared in the sky, it was probably military craft. I decided it was important to record this. Then, out of nowhere ANOTHER ROCKET appeared, this one had much stranger activity. I recorded them both. They were heading toward! s the same direction, where the first white dots were in the sky. The second craft either stopped, changed direction or was going really slow, because it was suspended in midair. Soon, it went behind a cloud.

I was assigned to the communications dept. Our Department and the Air ops Department had interchanged personel in the CDC prior to a upcoming deployment for a better relationship and understanding of each others jobs. Our ship set sail to a military operations area known as the SOCAL Naval Operations area. During one of the nights I went to the I had went to the smoking sponson on the outskirt of the ship. There were 8 other people pointing to the sky I looked up and saw a very odd triangle shaped object with 3 distinct light at each point moving very unusally. They Ask how are our jets moving like that. I had told them that our ship had not launched a jet nor even had any to launch and we were on a ship board training mission and did not envolve any aircraft. Also that we were alone in the entire Operations area. No other Ships or Aircraft was in the area for days. We had stared at the object abit then I had went to get a freind to witness this. At that time I realized I was in a place to go catch this on a radar. I went back to the Air ops station in the CDC and told the radar specialist to look at this object. He Stated that is was nothing other then a invalid track. I ask what makes this invalid. He had stated that the object was at 1200kph and speeding up to a unrecordable speed by our radar system thus for the system reports as invalid. I ask why then the system displayed it as a fixed wing craft. He stated for some reason the the object had a IFF system aboard. It was stating that is was a comercial aircraft. Something like a beoing 707. I had logged our current position and the path of this object and it was on a desert course towards the state of Nevada. The Obejct was large Triangle and had 3 unusual looking white lights. Being around many aircraft when i was watching this object move i was looking closely and the craft did have any port,starboard,foreward or aft light systems. Just a single light almost like ! it was being shined through a crystal. I also had seen a show in 2000 of a SDPD officer had captured this same object on his patrol car camera. I believe the date said 1998. It&apos;s been a long time since this happened. I always wanted to tell or report this but I did not want to be considered another UFO nut.

The driveway is a long driveway, about halfway down we saw two lights coming down this driveway. We both saw these lights, I thought it was a car coming down this driveway.I was fixing to say something about this car coming down at a pretty good speed. This car should have stopped to let us pass. As we went pass the end of the driveway my husband and myself looked up the driveway and saw nothing, no car or truck, it had not turned to right or left and nothing was blocking our view.

No noise.Hello and thank you for your services.It is 3am on Sunday the 6th of July.At between 12:03am and 12:05am the 6th of July, i was sitting on my balcony of my appartment and looking up at the night sky. The sky is quite clear tonight and there are a dozen stars visable.  I noticed a pale colored object moving slowly due south across the sky above me.  I stood and squinted(ive lost my glasses)and noticed it was not lit with strobes or anything that most aircraft are required to have.  Then i ran in and grabbed my binoculars and came out for a better look. At the same time i yelled at my girl friend to come look, because she has better vision.I was not completely alarmed when i first saw it, because i thought it was much higher and possibly a sattelite.  When i put the bino&apos;s on it, i then freaked out, because what i saw was definately not a known aircraft.  My heart was racing.The craft appeared to be a &quot;V&quot; shaped thing, or a &quot;boomerang&quot; shape.  It was tilted roughly 45-65 degrees from the horizon and from my perspective seemed to be between 1500-3000 ft altitude.  It was a pale color, possibly white, and seemed to only be lit by the city lights. I was a bit shakey with the bino&apos;s at first but could make out some rough details.  It had some kind of dark/black trim work, but i dont believe it was a silver colored object, because there was not glean or glint from the city lights off of the surface.  Its rotation was counter clockwise and probably no more than 1 revolution per second, but its spin changed slightly from half of that, more or less during its path.  Its path was steady, and in a south direction.   I live just north of the capitol building in Salem, and this craft was just north of being above that building.  Just further south is our airport, and it looked as though the craft got to the vicinity of being above the airport and then it stopped its flight path and hovered, while still spinning.  I climbed my railing for a better look because it was just about to go behind some trees in my line of sight.  When i got up the railing 2 seconds later, and put the bino&apos;s on it again it was simply gone. I immediately called 911 and reported it, if nothing else, there&apos;s a record of it if you call them i believe.  I asked if they had any other reports and he said no. I asked if he had a number for the airport. I wanted to contact someone at the radar station, but he said Salems airport(traffic control) was closed at this time of night. I had about 25-30 seconds of nice veiwing of the craft through my binoculars and have made detailed sketches. The craft made no noise. It filled my view in the binoculars.  It was roughly 1/2 to 3/4 the size of a full moon from my vantage point. If i were to make an amature guess, i would say it was possibly close to the size of a chinook helicopter.  It seemed to be traveling at the rate of a helocoptor moving at a fairly slow cruise. But it certainly wasnt any kind of craft ive seen before. Temperature 65-68 F Clear skys, some slight haze.  Some light polution No other oddities to report, expept a strange encounter with a homeless fellow in a near by park by me and my girl friend 3 hours earlier.

It moved from a Northeast to Southwest direction at an alarming rate of speed.  I am an amateur star gazer/sky wathcer and I know what a satellite looks like moving across the night sky.  I don&apos;t know of any satellites that move from East to West, and I&apos;ve never seen a sattelite moving this fast before.  It crossed the portion of sky visible to me (120 degrees) in less than 45 seconds.  There was no sound nor any streak or trail behind it.  I followed it until it disappeared over the trees.  My best explanation other than some kind of vehicle would be a meteor that passed close to Earth, but I saw no reports either way.  I am uncertain about the date and/or time, and had I known there was a website, I would have reported when it happened.  I know it was late in the year 2002 and that it was around 8:00 pm.

After pointing it out to others around him on the beach I eventually located one myself. At first I could not see what the others were able to see, then it came into focus. The one that I was able to view was of a different shape. The day was a perfect beach day, the sky was blue with puffy white clouds. The object that I saw along with the others appeared to be very high up. It&apos;s color could have been white or silver and long in shape. We live near JFK and Laguardia airports and are very familiar whith the various types of aircraft flying overhead. Whether it be a large jet, sometimes the the Concord, or small private planes flying along the coastline this object in no way resembled anything we have ever seen before. I am a World Trade Center survivor by only minutes and live less than a 1000 feet from the plane crash in Belle Harbor. While I was still looking at this object in the sky I called 911 and reported what I saw. I was thinking more along the lines of some terrorist controlled satellite than a spaceship of some sort. I am the kind of person who would sleep better if this could be explained logically. I have never seen anything like this before and when I mentioned it to a relative that wasn&apos;t there she said she heard of places where people can report such sightings and that is how I wound up here.P.S.

It was 8:30pm when we arrived.At that time the visibilty in the fog was about a half mile as I could just barely see the white light on the light tower.By 10:00 pm the visibility went down to zero.We were the only boat around as the other 3 left because of the fog.We were planning on fishing all night so it didn`t matter to us.About 1:00 am,my partner went to the front of the boat to lay down.I stayed in the back in my chair,still fishing.About 10 minutes went by and I happend to look up towards the sky and saw a green flashing light.My first thought was the fog was just thick at low-level and I could see up some,and I could see an airplane so I began to look for stars or clouds,but could see nothing else but this green flashing light.After about 10 seconds this flashing light began to zip from left to right,with each zig-zag a little higher or lower than the previous.That began to freek me out because I`ve never seen anything move like that or that fast in the air before.I called for my partner who was up immediatly.He saw it and we watched it as It headed straight down towards the water, again, very fast.I thought it was going into the water,but it stopped at water level and the light was stationary as to be in a *hover*.At that time it was in front of us,just to our left.After a few seconds of the hover it began to move slowly by us on our left,still at water level.After it went by and was off the back of the boat we saw it go straight up,only about 3 blinks of the light,then it was gone.He said to me WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT! I have no explanation as the way and the speed at which it darted and being the visibility, it had to be within 100 yards of me,and neither of us heard a sound,and it was dead calm out there.

The colors were green and slightly off red(pinkish). The colors were off because they looked like a mist or fog was moving with them covering each up. The speed of these crafts flying over must of been fast(between 3-5 seconds). Father estimated them at at between 1000-1500 mph(comparing them with jets that usually fly over from Seattle).

I was at a stoplight when I thought that it was very close to the ground (est. 500-600ft) and couldn&apos;t imagine an airplane being in such close proximity.  It was at this point when I realized that it appeared to be stationary and not moving.  It was approx. 1/8-1/4 mile down range and to my left as I was at the traffic light and as I continued on my way the road curves to the left and the object was now directly to my left about 9 o&apos;clock and still 500-600 ft in the air.  At this point I stopped my car in the middle of the road and rolled down the window to try and hear if it was a hovering helicopter or something.  It was dead quiet and now I could see that there were two distinct red pulsing lights to the rear of this object.  They pulsed slowly and intermittently.  I stared at this object in utter disbelief all the while waiting for another car to come by so I could verify this with someone else.  There were no other cars around.  I couldn&apos;t believe it and as I continued to stare at this thing for about 30-45 seconds I know it was completely still in its position.  Very bright forward lights with no defraction of light, by the way, and slowly pulsing red rear lights.  After this duration of time, this &quot;thing&quot; completely catapulted forward from its position roughly 1/4-1/2 mile away within 1/2-1 second.  When it did this I had a distinct guttural vibration of some sort and it took off like that and slowed immediately.  I literally screamed and took off to come home.  After I made my left turn at the next light  I knew I could see this object about 1/4 mile down the road and to my left because it was a clear view from there.  As I passed this area I could see the red pulsing lights, still the same distance above the ground but it looked to be about 3/4 mile away and it seemed to be slowly moving in that direction (away from me).  I made my right turn to enter my housing! development (300 feet away) and as I was going down this road I kept looking in my rearview mirror to see if I could see anything at all.  As I was driving down this winding road, all of a sudden this &quot;craft&quot; of somesort appears at my 11o&apos;clock and coming directly overhead on a slight angle so that as it passed over I would then be at my 5 o&apos;clock position.  It still seemed to be about 500-600 feet above ground and I again stopped my car in the middle of the road and rolled down my window to stick my head out to get a better view.  I was literally shaking with fear and/or excitement, I guess.  As it passed over me very slowly, I could make out what seemed to be underneath structure of some sort with 4 additional &quot;lights&quot; facing downward.  Because of the location of the red still pulsing lights, I had the distinct impression that it was sort of triangular in shape but more like a wedge/boomerang.  It was moving very slowly and didn&apos;t make any noise at all.  It was extremely quiet and it traveled out of my sightline (many trees line this street)and I raced home thinking it was going to turn around and follow me.

We love to look for shooting stars.  As we walked out the door, we noticed a super bright star.  As we gazed at it we realized it was moving.  It became brighter and brighter in the sky mostly straight up a little to the western horizon.  This &apos;star&apos; was traveling from south to north and then stopped, turned, and headed toward space.  We watched as it disappeared from view.  As this was not the first time I&apos;ve seen this strange event, I finally decided to report it somewhere.  Last year on Sept. 7, 2002 at approximately 11 pm again, 3 of us saw the same thing in the eastern sky.  It headed right at us and we thought it was a shooting star.  As in came closer, I actually became frightened as I thought maybe it was a meteorite going to hit or something.  I hadn&apos;t ever seen anything like it.  It finally changed direction heading south and then changed direction again and headed into space until it disappeared.  The object both times was extremely high...as if in space, but much bigger than a star or satelite.  It didn&apos;t have the lights of a plane or jet and didn&apos;t move like any kind of plane I&apos;ve ever seen.  It was much too high to be a helicopter.

I focused my attention back on the glowing object over the air station. this object moved slowly to the south then moved north slowly and kept going.

My friends and I were playing in the field that we always played football in, in back of our houses. When we first saw this thing we kind of just tried to figure out what it was. One of my friends&apos; older friends son was a pilot of some sort and had a type of cb setup or such in his basement that the old woman would let us kids see, so my friend said he would try and see if its locator could tell us what was in the area at the time. Everyone but me took off for dinner, and I just wanted to wait for my other friend to come back and tell me what it was. Everyone said our parents wouldnt believe us anyway, so whats the use? It was just hovering like over me and kept changing shapes, and one minute you could see it clearly and the next it would fade in and out. I thought they were all chicken-shits, and tomboy that I am I just studied it. My friend was taking too long, yet it was like it could tell I wasnt afraid of it and it didnt really want me to tell anyone. Then it backed up like a zoom and vanished. None of us ever said a word except me, it was like no one else remembered or something, and it was very strange. As it moved though, I remember that it did change not only its looks but shape and color of its windows also. I did not see any aliens or anything looking out, but when it was almost transparent, I still knew it was there and sometimes you could see an outline of sorts. There seemed to be a crystal kind of effect in there whan it was changing almost like it could radiate electricity of info that was bouncing on it or off it, like it could absorb info like that. And the windows sometimes went around the body in a certain shape fast then slow, slow then fast, and extremely fast at that. And those colors were like they werent really there either, like they were playing with them or making them up as they went until they got it right. Maybe they just liked the game we were playing and wanted to analize why we were. And maybe the lights were our score....or t! heir excitement, or that I was not afraid. I did not at any time feel afraid of them either, it was like I knew or should know who they were, or why they came to see me? I only know that just recently I have had the pleasure to see them up close checking me out in my sleep. And when I felt their presence I awoke to see a connect the dots kind of starman bending over me, and then a smaller one walking towards him, touching his arm telling him it was time to go now, and they did. I wish I knew if this was real. There is no history of anything weird in my family on both sides, and my friends will not talk about it further. When I mention it they sort of go blank and act like I never mentioned it. That is bizarre! Well, I hope that someday, when I go wherever it is we go &amp; if we do, that I find out instead of just dwindling into the vast universe with no answer either. That would suck. Thanks for looking at this, enjoy, and I hope others can be there with me if they do seem to be nice....C-Ya  Me   P.S. Till this day it is like I still dont believe it myself what I saw like I am deprogrammed or jumbled or something like that &amp; it feels weird to recall or try to but at the same time is still fresh in my memory- just plain wierd feeling.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

After about 5 min we noticed some unusual lights over the ocean. Due east off Fl coast. In one&apos;s vision,you would have the beach in the lower vision and the upper the sky. Within the sky portion it was 1/3 of it above the horizon/beach. The lights would have appeared to be about an inch to two inches across together. The lights themselves were rectangular shaped and evenly spaced in a parallel line. The Light swere also orange in color and stationary. They disappeared all of a sudden like someone turned off a lightswitch. We observed them for about 15- 30 sec. For the most part it was a fairly clear night. There were some cirrus clouds over head and a bank of clouds off near the horizon but these lights were definately no where near clouds. It was a full moon so there was plenty of stuff visible. After the lights disappeared nothing could be seen where they once were.

It was much like a tear. Blue lights circled the bottom of it and a yellow one at the top. I stood there in disbelief watching it. It didnt move. It just hovered maybe 5 feet above my yard. I didnt want to look away for fear i might loose it. In what seemed like hours it finally shot straight up into the sky in a streak of blue light.

The duration of observation is 4 minutes. The written witness:  &quot;I take a few moments to report the observation of a UFO phenomenon I have just witnessed last night. I am not someone who indulges in tellinh his personal stories but in this case I consider that it is my duty to share my experiment in order to help someone else or quite simply to get some hints and have someone tell me what I saw because I am still disturbed by it this morning on my arrival in Montreal.&quot;  &quot;I left from Chicoutimi at about 2:10 A.M. to drive to Montreal. The night is hot and the moon strongly lights the forest of the park of Laurentides. When I arrived between the junction of Alma and L&apos;Etape two lengthened and vers luminous elliptic discs fly over the forest on my left at approximately 50 meters of my vehicle. I start to observe them without quitting them from the eyes and I completely open the window to make sure that they are not reflections or something like that and they follow me during a lomg moment. The light which surrounds the two UFOS is whitish and their movement is very particular. They make abrupt movement and move fast laterally and ahead. I can perfectly see the two UFOS during approximately 10 seconds then they disappear a split second to reappear during a moment. I wondered during one moment if they followed my car because they followed me like this during approximately 4 minutes which were very long for me. Then whereas the two UFOS in the shape of lengthened discs follow me laterally, I see two other UFOs ahead which are movin in the opposite direction to join them and thus make a formation with 4 in rhombus, which move strangely with sharp and precise movements but always with logic. Approximately at the third minute there are not two only to move above the forest, but four luminous discs. The feeling I have at this this moment is both fear and amazement but I do not want to pull up for two reasons; firstly to not lose sight of them, then by pure fear that if they also immobilize their movements I would have quite simply lost my nerves. Thereafter, the four UFOs came above the road during a few seconds in front of my car (approximately at 70m), then directed themselves again to the forest on my left. Whereas I lost sight of them I see at the same time interval 5 seconds) a plane, helicopter or another apparatus which comes by in the North at the same place where I observed the UFOs, the pilot of this craft probably saw the phenomenon because he was at the heart of the p! henomenon also. The size of the UFOs was of approximately the length of three long cars (could be smaller) and they flew relatively low at the tree top at certain moments.&quot;  &quot;I do not write this story for the pleasure but to have answers to my questions, what I saw this night. If someone saw the same observations than myself this same night in the park of Laurentides please please let it be known (I believe that I crossed 10 vehicles in the 200 km of the park and none during the observations). a second question annoys me a lot, which was this craft at low altitude seen at the same time when I lost sight of the four UFOs, was this a plane, a helicopter or something else. If somebody can have access to the possible flights of aircraft at 2:55 in the morning in this sector of the park of Laurentides there are strong chances that the pilot saw the UFO phenomenon and could testify about it but who knows who this craft belongs to. One thing is certain is that if I have had a video camera people could have be shown a spectacular display who would have upset them, nevertheless I reported it back the best than I can and if somebody can enlight me do not hesitate to write to me.&quot;  Thanks to this witness.

Couldn&apos;t get it to focus clearly. The pet cats were climbing all over us, and they usually don&apos;t want to cuddle with me, so I thought that was odd. I got up from my chair in the driveway and looked up above the tall, surrounding trees to see if I could find the moon, easier to focus on. I turned around to look behind us , and above the Douglas firs and the house was a bright white light.Complete circle, breifly thought it was the moon, but it had an electrical glow. I asked my friend&quot;what&apos;s that?&quot; She said she didn&apos;t know- not a lamp.She tried to focus on it with the telescope, and when she put her eye to the eyepiece the light flashed brightly. My friend jerked her head away and exclaimed that the light had hurt her eye.

Cable, wireless phone and the hardline telephone was out as well because I tried to dial in to check email and see if there was a bad storm coming. I went downstairs to unplug the TV and stereo because I know they are usually at risk when a surge of power hits when power is restored. I also grabbed some candles. When I walked in the family room - I smelled a VERY HIGH concentration of ozone, similar to my Ionic Breeze when it&apos;s turned on after being cleaned but it was not on and had not been on all day. Looking out the back window I saw it. The object was probably 30-40deg declination directly to my west. When I finally stepped outside, there was no storm that knocked out the power - actually, there was not a single sound at all - not even crickets or passing cars. The vehicle was probably 300-600 feet up (but hard to say exactly) and moved erratically but seemed to be hovering. It would wobble to the left and right and below it were two independent blue-ultra/violet-blue strobing halos that made the bottom of the vessel glow in this eerie blue. I was petrified watching it in awe and did not get a picture of it but I certainly studied it enough to accurately describe/draw it.

I am not sure what the exact time was because I currently do not have a clock in my bedroom on hand... I felt it must&apos;ve been some time between 1-3 A.M.  I had my window open all night since the weather was warm earlier that day.  For some strange reason, I woke up out of a sound sleep and seconds later I heard what sounded like a small airplane buzzing in the distance and it was getting closer.  After a moment the sound grew louder and louder and I recognized that it was the sound of helicopters, maybe two or three.  These helicopters then began to fly EXTREMELY low over and through the tree tops of our quiet wooded neighborhood.  I knew that by this time, all of the neighbors were probably awaken by this event.  The helicopters, for ten minutes circled low, several times as if looking for something.  They were low, but circled a wide perimeter of the forest and I could not see them.  It was the last couple of minutes, one of the helicopters finally circled in closer.  I saw a black helicopter with a very bright searchlight and with bright blue and red lights underneath.  I did not see the other two, but I know there was more than one.  I&apos;m not sure if they were King County Police or military!?  After ten minutes, they flew away in the southwest direction.  It was right after they left, I heard a strange low hum outside in the area that lasted for a few minutes and faded.  In the morning, I asked my family, who also had their windows open, if they woke up and heard this terribly loud event and they said, &quot;No,&quot; and that they were all fast asleep.  Something was strange about this.  These helicopters were frantically chasing and looking for something in these woods.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

I was as straight as a die as I had badly sprained my ankle the night before and didn&apos;t want to &quot;party hard&quot;  and make it worse (there was a good band and usually I love to dance) so had drank only two cans of premixed bourbon and cola over a period of about 7 hours prior to driving a car load of people back to my place who had been indulging. All up there were two car loads of us.  Our bach is situated on top of a hill which has a 360 degree view all around but the front of the place has huge windows which look directly out to the Pacific (directly east).  There is approximately 400 metres of land between us and the beach and it is totally flat - the top of our hill is probably about 5 or 6 storeys high...  Being a farming/rural community, the coast around here is reasonably unpopulated and there was only one house between us and the beach, an old homestead which my husband grew up in - about 100 m away from the hill between us and the beach.  There were no roads although a &quot;farm track&quot; lead to the beach. October in New Zealand is still pretty cold, although officially spring, and we were all huddled together on the deck waiting for my partner to open the door when we all noticed two headlights coming straight towards us from the direction of the beach/sea.  We quickly realised that it wasn&apos;t a car as we were at eye level with these headlights and they were somewhat bigger.  The weird thing was that there was no noise and they had &quot;snuck up&quot; on us to quite a close distance without us realising.  Our initial reaction was that it was a plane or helicopter (do they have headlights?) and they were on a collison course with the hill (and us!) as they appeared to be getting closer and closer.  We were all talking about it when my husband finally got the door open and we all spilled inside.  I remember saying, quick turn on some lights so they can see it is a hill and a house and don&apos;t hit us.  We turned on the lights and everyone arranged themselves around the kitchen breakfast bar which looked over the sea.  I had gone straight to the window with one of the other girls and was amazed to see that the &quot;headlights&quot; were almost within striking distance but then in a &quot;blink&quot; of my eyes they had suddenly jumped back to sit out somewhere over the sea.  At this point they were bearly distinguishable as &quot;headlights&quot; and then suddenly seemed to be more of a diamond shape.  I verified with my friend that I wasn&apos;t seeing things and we tried to engage the others to reaffirm what we had all seen.  It was funny because they all sat down and opened drinks and seemed to forget about the headlights that had been coming straight at us minutes before.  We tried to get their attention and point out that the head lights had suddenly gone from about to hit us to sitting way back and they all went yeah yeah you guys are out of it!  Anyway, knowing that I was absolutely NOT out of it (may be a bit tired) I decided to go outside to have a better look as it was hard to know whether I was seeing things properly looking through the window and sheilding my eyes from the light inside.  It was pitch black outside except for a few dim stars and this bright white light which every now and then seemed to glow red and move about suddenly.  I felt a wee bit scared and got my girlfriend to come outside too.  We seemed to be the only ones interested or who remembered what had just happened... Once we got outside I was almost certain that the shape was a diamond although it had moved even further back, still at eye level though.  All of a sudden it zig zagged from side to side and seemed to come closer, then settled directly in front of us but further away.  I really thought my eyes were playing tricks on me and said to my friend... did you see that? She said yep and not wanting to lead her, I said, what did you see? and she descibed the zig zap movement too.  This thing must have been moving fast as it went from the left to right of our field of vision and back again several times in a matter of seconds.  At this point we got the binoculars and resting my arms on the fence to ensure I didn&apos;t wobble, I tried to see something.  It was too far away and only confirmed that it was vaguely diamond shaped, it was really bright and occasionally seemed to flash red but far enough back now that even through binoculars was hard to distinguish.  I gave up.  We started to run through all the things it could possibly be and logic said it wasn&apos;t any of them, ie. not a satellite as they orbit the earth on a horizontal plane, not a star as we had never seen one there before and they tended to pass overhead as night waned to day (incidentially I have looked and looked and never seen anything remotely like that light at any time of year, ever again), etc... We were determined to keep an eye on it and at one point started to feel that maybe it was keeping an eye on us!  Every now and again we would go back in and tell the others it was still there but they told us we were seeing things.  It zig zagged several times after that and occasionally appeared to come closer (and we got ready to run inside) but always it settled just beyond our field of truly distinguishable vision. We decided to keep an eye on it until it went away and finally it sat at a point which we realised was the horizon as the sun came up, and there it stayed until about 8.00 am.  As the sky lit up it maintained its brightness while the stars dimmed and faded out completely by about 7.00 am.  We watched the family in the house below arise and soon summised that even if farmers/early risers did look to the sky, unless they knew where to look, they probably would have missed this object or dismissed it as a star. By this time we had &quot;landmarks&quot; to measure the object against, being several little islands near the horizon.  As the sun rose we were able to confirm that it was sitting just above and to the right of the one on the right. We were tired by now and nothing &quot;exciting&quot; had happened for quite some time so we would go inside and come out every half hour or so to check...  Around 8.00 am we realised that having sat stationery for most of the night, the object was now moving up, back and to the left at a considerable speed.  We could still see it because we knew where to look but, although bright, it was becoming much smaller as it moved away.  By about 10.00 am we could still see it getting smaller and further away and finally giving up, noted that it had moved a lot from its original position... instead of just above and to the right of the right island, it was now considerably to the left of the left island (bearing in mind the islands are situated straight ahead and directly to the east) and instead of near the horizon, was high in the sky, and a mere pinprick of bright light, having at first been of a size considerably larger and brigher than the largest and brightest star. Over the years, we have talked of this experience to numerous people and not all have scoffed.  I didn&apos;t know who to report it to so didn&apos;t.  A few people even related their UFO stories to me.  One guy was on his way from shopping with his wife after work, when coming out of the city, noticed a many storied, brightly lit object hovering over the sea.  They pulled over and looked at it, as did the car behind them, before it disappeared.  He is disappointed that they then drove off without verifying it with the driver of the other car. Another was an airline pilot who looked at me in horror when I asked him if he believed in UFO&apos;s.  I proceeded to tell my story anyway, at which point he relaxed, and realising that I wasn&apos;t going to cite him mad or cause him to lose his job, he told of a time near New Caledonia, an island in the Pacific, when his commercial flight and an American plane were both circling to land and reported an unidentified object sitting between them.  It didn&apos;t show on the radar on land or their planes, but the cockpit crews of both planes had visually identified it and started discussing it sitting between them, at that point it suddenly accelerated straight up in the air from a motionless position, at extremely high speed, and disappeared. Another friend who does air traffic control told me that something once crossed his radar and went off the screen in a matter of seconds - many in the control tower witnessed it and none can explain it as the speed at which it was flying was so much greater than anything known at that time.((NUFORC Note:  Date in October 1995 is approximate.

Grant (brother) is facing South West at approx 2:00pm (race was due to start at 2:15) two New Zealand air force Orions (I think) caught his eye as they approached and then flew directly over the school, he took 1 pic as they approached, and another as they were directly over head.

Lastly, check out my UFO! The photo called Planes_3 was taken while we waited for racing to start. Two Orions or Hercules from Whenuapai flew straight over the top of the school. When overhead I took the photo Planes_1. When I got them back yesterday from processing there is a funny silver disc at the top of the shot. When you look through the Lupe you can see a flat round base, a ridge running around the centre with white spots and the silver finish. It is slightly blurred at the back left corner. It appears on the negatives and seems too disc shaped to be a balloon.

We both lived on the same road and he drove me home, about 2 miles from my house we saw a strange sphere shaped object on the right side of the road above a security light its lights were so bright you could see them over the brightness of the security light, it had every color of the spectrum and the lights moved across the center of the object like a belt with a new color flashing every second. We stopped in the middle of the road and watched in amazement as it started to decend on the hill next to the road, it was rather large in appearence so it appeared to me that it was only 200 to 300 feet from the ground, we rounded the curve to get a better view only to discover that it had vanished.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I will email it to you...", "Six small silvery-white spherical shapes, moving very rapidly across the daytime sky, one at a time over 15 minutes.This account is true and describes what a I, along with a friend, witnessed today in the skies over Lenexa, Kansas. Around 12:35 in the afternoon today, 06/09/03, after unloading some very heavy 6x6 posts, I had reclined on my back on the deck I was building to catch my breath.  I looked up into a nearly cloudless blue sky and just happened to see something streaking across the sky directly above us.  I watched it for a few moments, trying to identify it in my own mind, but had no luck making sense of it at all.  It seemed to be a small spot of silvery white, made no noise at all, and really had no discernable shape other than spherical.  It looked small, and moved incredibly fast, moving from horizon to horizon directly overhead in little more than about 10 seconds.  My first thought was it was my first daylight glimpse of a satellite, but it moved much too fast for that. My brother and I grew up watching and counting orbiting satellites at night in the skies over Wyoming, so I&apos;m very familiar with how they move, but had never seen one in daylight.  I discounted the idea, realizing it didn&apos;t seem to be high enough to be in orbit.  As the object neared the far horizon, on a Southwesterly to Northeasterly course, I suddenly sat bolt upright, the realization hitting me that I couldn&apos;t identify what I had been watching, and said to my friend, &quot;What the hell is that?!&quot;  He didn&apos;t see it and I immediately tried to point it out to him but as I did it faded from visibility into the distant sky.  I described it to him, still looking skyward, saying, &quot;God, I wish you had seen that...&quot;, when suddenly there was another, coming from roughly the same direction, on the same general heading as the first, Northeast.  I quickly pointed this one out to my friend, and he immediately spotted it and began tracking it across the sky. Now I consider myself a serious aviation enthusiast, and I know military aircraft better than most people, even other enthusiasts.  I served in the Air Force as a flight line mechanic, and my buddy who was with me served in the Navy where he specialized in guided missiles, so it&apos;s my opinion we both understand basic propulsion systems, the dynamics of flight, and the capabilities - AND the limitations of manned flight.  Neither of us could explain what we were seeing, we thought through all the possibilities we could think of, everything from high flying experimental aircraft, to cotton seeds floating on the breeze to meteors entering the earth&apos;s upper atmosphere and burning up.  There were inherent flaws with each of these possibilites though... the objects didn&apos;t &quot;float&quot; on any breeze, they were on a laser straight course and moving at a very high rate of speed, they didn&apos;t seem to be burning or breaking up as any other meteor does, they didn&apos;t emit any sound whatsoever, left no vapor trails or contrails... almost as if they didn&apos;t disturb the air at all.  And any aircraft moving as fast as these were would most certainly have broken the sound barrier and delivered the telltale thunderous &apos;clap&apos;. As we stood staring in utter disbelief at the sky, the object quickly disappeared beyond the horizon to our Northeast.  We frantically searched the sky for any other activity, and to our surprise after a minute or two there came another object, again moving from the same general direction.  That made three so far, and again we both watched in amazement.  They all headed the same direction, yet each was on it&apos;s own trajectory.  Some looked slightly larger than others, giving the indication of a difference in altitude, though that&apos;s tough to speculate on, not knowing the size of the objects. By this time I tried to call my wife (exacly 12:44pm according to my cell phone log)but only got her voicemail.  I then dialed my brother in Idaho and excitedly told him what we were witnessing, as we spoke.  They kept coming, a few minutes apart, until we counted six altogether.  At one point, I watched one of the objects (which seemed either larger or lower in altitude) moving at a slower pace than the rest.  As it neared the far horizon, roughly 70% of the way across the viewable sky, it seemed to suddenly accelerate.  We called the homeowner out after seeing the 6th object, hoping for a 3rd set of eyes to confirm what we were seeing, but by the time he got outside it was gone from view, and with that, our encounter was over.  We watched the skies intermittently for the next hour or so, but saw nothing more. While the activity was ongoing, we considered taking digital pictures, but realized it would be pointless because the camera couldn&apos;t possibly capture such small points in the sky with any clarity.  Plus we just didn&apos;t think we&apos;d keep seeing more of them so we just stood transfixed, trying to debunk what we were starting to suspect. This was my first sighting of anything I could consider as even possibly having been of a non-terrestrial nature.  I was excited, yet still questioned whether I had just seen what I had just seen, if that makes sense.  Like everyone else, I had seen the movies, heard the stories, seen the picures and read eye-witness accounts of similar encounters.  I had always suspected something or someone else was out there, but I&apos;d never seen anything firsthand.  Now suddenly here I am confronted with my own personal evidence - and understand I can&apos;t completely convince anyone else of what we saw - but now I have firsthand knowledge of something that supposedly doesn&apos;t exist.

I was sitting in a lounge chair that lays back. I dont know why but for some reason I looked up. I know what I saw was not a plane or lights off some gas ball. There were 5 circles in the sky. Each one was a off white color. They did&apos;nt move they did&apos;nt blink they just sat there. But they were&apos;nt by them selfs. They were hooked to something else. The circles were in a circular pattern, as if they were attached to something. They were about 5 feet from one another. But you could see them clear.....it was&apos;nt a plane! Those lights were attached to the left side of some kind of craft. I told my wife to look at it. When she saw it she got a little scared and went inside. I stayed out there for maybe 15 more minutes. When I got to the upper part of the hotel I looked out over the rail. They were gone......just like that....gone no noise..nothing. Well when I went inside my wife did&apos;nt really wont to talk about it. Later on that night I would say around 3;15 am. I woke up to a very bright light outside the hotel window. I got up and looked out the door. It was so bright when I opened the door you could&apos;nt even see the parking lot. I dont remember much after that....not even going back to bed. But the next morning I woke up with a cut in the middle of my arm. Not a big cut, but a cut. It was&apos;nt there when I went to bed. Well after comeing back home the cut stayed on my arm for about 2 weeks. Did&apos;nt scab up....did&apos;nt bleed...nothing. Then the next morning it was gone! No scar...nothing. I have never had any trouble with my body before that night. But ever since I saw what I saw. Ive had bad headaches...and my right arm goes num. I know it sounds stupid but it&apos;s the truth.

I didn&apos;t see the object in the sky at the time, but when I looked at the photos afterwards there was a curious, bright shape in the sky, shaped I suppose like a teardrop.  Using a long exposure soaks up whatever light is in the sky, even stuff you don&apos;t see with the naked eye.  For example, keeping the shutter open for ten seconds over a solid blue sky could reveal distinct, clear clouds once the photograph is developed (or you view the digital photos, such as mine).  The object was definitely stationary because otherwise it would have been streaked.  It wasn&apos;t a reflection or something stuck on the lens because it would have shown up in other pictures.  Also, as the position of the camera changed, the object remained in the same place.  There&apos;s a small, very faint, circle of light surrounding it.  So there&apos;s no question that it was something in the sky and not a glitch with the camera.

To get a better look I shielded my eyes and looked ahead of it a bit. I don&apos;t wear glasses so there was no reflection. The object was moving from south to north and I noticed a faint blue crescent or what may have been lights around the leading edge and sides with a faint yellowish circle in what would appear to be the middle. From the few seconds that I saw this I can only estimate that it was traveling at approximately 1200 to 1500 miles per hour. Estimated altitude is rough to even estimate but I would guess it was around 10,000 to 15,000 feet. It crossed roughly 30% of the sky in about 3 to 4 seconds. What I waited for after it went out of sight was the noise of it&apos;s engines. There was none. It was absolutely silent, and there wasn&apos;t any other aircraft in the area at the time that it went overhead.I know it sounds a little nuts, it sure does to me, but I grew up around the airline industry.

At one point, something burning or flickering dropped from it. It was just a tiny little flicker that came down. We all went: `Oooh, what was that?&apos;&quot;  No one seems to know. That includes ((name #2 deleted)) of Saratoga, who spied the object Tuesday night while lounging with her husband in their backyard spa.Yauger said the light appeared high in the northwestern sky, first moving toward them, then away. Through her binoculars, the apparition became a cluster of lights. &quot;It was scary. When it started get- ting larger, it seemed to be coming down,&quot; she said. Yauger didn&apos;t see the object fade from view because she had just gone into the house. Her husband told her the light turned green and slowly disappeared. Spokesmen at Moffett Field Naval Air Station said nothing flew out of their airfield Tuesday that looked like that. And officials at Vandenberg Air Force Base in Lompoc said they didn&apos;t launch a thing Tuesday night.

My friend had a digital camera and was shooting photographs of his son playing in the water. None of us saw anything unusual at that time. When my friend looked at his pictures at home, however, he found a very strange sight: a distinct, silver, disc-shaped object in the air between the beach where we had been and another peninsula of the island in the distance.

The time of the event is approximate - it may have been an hour or more later. I spotted the object to the northwest of my Renton location in the direction of downtown Seattle.My first impression of the dark object was that it was perhaps a dirigible in place to observe fireworks displays, but if it was something the size of a dirigible it would have to be at an altitude at which dirigibles are not normally seen.  My curiosity piqued, I grabbed my binoculars to get a better look. What I observed for the next five minutes or so was simply puzzling. The shape was similar to a blimp but rounded on each end - an egg shape that is elongated somewhat on its horizontal axis. The color was dark , there were no appendages. I wondered what I was seeing as the thing drifted slowly to the south , apparently wind born. Only once did the thing seem as if it could possibly be under some control when the larger end turned into the wind, but that motion would be consistent with the action of the wind on its shape. I took particular notice of an odd coloration on the smaller end a couple of minutes into the observation when it was about due west. Might this have been a reflection of the sunset?  At any rate I lost the object when I moved to the front of my building. It was then to the southwest. My impression was that the object was three to eight feet in length.   I didn&apos;t call the sighting in because it seemed to be some very odd type of balloon.  It turned in the wind as a balloon would.

Note: about four minutes later we were on an adjacent road and viewed a jet, clearly visible against the moon, heading southwest, the opposite of the craft. the jet picked up speed and we have agreed that it had to have been going at least mock 1, because of the jetstream and the length of time it took to clear our view(at least a four mile radious, we stopped by a field) we contiued to watch the sky for a moment and about 1 to 2 minutes later two more jets were visibly seen goin! g northeast toward the craft. they too were flying exeptionally fast. one came from the southwest, the other from the west. getting closer to each other, then they left our line of sight.", "Followed object in my car for 13 blocks it stopped hung in air for 3min. then went opposite direction and was gone.This event happened during the summer on a cloudless day.

The object proceeded to float eastward over the east river - a description that someone used earlier this year is perfect - &quot;a string of illuminated pearls&quot; trailing this black balloon-esque object.  The strings were stationary, i.e. not moving around - just trailing the object.  It looked like a moving constellation.", "blue light  changing shape and brightnessI would like to first say I understand how important your website is. I have a hard time discussing the topic with friends and family. I have had numerous sighting and experiences since I was a child. Last year on the same day on July,07/13/02, I went to sleep in my bed room around 12 A.M. I was laying in my bed watching the television for around a half an hour. Nothing much was on the t.v, so I turned it off and started to close my eyes. The lights were off and the room was pitch black. I was still awake. I want to make it very clear that I was awake and not drifting off to sleep. I&apos;ve had a real problem falling asleap in the past two years, I&apos;ve seen a doctor about this. On a usual night I will just lay in bed thinking about the day and things going on in my life. This is what I was doing that night. I all of a sudden felt strange and heard a faint sound, almost like that of a pool filter being on. It was a kind of humming, but not loud at all. I felt nervous and looked out of the window by my bed. Above my roof was a blue light. It changed colors and sizes, yet did not seem to be moving. Still in bed, I tried to get up, but found my body frozen. I could not move. Then suddenly I felt my legs being pulled and my body being moved from my bed. I tried to scream, but I could not talk. I became worried that I would stop breathing. I have never been so scared in my life. The strange thing is that this is all I remember. I regained control over my body and got out of bed and looked out of the window. The light was gone. I glanced over at my alarm clock, andit read 2:30 A.M. Over two hours had passed, but the whole experience felt like only minutes; I am positive that I did not dream this, and know that I was awake the entire time of the occurance. This was not the last time this kind of episode has happended. Only a month ago I had two similar things happen. One was scary as all hell! I was laying in bed ready to fall asleap when a small light, almost like a lighting bug flew by my dresser. ! Then I was frozen and could not move, but I could move my eyes. My head was facing my couch and there I saw &quot; Myself &quot; sitting on the couch. I was so stricken with fear, it was so real. I was watching myself from a behind the scenes point of view. I then fell asleep. I&apos;ve had missing time episodes all of my life, and numerous times I&apos;ve seen strange moving lights in the sky. One time I watched an unidentified object flying in circles and changing color, I saw it from the raod and followed it to scudder Beach on Long Island. I saw a suffolk county police car parked near by and asked if the officer would take a look. The two of us watched in awe this strange light. Anyway I thought I would write what has happened in my life. Do what you want with it, draw a conclusion. But the fact is these things happened and scare me.", "Watch Spherical object for 15 Minutes over BrooklynI had just finished a bike ride in Marine Park and went across the street to the Salt Marshes to unwind from the ride.  The view from the back of the parks department building is beautiful and peaceful. Plus the view is clear to the horizon, which is very rare in Brroklyn.  While I was looking out over the Marsh, I saw a flash of light from the sky.  I looked up and saw the usual planes comming and going because I live close to JFK and La Guarida Airports. But there was an object comming up from the south and heading in a Northerly direction that did look like or act like a jet.  This object which I watched for 15 minutes was spherical in shape and had a light gray metalic color to it.  It was high above the clouds which made it impossible to see any other features on this craft.  I did not see any flashing lights on it either. At first the craft was comming up from the south in a straight line.  What made it different from the jets is that is was wobbling as it was moving and it wasn&apos;t on the same path as all the other jets were. The weather this day was clear with a few fair weather clouds in the sky.  I know that it was high up because a cloud passed in front of it and I lost sight of it for a moment, while all the jets in the area were flying below the clouds.  After watching for several minutes, the craft went off its course and started following one of the jets that was heading in an easterly direction. What bothered me it that the craft descended a bit while doing this and I thought for a moment it was going to crash into the jet. As this was happening a cloud was passing by and I noticed that the craft went behind the cloud and the jet was in front of it which means there must of still been some height distance between the two. Then the unidentified craft switched directions and start heading away from the jet in a westerly direction.  It did that for a couple of minutes, then turned into a northerly direction.  The craft was getting closer to me, not straight above me but still ! on an angle when a large cloud came by.  It took a couple of minutes for the cloud to pass.  When it did the craft was gone.  As a said earlier I watched this craft for 15 minutes before it went behind the large cloud.  It was not moving fast at all, more like a slow meandering pace.  I am somewhat interested in UFO&apos;s and have visited this site in the pass to see what&apos;s going on in the tri-state area.  I probably  would not have filed this report if I hadn&apos;t seen two other reports from my area on the same day.  I&apos;ve never seen anything like this in the 43 years I&apos;ve been alive.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  We believe that a helium blimp would be the first possibility to be ruled out, although the description by the witness does not appear to us to fit that profile.  PD))", "((NUFORC Note:  We are confused by several elements of this report.  Perhaps the witnesses observed a launch from Vandenberg AFB, but their description is of something much closer.  Moreover, missiles are launched to the south from Vandenberg, so a missile would not have been seen from the Colorado River moving from left to right, unless it was a launch out into the Pacific.  However, we believe that those launches, intended to test the anti-ballistic missile capability of rockets launched in the mid-Pacific Ocean, began only relatively recently, not in 1971.  We have asked for clarification from the party who submitted the report.  PD))There seemed to be no dissipation of the glow coming from the sphere. It surrounded it, stretched in one direction and stopped!?As my friend and I neared the end of our month-long drift down the Colorado River, we noticed a concentrated illumination going from right to left and stretching halfway across, maybe 300 meters downstream. We speculated it was coming from car headlights, but reminded ourselves we were still quite a ways from a driveable road. Guiding ourselves close to the bank using partially submerged stumps and branches to steer us, we came to an inlet and up on the bank which rose at about 30 degrees we observed an incandescent sphere of light hovering about three feet above the ground and perfectly still. It was somewhere between twelve and sixteen feet in diameter and was no more than 30 or 40 feet away from us on the level ground above the bank. We observed it for the longest six minutes or so and noticed that it appeared perfectly symmetrical and hazily transparent except for an irregularly shaped denser bluish-green core, maybe four feet across and two feet high. We could not see through this portion of the sphere. It made no sound and eerily all sounds on the river (muskrats diving in etc.) seemed to have ceased from when we first noticed the (beam) light. Holding our position right by the bank, I considered the prospect of exiting the boat and walking up to the sphere. Before I actually decided on this, the sphere moved both upwards and backwards in the blink of an eye shot into the clear black sky. I kept my eyes fixed at the point where it had seemed to disappear and within seconds observed an emerald green streak shooting from right to left at about 15-20 degrees. The whole thing lasted only a fraction of a second and we let go of the branches anchoring us we resumed drifting downstream. My friend and I and talked about the event(s) facing each other seated in the boat, he at the bow, I at the back facing foward. It was only minutes later that I observed what seemed to be a bright triangular opening in the sky  at 11 or 12 o&apos;clock and this turned into a widening  bright puff and eventually something similar to a smoke ring before disappearing. I have since come to recognize this as a probable VanDeberg launch which would easily enough date the event exactly as I am only guessing now at the date. I was pointing this out to my friend when suddenly the river came alive with the sound of helicopters. We had now positioned our boat close to the center of the river and though it appeared the craft was flying along both banks, we could not tell how many there were. They were apparently painted in a dark color and try as we could, neither of us could make out any markings on the fanthom shapes. If there were any lights, they were minimal and they used no floodlights or other means to illuminate the area. We did not sleep that night and when the next morning we came across the first riverside business in almost a month, we inquired if anything unusual had been reported the night before, and were told &quot;nothing.&quot;", "1 UFO goes in front of the moon!It all started over a patch of trees, then it moved toward the full moon and went right under the moon, then it disapeared.

My Great Grandfather and two neighbors, both from different houses. We were on the hill, which is the terrain on Coleman Rd. I was in my house at first then my Great Grandfather told me to look out the storm door. I did and saw a bright, white, round light flying low and comming towards our hill. We went outside the same time our neighboors did and watched it till it slowly disappeared behind the other hill. I didn&apos;t know what U.F.O.s were untill I saw it and it was like then I knew what it was. I don&apos;t know what month it was or year, or at what time it happened.

On the afternoon of July 6 , 2003 my husband noticed a gleem way over head , it looked odd so I went and got my camcorder w/ 500 digital zoom . Couldn&apos;t see what it was until I zoomed in . I recorded the most awesome 3 minutes of what was definitely an unidentified object . We looked through frame by frame and found some &apos; brow raising &apos; images . For one I am a 31 year old skeptic , don&apos;t care for politics or red tape . I am the type of person that looks to the logical explanations in all  &apos; unexplained &apos; from paranormal to the unexplained but this footage is like nothing I know is on record to date . It isn&apos;t just a sliver ball darting around , the footage has captured more detail than that , the object is definitely not a sliver ball . I was in the Navy , have been on carriers / sub-tenders , I have seen aircraft ... stealth , bomber ... etc. But I have never seen anything like this !  And the footage shows ( I was filming by a tree ) you can see the object moving as the leaves in the same frame remain still . Also taped the moon to show I did not mistake the object for &apos; swamp gas reflecting off a weather balloon causing steam to rise in a dioxide mist &apos;  Let me assure you this footage is true .Pictures can be found at: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/united_states_ufo_reports.htm  This footage is so solid I am willing to sell all rights of it .I realize there are many are hoaxed projects - experts that can sniff out a fake crop circle a mile away .I do feel this footage will be talked from all aspects of the UFO pros &amp; cons for years to come.

As I was out side seeing how many of teh star shapes I could make out the big dipper, ect. I had looked to my right at a rather large hill that the road that runs in front of the apartment house.  A ball of light came over the hill i&apos;m guessing was  about  50 to 70 feet in the air moving very slowly.  I watched it for a few mins an noticed that none of the &quot;sounds&quot; you would hear in the country had stopped and there was absolutly no noise from the object.  I had ran into the house to get my sister and her then husband and we all watched it seem to slow down even more for a breef moment, then continued its path from the south to the north (more or less) As we had no phone in the house at the moment there was no way of contacting anyone else to what we saw.  We were watching it move out of site for about 45 mins untill we could not see it any longer, I was quite supprized the distance we were able to see the light flashing from so far away as it was.  (not sure if this is important or not but, The very next day, I had seen a red bi-plane following a sillilar course as the ball of light I had seen the night before but I could hear that from inside the house, the object had made no nose and was about 100 to 150 feet away as it passed us as we watched it.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was stationed on a Navy ship that was underway in the Carribean Sea between Bermuda and Puerto Rico. I was standing aft lookout when I noticed a round set of lights behind the ship just under the water. The lights were red, green and white split equally at 120 degrees each with a total width of around 6 feet. We were towing a device at the time designed to detect nuclear submarines at long distances.(This device never heard whatever this was).The light moved from just behind us at around 20 yards to the right then the left and then back as if to be surveying the towed cable that was running behind us. At the time my initial response was that I was not believing what I was seeing. After watching this for about 20 minutes I reported it to the bridge. No sooner had I reported it than it disappeared(almost as if it were listening to me). The report to the bridge brought down the Captain, the chief engineer and the operations officer but the light was long gone by the time they got their and they most likely wrote it off as another young sailor smoking dope on the fantail and seeing things. I never said anything about it after that night but it was definetly unidentified. It is interesting to note that this was in the Bermuda Triangle where so many other strange encounters have occured .At that time I was a young seaman age 19. I was a fully qualifed lookout with 6 months experience at sea.It is very possible that even more data is available from the official ships log. I can give all the relevant info if someone wants to call and followup on it.Quite an erie event in my life especially for one who has always believed there were others out there somewhere.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

There were no man made lights except some distant campers.  A circular colored light ( I am red-green color blind and the color is hard for me to discern, but it was not white, more a faint red or green), came over the horizon moving in a wobbly fashion but basically in a linear trachectory.  It was about 15 to 20 times bigger than a star. The unusual aspects were the size and the unusual movement.  The amplitude of the movement was probably 2 to 3 times the diameter of the object, but it had no discernable regular frequency.It moved from west to east.  There was no noise of an aircraft.  Before crossing the next horizon the light got smaller then disappeared in about a 5 second span.  I cannot think of anything that moves in this manner.  I suppose if it was high enough it could have been reflecting light from the sun as I was far enough north that it had only been completely dark for about 30 minutes.", "Round object above US 17 Charleston, SC.Traveling high above US Hwy 17 moving towards downtown Charleston in the West Ashley area an object was spotted moving in northerly direction.  The object was small and round, remained a constant height, had a whitish to silver tone but did not reflect light.  Its movement was characterized by being rather fast while the clouds above and below it were stationary. It moved northerly while also erratically moving left and right along its flight path while pausing in one spot on several occaisions.  My first inclination was a weather balloon but due to the stationary clouds above and below the object as well as the object&apos;s intermittent pauses in flight and seemingly random movements left and right I decided to file this report.", "Glowing object hovering over Shea StadiumI was driving across the Throgs Neck Bridge with my wife and two sons.  My wife noted that there seemed to be a lot of planes in the air in the vicinity of Laguardia Aiport.  There was a Mets game on at Shea Stadium, and at first I noticed what appeared to be a group of small white lights moving in formation.  On my second look, these lights seemed to be helicopters and were actually stationary.  Then I noticed a large oblong object near the other lights.  This object had a red/orange glow emanting from the bottom.  The boject did not move across the sky, but it seemed to dip up and down periodically. We continued driving over the bridge, and I noticed the object just above the tree line as I drove on the highway.  I pulled off the highway onto a side street and got out of the car.  I happened to have my digital camera in the car, and I took several pictures using the extreme telephoto setting. Shortly after I got home, I got back in the car and headed to Shea Stadium.

The movement in and out was very graceful and smooth like an inhale and exhale movement. When the objects merged in the center they merged into an orb that was translucent also and we could see a star shinning through. The star stayed in the center the whole time and was twinkling red and white. Did not count how many times these disks rotated or how many orbits. It was very quiet the whole time, even the animals out side were quite but my husband and I talked to each other and asked questions of each other. But we noticed the silence. The disk merged togeather into the center one last time then disappeared. The star remained.

At the same time be both pointed out what at first looked exactly like a star, but this bright object was moving at a constant rate of speed.

We didn&apos;t think anything of it for at least an hour. It just seemed something cool to look at while we passed the time away. I stood there staring at it for a few moments and then told my friends (at this moment, the group comprised of myself and four others) &quot;It&apos;s moving.&quot; They, at first, didn&apos;t believe me. We then ran in to retrieve my girlfriend&apos;s telescope and I quickly got it centered on the object. It appeared perfectly circular (which is to be expected from viewing something through a home telescope at such great distance), orbiting the moon at what I thumbed out to be at least 500 miles (I was always good at math and spatial orientation). When it first was brought to our attention, it was in the 7 o&apos;clock position in relation to the moon. What made us realize that this was no planet, star, or earth orbiting craft was because of these reasons: 1- it stayed approximately equidistant from the moon at all times in an orbital path(it is at about the 2 o&apos;clock position as I type this. when we first saw it it was in the 7 o&apos;clock position as stated above.) 2- any star that close to the moon when it was full but 4 days ago would be occluded by the sun&apos;s light refracting off of it. I know this to be fact. 3- I know of no moon orbital sattelites posessed by any nation at this time(of course, there could be some that I am not aware of!) 4- no planet or star could maintain such a perfect relation to the moon. The object in question exhibited a yellowish tinge and produced coronal light discharge that completely differed from any heavenly body I have yet encountered. To me it somewhat of a mystery, but I have no doubt that what I saw was very doubtfully made by human hands and exhibited behavior clearly indicative of an orbi! tal path around the moon.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the object may have been the planet, Mars.

Green which spinning on top of the reds and also flashing. Blue which flashed very quickly and often to the right of the red.

It was traveling from East to West and almost appeared straight over head.  It was very high up in the atmosphere.  It was teardrop shape with the fat part flying first.  The thing was white in color.  No wings, tail, or markings.  It had a line of smoke behind it like the Columbia did when it was burning up.  It definately was not a contrail.  As it flew west, it was seen behind extremely high level fair weather clouds.  It was clearly coming in towards the Earth at an angle.  Even my young child who watches aircraft every day even asked me what that strange thing was.  It came in to the atmosphere quite quickly, but definately not as fast as a meteor.  It took minutes to cross the sky, but was faster than any jet I&apos;ve seen.  Also, 10 minutes before I saw this, a fighter plane at higher altitudes flew east to west, but not the same exact trajectory.  It had its afterburners on.  This object was still faster than that.That&apos;s the first time I&apos;ve heard of a craft re-entering on a east to west path.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.  We suspect that the first possibility to be ruled out would be a short contrail behind a jet aircraft, although the witness is self-described as an experienced observer of aircraft.  The object could not have been a meteor or space debris.  Both of those categories of objects move too rapidly across the sky to be visible for 2 minutes.

We were walking from Lake Ave. to Lincoln St. On Hope St., along the way, I was looking up in the sky, hoping to catch a glimpse of a meteor when my eye caught a pitch black disk, moving steadily from right to left (from south to north). I called out to my cousin and his friend, but they didn&apos;t see it, and I wasn&apos;t surprised as it was a black object moving against a dark blue sky (considering the sun had gone down but there was still a small bit of twilight) and if your eye wasn&apos;t already locked on it, it was very hard to pick up.

After work, my girlfriends and I would go to a cul de sac in the back of the country club to hang out and party.  They were building new homes back there, but none were completed. The road was completed and allowed for some privacy, as few cars ever drove by.  That night we,  (there were three of us in the front seat),  were just pulling up to the back of the &quot;cul de sac&quot;(before having any drinks), when a bright light came over the top of the car.  The three of us were unable to move, it was like we were frozen in time.  We were facing forward and we were unable to communicate or move.  I guess during this time the car shut off.  We all came out of this trance at the same time.  We all began to cry simultaneously and I tried quickly to get the car started to get out of there.  At about the same time we noticed truck lights behind us on the main road leading to the &quot;cul de sac&quot;. The truck passed and we left as quickly as possible.  What we remebered, we all recounted pretty much exactly the same things, was that the car was shaking, like it was lifted up and dropped.  This was at the very beginning I think, so maybe it was the fact that I could not move and because the car was a stick shift, shook as it was out of gear and shut off?  When we came back, the car was difficult to start and that may have been the fear, maybe I was unable to simply start it, but I do recall the cassette deck being screwed up and the clock on the dash.  We all estimated we had lost about ten to fifteen minutes as we knew when we arrived. We went to a local bowling alley and got a guy we knew to go back with us to see if anything was there.  Unfortunately, we were too frightened and opted to stay down the road about a mile, while he did it alone.  He laughed at us and, of course, this became a joke with our other friends.  I spoke with my father about it later that night and he said it must have been something,(because I had not bee! n home on a Saturday night @9:00 PM since I was in Junior High).  Anyway, I am 38 now, A Financial Planner, sane individual.  All three of us grew up to be responsible, educated, professinal adults.  However, I am unable to forget this event.

Around 6:00 to 6:30 my friend and I were going to be going out trick or treating and we were at my house getting ready and we went into the kitchen.  My friend was the first one to spot it.  He said to me &quot;hey look out the window, look at that, do you see it?&quot;  Well at first I didn&apos;t even know what he was talking about.  Then I saw what he was referring to.  Keep in mind there was still a little light left outside and the sun was just setting.  I could see this object in the sky, which was actually pretty close.  I would say about 200 feet away.  The object did seem to have a similar shape that people seem to describe when they see so called UFO&apos;s.  Now here is the part that I have never heard anyone describe.  The object seemed to be almost invisible, but you could still see it.  If you have seen the movie predator where the creature could turn invisible, well it had a similar type transparency.  So we both just sat there looking out the window at this strange thing and it was not horizontal with the ground, but leaning to its side and was slowly moving to our right.  Then it slowly started moving up and to the right and then it started to move behind some trees and the neighbor&apos;s house and that was it.... it was gone.  To this day I don&apos;t know why I didn&apos;t go run behind my neighbor&rsquo;s house and try to continue watching it.

Perfect in balance.  The only lights on the craft were the three lights, one in the front with the two in the rear at each corner.  If this was one solid craft, not three in a formation, it was huge.  At least the size of a football field. The craft moved at a slow constant speed overhead us.  The height seemed less than a normal commercial plane.  There was no noise at all.  The reason I think it was a solid craft is because how all three of the lights moved.  All of them stayed at all times and equal distance apart from each other.  The craft was in no hurry and I could see it for at least three minutes.  The way it disappeared blew our minds.  The craft moved across the sky to reach a point to where it simply disappear.  When I say point in the sky, that is what I mean.  I watch the lead light disappear at this point while the back two continued on the same path to this point and disappeared as well.  There were no traces of the lights past that point and have not seen it since.  I live on the outskirts of town.

The object was relatively big,  half a thumbnail size at arm&apos;s full extension when it was first sighted. Estimated altitude range at 10,000 ft. - 35,000 ft. based on various commercial aircraft and helicopters (approx. 7) that crossed the sky during the event.  The cylinder maintained its amazing  upright posture throughout its flight.  We were not under the influence of any intoxicants or alcohol. Unfortunately, we were too mesmerized to grab a camera.((NUFORC Note:  We believe that a blimp would be the first possibility to be ruled out, although we suspect the witness probably considered such a possibility during his sighting.

When picture was downloaded on computer, orange stars weren&apos;t visible, HOWEVER down below the moon is a perfectly round white circle and off to the right are also strange circular shapes which weren&apos;t seen by us at all when we were observing the moon.  Whats strange is when you zoom in on the lower circle you can see an almost perfect looking triangle in the middle, zoom back out and the circular shaes to the right almost appear to be trails (?) of the lower, smaller circle.  Someone said it was probably a star but I tried to take photos of stars later and they do not look like these circular shapes.  Later we recalled dashboard lights had blinked off three seperate times on the new veicle we were driving.((NUFORC Note:  Probably Mars.  Please see other reports.  PD))", "White cigar-shaped object flashes a brilliant white light twice, then disappears.About a month ago, my brother called me out on the deck of my house (in the back).  He said, &quot;There is a UFO out here!&quot;   I went out as fast as I could, since I am disabled and don&apos;t move very fast.  It took me about one minute to get out there...then I looked in the direction he was pointing (almost straight up). Here is what I saw:  The object was approximately 1/2 to 3/4 as wide as a full moon.  It was definitely cigar-shaped and brilliant white.  It looked just like a fuselage of a jet with absolutely no wings.  It was traveling from about 030 deg (NNE) on a compass to about 210 (SSW), which is exactly perpendicular to my house as it is oriented.  (That is why I am so sure of the directional travel of the object)  I would estimate it was quite a ways up into the sky, approximately 3 to 5 thousand feet, although it is difficult to say with no other reference points.  The object made absolutely no sound.  The skies were clear blue.  It was near 7:00 P.M.   I first picked up the object at an inclination of about 80 degrees (azimuth 030) and followed it for about 3 minutes until it was at an inclination of about 50 degrees (azimuth 210).  It made no sudden acceleration or deceleration during the entire travel.  It then flashed BRILLIANT WHITE, so bright I lost sight of the shape of the object.  The flash was almost as big as a full moon!  About five seconds later it flashed a second time (identical to the first time).  Then the object just disappeared!  I have emailed a sketch of the object, but it really isn&apos;t very detailed as I didn&apos;t see much detail other than the shape of the object itself.  The sketch includes the object shape, the relation of a full moon in size, and the size of the 2 &quot;bursts of light&quot; that the object made, in relation to the size of the object. This is the second time in my life I have seen something that is absolutely unexplainable in the sky.  (The first being in Mancelona, Michigan in 1978).  I used to be a UFO skeptic.  I still have not been convinced that these objects are extraterrestrial, but I can say with absolute certainty that there are &quot;unidentifiable objects&quot; traveling through the atmosphere of this planet.  I know there are more than one type since I have seen for myself two distinct shapes of these objects. It is certainly well past time for our government to &quot;come clean&quot; on what they know about these objects.  If they think they are protecting us by cloaking their knowledge in secrecy they are mistaken.  The more data the researchers have to work with, the better the chance that these mysteries can be solved!", "The object was a dim point of light that grew to a brightness of twice what Venus would be and then disappeared &amp; lasted ~ 15 seconds.I went outside to enjoy the night sky.  It&apos;s 70 F degrees, clear skies with a few thin clouds.  To the western sky is a very bright star low in the horizon.  It&apos;s about 15 degrees or so.  Worland is located approximately 44 degrees North Latitude and 108 degrees West Longitude.  I&apos;m 5 miles north on Wyo. Hwy. 433: West River Road.  The bright star is due west.  About 1/2 degree above and perhaps 3 degrees south of this star, I saw a small point of light moving from South to North.  I assumed it was a satellite until it grew in brightness.  I thought it might be a plane except there were no flashing lights and only the one point of light.  It grew in brightness to twice that of the star which is about as bright as Venus would be.  I thought it might be a plane turning towards me however it continued in a straight line to the north.  At about the 2/3 point of it&apos;s arch which covered about the span of one hand at arms length, it reached its maximum brightness and then faded back to a dim point of light before disapearing.  The event lasted about 15 seconds.  As for my background, I&apos;m retired Air Force and flew in B-52G&apos;s.  I&apos;m also a private pilot (licensed in the early &apos;70&apos;s).  This was not a plane.  It was also not a meteor.  The duration and relative slow speed of the sighting was without any &quot;tail&quot; of any kind.  It was simply a dim spot of light that suddenly grew in intensity and then deminished.

For some reason I was compelled to look up in the sky. Supprised and happy I finally saw a UFO. The craft did not move or make any sound that I heard in the 3 seconds I saw It. I looked away to tell some of my friends to look and they asked me where it was. It was gone, it disapeared in the 2 seconds I looked away. In the Sky, it was about 2 inches long. It was an oval on its side. The highth was about half an inch. There was no lights flashing, the whole craft was glowing metalic orange, perhaps the &apos;Stealth&apos; of it was reflected from the setting sun.  Amazing!", "Craft with Red Strobing Light!I was standing in my mother&apos;s room looking out her open window into the southeastern sky around 10pm.  Just by chance I noticed a bright object, traveling slowly across the sky on the Victor 23 flight path heading north.  It was traveling slower than a small plane and I saw it disappear over the trees.  I then told my mom about it and went back into the room five minutes later... It was then, in the distance, I saw a blinking red light emerging closer from the southeastern sky and flight path.  It crossed over and headed into the northwest sky.  I thought is was a star at first.  As it came closer, over the house, I could see it was not a star or a plane.  It was a hazy looking triangle-like-craft with a blinking red strobe light in the bottom center.  Around the craft it seemed to sparkel and shift like a glittery transformation. I called my mother into the room and had her see what I was seeing... she cleary saw it without her glasses on and told me she saw a blinking red light and a strange metallic haze surrounding the craft.  We also noticed that were was no noise of anykind, no aircraft, nothing. Five minutes later, a helicopter was flying overhead, in the northwest direction of the second odject. There have been helicopters flying aroung here lately, at night, and during the day.  In fact, my mother and I saw them last Saturday at 2pm in the afternoon for about 30 minutes hovering around the trees.  They were green military helicopters circling and hovering around the Woodinville-Reintree area.  Something is seriously going on out here in the woods.  My mother and I would like to remain anonymous.((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides excellent graphic of his sightings.  Objects do not appear to us to have been either a/c or satellites.

I was watching TV at approximately 10:45 p.m. I was facing toward the west, in the direction of a door with a large window facing my deck in a westerly direction. Out of the corner of my eye, I observed what appeared to be an object in the sky that was simultaneously flashing a red and white light. It also appeared to flash yellow as well. I immediately checked to make sure that this was not a reflection off of the glass from an inside source. I moved closer to the window and affirmed that is was indeed an object in the sky. It remained completely stationary, but it continued to flash a red, white, and yellow light on and off at the same time. The object was about 45 degrees above the horizon. I would estimate that it was approximately 4-5 miles WNW of my location. It was smaller than a dime at arms length, but definitely noticeable. It had no definite shape. Anyone driving on Interstate 71 should have been able to see the object since I-71 is 2 miles west of my location in a semi-rural area. In a period of 3 seconds, the object appeared to &quot;fade away,&quot; leaving only the darkness of the sky in its wake. I do recall audibly hearing other small Cessna aircraft in the vicinity after the sighting that night, but this object was far brighter than any other conventional aircraft that I have seen in the night sky. I felt strongly enough about the sighting to report it. I would like to add that I am a regular visitor to your site. I think that NUFORC has done a tremendous job with limited resources. The American public deserves an independent source to report unusual activity in the skies for scientific, public interest, and public safety issues. Thank You.", "A beautiful, round, pure red light in the sky just after dark.I looked out the front window and I noticed that  one half of the front street was wet. Went out to curb to investigate. Noticed that my half of the street was totally full of water, water running in the curb. Turned around to start to come back in, and  looked up into the sky as I usually do.  There was a beautiful, pure red round light just south of straight up, which was motionless and silent.  After one minute in awe, I ran in to get my camera.  Upon return it was still there.  I videoed for approximately three minutes, with the brightest star in the picture, before it started to move eastward.  As it gained speed it was flashing and glowing with more brilliance and speed.  Just before it left my view it paused and turned towards the south.  It continued to flash and glow a bright red.  Then out of sight. When viewed video, noticed a hot pink starlike light.  Also, when panned down accidentally, can see water in street for two seconds.

But on to what I saw. At around 10pm PST, I was driving due west through Knightsen to Oakley. I was on farming roads, so I had a pretty unobstructed view of what I saw. So, as I&apos;m looking at the West horizon around Mt. Diablo, I see this fairly large orange light that was stationary off in the distance. I keep looking at it while i&apos;m driving, and then a I see a smaller orange light off to the right of the first larger orange, and its making it way towards the bigger light. The smaller light continues to go toward the bigger light until they merge together. The bigger light completely envelops the small one. At this point i&apos;m excited because i&apos;ve never seen anything like this before. so I keep watching waiting for the smaller light to emerge signifying that it is just an airplane, but it doesnt. at that point trees cut off my vision of the event, and a few minutes later when i regain my viewpoint, the lights are gone. don&apos;t what it was. i&apos;m just hoping that someone else might have saw something as well.", "6/28/03 23:30 4 witnesses.

There was a saucer shaped object with the usual half sphere middle part 3 rows of 8 or 10 windows. It was emitting a gloomy white light/haze all over it and a blinking sharp white light from the bottom. It was hovering low in the horizon. It stayed in one position approx 300 meters high then moved slowly to the right while lowering itself. Then came back to its original position but much closer to the ground and got out of sight because covered by a building. Might have landed. We were four of us. Other people also saw it from a JFK between terminals bus but did not pay too much attention. We have just got back to NY and looked up on the sky as getting off the bus and going into the subway station. IT WAS NOT AN AIRPLANE. Several airplanes went by paying no attention to it altough they must have seen it. No chasing. I followed its movements in the parking lot and saw it time to time covered by the trees. At the very first sight we knew we had never seen anything like that on the sky before. Somehow a very nice relaxing feeling over the excitement of the unusual sight.", "UFO Spotted on Mt. Greylock in 1960&apos;s. Saucer and some kind of a seperate long white light.I just wanted to share a story with you that happened in the 1960s when my in-laws were &quot;parking&quot; with another couple on Mt. Greylock in Adams, Ma.  While parking in an area by the top of the mountain they heard what sounded like some kind of machine running. My father-in-law and his friend took a short path to the top to investigate. What they saw was a UFO that was surrounded by people.  The people spotted them and gave chase. The two men ran back to the car to find the women crying. The car acted like it does in the movies, it kept stalling down the mountain. While on their way down, the men asked why the women were so terrified and they had said they saw a white light come up to the front windshield of the car. They did not understand what this was because the front of the car was parked up against a wall with a drop off on the other side. They did make it to the bottom and noticed the clouds above the mountain were illuminated pink. They never reported this because they said they thought nobody would believe them.Not too long after, My Mother-in-law was at a friends house when this same (long) white light appeared outside the bedroom window on the second floor. There was a garage next to the house with a small alleyway between where she saw the light. One night, around the same time, my in-laws were parked at Onota Lake parking lot in Pittsfield. They were watching another couple parked in the lot who appeared to be arguing (The other couple had their dome light on) when all of a sudden they felt like they were hit from behind, The only thing was is they were backed up against the woods. And just as sudden there was no longer that other car in the lot, but they said they never saw it leave. (Maybe missing time?) They both said they felt like they were knocked out. They inspected their car but there was no damage to it. My in-laws are now divorced but will tell exactly the same story. They are not the type to lie and my mother-in-law still does not like to talk about it.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Last night at a few minutes after 4 am I awoke and I looked out and saw 2 disk shaped objects moving north parallel to each other. I knelt up in bed to see the second one pass the other. Than the first one passed the other and slow down. Both staying on the same plane. This happened 3 times when they both turned right or east. The speed was amazing. There was a commercial jet in the backround and I noticed it. The 2 objects diapeared.   There were no blinking lights on either object. They both had the color of etched glass. A light source that seemed to come from within. I would estimate the distance from me of between 2000-4000 feet away.I called the regional airport control tower that was right under their path. No one answered. I called back at 7 am and they said that no one is in the tower till 6am but they would give me a # to call. Here I am.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at considerable length, and we found him to be a seemingly exceptionally credible witness.  His description of the two objects, and the manner in which they moved across the sky, and relative to each other, was quite objective and precise.

PD))", "Viewed at 200/300 yards using a rifle telescope it was very close and could not have been one of ours I am not sure on the actual date and time. My elder brother, 2 friends and I were out shooting which on occassions would start at dusk and last all night until just after dawn. We inavariably tried to get some sleep in the FWD from time to time whilst one or the other would keep watch. It was a very clear night, absolutely no cloud and I estimate ( very roughly ) that we could see aircraft as far away as 5/10 miles. I was sleeping in the back seat when my brother woke me &quot;Stewart it&apos;s the UFO again - Look !&quot;. I woke up half expecting some prank or another - the guys had been out the previous night when I was not there and had babbled on about seeing a UFO which I had dismissed with a &quot;Oh Really!&quot; attitude. When I looked out of my left window and forward towards the forestry commision ground I saw a circular shaped light/ vehicle rise straight up from what appeared to be the forest. I immediately tried to rationalise what I was seeing - I rolled down the window to stop any glass interference but it was still there but had stopped and just hung in the sky at about a 40/50 degree elevation from the ground in relatuion to me. I would estimate that this object was within 300 yards of us. I asked my elder brother to tell me what it was as I was really at a loss to identify it. He said it was the UFO. I screamed at him - I know it&apos;s a UFO but what is it ? &quot;Its a UFO&quot; he said rather infuriatingly. As hard as I could I struggled to reason this one out - could it be a helicopter with a night lamp - but there was no noise and I could see only the object not any helicopter or anything else near it. Could it be a light projected from the ground - no because the circle was not just light it had a physical presence ( and I may ot be describing this well ) a sort of texture - It was definately something real not just a light. I knew by this time that with the best will in the world my friends could not be replicating this. I started at it in awe and then remembered we had the scoped rifles so I took mines out - equiped with a powerful 6X42 scope and started to study it. I could determine a circular physical shape , bright luminescent , with a ill defined banding around the center but little else could be identified. I must have studied this object for 3 or 4 minutes at about 300 yards and no higher than 200/300 ft. All the time I was trying to figure out what it was. So far it has risen vertically and quite slowly and then stopped. I knew Helicopters could do this and harrier jump jets but at that distance I would have expected to hear something. There was no wind to block sound. The craft then moved from it&apos;s hover position from my right to my left. It moved quickly with incredible speed but stopped instantly. I know we have fast aircraft but I doubt anything can demonstrate this level of acceleration and it came to an instant stop eg from whatever speed to zero instantly. I had only travelled about 200/300 yards and stopped behind but above the corner tree where the two fields meet, still off our ground but only just off. I shouted did you see that and ofcourse they all did. We had the night lamps ourselves - these are million candle power lamps and it was suggested by my brother to &quot;Lamp It&quot; eg switch on the lamp and aim it at the object. This was not to increase the view of it - that was not necessary - it was more to provoke it or communicate with it in some way. The eldest chap there did not want us to do this - he was very nervous of what he was seeing and did not want the thing to come any closer that it already was. Behind and below the craft on the horizon I could see an aircraft with its normal navigation lighting heading in our general direction. If the aircarft which must have been 5/10 miles away continued in our direction ( Common site with aeroplanes passing over us at normal height regularly) then it would come close to the bright object albeit the object was still only at about 200/300 ft off the ground. We watched , me through the scope and using the naked eye and the craft just hovered. You could determine some activity eg shimmer/vibration but in was not moving. The Aeroplane continued to approach and we stared , transfixed by this encounter and eager to see what if anything was going to happen as the aircraft was on course to fly over the object. When the aircraft was a few miles distant the object moved again. It shot upwards to the left and stopped instantly again. Then it literally accelerated from zero to disappear in a second heading left and away from us. It&apos;s speed of departing was instant eg almost in the blink of an eye. I am not sure of the actual dates and times however within a day or two of our sighting the morning TV programme showed a report on fishermen in cornwall having captured a UFO on video. Whilst I know that video was subsequently disproved or belittled what I can say is that the object we saw resembled what they caught on video. To say the event had an effect on me - we wanted to go check out the woods where the object rose from but were frightened to without our rifles and the ground it rose from was not ours. I told a lot of people about this and met with a lot of ridicule but I am a very logical person in my early 40&apos;s , my brother and his friends are about 10 years older and the eldest was a business man who had retired. I would have given a lot of money to have a video camera that night instead of our rifles. For weeks I tried and tried evaluate what I had seen and were there any other possible explanations. For the reasons given below I remain convinced to this day that what I was seeing was either a very specialised and earth shattering new aircraft of ours as yet not made public and has not been made public in the 10 years since or that the object was not man made. 1] I believe the object demonstrated intelligence in that it moved vertically then horizontally with amazing acceleration and deceleration ( well instantly stopping ).2] I had a clear site of the object and even better through my telescope.3] I am used to seeing british fighters at ground level practising where I used to fish and when they move they make an enormous racket that you can hear for miles let alone 200/300 yards.4] I had a significant amount of time to study it.5] My brother is army trained and was involved in flying drones etc as well as aircraft recognition. Overall I do not know what it was but it still facinates me as to what it could have been. I hope this helps anyone who studies these events.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It traveled in a straight line, with it&apos;s leading edge spanning about 1 degree of arc (as estimated by comparison with a thumb&apos;s width at arm&apos;s length, and traveled about 75 to 90 degrees of arc in about 8 to 10 seconds.

Bronze saucer/cylindrical craft; approx. 3:30 p.m., no life form sited.This was such an amazing sighting.  The craft was deep bronze in color with a glow about it, probably due to the time of day and the sun&apos;s position.  This was in a relatively remote suburban location, and we were simply in the large back area having a family picnic. The object appeared suddenly at some (miles?) away and slowly approached us...however, it did not attempt to get too near, but instead laid back at a distance for a little time and then suddenly veered to its left and disappeared. The object was absolutely huge. At no time did we feel threatened in any way...it was almost a protective feeling.  We did not report the incident, but rather just took in in stride for some reason.  As I reflect back now, I feel that it was a direct emissary from God.  We saw no evidence of life form, except for the magnificent warmth of color of the object and obvious intelligence of the crafters of same.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

As I was looking downward, an intense white circular beam of light shown down from straight over head encompassing myself and only a few inches around me. I was startled momentarily and then looked up to see the source of the light which ceased as my head moved upward. Total time from light on to light off was no more than two seconds. The beam was stationary. It had strong edges as a stage spotlight would when striking the ground.I began looking in all directions for the source and witnessed a vertical column of light being emitted from an unknown source, approximately &frac12;- 1 mile to the north.

I did not see it come out of the cloud as my viewing was blocked by buildings. I do not know if indeed it did go into the cloud or not as the clouds where white and the object was white so with the white background I could not see it anymore. Specially since the object was flying away from me and was much smaller. About the size of a bright evening star. As to it&apos;s size, if I were looking at a airline plane, that I would assume to be flying about the same altitude, I would say it was about half a plane longer.

It was very high in the sky as I could not identify aircraft wings and could barely discern the faint sound of jet engines.  The aircraft caught my eye because it was shining brightly (probably due to the reflection of sunlight at sunset) and I found it odd that there was no vapor trail from the jet engines.  The speed of the aircraft was constant (not unusually fast or slow). The very strange aspect of this sighting was that the aircraft did a very quick and very sharp U-turn.  It took less than two seconds for the aircraft to change directions and begin flying on the same path it had been travelling. I work in aviation and know that vapor trails are not always visible due to air temperatures but jet aircraft cannot change directions that quickly. I hope someone else saw this as well.

As I walked toward the stairs, I heard a loud grinding metallic sound. I thought it sounded too odd to be a blimp. I ran outside to see what was producing the sound and looked up in the night sky and saw a triangular shaped craft with a white light at each corner and a red light in the middle flying over my boyfriend&apos;s house.

I have some info about an experience with a spherical light probe that entered my van some years ago. I am not some nut or some glory hound, I am a level headed person that had an unexplainable experience. I had taken my ex-wife ((wife&apos;s name deleted)) with me to a training class held by the Ohio Peace Officer Training Academy (OPOTA) held in London, Ohio. I recall it was a one day session. My certificate for 1989 show 2 dates of one day long training, May 30 &amp; July 10, 1989. I don&apos;t know which date this occurred on.I was driving on US Rt. 30 between Mansfield, Ohio and Wooster, Ohio. Actually I was closer to Mansfield. It was at night time, late between 11pm and midnight. My wife asked me the time, I looked at the clock and told her. Immediately there was a blinding flash of light. The bright flash occurred in the sky. The light was a very bright lightning flash. It filled my whole field of vision, filled the whole windshield of my Ford Econoline van.  My wife screamed and I looked at her. This is when I saw &quot;it.&quot; The &quot;it&quot; was a white-bluish bright ball of light that appeared to be floating in midair in my van. The ball of light was floating right in front of the abdomen, over the lap of my then wife (-now ex-wife). As she screamed the ball of light became more agitated. It clearly was reacting to her screams. It rapidly moved back and forth as it floated in front of her. It then moved to her right and vanished THROUGH the door panel of the van. It actually went through the door panel. The window was up and there was no sound. Within in a second or two the ball appeared back in the same location in front of her. I didn&apos;t see how or from where it appeared. It did exhibit the same properties and behavior as the first light ball, with one exception. I got a long and hard look at the ball. I stared at it and watched it. It appeared to be a ball of whitish-blue light (similar to the light of an arc welder). The ball was about the s! ize of a grapefruit with about 6 smaller light balls circling its equator. This ball of light moved back and forth in sync with ((wife&apos;s)) screams. It was then observed to float through the door panel, as before.What is interesting is that from the time this experienced occurred until it ended, I figure 30 seconds had went by. In reality, when I looked at the dash clock 15 - 30 minutes had gone by!! I had never stopped driving the van. I never pulled over to the side of Rt. 30 or stopped. I have no memory of what I was doing during the experience. All I know is that I kept driving but I was looking at, staring at, studying the light balls. How this occurred, I have no idea.((Wife)) did sketch the lights when we got back to Canton. We had divorced in 1988 but were friendly. So usingou dvorce and my training certificates, I have narrowed the occurance to two dates. I have not seen my ex-wife for  over 10 years and I don&apos;t know what she did with the sketch.I am a trained observer, 2- ((twenty +)) yr police ((senior officer)) and I know what occurred. I just can&apos;t account for the missing time and how I kept driving.  Thanks for listening ((name deleted))((NUFORC Note:  We have corresponded with this witness, and our impression is that he is extremely credible.

Without a warning, no noise, no sightings. Intensly bright flashing white lights passed over us with incredable speed. We were both knocked backwards off our lawn chairs.  Ther were 5 flashes in total but to this day I&apos;m not to sure if it was the shock of seeing lights so amazingly bright or if it was as if we were the only things in the area that got caught up in its wake as it passed by us so fast. We did tell some friends but after the response we got we decided not to share this incident any longer with any one else.The lights seemed to start off in the distance with only one flash. We both started to ask if the other had seen it. Before we knew it or could even finnish asking the other if he had seen it ,the light was above us and flashing with such intense brightness.

I just thought that it was another airplane and was waiting for it to clear the trees so that I could get a better look at it.  When it finally did clear the trees, I saw this extra large glowing object that was round.  It had greenish, reddish, and yellowish glowing lights.  The only way I can really describe it is that it looked like a ferris wheel with the lights glowing and pulsing.  At first I didn&apos;t have my glasses on and I thought it was blurry so I put my glasses on and it was the same.  It looked like it was just hovering in the air, or moving very slowly in the north western direction.  Then all of a sudden it sped up and quickly took off to the west and I couldn&apos;t see it anymore.  It was making a sound that I could hear and it sounded kind of like a humming sound and it sounded like it was low to the ground.  My son was in the other room and when I went into the room to ask him if he saw or heard it, he said that he heard it and that it sounded like it was really low to the ground.

One night, I was outside with my 8&quot; Cave newtonian telescope when my father came out to tell me it was time to go in.  I happened to look to the north-east and saw a V-shaped formation of lights moving in a westerly course.  I knew that the LAX flight corridor is in the same area but I had never seen a flight of planes in that corrider as it is for &quot;heavies&quot; only, and not for military planes.  I told my father to look at the formation.  It moved to the western horizon and dissappeared into the L.A. light pollution in about 7 seconds.  That was faster than any jumbo jet would have moved in that corridor, and it made no sound.  I could always hear the jets flying by but these made no sound.  The best part was that as my father and I watched, the V-shaped formation suddenly shifted.  It seemed as if each light flew across the path of the others and it became a stright-line (line-abreast) formation.  The change was almost instantaneous, but slow enough for us to see them move.  We looked at each other knowing that military planes don&apos;t fly in the LAX approach corridor and they sure don&apos;t switch formation like that, especially at night. Plus they made absolutely no sound; we would have heard that many military jets.   Like I stated earlier, I am an amateur astronomer and have seen everything under the night sky, from flocks of geese, to meteors, to planes, to balloons, and this was none of the above.

There were about five or six of the spotlights that shone straight down in almost a pinpoint of light - definitely not floods but spots.  It was matte black, and it was hovering, and was absolutely silent.  I saw at least one other car coming the other direction on the interstate but it was impossible to tell if they saw it also. The object stayed there as long as I could see it in my rearview mirror. I was about 19 at the time and was on my way home from work.  I had been away to university for one year and had decided not to go back, and went to work full time.  I had worked overtime for two hours which was typical for that time.  I did not stop because I was a)fearful that the occupants might see me and b)even more afraid that my father would be angry if I arrived home later than I said I would.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We both noticed a shape travelling North east to South West across the sky at the same time.  We could not see the shape of the object all I could see was a series of lights arranged in a circle. It appeared to be flying as fast as a normal plane and was fairly high in the sky as it dissapeared over the clouds.  I thought I could hear the drone of a distant engine although my friend said it was silent. We watched it until it went out of view, it was heading out of Southampton and across the English Channel. I am completely sane and have not seen anything like this before, nor do I believe in UFO&apos;s.  Did anyone else seen this over the UK?  Could it be some kind of special military plane?", "Object seen where nothing should have been at all.At around 1:00 am, my friend and I were returning from a long week of fishing out in the Gulf of Mexico, when, in the pitch-blackness of the swamp, we noticed a circular glowing object in our path through the swamp. We stopped our boat&apos;s engine, and observed the object for about 30 minutes, doing what seemed to us to be surveying the area. We both contemplated what we should do, and decided to move ahead to our destination. As soon as we moved towards the object, it&apos;s glow intensified, and it began to ascend into the sky very slowly, as if to let us pass. We got within 200 feet of it, and it vanished, no sound, nothing. My friend and I do not drink alcohol, do not use drugs, and have gown up in the swamps of Louisiana, never having witnessed anything like that before. I travel by plane all over the USA, and I am quite familiar with many different types of aircraft. I am very critical, I don&apos;t believe in beings from other worlds, bigfoot, or ghosts.

Was outside by barn while husband was just inside. Saw yellow-orange colored ball/light, this object was grapefruit sized compared to stars. Seemed to be stationary above town of California, quite high.  I kept telling my husband to come out of the barn and see this thing.  After several minutes, no more than 3-5, the object instantly shrank from what grapefruit size (my perspective) to grape size, and then appeared to be a white lighted object with red and blue lights blinking.  It moved toward the north until I could no longer see it.  My husband did not come out of the barn in time to see it.On same farm, in Moniteau County: 2st Incident: July 18th 2003, app 8:00 to 8:30pm. I had been watching the sky since first incident and this evening (still daylight) there were a lot of scattered dark clouds.  I saw a large silver tube, it was in my clear line of vision - from my perspective I would say it was the size of a fat hot dog, no wings, no lights, no difference in front or back that I could see. From what I could tell, there was not rounding at &quot;nose&quot; or &quot;tail&quot;.  This tube came from behind one dark cloud and &quot;flew&quot; into another (west to south). I saw it clearly for about 2 minutes. There was no noise, no jet flume, and no shine.  I kept watching for it to come out of the cloud - at any direction. About 5 minutes later, an orange ball/light (much smaller) came from the same direction and &quot;followed&quot;? the tube.  Although I never saw the tube again, I did see the orange ball/light come out of the cloud and travel west to south into another cloud.I have no explanation for what I have seen. This is  exactly what happened and I can&apos;t stop wondering what is going on. The silver tube thing really spooked me because it was big enough or low enough to be clearly seen.", "A stationary light observed over Stevenage before it followed two other fast moving objects, one light and one hazy object.At approximately 12.30 pm on Saturday 2nd August I was observing aircraft flying on final approach into Luton Airport (about 5-7 miles to end of runway). I was suddenly aware of a bright object in the sky at about 60 degrees from vertical from where I was standing and just slightly higher than the flight path to Luton. At first I thought that this was a silver child&apos;s balloon that may have been released by someone gathering at the nearby Knebworth Rock Festival (Robbie Williams). The sky was clear and sunny with only the jet streams of high civil aircraft breaking an otherwise cloudless sky. I carried on with what I was doing in the garden but kept looking back to see if I could see the light and each time I was able to find it, unmoved from the first location. I started to think that a balloon would have drifted out of sight by now and watched the light for a minute or so more when a second light drifted very slowly across from the direction of the Knebworth festival. This second light passed close to the first light before suddenly accelerating off in a North Easterly direction at a speed I could only guess to be in excess of 2000 mph. It was closely followed by what appeared to be a haze, or very small cloud travelling at the same speed. The first light then began to move before this too took of in the same direction at high speed. There was no noise associated with these objects. During this time I think at least two airliners were on final approach to Luton Airport, one of which appeared to be heading straight for the light before banking left to take up final approach to Luton, and I would say that the flight crew of this plane must have seen the stationary light. In a clear sky I could see high level passenger aircraft taking forever to cross the sky, speeds that were easily much slower than the objects I had seen. In addition, helecopters were going in and out of Knebworth all day and these objects were not helecopters. Coincidentally enough the following day, a school fete took place close to us where a number of silver (and blue and gold) style childs balloons were released into the sky and instantly it was clear to see that the movements of these balloons was completely different to the objects I had seen the previous day. The balloons also disappeared from vision a lot sooner than the lights I had seen which I had been able to see disappearing off into the distance a few miles away. I have to draw conclusion that the mass gathering of 125,000 people at Knebworth for the Robbie Williams concert had something to do with the appearance of these objects, particularly as two of them were seen coming from that direction. They most certainly were not balloons, not high level airliners, not helecopters and not flares. Personally, I am a currently unemployed Computer Programmer aged 39. I have lived at the same location for over 30 years. Stevenage is a town of some 110,000 population so I would be very surprised if no-one else saw at least the stationary light.", "About 12: Midnite I walked out on my front deck and looked in the sky, I noticed what appeared to be some kind of aircraft stoping in mid flight, It was navy grey in color.As I watched it changed its direction 90deg. and apeard to streash to about 6 times its lenth and narrow to about 1/3 its diameter, It apeard to be excelerating as the rear of the craft left my sight it left a small ball of fire.

They came out and saw what I was on about, a &apos;star&apos; moving around seemingly randomly but definatley with amazing speed and at crazy angles - almost &apos;dancing&apos; in the sky but then after about 5 minutes of looking around the sky I said &apos;hold on - there are 12 of these things up there&apos;. The hotel staff and myself watched these objects moving around the sky for the next two hours, some of them moving in perfect formation with the others until the sun started coming up. I took many photos of these things which must have been moving at phenemonal speeds; you can clearly see that the stars are stationary in these photos but the ufos are moving so quickly that they have left light streaks on the image in the time it took the for the camera to take the picture whilst the stars are totally stationary. These &apos;lights&apos; seemed to be under intelligent control. They almost seemed to be putting on &apos;as show&apos; for us!  This was just the beginning of a series of amazing observations over the next 4 nights which did not just consist of light streaks in the sky, the other stuff is even more incredible.

It was a hand and a halftall at arms lenght. It was as long or longer than my arm, held at arms lenght. It looked almost like, when you scramble someones face on tv, the blur you see. It was moving sooo fast! It took maybe 2to3 seconds for it to, with my head turned to the left then following it, go all the way across in front of me and over the trees to the right. Nothing can move that fast. But that did! I did not see any shape in the blur what so ever. It looked transparent as such. no color.

Then the craft or whatever it was had more flashes but very dimmly lit as it started to move.  Ten minutes had elapsed and I saw another slow bright flash about 60 degrees from where i saw the first one and that took off at a slow rate of speed and had the same characteristics.

Then as it passed over head it made an unusally abrupt right turn and headed east. This object moved with a constant rate of speed and a constant rate of magnitude of bright light.

As you can imagine, the damage done to the city was severe and extensive. At this writing, over a quarter-million homes and businesses are still without power, and there is much wreckage and many damaged buildings throught the city. When our power went out, I switched on our battery-operated radio and listened to one of the few stations on the air, a sports-talk call-in show. Of course, no one was talking about sports. People were calling in to tell which streets and highways were blocked by debris, etc. I listened for a while then became preoccupied with completing my morning routine without benefit of electricity when I became aware of a caller who was reporting &quot;something strange,&quot; that he&apos;d seen. The caller sounded like a mature man, with a rural accent. He seemed very concerned that no one would believe him. The only description that I caught was that he had spotted one of &quot;them circle-crop things&quot; up in the air,  and he never believed in them before, but he swore he saw it, etc. He sounded completely sincere, and I must add, he was met with a stoney silence by the show&apos;s host, who offered no comment at all. The host and co-host merely chuckled and went on to the next caller. I&apos;m reporting this for a couple of reasons. First of all, Peter has mentioned that sightings are often associated with storms. Secondly, I wonder if anyone else heard this man&apos;s report and could offer more details about what the man said. (It may seem absurd to refer to a UFO as a &quot;circle-crop thing,&quot; but he sounded excited and perhaps even a bit upset by what he&apos;d seen.)  If anyone else heard the report or saw something UFO-related before, during, or after the Memphis storm, I hope they will report it on this site.

It had a orange-white glow to it. It was traveling towards the NW for 10 seconds and it covered about 15 % of the sky before it made a dead stop, did a looped U-turn and then just &quot;popped&quot; out of sight.  It was very high up, wasn&apos;t blnking like a plane, and was not a satellite. It was also not a meteorite  or anything else of that sort.  It was too slow for that, but too fast for a normal plane, and what kind of high altitude plane can stop on a dime and make a u-turn?  To note: this was the night of the blackout in the NE, and half of the electric was out in the area which gave us a decent chance to see clearly what was up in the sky.  There were also many criss-crossed chemtrails in the sky early the next morning.  I thought this was weird since the NE had very few airline flights from the previous 16-20 hours.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

I had time to go get my binoculars and with them made out the first of three distinguishable lights.  I then realized that there were actually three sets of three hovering lights.  I thought it must be three airplanes headed towards the south because the lights were so similar to airplane lights. With a change in color as the lights lit up from one of the three lights to another of the three lights.  It probably was just airplanes.  The only odd thing was they didn&apos;t seem to be moving.

I happened to look up to see directly overhead a bright white light moving very slowly west to east. It was not high, by that I mean not a satellite, but I am not able to estimate how high. I got the impression it was about the height a light aircraft might fly, and it moved at about that speed. The light was very intense, and did not change intensity, and there was no noise.

Both had the appearance of a star (about the brightness of Jupiter at night) and were roughly a few miles apart (best guess).  Neither had any color, the same color as starlight.  Common sense told me that they couldn&apos;t have been stars during broad daylight so out of curiosity I stood there and watched.  My first thought was that they were balloons very high up, but as I stood there and the minutes rolled by, I seriously doubted that as neither one had moved whatsoever.  I noticed, to my amazement, that the light closest to me had a very tiny light flying in circles rapidly around it.  That disappeared and the two lights just sat there motionless.  Neither of the two bright ones moved at all during this time.  I put the groceries away and came back out about 3-4 minutes later and noticed that the light that was farthest away had moved farther east of the other.  Neither was moving but I know for a fact that the one had moved while I was in the house, it was visibly noticable.  I sat watching for about 10 more minutes and nothing.  I found a pair of binoculars and had a look... both looked like stars... very high up and a simple dot of light, just like a star would look.  I went back in the house... and about 5 minutes later, curiosity got the best of me so I stepped back outside to have a look.  Both lights had completly vanished but there were about 4(?) very tiny lights flying around... all very small and much dimmer then the two before.  Hard to believe, but they were flying around each other... kind of a dogfight and I had the feeling that they were very high up.  As I watched they all kind of just faded and that was it.

I saw something shiny in the sky.  My first thought was that it was the sun reflecting on the windshield, but a better look told me it was in the sky.  I pulled my car over to the side of the road and got out just to make sure I wasn&apos;t seeing reflection.  At that point I became somewhat alarmed because I thought I was seeing a plane crashing due to the angle of the object and its path.  If it kept on going it would hit the hills to my right.  I thought I was seeing  an unpainted plane fuselage from the side but then noticed there was no tail to the object.  I should probably note that the object seemed to be luminous and I could not determine its exact shape.  It was bright enough that it hurt my eyes to view it directly for very long.Anyway, as I was standing there watching this thing slowly proceed at this awkward angle toward the hills it stopped dead and hung in the sky.  At the time it stopped it had gone low enough thatI could see the hills behind it.  That is when it really got strange.  I am standing there wondering just what the hell I was looking at when I get the feeling that it is watching me back.  I can&apos;t describe this very well, but I was flooded by a feeling of being caught doing something wrong.  That thing really was looking back at me!  What I report next sounds fabulous even to me and I experienced it.  I could swear I heard a conversation in my head between 2 or 3 different people.  Voice1: We are being observed.Voice2: It is not permitted to be observed.Voice3: We must leave.Then the object seemed to rotate and either shot off at an incredible speed or winked out.  It was just there and then it seemed to be gone in the distance.  It left me there shaking in my sneakers.For the record:  I freely admit that I have been fascinated by the UFO controversy and have enjoyed science fiction since I was a young kid.  That being said I have also served in the Army&apos;s Presidential Honor Guard.  I am not making this up.The whole time I watched this thing I was fascinated by it.  I had read about abductions and contacts etc before that time.  It had been reported that some aliens communicated telepathically.  While I was watching I was also thinking &quot;please land!&quot;.  I think that the fear I felt and the conversation I heard might have been their way of saying &quot;We&apos;d like to stop, but it isn&apos;t allowed and we&apos;ll all get in trouble.  What I really wanted at that point was to have my existence acknowledged by them and I feel that they complied with my wish to the extent they felt they could get away with.  That is all.", "There was a large group of lights that were moving all over the sky just in one spot.There were more than I could count at some times, it was a large group of lights that were zooming all over the night sky. At times there were just a few and other times there were alot. They would zoom real fast in one direction and seem to just disappear. It was at night and there was a thunder storm in the back ground. I have video tape of it for an hour.((NUFORC Note:  Given the duration of the sighting, and given the absence of other reports, we wonder whether the sighting might have been caused by the presence of advertising lights, or some other manmade phenomenon.  That is just a guess.

I imediatly realized that I was seeing a u.f.o. as I had never seen anything like this before in the broad daylight.I stood very still and was a little concerned with the fact that I was all alone and could possibly be abducted.I watched the entire time as it passed hopeing that it might change course or maybe even get a little closer to where I could see it even better.It came to a point where the sun reflected off of it for a moment.Not knowing the true size of this object I could not determine how high or far away it was. I would have to guess that it was at about 5000 to 10000 ft. up.The shape did appear to change at a certain angle as it seemed to go from cigar to football looking.I could not hear any sounds other than the sound of the process area that I was standing in when noticing this object.I called the local sheriff dept. to both report what I had seen and ask if anyone else had called about a sighting, they answered no.This was a unforgetable experience.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We wonder whether the witness might have witnessed an aircraft, which reflected sunlight off an unpainted fuselage, but we also presume that he probably addressed that possibility at the time of his sighting, and ruled it out.  The witness is correct that it is virtually impossible, without triangulation, to calculate the altitude of an object, whose dimension is unknown.

It had a searchlight shining down on the cars at the top of the hill much like a search helicopter would normally do. Except as I drove closer to the flying object I soon realized some strange things about it. It was unusual to see helicopters flying outside of Sacramento at that time of night, and I noticed it had no flashing strobe lights whatsoever - only two bright white &quot;wingtip&quot; or &quot;landing&quot; lights. The object became clear to me that this was not a helicopter as it had wingtip lights, however, it moved as slowly as a helicopter. Getting more closer, I think this is a very large and low flying plane with a wingspan of a B-52 or larger. Still, no flashing lights. Now it has turned off it&apos;s searchlight and moved to fly along the right side of the highway. At this time I am making my way towards the top of the hill and the object is about to come along side of me on my right side going down the hill as I am driving up the hill. The object is less than 100 feet above ground and about 100 feet out from the road flying slowly just above some power lines that were part of a large Sacramento radio antenna at the top of the hill. &quot;What the hell is that thing?&quot; I kept asking myself. It was too dark to make out anything. It was way too big to be a large plane with just two lights and no strobes flying way to low and slow. It wasn&apos;t until I was directly alongside the object, I rolled down my window to see if I could hear any engine noise when I saw enormous light between the wingtip lights. Rows of red, clear, and like a neon purple in  tubular sections, and there was purple lightning dancing between the bottom of the object and the ground! I screamed I was so scared because I was so close to it and yet I! had no answer to what it was other than alien being a real possibility. I couldn&apos;t believe what I was seeing. I honked my horn and tried to get the people in the car passing me to look at it as I waved my hand pointing frantically at it for them to see. Once I had passed along side of it and passed it, I could no longer see the colored lights between the wingtips anymore, only the two white wingtip lights. I tried to pull over but couldn&apos;t so had to wait until I reached the top of the hill. I got to the top and pulled over and got out and looked, but it was gone. Shoook my head got back in the car headed home and I saw it again in my rear view mirror. It was just too low to see when I got out. I watched it for as long as I could in the mirror as I drove off in fright. The object stayed on it&apos;s course heading for Sacramento, slow and very low to the ground. The entire drive back home was strange, I kept looking up at the sky as I drove thinking there was maybe a mass invasion going on. When I got to Tahoe it was 5:30am. To this day I still have no idea why it took that long to get home. It&apos;s only a 2hr. drive. I only stepped out of the car for a minute or two at the top of that hill. I wanted to get a better look at it. I KNOW others had to have seen this but might have thought it was just a plane. If I only had a passenger or a camera at the time. I actually went back one week later during the day and took photos of the site and made documentations for myself.", "I was sitting out side my house when I saw A shinney round object going across the sky. 30 sec. later two fighter jets came after flyinI am A normal every day person who saw something yesterday that I saw as  A seventeen year old kid that I as A rational person Know can&apos;t be explained by any one or will I go out and tell anyone for fear of ridicule.

My husband (names deleted by HBCC UFO) and I saw a bright white light in the sky at night, this took place on July 26, 2003 about 12:30 a.m. moving southeast from where it moved from St Mary Lake. That night the couple who saw it when they camped at the lake and reported it, well we saw it too.  It was such a warm night so we went out and had iced tea standing on the deck. We loved to look at the stars at night, about 15 or 20 mins later I first saw it moving. I called (names deleted by HBCC UFO) to look at it. We looked at it to make sure it wasn&apos;t a plane. So we watched it moving southeast until it disappeared. It moved at low altitude, not moving so fast. So we wondered what it was. We watched it for about a minute and a half.

Orginial language text at bottom ---  I live in the small town of Mendoza San Rafael in Argentina. On 8/1/03 at approximately 2:10 am something happened that I, nor any of my family or friends that were there, had ever seen in our lives. I don&apos;t usually believe in things such as UFOs, but what I saw was definately out of the norm.We heard a very loud sound that was unlike anything I can describe. When we went outside we saw something that was round and emitted colors that changed between very strong white, yellow and red. Something like this I had no idea what it was and I first assumed it was a meteor due to its size, but it went across the very, very fast and all we could do is stand there paralysed with wonder as to what this object could be. It continued across the sky and I believe that it impacted the earth some distance away as we felt a tremor and my home shook as though a plane had crashed nearby or something similar. The local news reported it and gave commentary from people of the village who experienced it, but the Civil Defense service explained it as a meteor impact, although a search by the Civil Defense forces with use of airplanes, aerial photos, helicopters, men on horseback and trucks have not been able to produce any evidence of a meteor fall. Scientists will be coming this Saturday (8/7/03) to investigate the area, even though to date no evidence of any type of impact as been seen. I work in the municipality of San Rafael and I have been informed of all the activity related to this event due to my contacts within the Civil Defense Forces and the Municipality of San Rafael. ---- *Editors note, this is not a word for word translation, as Argentina speaks a Spanish dialect and it was necessary to change some sentences to retain English grammar and understandability.

Anyway, I was sitting in my back yard smoking a cigarette about 9 pm sometime during the early part of the year (I think it was in February) when I suddenly noticed a bright glowing object off to my right perhaps 1000-1500 ft. away and perhaps 50 degree angle from my position on the ground.  The object really caught my attention because it made several rapid &quot;jerking&quot; maneuvers and then went through a rainbow of colors in a few seconds and then started flashing a white light.  I quickly ran to the back door to call my roommate.  He came out and observed the original object which had now begun to move to the northwest at a rather slow &quot;helicopter-like&quot; speed.  By this time, two additional objects (flashing the same white light) appeared and were moving into formation with the first object.  What was striking about their movement was its &quot;unnaturalness&quot; if you will.  They both moved very quickly and literally stopped in an exact triangular formation with the first object.  Then all three began flashing the same white light in unison.  Suddenly, we noticed two additional objects literally appear out of no where and move into formation with the first three in the same odd manner.  We watched the 5 objects move out of sight to the northwest.  The entire sighting lasted perhaps 5 minutes.  It should be noted that traditional aircraft were clearly visible at the time of the sighting as we live in the flight path of Bush International Airport and a local airport.  We have never seen a UFO but we are confident we have now!", "Large bright red light hovers high in atmosphere then rockets away at unreal speed.A extremely bright large round red light was observed in the southern sky, not too far from the position of planet Mars.  The light was stationary and appeared very high in the sky.  I had a sense this was higher than aircraft go.  It stood still for several minutes and was brighter than anything I have ever seen in the night sky.  Then suddenly it accelerated at an unbelievable speed, as fast as a shooting star across the sky, and vanished in the night sky.  There was no trail of light.  A faint light remained in the spot as the main light disappeared.  My friend and I have never seen anything like this before and we do not know what it was.  We only know that it was like nothing we have ever observed and it seem unreal and unnatural.  I&apos;m glad someone else saw it with me to confirm my reality.((NUFORC Note:  Please see second report of apparently the same event from Los Angeles.  PD))", "Three lights flying in a perfect triange formation. There was absolutely no sound.Three lights flying in a perfect triange formation. There was absolutely no sound, so it&apos;s doubtful it was an airplane(s). We followed them across the sky for about 15-20 seconds and then they scattered very fast.

They were still visible in early 1996, when NUFORC first witnessed them, and first began to investigate that phenomenon.

He wondered if there was a highway above us, because the lights seemed to be heading south parallel to I-5.  Suddenly the lights turned and zoomed down toward the freeway rapidly.  He guessed it covered 2 miles in about 10-15 seconds. At this point the craft slowed down, and he alerted mo of its presence.  We both thought it was a very low-flying, large airplane, and we watched as it crossed the freeway in front of us.  It was so low, we were barely looking up.  The craft turned left and headed north above the ground next to the north-bound side of I-5.  It appeared to be trying to land, when suddendly this large craft (about 40-60 feet across) banked sharply, about 45 degrees.  We were amazed that a craft that big, flying so low and so slow could have turned that sharply successfully.  It seemed that there was no way without stalling.  As it banked, the three bright, white lights seemed equidistant apart, one in the center and one on each end.  The craft was TOTALLY silent. It crossed I-5 in front of us again, this time it was heading west and was only about 100 feet in front of us, and about 40 feet off the ground.  It was so low we hoped it wouldn&apos;t hit us.  We thought it might crash in the field to our right, but it descended and decelerated, no noise, no noticeable dust.  It seemed it would land safely as it almost skimmed the ground.  At this time, we were looking out the side windows, to our right, down and slightly back.  The craft seemed lower than our SUV. It seemed the bottom was flat, because the lights were skimming the ground. The only lights we saw, were shining forward on the craft.  However, from this oblique view, they seemed to be positioned at a slightly obtuse angle (approximately 150 degrees).  It was very dark and neither of us saw any shape to the craft, except for the position of the lights.  All three lights seemed to be in the horizontal plane, as it skimmed the ground, at about 15 to 20 mph, almost touching it for about 150 ft.  Then just as I thought it was about to land, it suddenly tilted up and disappeared. Soon after this the driver saw the three bright, white lights, in the rear-view mirror.  I turned and watched out the back window as it made several more passes across I-5.  The driver caught glimpses of these passes in the rear-view mirror.  Eventually we lost sight of it as we drove out of range.  At this point we noticed the car clock light was flashing -- nothing else.  It continued to flash for a few more minutes.  The time kept changing correctly as it blinked.  Then it returned to normal without being reset. We never heard any noise or saw any shape except for the lights.  There were three other sleeping passengers, who never awakened during the incident.  There were also other cars on both sides of the freeway during this sighting.", "My friend and I heard strange whistling sounds with many other people in a Wal-Mart parking lot.My friend and I left a Wal-Mart Supercenter at 9:45 pm EDT.  The store number for this location is 658 according to Wal-Mart&apos;s website.  As we approached and entered into my vehicle, a whistling sound like a jet landing at close range was heard.  The sound began at a high frequency, about 18,000 hertz but decreased in pitch at a constant rate until the frequency of the sound was inaudible.  The sound lasted about eight to ten seconds per event and it was heard a minimum of three full times.  The first time that I heard the sound, I thought it sounded like a small military jet landing nearby.  However, this sound was too pure and ambient like it was coming from many different directions at the same time.  My friend and I didn&apos;t say anything to each other during the first event, but by the time I started the car and decided to leave the parking spot, we heard it again.  The windows in my car were rolled down and I saw a lady at a range of fifteen feet who was two men ask, &quot;what is that noise?&quot;  The noise sounded as it did the first time.  By then my friend and I asked each other what we thought it was.  My friend described it as a jet plane landing but there was no jet.  We are not from this area.  We were only driving through on our way for a weekend camping trip.  We are not familiar with any type of airfields in the area, civil or military.  As we exited the parking lot we could hear the sound once again, but this time it sounded more distant.  The only explanation that my friend and I could rationalize is if there is some type of very loud, crisp, ambient car stereo technology that is on the market that we are unaware of.  This sound was loud and it seemed to permeate through the entire parking lot. There were a few dozen people walking in and out of the Wal-Mart at this time.  It appeared that many people heard these sounds and they were perplexed as we were.  It was a warm, humid and hazy night and the sky was unable to be seen due to the haze and the lights from the area.  The performance of my vehicle was unaffected.  My dog in the backseat of my car seemed tense, but not abnormally so.((NUFORC Note:  We have received several reports recently of sounds, for which there is no ready explanation for what causes them.  PD))", "I drove as planned up to Mount Laguna to the top of Vista Point where the old radar installation/FAA radar station is, which is now pretty much abandoned as I am familiar with this area as a young kid who&apos;s parents owned a cabin for years which is across the mountain on the other side. Myself, my Wife as well as my big sister came along also. I am an avid astronomy buff &amp; had set my Meade Telescope for a view of Mars, as it is so close and a clear night would benefit viewing, along with the altitude. We noticed a laser shooting into the sky, apparently coming from atop one of the radar towers which we as kids used to call &quot;big golf balls&quot; as they used to look like when they were covered with the white circular enclosures. After a few minuted the laser stopped and about a half mile behind it, (facing the western sky) a fuzzy red kind of smeared oval just dropped out of the sky approx. 1000 feet high, and slowly moved to the east at a five degree angle, horizontally. And then just stopped and faded away. With my years of sky watching I am sure this was not a meteor, jet, copter or exhaust from a airplane.  This moved with intelligence. All of us spotted it and found it unusual that this device would be in such a close proximity to the laser signal. Which is obviously what it is and what it was doing at that specific time, with this UFO device so close to it.

The temperature was 17 degrees Celsius and humidity 100%. I was outside looking directly overhead and noticed a small white light (like a small star) darting and turning in tight angular patterns at extremely high speed. I watched the light move erratically in this way for about three minutes. Occasionally the light would suddenly disappear and then reappear a little further north. Eventually it just disappeared from view. Shortly afterwards I saw a jet lower in the horizon towards the west tracking a slow straight line south, and then the clouds began to blow in covering the sky within a couple minutes.", "Connection With Missing Time Experience  This witness had no idea about the missing time event. I had a telephone call from a lady who lives in Kelowna, British Columbia today, August 26, 2003. She explained that a friend had cut out an article which ran in the Kelowna Capital Newspaper about a UFO Investigator Seeking Witnesses To A UFO Sighting. The lady told me she saw an unusual object in the night sky on July 31, 2003. She also told me she has a habit of glancing up into the sky as she has a beautiful view of the stars and it is very dark in her area. On this night the woman had already turned in, but couldn&apos;t sleep due to how warm it was in her home. The lady got up out of bed and went outside for some weird reason and when outside the lady looked towards the south. As the witness sat out looking around she spotted something, her thoughts were there shouldn&apos;t be any airplanes out here at this time of night, but there was something very strange. She watched an object traveling from east to west and described the object as being almond in shape and a luminas green in color. The witness also reports only seeing one green light. The lady reports that from their location, which was not at all far away from the two ladies who experienced the missing time, something very strange took place. She brought out her camera to take some pictures, but as she tried to take her photos, the camera would not work. It went dead! Also she reports that the evening was warm, and she could hear coyotes cutting up. But soon they became silent, and so did everything else around them including the crickets which were making some noise. She said it was if someone had clicked off a switch. The air went from a nice sweet smelling night to a musty cold in this dead silence. Also this witness said that two nights ago a person telephoned the radio station (CKOV) on an open line call in program and reported seeing a streak of light, and at the front of this streak a round ball was noted and the caller reported &quot;it&quot; had landed somewhere in South East Kelowna in the exact area where the green object had been witnessed, also where the two ladies had their missing time event. HBCC UFO Note: This sighting is very, very important due to the date of this sighting, the time it was witnessed, the color which was green and the shape, which is reported here to be almond in shape. Also what has me all excited over it, is due to the location where the object was observed, which was where the two ladies watched the beings on the side of the highway and the green lights, then experienced the missing time. There will be more coming on this case, also I have interviewed the second witness who had the missing time on July 31, 2003 and will be writing up the report really quick. Before I forget, I will be contacting CKOV in hopes of getting some information, and if not maybe I may get lucky and have them request that this witness to the streak of light get a hold of me.

The object was brighter than any star or planet in the sky, flying horizontally at approximatly 30 degrees above the horizon.

At first I thought it was a plane but then convinced myself it was to far up to be a plane. My next thought was a satellite, but then I saw another one and another one. We counted at least six and they traveled at different speeds and seemed to zig zag every once in a while. We watched for quite a while then they stopped going by. One seemed to travel at a great speed as for as high up as it appeared it crossed the sky quite quickly. It may have a reasonable explanation but none I can come up with. I do not consider myself a believer of UFOs, but I do know it is a big universe and to think in all of that space we are the only one&apos;s would be kind of a stretch. Additional Information:  Hi Brian, It was pretty late and I was on my to bed. I said Sept. 1 but I meant Aug. 1 of this year (2003). I&apos;ll tackle your questions one at a time. As for meteors, I&apos;m no space expert but I do watch the sky allot and I&apos;ve seen allot of meteors and shooting stars and they definitely not either of those. I mentioned they zig zagged once and a while and I should mention they also traveled in different directions. There were no tails or trails behind them but they were also pretty high up, just a dot of light. As for time of night it must have been 10:30 or 11:00. My step-daughter and I watched for around 20 mins. I say Aug. 1 but I&apos;m not quite sure as I didn&apos;t think much about it until my wife pointed out the story in the capital News the other day. There was no pattern to them. They just traveled back and forth. We saw several but I was guessing we were watching 5 or 6 more than once. No stoppage and no sound as far up as they were. It was kind of funny, earlier in the evening a plane passed over and my father in law told the kids it was a UFO. When we saw the lights we were quite taken a back. We tried to watch through binoculars but couldn&apos;t focus on the lights to get a good look at them. I told the Step-daughter that if they were UFOs then the air force jets should be coming by anytime but they didn&apos;t come. I&apos;m sure what we saw had to have a reasonable explanation but I had to think after I read the story. I would be interested in hearing if anyone else saw these lights. Feel free to contact me if you would like anymore info. On your website I noticed there seems to be allot of activity around the Houston area, what do you think they would be interested in up there?  Take it easy and have a good weekend. Thank you to the witness for the report.

I saw three bright orange objects in the western sky at what I estimate to be six or seven thousand feet altitude above the desert floor. Two of the objects were at the altitude mentioned, the third was below the other two at about two thousand feet. The objects appeared to be stationary and were approximately 30 to 40 miles distant. I estimated their actual location to be about 20 miles directly south of the city of Phoenix. This area represents the very eastern edge of the Barry Goldwater Test Range. From my vantage point these lights were extemely bright compared to every other light source in that direction. After I first sighted them, I pulled off the road and watched them through my driver side window for about ten minutes. At the end of that period they quickly faded out and were replaced with two more similar objects at about the same altitude. I knew this location to be near the Goldwater test range and had observed lights there in times past. However, those lights were moving and weren&apos;t nearly as bright and bluish white in color. The lights I observed last night were incredibly bright with a bright orange, almost yellow hue. They were also pulsating irregularly. The second set of lights faded out quickly just as the first set had done. I then got back on the road and continued driving west. About ten minutes later I saw another set of lights pop on and decided to head to that location as fast as I could. It took me about 50 minutes to get to that location. En route the lights kept popping on and fading out as they had done before. When I finally approached the area a new set of lights appeared approx. 3 to 4 miles from where I stopped the car. At this point I could make out the diamond shape. Again, they were stationary. Had they been military flares on the test range, they would have been slowly descending and I would have seen smoke and small parachutes. However, that was not the case. At my close proximity I observed that they still had a bright orange color. There was no sound. I saw no other aircraft in the area except for commercial flights heading to Sky Harbor airport from the west. By about 11:00 pm, the activity ceased and I drove back home. If this was a military exercise using flares, they are the most unusual flares I&apos;ve ever seen. I would appreciate knowing if anyone else in the area observed them and if indded there was an exercise taking place on the test range.((NUFORC Note:  Date indicated by witness may be flawed.  We suspect witness intended to indicate August 27, not August 28, and we have amended the date above.  Also, se believe that some type of pyrotechnic device being used over the BMG/Gila Bend Firing Range would have to be ruled out, before we could conclude that the witness observed something unusual.  However, the witness seems to rule out that possibility, and we recognize that flares usually give off a smokey trail, which is visible, and the witness correctly reports.  Please see somewhat similar report from Mesa, AZ, for the same date at 20:45 hrs..  If the events are the same, the data from the two reports could be used to triangulate on the location of the lights.  PD))", "I am a student at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. I am now home for the summer and when I got home from work one night I saw three objects in the sky. They had kind of a red glow and they seemed to be moving in a coordinated pattern, kind of like they were looking for something. They made no noise that i could hear and were flying pretty low to the ground. They were too far away to discern what the shape of the objects were. They were moving pretty fast and all three of them were kind of zig zagging as they went along.", "A light emitted other other lightsThis is another strange thing I have seen in the night sky as an amateur astronomer.  I was out with my telescope around two in the morning and about ready to call it a night when I noticed a star directly overhead.  It was not especially bright but I knew that it did not belong in that constellation of stars.  As I looked at the constellation and was telling myself that it didn&apos;t belong, it grew brighter and brighter.  It did not move at all; it just got brighter.  It came to a point when it was brighter than any other star in the sky, which made me think I was about to get nailed in the face by a meteor. You know what they say; if it ain&apos;t moving, it&apos;s coming straight for you.  So, you&apos;re saying to yourself, big deal! That&apos;s around the time of the Persied (maybe Leonid, I forget) meteor shower. I know that and I know what meteors look like.  Well, the best part was that , as I watched for the impact, the light sent out about 5 or 6 dimmer lights in quick succession, one at a time, in separate directions.  In fact, it seemed as if they shot out in a perfectly geometrical design.  The little lights moved off in straight lines then the central light that first drew my attention started going dim.  It grew dimmer and dimmer until I could no longer make it out.  It never moved laterally.  I figure something came into the atmosphere straight down over me, let smaller craft loose, then went vertically back out of the atmosphere. I&apos;ve seen meteors that fragment but they never break up symetrically.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  One of two excellent reports submitted by same witness, who appears to us to be an excellent witness.  Both reports from Brea, CA, during 1977.  PD))", "Dancing light in the Georgia skyI noticed a light in the sky south of Mars (which is highly cisable these days). I noticed this bright light that at first appeared to be a star, but it began to move. It wasn&apos;t like a plane in the sky, it moved left and rright and up and down. It changed direction very quickly. I made my wife and fathe in law get out of the bed to see it and they confirmed that they were seeing the same thing I was. This lasted for about an hour or so, until I lost visual contact due to cloud cover. I did notice that there seemed to be a change of red to blue in the &quot;twinkle&quot; of the light((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnesses might have been observing a celestial body of some type.  PD))", "Bright white and blue flashes. (Lightening)Again today I received a local telephone call from a Houston resident who wanted to ask a couple of questions, and to inform me of something unusual that was seen by her, and her two teenagers. Both the Mom and the kids reported seeing a very bright white flash of light, followed by a extremely bright flash of blue light which lit up their property. No object or sound was heard, nothing at all actually other than the bright flashes of light. I did some quick checking and found out that one punch of lightening was seen at the time these folks witnesses the flashes of light. So this one was solved and glad to be able to figure it out quickly. Seems like to many sightings are going unsolved out this way. So again, lightening was the cause of the white and blue flashes of light. I also guess they wondered about it as no thunder was heard following the flashes of light.

I observed a white glowing round object approximately the size of a bottle cap at half an arms length, slowly traveling from South to North low in the western sky. The object had about the same luminescence as a bright full moon and could still be seen as it passed behind the area trees. Unrestricted viewing observation time was about 2 seconds, total observation time was approximately 5 seconds before the object left the area.((NUFORC Note:  We know this witness from several earlier reports.  We consider him to be quite credible.  PD))", "((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses were looking at either Mars, or at a bright, twinkling star in the northeast sky.  PD))FLASHING RED, GREEN and WHITE LIGHTS THAT ALTERNATEWell, let me begin by saying that i do realize that mars is going to be at it&apos;s closest to earth on august 27th, 2003 as it has in roughly 60,000 years. With that in mind, i have seen something in the sky that i&apos;m not sure if it was mars or something else. On August 6th at 10:00 p.m. i&apos;m driving with my two sons and look toward the moon (which was in the southern sky) and directly to the bottom left (at about the 8 o&apos;clock position) we saw a light that was flashing red. Now upon focusing with the naked eye, we could see that it was not only flashing red but also had green and white flashes which would alternate between the three. Very visible! We were very impressed with what we were seeing. We returned home after discussing it on the road and nothing more was said. Now on the next night (August 7th) i went outside in my backyard and looked at the moon again (which was super bright)  in the southern sky, and noticed once again that the red, green and white light was there, only this time at the bottom right at around the 4 o&apos;clock position. This time i went inside and grabbed my binocculars that have 20x50mm field of view 171 ft./1000 yrds. I could see it really well other then the natural unsteadiness of holding them. I&apos;m not sure, but it looked to me as if it was moving ever so slowly. I&apos;m not laying money on that tho. Well, i observed this light for about an 1hr and a half untill i could&apos;nt see it anymore for it had been moving to the west and had tree blockage. I don&apos;t know if mars or any other thing would produce lights of red, green and white which alternate. Very very distinctive. These lights were just a little bigger than a star in size, but i&apos;m not dismissing the fact that it could have been some sort of star or anything other then a UFO. I just want to know what it was.", "Silent red/yellow lighted craft north to south in Green Bay night sky.At 10:20pm on Wed. August 13th,  my spouse and I were out in our back yard,  a few miles east of Austin Straubel airport in Green Bay, WI.   We noticed a large reddish twinkling star,  which we found to be moving.  It began at 45 degrees up in the south sky,  and proceeded to 90 degrees straight above,  then flew continuously in a straight line to the north.  It has distinguishable yellow and red lights that were twinkling.  It made no sound.  It was approx.  10-15 times larger than a star,  but only about 1/10 the size of the full moon.((NUFORC Note:  Wife&apos;s report of same event.

We were to meet in El Dorado Hills for some supplies. It was late, about 10:15pm when we met at his RV. We were all outside on a very clear warm evening, No moon that night you could see billions of stars and easily spot a satellite going by in space, and I did. Being an avid astronomer myself, I pointed almost directly up at the sky and said &quot;look at this satellite going by&quot; So by the time everyone looks up and sees it - out from the south came a fish-tailing light about the same brightness as the satellite. It was fish-tailing from left to right as it went forward in space. And guess what, it was on a collision course with that satellite! ((Uncle&apos;s name deleted)) uncles older niece  (sic--cousin to witness??) said &quot;what&apos;s that thing below it?&quot; My jaw dropped.. I replied, &quot;I don&apos;t know..&quot; We all watched as this weird object made its way with the satellite in it&apos;s path. When it got to almost where it looked like they were going to collide.. BOOM! This thing just went crazy, started doing these violent superfast zig zags around the satellite as if it were threatened!! It did that in an instant, and when it did we all screamed at the same time! Look at what we were witnessing way up in space! And I bet we were the only ones to see it. You had to be looking up at the right place at just the right time. Nothing we have will ever reproduce the swift movements of whatever that thing is/was nor does it make any sense to have such vehicles behave like that. After the zig zag attack on the satellite, the craft went back into it&apos;s fish-tailing left to right movement as it went forward, heading West, high above the earth. About a half a second-left and a half a second right is about the pulse it was moving at. It seemed like an inefficiant way of travel. Very alien. We watched it fishtail for about a minute until it was too far away to see anymore. You probably won&apos;t believe this, but I had a sighting 2 years prior to this in the same ar! ea! With this sighting I am now fully convinced we are NOT alone in the universe.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

She told me she saw something that was pretty peculiar around 8:30 p.m. She told me it was remarkable to her, so much so that she wanted her neighbors around to discuss what she saw but no one was in the area at the time. she also believes that she may have been the only one who witnessed this object, but of course at this time she hasn&apos;t heard from anyone else yet who may have saw it. The witness went on to say it was a perfectly round metallic silver object moving across the daylight sky. The lady also said it was round apposed to being cylindrical or egg shaped and stressed it was as round as a ball. The object was moving in a easterly direction and she got the impression it was very, very distant. It moved at a steady pace, it didn&apos;t stop, it didn&apos;t hover it just kept moving along through the sky until she lost sight of it. She also heard no sound coming from it. No trail or tail was witnessed. She gave a guess at what the size of the object may have been. She took a guess and estimated it may have been the size of a nickel, or at least close after holding out her hand at arms length. She estimates she observed it for approx: 2 minutes before she lost site of it when it went behind the hills. Thank you very much to the witness for the report.

This particular night I was staring up at the sky and there, directly above us, at what seemed like miles in altitude, was a gigantic triangular thing with bright lights on each tip of  the triangle. The thing just sat there motionless for a couple of minutes. Then, without warning, it began rotating back and forth as if on a fixed point. After I came out of my state of shock I grabbed my dad and showed him what I was looking at. My dad is not very emotional. He just kind of looked at it and said, &quot;Oh yeah. My brothers and I use to see that thing out on the farm all the time when we were kids.&quot; Then he went back to spraying the apples while I flew inside the house to get my mom and grandma to show them the thing. They were frustratingly slow and was begging them to hurry. By the time we got out there, the thing was gone and I was royally p.o.ed. My dad was still standing there with the hose. I asked him where the thing went. He said he didn&apos;t know. That was the last we ever saw of the big triangle.

I had just bought a new digital camera and was trying it out on my tripod. I live on a lake and we had just experienced a severe thunderstorm which had abated and the cloud formations were beautiful.

I was not viewing the scene through the camera. I was simply watching the clouds roll with my eyes and pressing the shutter on the camera which was on the tripod at my side. I saw nothing odd or unusual. After shooting eight or ten pictures, I took the camera upstairs to the computer and downloaded the pictures for editing or deleting. To my amazement, there were several photos depicting a bright light beginning at the top of one of the photos and falling through a pine tree quite rapidly through several of the photos. It was not in the shape of a saucer or any other shape, but it was quite clearly a light which was moving through a three second sequence of photographs. Then it split into two lights. I was not frightened by that sequence until I viewed the next photograph. It depicted a smokey trail that wove around not only the tree but also snaked around a light pole and through the atmosphere. I had seen that phenomenon before on television shows on cable channels which reviewed videos and photographs taken by others who had witnessed the same sorts of events. I reviewed the sequence of photographs for over two hours and concluded I was not a nutcase. I am an attorney and quite sane.

It just kept going and going and at first it was the same tiny orbit but as time went on the course would change slightly and it got bigger and bigger and it seemed that towards the end another object joined the course. It couldn&apos;t have been a light from earth because there was no stream of light and where there was no cloud you couldn&apos;t see anything, But where there was a thick cloud cover you couldn&apos;t see anything either so if there were a light it would show.

It was nothing unusual but I was entertained for a brief second and started looking for more.  There really is a lot of stuff flying around up there. At any rate after a couple of minutes my eyes caught a very faint light that appeared to be a satelite traveling NW-SE at the speed any typical satelite would.  At first I thought nothing of it but then my eye caught 2 more lights, just as faint as the first, forming a triangle.  The lights (I presume a satelite or group of satelites) appeared to be flying in formation at the same speed and altitute or outlined a very large craft.  How I saw this with all the light pollution around Seattle was pure luck.  Two others also saw it after I pointed it out. I believe what I saw definitely originated right here on planet earth but what exactly it was is a mystery.  It could have been something very unique.  I&apos;ve never seen anything like this before and I&apos;d love to know what it was...  3 unrelated satelites that by chance ended up in a triangle formation?  3 related satelites flying in formation?  Some sort or communications array?  A secret spy/weapons/science platform?  Who knows?

I suspect you witnessed the three satellites which are seen to fly in formation, and which are thought to be part of the U. S. Navy &quot;N.O.S.S.&quot; satellite surveillance system.  We have received reports of them since 1996.  They are visible for several weeks, and then they disappear for a while.  Then, months later, they, or something identical, will appear again.  They are in an orbit that is approximately 90 minutes long, so you can plan when, and where, they will pass overhead, or within sighting distance, and watch them on the next orbit. Thank you, again, for sharing the information with our Center! Cordially,   Peter Davenport((RESPONSE))Hey,   That&apos;s interesting.  I figured it probably was something military.  There sure is a lot of stuff flying around up there...  It&apos;s really amazing that more space flight accidents (such as Columbia) haven&apos;t occured considering the amount of debris smaller than a satelite we can&apos;t see in orbit.   Anyway, I like your web site...  It&apos;s interesting to see what is reported an where.  Alien or not I think it&apos;s all interesting.  There is plenty of technology that is made right here on planet earth that borders on science fiction.

As I got closer I noticed that the balloon was glowing and orange in color.  It seemed to be getting closer but moving away at the same time.  It began to take the shape of an orange slice (like the fruit).  As I sped up to get a closer look, the object started to move away faster than any other flying craft that I&apos;ve every seen.  It became so small in such a quick amount of time, it practically disappeared as it moved away further south.  I caught back up to it around 1st ave. and the object was back to its original size.

In November of 1995 I left work about 8 p.m.  I had to stop over at my parents house and decided to take a &quot;back road&quot; because it was quicker, the road is 7 miles of uninhabited state land, it is a winding dirt road, I had traveled it many times before and was very familiar with the road and terrain next to it.  The night was overcast so there were no stars or moon visible, about 2-3 miles down the road I came around a sharp bend and saw an object hovering above the treetops straight ahead (where the road takes another sharp bend).  At first I was confused about what I was looking at, it didn&apos;t make sense what I was seeing.  I stopped the car and put it in park, and rolled down my window, I heard absolutely nothing, the craft was about 50 ft down the road from me, It had 4 rows of orange or amber lights, and it had a whitish-green mist around the it, the bottom of the craft lit up the branches of the trees it was hovering over, the lights around the rim were NOT pulsating or changing colors, they remained constant and didn&apos;t seem to shine very brightly.  About this time I completely freaked out! I didn&apos;t feel I had time to turn the car around so I threw the car into park and gunned it, I went straight towards the craft and hoped to hell it wouldn&apos;t start following me or shine a light on my car, (I had heard the stories), Good God it was terrifying.  When I got just about under it I had to brake to make the corner and I remember glancing up, I don&apos;t recall exactly what I saw, but I do remember a small bright &quot;neon&quot; green light somewhere on the bottom of the craft, I drove like a bat-out-of-hell until I got to my parents house, I could hardly walk into the house my legs where so weak, and as soon as I saw my mom I started bawling like a baby, She didn&apos;t really know what to say when I told her what happened.  And to this day my family gets uncomfortable if! I bring it up. After that experience I had terrible nightmares, I&apos;m not saying I was &quot;abducted&quot; but the nightmares were along that line. and I would have panic attacks when I drove at night, especially since I live in a rural area. Well I could write more, but I think this will do.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; date is approximate.

Our eyes had become accustomed to the low light and we walked to a lookout. On the way back I looked over the resevoir and saw a light dart up then down below the range of hills in the distance. I stopped walking and watched and it flew up again, hovered with a shaking motion, then &quot;hid&quot; again. The object had a white light on the front, a red light on the bottom and a flashing yellow light on the back. At all times it was silent.I drew my lady friends attention to the distance and it obligingly darted into view again. It didn&apos;t seem to be affected by inertia and when stationary, seemed to shake as if it was between two repelling magnets. At one stage it dissapeared behind the range of hills and a vivid red light lit up the trees on the ridge as if they were on fire. Then it flew up, darted round then flew down to the water. A bright red light eminated from the front of it, not a beam, more like ambient light. After a couple of minutes it flew up again and started moving in our direction. It started off about 2/3 kms away and got to a few hundred metres away before I decided to leave. There was a feeling of danger and were glad to go, despite my curiosity.One of the strangest things about the event was that as we left the house to start our midnight ramble, I had a feeling that we would see something and I said as much to my girlfriend.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

I flew to them not able to close them further in. They disappeared and when the appeared to hear the communication, they returned and I flew towards them again, which game lasted and lasted.

One second you would be able to see it and then it would go out, and wouldn&apos;t reappear for 3 or 4 seconds. The times varied. We were then looking up at the stars again and all saw one huge light come across the entire sky (towards the south) and it seemed to be a shooting star or comet, but the tail following it seemed to be just part of the initial light streaking through the sky, and did not last for more than a quarter of a second. 3 or 4 of us saw it and all yelled &quot;woa&quot;.

For 10 seconds the &quot;star&quot; was shimmering an inconsistant red colour, and then the next 10 seconds and inconsistant blue colour. The colours were always visible and did not blink, but got brighter and darker some times. It seemed to be very far away.

We decided to move around the house to the northside where we could just skywatch for awhile longer. From this vantage point, away from the dusk to dawn light, we could see the Milky Way and some of the constellations.In the distance was a bank of clouds and heat lightning.

She went on to say, &quot;There was a bright flash of  light and then it went out.&quot;  As I kept searching the area she was pointing in, she continued, &quot;It didn&apos;t have any blinking lights.&quot;(referring to navigational lights).Since I didn&apos;t have my watch on at that time, I would have to guess that it was approximately 20 seconds from the first time she spotted the light until I saw it.It seemed to blink on again almost in the same location she had been pointing out to me. In a spot where nothing had been visible previously.This time, the light had a definite circular shape and slightly blue. Not the bright white flash she first saw. It was on for a split second and then went out. I ran into the house to get the binoculars and check the time. We searched the sky, but saw nothing else.At one point,  a thin haze of clouds moved over that portion of the sky, so we gave up looking.Neither one of us observed any vapor trails or any indications that it was a meteor.

I was driving north on Canal St. then took a right(east) onto Brook St and proceeded to the intersection of Elm St. From there I went left (north) onto Elm and it was near the Bellman&apos;s Jewelers store that my husband first noticed what looked to be a very large jet. It was pretty low and appeared to be heading toward the direction of Manchester Airport. He lost sight of it momentarily as it seemed to disappear behind the New Hampshire Insurance building.

When the light changed I drove on slowly past the NH Insurance Building (it is on the corner of Elm &amp; the Amoskeag) looking for the jet that had seemingly disappeared. I was looking out of my side window as my husband watched from the front windshield. It was near a funeral home that I decided to pull over to the curb as a set of lights caught my eye - red and white, not blinking and distinctly shaped like a triangle. At first I thought that it was somehow attached to the roof of the building like a set of decorative lights. But I realized that the lights were not fixed, rather they were HOVERING. And it was very large. I got a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach, like I had been kicked and lost my breath. I was overwhelmed with a sense of fear, wishing I wasn&apos;t there. I screamed at my husband &quot;It&apos;s hovering!&quot; He leaned over to look out the front windshield and the object began to slowly move toward the south. It was so close to us, just across the street. My husband then opened the car door and stepped out and look. I started to panic as I was afraid for him. The object made absolutely no sound and seemed to float effortlessly southeast over Elm St. heading toward the airport.! By this time I was so frightened I only wanted to leave. I shouted for my husband to get back in the car. When we got home we stayed up until 3 am talking about it and I had a restless sleep filled with nightmares. The above description, as I stated before, was taken from my journal. To this day I am frightened when I recall that night.

Within a few seconds as I was watching the northeast object, I looked again at the southeast object and it was directly over the mountains and big and bright again.  The object in the northeast sky started to go upwards and became smaller until it was no longer visible.  The object in the southeast sky was very bright and seemed larger than previous mornings.  This object could still be seen even after the sky had lightened enough for the other stars in the sky to disappear.  Between 6:30-7:00 am, it moved upwards until it was no longer visible.

Also saw object in northeast sky, smaller and seemed to be moving away.6:30 am:  Object in southeast sky higher and moving away.  No longer visible at 7:00 am.", "The same lady who reported the sighting above told me of another report. There was a dance which took place at the Barrhead town hall one evening. Many folks were in attendance. All of a sudden the lights burned out and everyone stood watching five objects hovering over a power sub station. She also said that many pictures were taken of the objects sitting in the sky, and most likely some of the photos could be found if someone was to go looking, or asking area residents who lived there at the time.

Now looking towards the southwest the one witness observed a long, silver point of light. He said it would have been approx the size of a key at arms length. The witness thought it may have been a reflection of an airplane as that was his first thoughts, but he just took his eyes off it for a split second, and when he looked back up at it, it was gone. (He said nothing at this point to his friend)  The two men kept eating their lunch and a few seconds later the witnesses friend said, quick look over there, the friend now caught something with his eyes. When the witness turned to look at what his friend was pointing at, the object had vanished. His friend said it disappeared so quickly, and he said it just faded out into the blue sky. When the friend saw the object he said it was the size of a nickel at arms length. Both men reported seeing it coming from the west and in a few seconds it was in the east, the size of a nickel. They reported the color as being a metallic silver, and at the end of the sighting the friend said it looked just like a sphere in shape. That was the last time the fellows seen the object in the sky. Thank you to the witness for the report.

In the days after the events of 9/11/02 I knew the skies were empty of civilian traffic so I thought I would keep my eyes open for possibly any military traffic. After not seeing anything on the night of 9/11/02. I stopped over a friends house the following evening (9/12/02) and after talking about it we headed outside at approximately 20:00 to 20:10 hours the skies were completely clear with quite a few stars and by luck within a few minutes of heading outside we both at the same time sighted (2) two lights moving in tandem with the southern light trailing the northern light at a distance of about one inch in relation to a thumb and forefinger of an out-stretched hand, I approximated them to be at orbital heights and speeds moving from East to West. I immediatley considered them to be satellites due to their speed and brightness but thought it was odd that they were traveling in such close proximity to each other and at that instance the trailing southern light grew much brighter almost blueish in intensity than the northern light and suddenly burst ahead of the northern light. Following this, the northern light also grew brighter and jumped ahead of the southern light,this occured at about the 1 o&apos;clock position and as they crossed to about the 2 o&apos;clock position they both began a counter clockwise spiral rotation around each other as if they were playing follow the leader. We first picked up the objects up at approximately the 11 o&apos;clock position and followed them through to just past the 2 o&apos;clock position before loosing them in the light pollution of our city. The entire time my friend and I were calling out to each other verifying what we each were seeing to be sure we were really seeing these objects and I specifically recall the excitment from both of us when the spiral maneuvers began. I am an aircraft mechanic and a longtime aerospace/aircraft buff and have been employed by NASA since the mid 1990&apos;s, so I consider myself to be somewhat knowledgeable regarding aircraft/aerospace and I have on many occasions located, tracked and viewed various satellites and the Intermational Space Station this is why I had determined the objects to be of a orbital height and speed in relation to the time it was taking them to cross the night sky. During the entire duration of this event there was no detectable noise and at the estimated heights it was impossible to determine if there was any type of shape associated with the two lights.", "Strange light over LodiAround 9:00p.m. I was sitting outside with some company. We were just hanging out enjoying the cool night. I walked out to the driveway and a light caught my attention out of the corner of my eye. I looked up (toward the East) and saw this very bright, deep, orange/red light flying very very fast through the sky. As it flew it zig zagged. I screamed for everyone to come look. For about 15-20 minutes we watched this light zig zag, go straight up at a high rate of speed, go straight down at a high rate of speed, go side to side, get real bright then very dim. I&apos;m not good at guessing miles, but those with me guessed it was about 5 miles away. It was really amazing and we have no idea what it could have been.  It was sooo fast and moved incredibly.  All together there were six witnesses.", "star shaped incredible rate of speed low whirring sound at nightupon walking out my front door to get a pack of cigarettes I observed a star shaped object giving off large rays in every direction moving at an incredible rate of speed at about 3000 feet estimated speed mach 7 with a low whhhiiirrr sound trailing it. It covered one quadrant of sky within 8 secondfs then disappeared from my vieew heading east northeast from west to east heading out towards the ocean", "BURNING disc  sighting 1960At this time, my first sighting, I was 5 years old and being carried by my father. My brother and mother followed us between our house and our grandparents. It was cold, clear sky, mid winter. I have consulted with the memories of my parents and my brother as to be as correct as possible as memories tend to be distorted with time. We all agree to the following: It was dark and we were walking between houses. My mother noticed a large  fireball like-disc hovering in the sky,appearing very high, yet very visible and detail could be seen of pieces of burning material falling away, yet too, this object stood still for about 20 minutes. My grandmother and grandfather came out to see also. The object slowly began moving westward and stopped burning and simply glowed reddish yellow and over the next minutes of the sighting, the object faded away from our sight. At Peter&apos;s suggestion , I am filing this report  and felt it irrelavent, yet, according to Peter,any report, no matter how long ago,may very well be remembered by someone else also in a different geographic location, and become relavent, Thanks Peter Davenport, for the best Ufology site on the internet..((NUFORC Note:  Thank you for the compliment!  We have spoken with this witness on several occasions, and have looked at video tape he took on August 2nd, 2003.  He seems quite credible and objective to us.  We strongly suspect there is merit to his reports.

There were two protrusions sticking out of the big circle, one east and one west. The western protrusion is a small rectangle but bigger than the opposite.This is not a hoax.", "Large White &amp; Orange Sphere over Kannapolis Concord NC AreaI was traveling South on I-85 outside of Kannapolis/Concord NC at 2:00am on Monday July 28th 2003 when I noticed a bright light over the trees to my left.  I would not have given it much though except that it was so large and bright.  I watched it as I drove looking for some type of support like a pole underneath it or perhaps an aircraft above it.  I reached a point where there were no trees in the way of my view and I saw for the first time that it was hanging in midair completely independent.  Intrigued I pulled my car over to the side of the road, got out, and tried to make sense of what I was seeing.  It was a ball of light, about the color of an florescent light bulb only a bit whiter and much brighter; and when I say ball I mean a 3 dimensional object in the form of a sphere, and it was as far as I could tell a perfect ball shape, no flaws apparent, very vivid, very well focused, sharp edged sphere. The color was uniform through out its surface except for a small patch of orange on the bottom. You know how when you look at an incandescent light bulb you can see the filament burning inside of the clear or frosted glass? Well it was nothing like that.  The light was even through out, almost as though it WAS light.  The object made no sound, it did not change in intensity, there were no sparks, no fumes, no smoke, no windows, no antenna, no landing gear.  I could not tell it&apos;s size but I know it was big.I could hold my hand out in font of me at arms length and cover about 90% of the object. I didn&apos;t have the slightest bit of fear, I was to busy taking it all in.  Every fiber of my being told me that what I was witnessing COULD NOT BE HAPPENING. I spent the entire time determining what it was not, and believe me  I wanted it to be something I could identify, but it was not.  1. it was NOT an airplane 2. it was NOT a balloon 3. it was NOT a helicopter a) if it was a helicopter with a spotlight pointed at me, then they would have had to be pointing the light directly at me and continued to point it at me until it went out of sight because the light never became an ellipse.  It maintained its circular (actually spherical) shape for the entire observation; plus I never heard a sound.4. it was Not burning swamp gas a) it would seem to me that if it were a gas then it would have been some irregular ever changing shape as it would be unconfined.5. it was NOT Venus, a meteor, or a re-entry / launch 6. It was NOT the moon.7. I don&apos;t think it was &quot;Balled Lightning&quot; what ever that is. I don&apos;t know if it can exist on a clear, and calm summer night; but it just seems as if it could not have been so large and so steady then move slowly away without a perceivable change in color or intensity.8. It was NOT a satellite.a) it was not viewable the next night same time/place; b) it filled a full four inches of my field of view, c) it did NOT appear to &quot;move along&quot; with me as I traveled south. I started out looking forward towards the object.Then saw it through a break in the tree line and it was right beside me.  By the time I pulled over (half a mile later) it was slightly behind me.9. It was NOT built by McDonnell Douglas. I observed the object for about 2 minutes then it moved slowly away from my line of sight toward the East until I could no longer see it.  This is the first time anything like this has ever happened to me in my 36 years.It was real, and I will never forget one moment of it.((NUFORC Note:  The planet, Mars, would be visible in the southern sky at the time of the sighting, but it would not be as large as a man&apos;s fist, held at arm&apos;s length.  We do not know what he observed, but it sounds quite interesting.  PD))", "Bright star like light with blue and red lights shining downward while moving quickly in zig-zag patterns.This object looked like a bright star with red, blue, and white lights.  The lights were pertruding mostly downward and were shimmering at different intensities.  The downward lights would also vary in length.  The object was just over the mountain treeline mostly, but would zig-zag up and down, and also occasionally horizontally back and accross.  I also thought it was strange that it&apos;s movements weren&apos;t necessarily in straight lines either, and varied in speed and length.  It hovered mostly but would suddenly do one of those quick jerky moves.  It would dip down below or right at the tree line quite often.  The object was definatelly moving too fast to be a helecopter or balloon.", "Very high in the bright blue sky, string of pearls,Working on a roof installing skylights one worker looked into the bright sunny sky and remarked &quot;what is that&quot;? I can only describe it as a string of pearls, they appeared as white dots against the bright blue sky, hanging and changing formation, sometimes v shaped then slowly changing to a straight line in relation to the ground. that is to say they bisected the earth. Several airlines passed by as this is the regular incoming flight path to San Diego airport. The planes altitude is approx, five to eight thousand feet, this (these) objects were considerably higher. As we were working we could not focus on the ufo for long, I can estimate they were visible for at least half an hour. The planes flying in must have seen them. After they were no longer visible I observed a  plane (military?) flying about the same altitude, the plane appeared quite small due to it&apos;s hieght. So I&apos;m guessing this object(s) must have been quite large. One worker thought they were ballons, as many car dealerships use strings of colored ballons to attract attention, this object resembled that but they were all white, and no balloon would have survived such altitude.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I drew pictures of what I saw for my parents.Three years later I was in the library at school and noticed a book on UFO,s.  Inside I found a drawing of what I had seen and what others had seen.  It said that others had said they had seen small Greys come out of these spheres.

During intermission to a vaudeville show at Hokum Hall in West Seattle, the entire audience and some performers went outside onto the front patio and steps to enjoy the brisk still air.  After some time, everyone--all the grandmas and grandkids and moms and supportive West Seattle locals--went back in for the second half of the show...that is, everyone except me and my two freaky friends (one of whom hadn&apos;t finished his cigarette), and my performer friend, who was headlining that night.  After a few more words, my performer friend went inside and there were only the three of us remaining.   We contined to stand on the stairs, staring out into the deep western sky.  On one side of me, Mr. ((name deleted)) dreadlocked-to his-waist I-Do-Magic-with-a-K was still smoking his cigarette while people-cough-when-I-walk-in-the-room Mr. D stood on my other side.  Both D and I shaved our heads then and if you didn&apos;t know us as some of the most gentle folks around you might have been intimidated by our sense of style then, very minimalist, tough guy black leather jackets and boots.  Experienced trippers we, we were all on about 1/4 hit of acid (25mcg) each that night, not enough to hallucinate, just enough to encourage a little synchronicity... Not even a minute had passed after my performer friend had returned to the fold, Mr. ((name deleted)) was speaking as I stared into the night sky, listening intently, while slowly, a pattern of lights in the distant west-northwestern sky &apos;dawned into my awareness&apos;[ital.] exactly in the place I had been staring.  I&apos;m sure we must have all noticed it at pretty much the same time, but I was the first one to interrupt Mikey...&quot;wait, that&apos;s &apos;not normal&apos;[ital.].&quot;  All three of us stood there silent, mesmerized, as the lights moved in formation due eastward in the sky.  They appeared to by flying a little north of us over maybe Everett (about 30 mi. to the north), at the speed and elevation of low-flying aircraft.  What was strange was that each entity was only represented by one light, of the brightness and pale color of a star.  They varied from white into reds and oranges and blues and greens but only as much as a star would.  There were about 13-15 lights all moving precisely parallel to the ground plane in fixed formation.  There seemed to be two lights ahead of the denser cluster.  The quality of the lights themselves did not flicker or vary in constance.  I could tell that the lights did not form the edges of a single entity because you could see the stars behind and between them as they passed. Due to the local topography of tall trees and two story houses, we had to hop down the stairs and run north to the intersection and turn right heading east to keep them in sight.  Acid is known for its ability to inspire hallucinations, but I hadn&apos;t been hallucinating at all that night, and was on such a low dose as to not expect it.  Still, I couldn&apos;t believe it and I checked in with my friends as we ran. &quot;Are we hallucinating?  Is this a collective hallucination between the three of us?&quot;  They both had similar thoughts about low doses and hallucinations and it is also extremely rare to hallucinate the SAME THING as two other people simultaneously.  Still, we wanted to double check and so when we saw this black gentleman, apparently a local, on the street, we stopped and asked him, &quot;Do you see THAT?!&quot;  He was staring at the lights but he said nothing, he only looked down for a moment and shook his head.  We took that as a &quot;yes&quot; and kept on running, keeping the moving light formation in sight.  Finally, as the light formation glided eastward, approaching a position northnortheast of us, it moved behind an extra tall tree on our block and we lost sight of it for a moment.  As the two leading lights emerged the trailing light formation no longer followed.  In the same way that the lights had dawned into my awareness, I watched the remaining two &apos;dawn out of my awareness&apos;[ital], right before my eyes. Wow.  We were silent.  We walked about two blocks or so back to Hokum Hall.  I always remembered the entire event taking about 30 really long seconds but there&apos;s a probability of it having been more like a minute and a half. As we walked back up the stairs, an eerie airy haunting tonal music wafted out of Hokum Hall.We stepped into the midst of the second half of the vaudville show and sat down as unobtrusively as possible.  Mr. ((name deleted--2nd musician)) was playing his glass armonica, one of only six in current existence in the entire United States, an invention of Benjamin Franklin banned in the early 1900s on the belief that it awakened the spirits of the dead.  Crystal bowls of increasing diameter turned together on an axis as Mr. ((2nd witness)) touched his moistened fingers to the rims, playing it like a piano.  The sound was hardly like that of a piano however.  Sonorous sirens, otherworldly, perfect music to commemorate my first UFO sighting.  I felt strangely honored to have witnessed the event, one of three in a crowd of 60 who narrowly missed an opportunity to see what we had seen. I shared this experience with a lot of people in Seattle in the days that followed; with my friends, with people in my local coffee shop, with my fellow bus riders.  Folks told me that it was on the TV and on the radio the night of the occurance.  I found the event reported on the front page of the Seattle Times and PI the following day, but after that, there was no mention of it to be found anywhere.   I was surprised by how many people, once I shared my UFO experience, in exchange told me stories of UFO sightings and alien encounters they had had at some point in their life.  Surprised especially by the ones I had known for years who had never mentioned it.  &quot;Some people think you&apos;re crazy,&quot; they&apos;d reply, &quot; so I don&apos;t talk about it much.&quot;  When I told my friend who shares my sun and moon sign (Aquarius and Virgo respectively), she said that she witnessed it also, only from a downtown location.  From her more northerly location, (for you out-of-towners reading this report, West Seattle is actually SW of downtown by about 5-8 mi.), she was able to she the shape of the formation--two &quot;V&quot;s.  &quot;Like geese,&quot; she said.  This correlated precisely with what I had seen, with the two lights out ahead and a greater cluster following behind.  Just like the lights had disappeared behind a tree for me, for her they disappeared behind a skyscraper.  In the same way--two lights remaining, then winking out. I have a B.A. in English/Professional Writing from the University of Puget Sound.  I was an honors kid growing up who won spelling bees and competed in math olympiads and writer&apos;s conferences.  I was a varsity athlete and leader of organizations both in high school and college.  I&apos;m not trying to boast.  I&apos;m just saying that I&apos;m no dumb broad.  I know what aircraft, meteors, and &quot;Russian space debris&quot; all look like.  This was &apos;none of the above&apos;[ital] and definitely nothing that fits within the realm of ordinary human experience or logic.  Go figure.  ;)((NUFORC Note:  This event was widely reported on the night it occurred, and the U. S. Space Command Headquarters, based at Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado Springs, CO, reported that it was &quot;space debris&quot; that flew to the west (sic) and landed in the Pacific Ocean.  What the formation of lights must have looked like to a witness experiencing the effects of 1/4 &quot;hit&quot; of LSD is beyond our ability to comprehend.  We are familiar with the witness, and she seems credible and sincere to us.  Time of incident was approximately 21:09 hrs. (Pacific).

This is now the third or fourth time since moving into this area a couple of years ago that I have seen large brightly lit objects of indeterminate shape floating out over a largely deserted rural area West of the City.  Last night coming from a meeting and dinner out, I observed a very large brightly lit object floating, for lack of a better term, just over the tree line headed West (there is a small commercial airport) West of the City.  However, this object, didn&apos;t seem to be moving like an aircraft in a landing pattern.  Object was barely moving!  What attracted my attention was the unusual configuration of the lights which seemed to be in a row all on one side facing me.  This was as big as a dirigible or blimp, but didn&apos;t seem to emit any sound.  It was of indeterminate distance, and size.

I am lying on my back on chairs outside a hotel, waiting for people. I noticed a bright light way up in the sky. I first thought that it was a satellite reflecting the sun. But then it started to move slowly, erratically, in a small area. I discarded the idea of statellite. After more than 15-20 sec., it went on my left at a quicker speed, as a plane would go  when in altitude. It stopped, and disappeared very quickly, as if flying away from earth at a dazzling speed. That&apos;s it.", "50 or so small lights flying in formation from NNE to SSWI was sitting on my roof watching the nightsky what I often do. I clearly know the diference between a star, planet, airplane or satelite. Then suddenly I saw many lights approaching from the NNE and moving in straight line to the SSW. I could only see them in the darker part above me because the lower horizons were too polluted by residential lighting. The only thing I saw were lights, I didn&apos;t see any shape that connected them. The amount of lights were somewhere between 40 and 70. The majority was shaped in a V-shape. Outside this V-shape there were also a few that formed a straight line. Then there were a few seemingly randomly spreaded around. There was no sound, also not after they had dissappeared for 5 minutes. The lights were white and if not for the moving they seemed just like stars. All the lights (V-shape, straight line and the randomly spreaded) didn&apos;t move relatively to each other. It seemed they were flying in formation. At first I thought they were many single objects. The next morning I realized that they could have been the lights of a single object. Because I don&apos;t have any clue of how far the lights were I also cannot say anything about the size of the object. If they were all connected the total shape was much larger then an airplane used for intercity flightsthat usually flies at 3 to 4 km height.Although I&apos;m 100% conviced that this is pure coincidence the following is worth mentioning: After the lights dissapeared over the SSW there also entered a local airplane from the NNE which headed in the direction of W where the local airport of Taichung city is. This is quite normal because every 10 or 15 minutes one can spot one. Again the lights and the airplane were not observed at the same time. The airplane showed up after the lights had dissappeared.", "A BRIGHT YELLOW BURST of light 3&quot; in diameter - then a small white lightNOT A FLASH...BUT A BURST of light. Ever since my report June 21st of this year I find myself watching the sky almost nightly. Me and my girlfriend were staying at a small lake cabin that a co-worker is letting us use while he is out of town. This is about 15 miles west of Omaha. We had taken an air mattress to the dock and laid back so I could watch a star filled sky like no other as you can imagine)(12am).  Not alot except for meteors, satallites and the I think I saw somethings that you aren&apos;t sure if you did or didn&apos;t see it.  By 3:30am she was asleep and I was just staring into the East Northeast direction approximately 30 dgrees down from the straight above position.  In a split second I witnessed a large busrt of yellow light in a perfect circular shape looking to be 3&quot; diameter from my point of view. This was definately out in space outer earth atmosphere or further. 1 Second later immediately below &amp; to the right of where this occurred I saw a white flash of light about the size of what the International Space Station looks like going overhead. I sat up saying &quot;what the **** was that?!&quot;  I startled her out of her sleep and she asked &quot;what?&quot; I told her to turn and look - I had seen the small white flash again only this time it was 45 dgrees to the right of its original postion. Both times it had flashed on for approximately 1 sec.  As she became more awake I pointed to the area that the light would hopefully show again. Of course it didn&apos;t.  This was the most spectacular thing I have ever witnessed - better than my June 21st sighting.  I would love to be hypnotized and taken back to the 24th burst of light and have the description of what I see recorded.  If it was a star exploding which I doubt is there any place I can inquire that would know.  I truely beleave that what I witnessed was the burst of an alien craft coming out of light speed or thru a worm hole or teleportation burst of some sort.  I am not nuts and could not beleave what I saw.  I know others had to see this... p! lease help explain what I saw and are there any other reports -EVER - that report the same burst - size - perfect circular shape - no after effect illumination or glow - I have not reported this to anyone...after all I wouldnt blame you if even you didnt beleave me...It does sound far fetched but it is the truth &amp; like I said before - hynotized me.", "Krackowski &quot;Fast-Proton&quot; Detection   VesselANONYMITY IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO ME...&quot;CIRVIS REPORT&quot;  dated 030712 -Object Description: Triangular Vessel -Size: 50-60 meters in diameter -Propulsion:Unknown(possibly Grav/amp)? -Location: 5-6 Kilometers due West of Council Mountain, Lat. 44* 37&apos; 30&quot; Long. 116* 15&apos; 00&quot; -Bearing&amp;Distance from OBSVR: 90*x1 Kilometer to 150*x3 Kilometers.

Suddenly, an oval shaped craft came down, out of nowhere, and hovered above the ground, about 1 foot off the ground.  This was about 50 feet from where we were sitting on our porch, and acroos a dirt road, in a cow pasture.  The craft just hovered there for about 2 minutes, we were silent and just watched it.  There was a slight humming noise coming from the craft, there were no windows, that we could see.This craft was about 5 to 6 feet in lenght, it was domed from the middle to the &quot;back&quot; end of it...the other end was aerodynamic...seems to me that it must have been at least 3 to 4 feet in width...maybe two beings could have occupied it.  Also, it was metallic in color, look like it may have been stainless steel.  After it hovered there for about 2 minutes, it slowly rised and then took off at such a speed that it was over the ocean and out of sight in just seconds.  I have told some friends about this, and they all seem to believe me, but I always get the idea they it really scares them that I saw this craft.  I think I have the approximate time and dates correct, I was 16 yrs. old when I saw this with my step-father, and I know that he only talked to me about this, and no one else.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

I had just parked my vehicle in the lot (blue Chevy pickup truck).  As I exited my truck I looked up to watch a commercial jet liner crossing overhead ... coming over the mountains from north to south.  I thought to myself ... &quot;what a beautiful day ... the sky was dark blue ... perfectly clear&quot;.  I was facing west/northwest.  As I watched the jet liner cross overhead I noticed there was another object in the sky (at about 10 O&apos;clock)... it was a circular object ... it was very high up in the sky ... and just a couple seconds later I noticed there was another object (a duplicate) moving behind the first object to the left ... both objects seemed to be moving slowly approaching from the west ... both objects were moving toward me ... approximately 20 seconds later the second object made  a 90 degree change of direction (to my left) and disappeared very rapidly ... it streaked and was gone quickly ... the first object continued moving toward me and reached a position at about 11 O&apos;clock ... I watched the first object ... it seemed to be hovering at a very high altitude ... it was very high in the sky ... it was silver in color ... it gave off a silver/white glow or sheen ... perfectly round in shape ... it seemed to be glowing ... I watched the second object for maybe 2 minutes plus ... I thought to myself does anybody else see this ... there wasn&apos;t too many cars in the parking lot ... I looked around to see if anyone was close by ... when I looked back up in the sky I could not relocate the first object ... it had disappeared. I would say that from my position the objects were definitely not conventional aircraft ... they were perfectly round in shape ... they were much smaller than the airplane that had just passed in front ... they seemed much smaller than the airplane because they were so much higher altitude.", "medium bright star moving south to north at great speed.we saw a light only about as strong as medium starlight. the object travelled south to north (slightly irratic but basically straight) the object appeared to be very high but it did not streak like a meteor. the only thing which struck me as odd was the speed at which it was moving. it tracked across the entire sky in a minute or less I had seen an aircraft moving at high altitude 30 or so miutes earlier it was flashing and more than one color... this was not flashing or twinkling just a medium bright star(in town probably much brighter out of town) it was just whitish light. we are not near any military airbase or place associated with strange objects, swamp gas, or crop circles... so a simple moving object in ther sky moving at such a speed strikes me as strange.", "07-30-03 19:00 CST 15 miles South of Birmingham on I-65   I was tailing a friend on the way back to Montgomery, AL following a trip to Birmingham to help him move his belongings. Heading South on I-65 approximately 15 miles below Birmingham, I saw what I first presumed to be a short contrail at 2&apos;o-clock [it was still daylight]. I looked again and noticed it was a perfect rectangle shape, like a flat non-reflective white 2-by-4, and seemed suspended in air - - no movement. It seemed huge. If it was a single-level passenger craft, it was designed for an average passinger height around 12 feet tall. As my friend was on his cell phone, I decided not to call him to verify, but when we returned from the trip I asked if he had noticed the bogey at 2-o-clock. Athough I have seen several different objects since childhood, it was important to verify what he thought because he is a Marine Sgt. and he has a knowledge of military - civilian craft. He noted that although he knew of an airport close by, he had noticed the object and that it was certainly not moving, nor was it a contrail. He had a rear glass window large enough to notice it still motionless a minute or so later.", "4 coloured lights in triangle shapeIt was approximately 11:30 AM, I was playing in the garden with my 1 yo. son. I noticed in the sky a very bright orange/red light high in the sky. It was +/- 5 times bigger than a star. It seamed to stay at the same place. A few second later I saw 3 other lights lined up with the first light, the second light had the same colour as the first one, the 2 others were green / blue. The first light did not move and the other 3 formed a triangle around the first light which was exactly at the middle. I found that very strange because the objects were exactly over my head and after they formed the triangle, they did not move at all during a couple of minutes. I decided to take a picture, so I ran into the house. I met my girlfriend in the stairs and told her what I saw, but she did not pay attention. I took my camera and ran on the balcony, the triangle had disappeared, but one of the orange / red light was still there. It started to move forward at speed of a jet (I guess), I took a picture and saw it go away during many seconds until it disappeared in the clouds.On the picture I took, we can only see a very small point in the middle of the sky. I was quite disappointed.I was very surprised to read similar UFO reports on this site. At my opinion, that was no helicopters or planes, because the lights were very intensive, there was no engine sounds. Satelites wouldn&apos;t have been so bright in the noon sky. It looked so unusual and fascinating !((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides interesting graphic of is sighting, which we may post.

I telephoned another witness tonight over the July 27, 2003 sighting in the Kimberly/St. Mary&apos;s Lake area. The witness reported to me that she was in bed, and couldn&apos;t sleep due to the warm temperatures outside. Her bedroom blinds were up and the window fully open and then she gave out a cry, &quot;holy cow&quot;. Their home is up on a large hill which gives them a very good view of the surrounding area. The witness suddenly noticed, what she thought was a bright star or maybe an airplane coming in with it&apos;s landing lights on because it was moving at this point. The lady mentioned that it was extremely large in size and flying very low. Actually the witness just laid their waiting to see a green and red light, thinking it was certainly an aircraft coming down the St. Mary&apos;s Valley heading in to land at the near-by airport. She told me that the airplanes take the route down the St. Mary&apos;s Valley when heading to Vancouver and back to Kimberly B.C. The lady still laying there and watching the bright white light moving faster as it grew closer. All of a sudden it started maneuvering in a zig zag pattern. At this point in the sighting, where she could not see it anymore she jumped out of bed and headed toward her bedroom door, opened it and ran through her cottage styled home until she reached her front door of her home. The time she unlocked her front door and stepped outside the light was gone. I mentioned to this witness after taking her report about the 8 witnesses who saw a ray of light over the Jaffray, B.C. area which I reported on. She told me the light/object was traveling southeast from Kimberly, B.C. and would have flown straight over Jaffray, B.C. (HBCC UFO Note: What makes this interesting is that we are finding more witnesses to the sighting which was originally reported to Peter Davenport at the NUFORC. Plus other people who witnessed the ray of light and the object itself. From what I am gathering is that the light/object may have caused the ray of light. But of course this is a guess on my behalf. I was also contacted by a very kind person today who read my report and told me of another witness who had made a posting at a UFO forum board and explained to everyone about this ray of light, same location, different witness. This lady also took pictures of the light ray and I am now trying to track her down so I can give her a phone call to gather more information on this whole event.

We were both looking at this are when we both saw a light the size and intensity of an average star wink on for about 1/4 to 1/2 a second and then wink off.  It reminded me of a lightning bug.  We asked each other if we had seen it, and confirmed it.  We kept looking at the same area and saw it again.  I then began counting and found that it winked on in regular cycles of 29-30 seconds.  It slowly moved its way northwest down the sky toward the horizon.  We watched it go toward the horizon for an hour and a half, when we lost it in the glow of northern lights just above the tree tops.  The flashing light grew fainter as it progressed down the sky, until it was visible only by means of my field glasses, which I had run inside to get.  The light was white and had no other color to it.At about 22:30 (or 1/2 hour into the sighting), both my wife and I saw off and to the side of the light we were tracking a second light wink on and wink off, as bright as a bright star.

I brought my mother&apos;s attention to it and we stopped in the could-a-sac long enough to see it change colors multiple times. We then ran to a neighbor&apos;s house and pointed it out to her.

Duration was approximately 1-3 seconds.  It left no visible trail, although it was shedding material as it descended.  No terminal burst was visible, and no sonic report was detected for up to 10 minutes after the event.Conditions were ideal for viewing at the time of the event.  CAVU/no clouds visible.

The witness told me what her family member did see was certainly a jet. All of a sudden the witness saw what she thought was a shooting star just to the north of the jet but a lot higher up. She says it started out like a shooting star but then there was a flash of white light and then it happened again approx: 20 seconds later and another flash. They both stood wondering if this may have been another jet as this one was going in a northwesterly direction. But as the witness watched she mentioned that the intervals weren&apos;t the same as a jet airliner. (meaning the flashing of the jets lights). It then disappeared and then in another 20 to 30 seconds there was another flash of light. The witness says this is where it gets a bit odd and figured it wasn&apos;t another jet that she was aware of. Thinking maybe it was something the military was flying overhead. She saw a flash in front of the object and it reminded her of a laser light. She also said you could see the light zapping a good distance in front of the object.

Perhaps someone would be kind enough to point me to a more suitable site?  In September, 1973, a neighbour and I were intending to drive to Port Alberni, a  city about one hour away, in a northwest direction from my home in Nanaimo, BC.  We left my house around 10 am, drove about a half hour north, and we both clearly remember turning west onto the highway leading towards Port Alberni. However, our next clear recollection occurred about seven hours later. We suddenly found ourselves on a dirt road, with the car motor running, and it was after five oclock.  There was absolutely no memory for either of us, of how we had spent the missing hours.  My friend was absolutely terrified, crying and shaking uncontrollably.  On my part, I was deeply puzzled about where we were, slightly shaken, but not really frightened. Since we did not know where we were, after a few minutes, I simply started driving in the direction my car was pointed.  After about 10 minutes, we reached the Island Highway, but we were roughly one hour south of where we started out in Nanaimo.  The place we re-entered the Island Highway was one and a half hours south or about 80 miles from where we both remember turning onto the Alberni Highway. I have absolutely no conscious memory of aliens, a craft, or anything of that nature, but I know that this experience can have few other explanations.((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.

There are/were no clouds over the mtn, and from our view point, it hovered, without moving for some time, up over the towers. It periodically faded out then would reappear not too far from the last spote we saw it.  It climbed higher and just to the right of where we saw it.  It appears perfectly round in our binoculars then a red light will spin every so often. It also appears to have something (light) come out of the top and/or bottom or both at the same time.

It streaked downward and dissapeared behind the stand of trees on the opposite shoreline.  It had the brilliance of a welding torch and did not drop straight down but came in at an angle.

The object looked to have three lights on the front in a triangle shape, the lighting was orange.  It definalty taveled through the clouds because the clouds were illuminated as it passed through.  It moved way to fast to be a plane. I have never seen something move that fast in the sky. Maybe it was a meteor from the sky and I mistook the course correction, or it was something unknown.

The wife estimated that the light was the apparent size of a full Moon, and &quot;spikes&quot; were coming off of it.

The couple also called a local observatory, which told them that they probably had been witness to the International Space Station. They also called the local Kimberly newspaper, which reported that their offices had received approximately five calls from citizens, reporting strange lights in the vicinity of Kimberly on the same morning. The witnesses will submit reports, when they get access to a computer.

It hadn&apos;t started raining yet, but the wind was very strong and the street&apos;s electricity flickered on and off several times. After several minutes something in the sky southwest of me caught my attention--- there were four lights circling inside or above the clouds. They were large and diffuse, much like those of an airplane coming in on approach above a low cloud ceiling, but there was no aircraft noise and they just kept circling. The path of the circle they made must have been at least a half mile in diameter, but it only took a second or so for each light to complete a rotation.I had been watching for about a minute when my next door neighbor came out on her front porch, so I pointed it out to her as well. While we were watching, my wife arrived home from the store and all three of us stood in the front yard staring and trying to come up with a rational explanation while the storm got closer and closer. The only thing we could come up with was that it was a group of spotlights, though not once did we see a shaft of light from the ground, nor did it seem to be striking the underside of the clouds. Instead, it seemed to be coming from behind the clouds. Every so often one or two lights would break from the circle and swing very wide. I have no idea what kind of promotional spotlights are on the market now, but I can&apos;t imagine one that could spin a cluster of lights that fast, or why someone would be trying to promote their business in this manner just moments before a huge electrical storm moved into the area.The rain began shortly thereafter and eventually obscured the lights from view, although we kept watching the storm from our porch. The storm itself was somewhat odd, but I don&apos;t want to take up space describing that here. My wife and I came outside again at about 23:00 and saw the lights again, this time almost directly above us. The storm had passed but it was still overcast above us. We watched and tried to determine a point of origin, but could not pinpoint one. Several times we noticed little clouds lighting up that must have been between the light we could see and its source, which reinforced our belief that the light source was above the clouds. We still never saw a beam of light from the ground. Also, if the light was coming from the ground, it seems like the spots of light in the cloud would have been elongated at their furthest point from the source and rounder at their closest point, especially after the whole thing moved from its point before the storm to its later point that was miles closer, meaning the the angle from the ground would have to have been much sharper, but the lights seemed to be pretty uniform throughout their rotation. At about 23:28, all the lights disappeared but one, which stopped moving and then disappeared also. I half expected to see them again tonight and discover that they were just regular spotlights being used for some sort of promotion, but there was nothing to see.", "An object that appeared at first to be a satellite zigzaged across the sky.I was looking at the stars in a park that overlooks Motala (a small town in Sweden in th province of &Ouml;sterg&ouml;taland).

It appeared to be about the same size as Venus view by the naked eye but it was pale orange in color and seem kind of fuzzy or diffused in comparison to the stars. Its velocity was analogous to a satellite however it was diffidently not in orbit as its trajectory was level as when it vanished it was not at the horizon. The zigzags (it made about 7 &ndash; 8) where of a very acute angle and no noticeable radius and the object velocity was unvarying throughout the 8 seconds that I viewed it.

I dreamt that my wife and I were abducted.  This was by no means the typical abduction experience that you hear about nor was it by any means a typical dream. The first night featured a dream that included a massive airlift of people being abducted while asleep. My wife and I were raised off of our beds, traveled through the house feet first to the back door, out the door then gradually into the air. We moved at a slow pace through the air. We met many others in the sky. All were floating through the air feet first dressed in pajamas. We landed in the Angeles Forest in the foothills of the San Gabriel Valley near a flying saucer.  One &quot;alien&quot; removed here helmet. She looked orientally human. She gave us shots in arm. Then we woke up. I remembered the dream. My wife did not. But we both had sore arms where the shots were administered and there were red marks. I had fallen asleep about 4:00 a.m. and awoke at 6:30. The experience seemed to last 20 to 30 minutes. Very clear like a single long scene from a movie with no cuts. This was a dream but of course what is a dream? This was by no means a typical abduction experience. No bright lights. No little green men. The alien looked very human.  There was no terror. There was no hypnosis required to help recall the dream. I remembered the dream as soon as I awoke.  But it was not a typical dream either!

No sound. Aprox size of basketball held at armsMy mom and I were walking to the library around 7pm on a weeknight when we spotted a circular shaped object coming towards us from the south (I was 7 yrs old, my mom 27 at the time). It stopped over a transformer above us a few feet west of us and maybe 500-700 feet above us. It just hovered there for a few minutes. We thought it was either waiting for a plane to pass by or drawing power from the transformer. After a few minutes of hovering it slowly moved going east, passing over us heading east towards Lake Michigan. The thing that I can not explain is how quiet the object was. Nothing I know of can move, stop, change directions and move again so quietly, not a sound. The size of the craft was about the size of a basketball held at arms length, and I&apos;d guess it was no higher than 500 or so feet. I remember the color being a yellowish changing to orange color that changed back to yellow, then orange. My mom remembers more lighting on its edges, like a ring of lights (I remember when we were looking at the object her saying that to me, and I never did see the ring of lights, she said it might be because of our height difference, I was a short 7 yr old then). My mom also believes that we lost as much as an hour that night. We went to the library to pick up a book and come home. Normally a trip like this would take 30 minutes at the most, but we were gone over 2 hours. My father asked what took us so long, and we didn&apos;t think we were gone more than 30 minutes and didn&apos;t know what to say. The next morning my mom contacted the Air Force and filed a report. She was made to feel like she was seeing things or saw swamp gas or an airplane. Now 40 years later, we still remember that night. I have a college degree with honors, a pilots license, a scuba license and am an amature astronomer. Nothing in my education or experience can explain what I saw that night. I&apos;ve seen bright Venus, comets, planes, weather balloons, hot air ballons, flocks of birds flying high over the city at night that looked ! like a flying triangle, but nothing that can move so quietly like that object. Currently I&apos;m involved as a volunteer searching for SETI with my computer at home. I find it interesting that so many people have seen UFO&apos;s and we prove them.

PD))", "Strange, vaguely discernible &apos;structure&apos; seen flying directly overhead at an airfield near Banbury, UKI am a glider pilot in the UK, and the following, which may be of interest to you, is a slightly amended and expanded form of a posting I made on a glider pilots&apos; online discussion group yesterday:  On Sunday 3rd August at about 1430 I was standing at the launch point at Shenington Airfield (near Banbury, Oxfordshire, England) when I noticed a small object passing overhead, downwind, directly above and in line with our E-W runway. At first I thought it was a tiny feather drifting with the wind a few feet above my head, but on looking again I realised it was much higher, moving in a straight line and at a steady speed. Not knowing the actual size of the object it was difficult to gauge its altitude against a clear blue sky; I would hazard a guess at somewhere between 3000 and 4000 feet, but that could be way out. The object was white, but with a slightly wispy, almost transluscent appearance which gave it a somewhat  indistinct outline, hence my initial reaction that it was a feather.  I could however just make out a definite structure, the best description I can offer being that it was basically rectangular in overall planform, and consisted of what might have been a lattice of booms, which gave it an appearance rather reminiscent of an old-fashioned TV aerial.  Seen from a long distance this would explain why it looked rather vague and wispy.  It was moving assymetrically, ie set at a slight angle in relation to its direction of travel, which was from west to east. It had every appearance of steady and purposeful foward motion, and remained observable as a white speck receding into the distance for a short time after it had passed overhead. There may well be a perfectly simple and reasonable explanation for what this object was, but at the moment my only choice is to regard it as a UFO, by which I imply nothing more than an object, apparently flying, which I was unable to identify. After I filed my first report on our glider pilots&apos; discussion group, another glider pilot, who that afternoon had landed in a field some 30 miles to the east of my position, reported that he and his retrieve crew had also seen the same object.  They too were unable to identify it.((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS))I will certainly email the guy who corroborated my sighting and suggest that he and his crew each file a report.As for the wind, at ground level it was very light, averaging about 5kts I would say, and was blowing down the E-W  runway with a little right-to-left crosswind component, so I would say somewhere around 280-285 degrees.  The object I observed was coming pretty well directly parallel to the runway, and almost overhead of it - I had to crane my neck quite a bit to watch it when it was abreast of me. Unfortunately I don&apos;t know what the wind at altitude was; I was down to be launchpoint controller that day and had to  resign myself to spending most of the day on the ground, so only had time for one very quick local  thermalling flight to1800 feet, then it was out with the brakes and back down again.  I suppose it&apos;s possible that the object I saw was drifting with the upper wind, but with allowance for wind deflection I would have thought its course would have diverged more markedly from that of the surface wind if that had been so. Furthermore, its smooth and deliberate progress across the sky was highly suggestive of something that was being propelled and/or under intelligent control - directly or remotely.  Given what appeared  on the face of it to be (as far as I could make it out), a somewhat unaerodynamic structure, I would have also expected it to have shown at least some signs of instability if simply being blown by the wind.I might also mention that in the past couple of weeks there have been other reports of UFO sightings in this part of England.  Very near to where the other pilot landed his glider there have been reports in the local press of people having seen strange objects in the sky, seewww.daventryonline.co.uk/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=696&amp;Ar ticleID=568425  I live some 50 miles to the SE from Shenington, and our local paper also carried a report of some people  in the next town to me having seen some strange lights hovering in the sky.I hope this helps.Warm regards  ((name deleted))((FOLLOW-UP #2))Perhaps I should just clarify something regarding the wind direction though - I had described the runway as &apos;E-W&apos; in my reply, because as the runway in use this was the direction of take off and landing.   The object I observed was travelling pretty well directly W-E, ie downwind on a heading of approximately 90 degrees true, and only with a small divergence from the *surface* wind blowing from 280-285 degrees. Given the effects of wind deflection I would have expected it to have been a bit more divergent from this if it was travelling with the wind at altitude.I have suggested to the other pilot that observed this object that he and his companions also file reports to you.Best wishes  ((name deleted))((FOLLOW-UP #3))PeterI understand there is now an explanation for the strange object I saw last week.  I was told there was a news report  about it.  I&apos;ve been trying to trace further information from the BBC website but have not come up with anything yet.  You may well have sources you know that you can plug into to find out more particulars.

Without Joe being kind enough to send the report, we may have lost this one. HBCC UFO Note: I telephoned the witness today (August 8, 2003) at his home in North Bay Ontario. The fellow was kind enough to share what he and two other friends had witness on August 8, 2003 at 12:32 a.m. Also I will be hearing from the other two witnesses who were there. I will update the sighting with their information after I receive it. Also pictures are going to be emailed to me so one might determine what this thing was. The witness I talked with said he has the pictures already developed and had them handy when chatting with me. He also mentioned that the pictures did not come out all that well, but you can still see something sitting in the night sky. The witness told me that he and a couple of close friends had just dropped off one of their buddies. As they continued down the road they came to a full stop at the street light. The witness I talked with said while at a complete stop he turned his head to the right and saw a really strange object, he then pointed in the direction the object was sitting to alert his friends what he was looking at. All the fellows at this point were stunned at what they were seeing, so they pulled the vehicle over at an arcade business to watch. Due to this object being so low they wondered if it was attached by a cable, wire, etc.. because it sat stationary in one position. At this point they grabbed the camera, got out of the vehicle and took three snap shots of it. He told me while they stood watching the object it started to pulsate then disappeared, or blinked out. The object was sitting at approx: 250 feet (or close guess) off the ground, it was also very close to the witnesses as they estimated it to be about 6 to 7 blocks away from their position. It was cigar shaped, and solid grey in color. The total viewing time was approx: 3 to 5 minutes after they first spotted it. Also I was told that stood out from everything around them, meaning it wasn&apos;t extremely bright, but you couldn&apos;t miss it sitting in the air.I asked if any sound could be heard coming from it, the witness told me they could hear a very faint humming sound after the object blinked out. The skies were clear. After the fellows lost sight of it they jumped back into the vehicle and drove quickly to where the object had been sitting, thinking they may be able to get another look at it. But it had vanished. He also said there is a plant, (industrial complex) and this is where the object was hovering over top of. According to the witness the object was not seen flying in any direction as I mentioned above, it blinked out after sitting stationary for the few minutes.

SATURDAY NIGHT - A friend and I were swimming at Spanish Trails when a decent (awesome) storm passed thru with heavy rain, thunder and lightning....enough for storm lovers to get out of the pool. :) We waited and watched in the patio for it to pass so when it did move south, we got back in the pool. Within minutes to half an hour, I was sitting with someone and talking on a pool ledge. We both had seen a couple shooting stars earlier, very faint, far and normal, however..... facing north from Tropicana, and VERY close, we saw a bright white ball of streak heading straight down lasting for 2 seconds and then it turned green for another 2 seconds and it went out of view behind the house, but right after it cleared the rooftop, we saw a light of explosion (circular afterglow) just beneath the horizon of the rooftop, obstructing our view of the explosion. It seemed SO very closeby, it had to be within city limits or on the south side of town. It was big because the streak was wide. The thing disappearing from our view (back of the house) but still falling gives you a sense of how close this fireball came to the ground. I asked people the next day (on Sun) if they saw it too but no avail, and I missed the news...... IF YOU HAVE SEEN THIS EVENT PLEASE CONTACT ME. I cant find it anywhere in the news or paper.

I took a second look to make sure that what I was looking at wasn&apos;t a reflection.  I was startled and excited at what I saw.  The object was moving from West to East across the Yakima valley.  The object traveled very quickly and changed its trajectory three separate times.  The shape of the object was a triangle.  It appeared to be solid in shape, it was about the size of a star at night and was white in color, and did not have a vapor trail. I watched it for as long as it stayed visible, which was about ten to fifeteen seconds.  The object went behind cloud cover and that was the last I saw of this object.  This was my first sighting of a UFO and I feel very fortunate to have seen one.  My wife was outside with me during my sighting, but unfortunately was unable to see the object. I think she was looking just a little below the object.

The craft was putting off a tremendous amount of strobing light, changing from red to green to blue and white.  It was magnitude -3 and about 15 degrees off the western horizon.  Viewed through medium power binoculars, I got the sense of a disc or diamond shape.  After cruising slowly to the north for approximately 15 minutes, the object abruptly disappeared.  After the craft disappeared, several helicopters, both police and civilian (or television) flew through the area.

It struck me that it was at an extremely high altitude and perfectly steady.  Then I immediately realized that the perfect diamond shape (like a playing card) was no bird. The object was moving along the short axis of the diamond.  The relative size was approximate to a pencil lead held at arms length.  The clarity of the outline gave me the impression that it was less than a mile altitude and under 80&rsquo; wide.   It seemed black with a reddish area in the center which was hard to determine against a bright blue, clear sky. Being somewhat of an aviation enthusiast I realized it was no aircraft I have ever been aware of.  This was confirmed by the complete silence that would have betrayed an airplane, helicopter or model plane.  The sharp shape and completely straight steady motion ruled out any special balloon or kite, especially on such a calm day. The rate of travel was about that of a private plane but still seemed un-airplane like in relation to the altitude.  Then it suddenly accelerated up to about double it&rsquo;s original speed, much quicker than any fighter jet could change speed.  A half second later, while still clearly visible, it just disappeared or at least accelerated away faster than I could see it go.

It was in the east, southeast part of the sky, at an angle of about 30 degrees. It accelerated north from its position, but always moving slower than a satelite, and faded out at about 5 degrees from its original position. I searched for the object for about 4 seconds when I noticed another object of the same magnitude a few degrees southwest of the first. It moved the same direction and speed as the first, and it also faded in the same manner and area as the first.

Wednesday morning, August 6, 2003.  Time was 08:27:30.  The sky consisted of unbroken gray cloud cover approximately 200 feet thick with its base at approximately 400 feet altitude.  Directly above the highway in my line of site at approximately 10 degrees elevation, a small but very bright orange light came shooting out of the cloud base approximately 1600 feet away from me.  The object&apos;s trajectory out of the cloud base was horizontal at first but immediately curved sharply downward--directly toward the ground below.  The object continued to burn steady until it passed 100 feet altitude at which time it faded out within a full second and visually ceased to exist.  Estimated speed was approximately 50 feet per second.  I was facing SW.  The object travelled at first from my right going to my left (NW to SE) before diving.  Object appeared star-like similar to Planet Venus in image size and intensity with no noticable form.  If the sighting had occurred at night, the brightness could rival a welder&apos;s torch.  Size of object was likely only a couple feet diameter.  Size and distance range was determined by using estimated altitude of cloud ceiling and elevation of object at point of exit from the cloud base.  Object was very close to intersection of Hwy. #301 and Rt. #228 in downtown Waldorf.  There were at least 200 cars between me and that intersection.  There were at least as many cars behind me, as well.  Sighting was brief and unexpected.  No one was seen stopping and getting out of their cars.

I am a college professor and joined four college men on the hike near Slate Peak, the highest place you can drive in Washington state in the North Cascade mountains near the Canadian border. The 6,600 feet elevation trail head is at an old air force listening station manned in the 1940s which is now marked by an unmanned observation tower closed to the public. Our camp was about five miles north east of the trail head on a very isolated ridge with no other campers for miles and miles. The Pasayten Wilderness is one thousand square miles. While a very large forest fire was burning in an eastern region of the wilderness, we were at a safe distance. The fire was at a much lower elevation about 35 miles east and two valleys and mountain ranges away. The first night of our excursion, we were sitting around a small camp fire above the lake looking at a perfectly clear night sky. Then a few minutes after 11 PM we saw a bright light like an airplane in the south east above the mountain ridge skyline about 50 degrees high. It moved like a helicopter, but made no sound. It seemed to be about three or four miles away moving north west, seemingly flying above the Slate Peak observation tower. Suddenly something shot out of the light. We were astonished. &quot;Did you guys see that!&quot;, I said. Yes, all but one student agreed.  He didn&apos;t bring his glasses and couldn&rsquo;t see that clearly, but the other four of us all witnessed it. It looked like a shooting star, except it shot out of the airplane-like-light down towards the south east. We immediately thought that perhaps the projectile was a shooting star that just happened to shoot behind the light at the right moment, giving an illusion that the light was the source. Then one student said, &quot;Yea, but what are the odds that a shooting star would appear at exactly that point?&quot; We agreed that the sight was amazingly poignant. The light then appeared to be moving directly towards us, as if to fly over our lake.  And I said, &quot;It must be a Forest Service helicopter. Put out the fire.&quot; There was a burn ban which I admit we were not obeying. Moments after the fire was put out with a bottle of water, the light turned away from us and moved directly east. It floated lazily, as if taking in the scenery. It did not move like a helicopter doing a job. And there was no sound. The light moved away and faded into the horizon, turning reddish as it  apparently disappeared behind the atmosphere. We witnessed the strange light for about five or six minutes. We tried to think of what it could be. One of the group remarked that it couldn&apos;t be an airplane or jet because there was no discernable shape, no sound and looked like a single, bight ball of light, like a head light pointing at you. His father is a pilot and he seemed sure that it was not a fixed winged aircraft. We had seen Forest Service spotter aircraft looking for lightening fires all day long and could hear the roar of their engines long before we could see them. We all joked that maybe this light was a UFO. The next day, I took out my compass and topo map and plotted what I thought was the line of flight. Then I realized that the light seemed to out line the eastern side of the wild fire about 35 miles away. Maybe it was farther away than we thought. So, I told the men that it must have been Forest Service helicopter shuttling fire fighting crews or dropping water or fire retardant. Then on Monday evening we had another sighting. This time about 9 PM, after sun set but before you could see any stars, one of the men looked up at the same spot to the east and said, &quot;Look, the light is back!&quot; This time we saw the same intense point of light acting like an airplane flying away. We saw it for about one minute. It certainly looked exactly like the night before, except that we didn&apos;t get to watch it for very long to notice any thing strange. There was not sound. Tuesday the weather turned to rain and thunder storm clouds obscured the night sky. We later learned that this storm caused some small fires in a valley to the north west of our lake. In the afternoon on Wednesday, we heard a helicopter approaching. Then a large K-Max helicopter flew over our lake tugging a 300 gallon scoop. It hovered over the lake, scooped up water then made a wide turn along the ridge and flew over our camp into the hills to the north to drop water on a small fire caused by the lightening the day before. In about five minutes it returned. The third time we heard it approaching we ran down to the lake to get a close up view. We were directly under the chopper as it hovered. It was huge and make a sound so loud that my ears are still ringing. We noticed blinking lights on the tail and end of the fuselage. It made five water scooping trips. But, later we reflected on the contrast between the chopper and the light on Sunday and Monday nights. It seemed even more strange. Unlike the chopper, there was no sound. There were no blinking lights. It moved slow and funny. The projectile shooting out of it. That just could not be a helicopter. We hiked out on Thursday to stay at a hotel before driving home to Seattle on Friday. The ski lodge hotel was catering breakfast and lunches for fire fighter crews because their base camp was a half mile away. As I paid our bill, I met a director of the ground crew operations and asked him questions about the type of aircraft fighting the fire. He said that they use Bell helicopters to shuttle the crews and K-Max choppers to scoop and drop water. I didn&rsquo;t reveal why I was asking him all of these questions, but he ended by referring me to a forest service information officer at a head office in the town of Tonasket. Then I asked one more question, &quot;Do the helicopters work at night?&quot;  &quot;Oh, no,&quot; he said.  &quot;They have to be able to see.&quot;", "It was one quite big, red light moving very slowly.Than it`s dissapeared and return in that same place, but in yellow color.After half hour near this circle, flight very fast yellow object, and turned 3 times.

No flying lights were seen, it was a steady white glow, till it disappeared in the black opening. This is the second UFO sighting in this area for me.", "SUMMARY: A resident of West Chester, Ohio reports a dramatic sighting near his residence that was accompanied by a local power failure. Greg M.(name on file)says he was awakened around 2:30 AM by the sound of his UPS system beeping to let him know the power was out in his home.  Greg informed me that an UPS system is an uninterruptible power supply.  Bascially a battery backup to his computer. It can run his entire system with no utility power for about 2 hours.  When its activated it signals an alarm to notify him that the power has been interrrupted to the house so he can safely shut down the computer. When Greg heard the beeping he thought maybe a storm was coming so he got out of bed and went downstairs to unplug the TV and stereo.  That is when he noticed a strong smell emanating from the family room.  It smelled like a high concentration of ozone.His lotic breeze smelled similar when being cleaned but the device was unplugged and had not been used for several days.  Greg grabbed some candles and was getting ready to go back upstairs when he happened to gaze out the back window and spotted an object in the sky. The witness claims that an oval or disk shaped object was visually observed. He stressed that the object was &apos;not quite exactly&apos; oval or disc shaped.  When he first observed the object he believed it held stationary, but after a few minutes it began to wobble.  Greg likened the wobble to a left to right motion but not like a pendulum swinging. Greg estimated the object was around 1/4 to 3/4 miles distance from his location and at an elevation of 600 to 1,000 feet up.  He said the shape could be clearly seen and if it had been closer, could almost be compared to the size of a bus.  The bottom half of the object could be seen; being comprised of luminous blue/violet light.  On each end of the object were two lights of aqua blue color.  These lights were reportly spinning very fast and according to the witness, appeared to strobe or pulsate. Greg stepped outside to get a better look at the object. Once outside the witness say, &quot;The silence was so complete that it felt like I had walked into a sound proof room.  There was not a sound of any kind.  Not insects, cars, nothing.  Not even a breeze could be felt.  It was a very eerie feeling.&quot;  At this time Greg noticed that lights were on across State Route 747 which he can see in the near distance.  The state route runs not too far from his back yard.  However, when checking the front of the house he noticed the lights were off on his street.Going back in, the witness notes that his cats were nowhere in sight.  They are usually with him or near by when he is up.  I asked the witness if he had watched the object depart?  Greg claims that he does not remember how it left.  He states that he remembers standing out back gawking at the object in the stale silence.The witness sounded perplexed as he related how he usually would have stood there as long it took for the object to leave or do something.  He says that he honestly just remembers the parts leading uo to the sighting.  He says he watched it for 15-20 minutes and then went to bed.  He said he did not remember going back to bed. Again, he says he would of stayed or called someone or done something besides dismissing it. He did not understand his actions in regard to this. Upon awakening the next morning the witness says that a candle contained in glass he had left burning had exploded.  He detailed how wax had been projected on the walls after the explosion and theorized that the glass container had been defective.  He said he does not know why he did not awaken from the sound of the exploding candle. Checking his UPS systems backup which records data during the power outage he noticed that the electricity had been off for 5 hours and 11 minutes.  Greg states that this is impossible because he remembers waking up with plenty of time to get to work.  His printout reads as follows: Outage event at 2:23:43s Eastern time, duration of outage 5 hours 11 minutes 03 seconds.  So the power came back on at approx. 7:34 AM.Greg sent me the full printout from his computer system which he translated for easier reading.  This printout is on file. FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS:  In an attempt to obtain more regarding the claim of a UFO sighting on June 2, 2003, near West Chester, Ohio, I placed a telephone call to the Butler County, Ohio Sheriff&apos;s Dept., the receptionist offered one item from her log that may or may not be of relevance.  At approx. 1:05 AM on June 2nd a house security system had been tripped at a location 3 miles from the claimants home.  No explaination was given for the home security system activation.  I also contacted the West Chester City Police Dept.  The receptionist there stated no UFO sightings had been reported for that time period. I also asked if any power outages had been reported.  The receptionist told me that they do not do reports for that.  I would need to contact the power company. CINERGY INQUIRY:  Inquiry was made with CINERGY, the facility providing power to a large portion of Cincinnati and Southern Ohio.  I contacted the Operations Planning Engineer. He is in charge of the data for power outages in the area.  After pulling up the records for the area and the  address given he advised me that no power outages had occurred on June 2, 2003 for the West Chester, Ohio area. I also asked Greg to check with his neighbors to see if they saw anything on the night in question.  He called me back saying that no one he talked to had bee up at that time of night. Assessment of situation:  Greg sounded like an intelligent, coherent individual. In the early stages of the investigation Greg had told me that the power was only out in his house. Later he told me it was out on his street.  I do not know the reason for the change in his story. With the evidnece accumulated in the case and unless evidence surfaces on the contrary, I feel that the witness did indeed experince a UFO sighting.

We could only see the silhouette of the object whenever the lighting lit up the sky. it remained in the same spot for about 3 minutes when another object appeared next to it (only seen once)... the lighting died down and headed in another direction. we lost the sighting at that time...((NUFORC Note:  Please see other sightings on the same evening from Wisconsin, and from Grosseto, Italy.

The sighting lasted approx: for 8 or 9 seconds. No sound was heard and no unusual maneuvers were noted. The witness said, I thought not much of it until it came to a complete stop before disappearing. He then told me that was pretty weird. Thank you to the witness for the report.

She went on to say she had a very strange experience and saw something she could not explain. They have a large deck which faces south. Due to her having some trouble sleeping the lady awoke and around 2:00 a.m. and wondered around her deck looking up at the starry night sky. As she faced the south and looked up over a valley just west of town she spotted something very large. From her advantage point it looked about cup size. The witness said the object looked like a disc, or wheel shaped standing on it&apos;s edge. She also added it looked as if the object was cut into six section. Just like as if you were to cut 6 or 8 pieces of pie (6 or 8 triangular shaped pieces). There were lights running around the object, all white in color. The lady also said there were a good number of lights on it, but was not sure just how many there were. She also believes the lights were moving around the object. There was no sound heard coming from the unknown and her thoughts were whatever it was, was not all that far away from their property. The object sat stationary, it did not move. Using some of the structures on their deck to keep track of the object,  she eventually said it started moving but very slowly, but faster than any of the nighttime stars, etc.. After a period of time, the object disappeared. Thank you to the witness for the report.

I was outside talking to my brother as I noticed three &gt; triangular stars moving across the sky, I had to look &gt; again to make sure, I said &quot;look a triangle ufo!&quot; my &gt; brother and I both agreed to see if it was one solid &gt; craft or three independent ufo&apos;s, we did this by &gt; waiting for the triangle to pass over some stars, but &gt; when it did we seen the stars through the triangle and &gt; knew it was not one craft but three seperate objects.&gt;  also, even though the three objects kept the triangle &gt; formation as it flew from a south west direction to a &gt; north east direction the triangle formation did not &gt; keep true form but shifted out of place somewhat, so &gt; now we knew the objects did not all travel at constant &gt; speeds but varying speeds due to minor formation &gt; breakup.&gt;    after 2-3 minutes I went to my moms bedroom window &gt; and pounded on it for her to wake up! she came outside &gt; and also witnessed these objects.&gt;    I seen tumbling satelites that flash randomly as &gt; they reflect sunlight, I also witnessed low earth &gt; orbit repositioning satelites, and satelites that &gt; flare out due to sunlight reflection, and military &gt; flares,landing lights on planes,meteors,falling &gt; stars,northern lights,space station and shuttle flying &gt; at same time, ect...&gt;    I guess the best way to describe this is three &gt; satelites flying (20,000 mph) in space in triangle &gt; formation with one or two changing speed, but after &gt; approx. 3-5 minutes of viewing phenomonem, triangle &gt; formation remained intact, and none of the objects &gt; passed the other, unlike satelites which keep constant &gt; speed unless they reposition their course.((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnesses might have been looking at the formation of three satellites which are often reported to us, and which are thought to be U. S. Navy satellites, and part of the &quot;NOSS&quot; ocean-surveillance program.

I guess that makes it Monday morning. I live in California due east of the small town of Cotate in Sonoma county.  It is betewwn Santa Rosa on the north &amp; Petaluma on the south, off Highway 101.  We live up on the side of Sonoma Mt. at 1,700 ft., 3 miles NNW of the mt. top.  It&apos;s about 23 mi. from the ocean. I stepped out on the deck at 01:45 and was looking at the sky--some clouds &amp; having had about 200 drops of rain!!  I could see stars between the clouds.  Looking west at (on clear days we can see the ocean--not lately tho&apos;) I saw a flashing light &amp; watched it to see if it was an approaching airplane.  It seemed to not move, then seemed to come closer &amp; too bright &amp; big for even a large plane.  I am 5&apos; 2&quot; tall &amp; holding my fist at arms length it was about 20 deg. above my level, and about 30 deg. south of west.  At its closest at arm&apos;s length it was about 3/16&quot; diam. (at least).  I could see no form except the horizontal flashing including a green on the south side.  It flashed about every second then in an instant (less of course) it moved right a fist (extended) length &amp; then appeared below about 1/2 a fist.  Then back to the original position.  It did this a few times with out my seeing it move.  Just appeared.  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness illustrates how the thin, disc-shaped object appeared to &quot;jump&quot; in a triangular, clockwise pattern.  PD))  Then another appeared, maybe a fist to the left. They alternated rapid flashing, then synchronized maybe 3 x&apos;s, then alternated again &amp; the 2nd one was gone without visible movement.  (Both look alike.)  The first began to move north slowly with a few more erratic appearances &amp; then went slowly, flashing, to the north &amp; west getting smaller until I couldn&apos;t see it for the trees?  Time of viewing...??  That&apos;s a hard on...a guess is a few minutes. I have seen other flashing lights farther away &amp; a bit brighter than stars that were probably UFO&apos;s...not a plane  One was erratic in movement but I sort of doubted my eyes afterwards.  This time I had the edge of the umbrella as a steady point.  Great stuff!  Thanks for all your good work. ((name and contact data deleted))  P. S.  I am 77 years old &amp; of sound mind.  And hope to continue to be!  Which you may now doubt since I put the stamp on the envelope to open it upside down.&quot;", "Close encounter,My friends and I were sitting out in the back yard on our sport court when a light from above came down onto us.  Thinking it was a flashlight from the house, I called out for my mother but to my surprise the beam of light was coming from farther away and was now moving directly onto our circle where we were sitting.  I screamed out LOOK! and all my friends but one or two said they saw what I did.  I saw a circular object flying about 300-500 yards up in the air through the trees.  The middle point where the light was coming from looked like a huge strobe light and then there were two opposite rotating rings of cilindrical shaped lights that would change colors individually like a fibre-optic light.  On the outside of the craft I witnessed viewing windows not much unlike those from an commercial aircraft, except a lot bigger. After I pointed upwards the craft mysteriously disappeared vanishing withou leaving a tracer of light or any sound.  Which leads me to believe that the craft shot straight up into space.  I know it sounds like we were all under the influence but no, It was before I or my friends even did that stuff.  In the papers the next morning it read that there was a ufo sighted over bellevue last night and that 50 people other than ourselves reported it.  The Government or Officials said it was Strobe ligths reflecting off swamp gas, what ever! Believe what you want, My friends and I know the truth is out there. This all happened at the address listed ((address deleted))  Ave NE ballevue Wa 98005", "White or Luminous Disk seenI was coming back from class as I remember that this was the first day of class and it was a hot and clear day with big billowy cumulus clouds and dark blue sky.I rarely take notice of most things in the sky because usually it is just an airplane or helicopter as there is always so much air traffic in the sky.  On this particular day, I was travelling eastbound on Walnut St. in moderate traffic when I just so happened to see a glint in the sky that caught my attention.  What I saw, at first, looked like a plane but it seemed to be luminous or was a white color.  I would have dismissed it as a plane had it not rolled a couple of times and sped up as I watched it disappear into a big cloud.  When it rolled, I could tell there were not any wings or identification on it and it was about the size of an almond held at an arms length.  The time that it traversed over the sky, after it sped up, before it went into the cloud was approximately 10-15 seconds, before it sped up, I had noticed it for approximately 5-10 seconds.After going into the cloud, I had enough time to park but it never came back out of the cloud.  I wrote down this experience and called my brother and told him right after it had happened but I hesistated to tell anyone else.  The reason I am reporting this is that I feel that this report may be related to the Longview incident logged in on the same day of question.", "Missing Time In Kelowna, British Columbia. The story is real but the names in this report are fictitious for obvious reasons. Pat - Driver of the car.Linda - Passenger and friend. Date:  July 31, 2003 (Thursday) Time:  Between 1:00 a.m. &amp; 2:00 a.m. Today, Monday - August 18, 2003 I received a telephone call from Pat who lives in Kelowna, British Columbia. The lady was very upset and had a time speaking of the event that took place with her and a close female friend of hers. She told me today that a friend had brought over a newspaper article which was run in the Kelowna Capital Newspaper. The headline read &quot;Seeking Witnesses to UFO.&quot; which showed up on August 15, 2003. Here is her story. She tells that her and her friend are having a very hard time dealing with what took place. Also another couple who live in the area watched an aerial craft hovering close to the location where the two ladies had parked there car at the side of the highway and gave confirmation to the incident, or at least witnessed an object. At approx: 12:05 a.m., July 31, 2003 the two ladies were playing around on the computer when Linda said, we haven&apos;t done any star gazing in a long time....so Pat the lady who contacted me said, you&apos;re right, lets go out and do some star gazing. They left home at 12:05 a.m. heading out to an area where they would get a look at the clear night sky without having lights to obscure their view. Pat drove to Glenmore which is north from where she lives and is on the back road heading to Winfield from Kelowna, B.C. They were driving along and Pat reported that there was quite a bit of traffic for that time of the night but after they decided to stop just off to the side of the road to see what they might notice, the traffic stopped coming. There was not a light from any vehicles, not anything other than a very dark stretch of road. Pat grabbed her flashlight and shone it into the sky as she has done this in the past. Her friend Linda has the binoculars on the other side of the car scanning the starry night sky. They were there only a minute out of the car when her Linda said, this is really strange. There are three stars up in the sky and formed into a triangle shape. All three lights at this time were solid white. Both ladies watched as the three white lights started moving, but moving together. The witness with the binoculars said stars don&apos;t do that, and Pat replies, of course not..... as she thought it may have been a plane or something. Linda replies, no this is not a plane as the lights were changing color to a neon green and the object had stopped and hovered just ahead of their car. Pat turned the headlights off, and shone her flashlight down the road in front of her car. They were worrying about animals such as a bear, cougars, etc.. being around in this isolated area. As she shone the light up the road both of the women spotted something which frightened them a lot. Five sets of eyes staring at approx: 40 feet away from them. As frightened as they were, their first thoughts were of coyotes or some other wild animal, but she said once you really look your brain takes it in. Pat describes the creatures as being roughly four feet tall, dark gray shoulders and coming towards the women. Pat said &quot;I was so scared I could hardly talk and could hardly breathe&quot;. She yelled to her friend Linda, &quot;get in the car, get in the car&quot;. Pat said they both scrambled to get back into the vehicle but she said it was like moving through quicksand and it felt horrible. Being so terrified and trying to move as fast as they possibly could, it felt as if everything was slowing down around them. Once they were both back in the car, Pat tried to turn the ignition on so she could get the power windows up. But all the electrics on the car was failing. The dome light, headlights were going off and on, on their own and as she said. &quot;Everything was going nuts&quot; !  Finally the car started and they turned around in the middle of the road and sped off towards home and as they traveled along they noticed a fair bit of traffic coming in their direction. (Pat commented to me, where was all the traffic when all this was happening?) As they drove along the road, Pat said to Linda, &quot;this is the weirdest thing. &quot;She said I feel like electricity, my whole body is tingling just like I was zapped by a charge from a battery&quot;. When Linda heard this, she said, &quot;I didn&apos;t want to say anything to you as you might think I was nuts, but I am feeling the same. As if I was hit by an electrical charge.&quot; As Linda was explaining how she felt, and facing Pat she glanced at the clock in car and said, &quot;Jesus Pat, look at the time&quot; ! Pat said what are you talking about ? Linda said we were only stopped and out of the car for a few minutes at the most, and the time of the car&apos;s clock reads an extra 25 minutes of time. As they drove along and close to home they both discussed it and wondered if they had imagined it all.As they were just about home, they turned onto Baker Street which is covered in darkness next to a field. All of a sudden they saw this bright, glowing neon green ball low in the sky. The object started moving to the right, &quot;stop&quot;, left, &quot;stop&quot;, right, &quot;stop&quot;, left, &quot;stop&quot; and then it started to move away until the ladies car came to a halt, and so did the object. Before they knew it, the ball of green light started heading towards them at a high rate of speed and hovered  high above their car. At this point they just wanted to get to their home and be as far away from whatever it was as possible. The driver sped off quickly again and they headed into an orchard which was very close by. They thought they would not be seen hiding amongst the trees, plus there was no lighting in this area to reveal their position. Pat looked at her friend and said, &quot;they will never find us here&quot;. Both women are sitting in the car trying to get themselves together as the driver said she was losing it at this point. Only after a very short time after arriving in the orchard Linda said, Pat you better look out the front windscreen and look up slightly. We don&apos;t have just one green ball of light, there are now three, glowing green objects. The way the green lights were in the sky, it looked as if the they formed a triangle formation and all moving now together. After a short period of time each of the green lights moved away in different directions. (HBCC UFO asked if the witness could give some idea of how large the green lights were. The witness told me each of the lights were approx: half the size of a full moon). After seeing the lights flying off into different directions the ladies raced home as quickly as they possibly could. Once safe at home, both ladies shaken, they tried to come up with some reasonable explanation for what just happened. They tried to put it out of their minds but that was impossible !!!!  Later on both ladies turned in for the night and when they woke up in the morning, Pat discovered a large bruise on her left breast and another on the bottom of her foot.  She did not know how they got there but she did know they were extremly painful..... As she sat drinking a cup of coffee Linda finally got up and was walking down the hall towards the kitchen when she said, &quot;god, good morning - do I feel rough this morning&quot;. After Linda finished saying that ....Pat watched as blood came pouring from Linda&apos;s nose. Pat jumped up, ran and grabbed a towel. Linda also commented that she was having a lot of pain in her lower back area. She asked Pat to have a look to see if there was anything that could be seen. So she looked and gasped, there was a large circle burned into her skin and was located in the middle, lower back area (tail bone). Also bruises were found on Linda&apos;s body as well, some of them appeared to look like finger marks and there were three of them on each thigh. Both women at this point were shocked, upset and very frightened. Linda, who was up visiting from the Abbotsford ended her holiday and headed back home. Two days after being home in Abbotsford, B.C. she went to consult her family doctor due to still experiencing the terrible pain which was originating from her lower back, plus it was not getting any better. Her doctor examined her, and her injury to her back, the doctor said if I didn&apos;t know any better I would say you have a radiation burn. He was of course referring to the burn mark on Linda&apos;s back. The doctor is still trying to heal this mark on her back, as something had burned right through the outer layer of this ladies skin. (HBCC UFO Note:I will be keeping in contact with the witness to this event and hope I may be able to help in some small way). Update to this Story:  On the night this frightening experience took place, another couple who couldn&apos;t sleep decided to go out for a walk on the warm evening. They looked up at times into the night sky, and all of a sudden they noticed a bright glowing neon colored light. The couple also added that the light was moving in the strangest way, by coming to a complete stop, moving again, stopping and then moved off very quickly. The light was seen in the same vicinity where the ladies had been stopped at the side of the road. This sounds like it gives confirmation to what the ladies saw that night. HBCC UFO Research Foot note: I would recommend to anyone finding such marks as described here in this report, that they consult a professional, such as their family doctor. One has to remember that they do not have to walk in to the doctor&apos;s office and make claims of missing time, or possible abduction. Let you doctor come up with the answers. Also there are some very good people who carry out work in the abduction field, and I will be very happy to put you in contact with such folks if you would like. Just write to me and request that I do so, and give me permission to pass your personal information along. I would also like to add, this Missing Time event took place around the same date 147 witnessed watched one amazing event unfold in southeastern British Columbia. I also received a flood of sighting reports which also came from this area. July 27/28 to August 18, 2003. If anyone has any questions, please feel free to write me an email.

The object was only 20-30 feet above ground, and was no larger than 6-12 inches in diameter.  The speed of the object was somewhere around 30-50mph.  It came from behind, startling my friend and I, then quickly disappeared.  It&apos;s flight path was an upward arc, kind of a swooping motion, arcing upward after passing us.  This object made no sound at all. There were no electrical storms, no powerlines nearby and no one else directly around us. My friend and I were college students at the time.  I am a former Marine and have had aircraft observation/identification training. I didn&apos;t think much of this incident until I saw video taped evidence of &quot;balls of light&quot; nearby or directly above crop circle incidents.  When I saw those video images, it brought back to memory what I had seen.  I&apos;m not sure if the object was a spacecraft or some natural anomaly, but it was definitely real.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We will invite the other witness to submit a report, as well, if that is possible.  PD))", "Some friends and I have been watching the skies from Herr Road (near Sullivan, WI) for a few years now.  This long, narrow road has a unobstructed view of the night sky, almost like being atop a huge tower.  After many disappointing vists to this area, myself and three of my close friends saw something absolutly mind boggling.  It was approx. 12:30 AM when we first noticed a strange orange and red light sitting still above the tree line in the southeastern sky.  It was much larger and brighter than any of the planes or stars that we saw.  It did not move from that location, so we really didn&apos;t think much of it.  Approx. five minutes later, the exact same light we saw above the tree line, had moved to the eastern skyline.  We didn&apos;t take our eyes off of it from that point on.  The light began moving from the northeastern skyline to the southeast and then back again for approx. 10-15 minutes.  It seemed to have no pattern whatsoever to it&apos;s direction of flight.  We could tell that it was getting closer to us, and then very far at a tremendous rate of speed.  The most amazing thing happened after it had dimmed away for minute or so; We suddenly witnessed it very close again, mostly orange in color, but sometimes red, blue and white.  It was close enough that we certainly would have been able to hear if it was jet or prop powered, but there was dead silence.  It got even closer, staying just above the tree line.  It was moving from south to north when we ran down the road to catch a glimpse of it between two large trees.  We saw a classic &quot;movie made&quot; disk hovering at a 45 degree angle.  We could see 4 or 5 bright white round lights either on the top or bottom perimeter of the disk spinning on axis at a reletivly slow speed.We witnessed this actual disk for only 10 or 15 seconds.  The object changed from a spinning disk, to a white ball of light and took off at an amazing rate of speed (again, no sound) making almost a horseshoe loop in the sky, and then it was gone.  I&apos;ve been back there many times since we saw the unexplainable, and have never seen anything like it.((NUFORC Note:  The planet, Mars, would have been in the southeastern, or southern, sky on this date, and at the time indicated.  However, it would not have moved across the sky ask quickly as the witness describes.  We do not know what they observed.

This was in the vacinity of Westheimer and Chimney Rock in Houston.  This was completely unexplainable to me and therefore, unidentifyable, and flying, and an object. The color of green can best be described at this time by viewing an ebay item #2649237375 The size of the ball and the distance from the earth is hard to determine.This is my perception of what I saw.((NUFORC Note:  One of several reports of apparently the same event seen over Texas.  It is interesting that the event has not been reported from surrounding states, given that a bright meteor can be seen for hundreds of miles around.  PD))", "Two eggshaped objects hovered in the sky then speed away.I read the accounts of the gentlemen from Kansas and Florida and their stories were so similar to what I had seen I felt I should tell my story.At the time I lived in Albion, Indiana and was driving over to my girlfriend&apos;s home who lived outside of LaGrange to make christmas candy. I worked with her in a factory in LaGrange for several years. It was just before Thanksgiving. I had to drive through Rome City on St. Rd 9 going north. Just before you enter the town you are on a hill and it declines as you drive into it. There is a perfect view of the horizon. I have no idea what caused me to even notice what I saw but all I know is I have never mentioned it before only to a few close relatives.I saw a metalic, silverish eggshaped object in the western astmosphere, it hovered there and didn&apos;t move. Since I was driving I tried very hard to figured out what I was seeing and to watch the road. It was a great distance from the ground and I couldn&apos;t even begin to say how far. Since I had a perfect view from east to west I saw another object that was identical in the east. Suddenly the object in the east moved at a very high rate of speed and joined the object in the west. There was no trail of vapor that comes from planes,no sound, nothing. It shot across like a laser beam to the other. But it left no trail of any kind and I know from the speed it was not a plane. Both objects then hovered together in the west and them they just took off westward and were gone! All this happened quickly and it shook me up so much that I almost stopped at the police sttion in Rome City to report what I saw and to this day I regret not doing so. I saw something that I can&apos;t explain. I have never seen anything move so quickly or looked liked these objects.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

And, as I lay in bed, I became aware of what at first appeared to be a very bright star, shining through my venetian blinds, which were not fully closed due to fact they are old and won&apos;t close all the way!  As I watched the light it seemed to be dancing about and moving in an erratic pattern.  It was at an indeterminate distance because of the oblique angle of the window to the object and the height of the object appeared to change rapidly as it bobbed and weaved in a random pattern.  I would guess the object, whatever it was, was hovering out over West of 315 a 2 lane highway West of my location.  I was groggy and wanted to sleep, although it kind of fascinated me and frightened me at the same time.  It seemed to move down behind the tree line on the property further West of my building, and I can&apos;t remember falling asleep, but woke up again about 3 hours later and no light, star, or any other object was detectable in that part of the sky.  In fact, a fog had rolled in and daylight was very murky and didn&apos;t allow good visibility that morning, and it rained hard later on that day as I remember with thunder and lightning in abundance.  I also remember thinking about the sighting that next day and night and had some difficulty going to sleep for several nights since!  Thank you!((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It had a row of lights in the front that were red and yellowish in color. The lights were twinkling rather fast and behind that was a glob of lights (same color as front row of lights). Whatever this object was it made no sound and moved steadily through the sky.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the wife of this witness, and it is our belief that the couple may have witnessed something quite unusual.  We would welcome reports from anyone else who might have witnessed the object.

Something caught my eye directly above me, when I saw what looked like a green laser flying through the air. It was going relatively fast in an Eastern direction. I followed it with my eyes when it just disappeared like vapor. It didn&apos;t seem to be too far in the sky and it made absolutely no noise at all.

It was a regular airliner jet, blue in color with silver or gray wings, fairly low in the sky, about 15,000 feet? Flying an east to west flight path. Moments later, another passenger jetliner, red with white wings, intersected the path of the first jet but at a lower altitude of 9,000 feet, at a South to North Path. I was fascinated they did not hit each other, it could be considered a near miss. Suddenly after the two jets safely started making their way from what appeared to be  over lapping each other,  I saw a glowing white outline of a sharp peaked triangle fly inbetween these two jetliners with a slightly Northwest to Southeast flight path Going the same speed as the 2 jets. The bottom portion of the triangle did not appear to be there, there wasnt an outline like the two sides, which formed directly into the steep nose to the craft as if it did not need wings,  and the middle of the triangle appeared to just be plain blue sky. The glow of the outline did not appear to be a form of light, just a hazey opaque white that gave the illusion it was glowing. Kind of what a piece of frosted glass looks like,  If I were to estimate, it would be a 30-40 degree angle in the triangles shape makeup. It was not cloudy in the portion of the sky, directly above my head where all the sightings took place. Altough there were High, white puffy storm clouds on the eastern horizon. Not at all distorting any view of the events.I instinctively ran in the house to grab a camera after an adrenaline rush from fascination, and came out to be disappointed with awe, as I could not find the flying white triangle any more. The 2 pilots of the jetliners HAD to have seen this craft, Visually, AND on radar. So I am counting them as witnesses.((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the white, triangular object might have been a delta-winged, turboprop pusher, e.g. a LearStar, or a similar aircraft with swept wings.  Just a guess.  It is very difficult for an observer on the ground to determine an accurate range to a object of even known size.

PD))", "Very Distinctive and large glistening orange oval shaped craft hovering above us in our home city skiesDriving home we noticed two lights in front of us as we were crossing the Boolaroo bridge. I was trying to think of what these lights were, my friend was really having a good look too - I asked him what he was looking at, he replied, lights - I don&apos;t know. We pulled over the side of the road and pulled the sun roof back; by this time we noticed that these objects were not lights but some type of craft that were now alongside each other slowly hovering above us, they looked quite large and a glistening orange colour, we stopped the car engine to see if we could here something. These craft made no sound at all, they weren&apos;t far from us and were obviously having no concern of being seen as they were quite easily located and noticeable. My 15 yr old daughter and her friend were very excited about it, my friend and I were simply trying to identify what type of craft these could be, though unable to come up with anything. After a good 10 minutes of the craft hovering above our area and slowly moving North, one of the craft made a 90 deg turn to the left and proceeded to fly West / inland. We watched in amazement as they got further away; I then remembered to quickly grab my camera from the car and take a couple of photos, though they were quite a distance away by then. My camera is only a cheap digital camera though one of the photos has succeeded; though I am unsure if the craft took off quickly - or I moved when taking the photo as the light looks like a serated line on a black night sky - it doesn&apos;t look a very convincing photo to me, though - not being of any interest of UFO&apos;s or there reports in the past, I certainly have changed my attitude on what is seen in our skys; these were inexplicable craft. As we all hopped in the car to go, the street light which we were parked under suddenly went out for about 1 minute before coming back on again; wether this had any significance to the craft, we dont know. I phoned the Williamstown RAAF Base (about 20 mins drive) the next morning to ask if th! ere were any domestic or military craft in this area at that time, there response was no, and they gave me a phone number for reporting sightings to. We are yet to discuss with these authorities on the matter.It truly was a very clear and distinct viewing of these craft, we only wish the city / town folk were out and about like us to be able to see this phenomena as it was most amazing. We were unable to come up with any suggestions or eliminations to disprove our UFO thoughts. We all feel extremely fortunate to have experienced such a thing and only hope to some day experience it again.((NUFORC Note:  We attempted to correspond with this witness, in order to request permission to look at the photograph allegedly captured of the objects, but his e-address was invalid.

On Sunday the 28th, at 11am a pair of &quot;trainer&quot; jets had just finished their demonstration and flew off to the West up-river and over Richland, WA.  I followed them with my binoculars (Pentax 8x42s) thinking that they may turn and make another &quot;run&quot; for the spectators.  They didn&apos;t.  Instead they turned &quot;south&quot; as if heading toward Oregon.  They were in level flight and apparently taking a direct route to wherever their destination was.  As I followed them in my binocs, a black shape passed through my field of view from south to north.  For a moment I thought it was a large bird, so I stopped tracking the jets and turned back to the object.  It couldn&apos;t have taken more than one or two seconds, at most, to find the object.  However, it had turned from black to a silver color, no black was visible.  The object maneuvered in a manner I have described as a &quot;hawk&quot; scanning a field looking for prey.  The hawk will glide and turn, tipping its wings such that the observer can see the back (topside) of the hawk for a moment, then turn the other way and expose the underside of the bird.  This was very similiar to the movements of this flying machine.  As I steadied my binocs as much as possible, I could make out more and more detail.  The object was a very distinct disk.  There were no &quot;bat-wing&quot;, &quot;delta-wing&quot; contours.  In fact it appeared to be a &quot;classic&quot; flying saucer shape.  That notwithstanding, I continued to observe.  When the bottom side was turned towards me, I could see that the disk was perfectly round and perfectly black with a very thin ring of silver or white around the edge of the disk.  The blackness of the bottom obscured whatever details might have been present (other than the &quot;ring&quot;).  When the disk turned on edge I could see the craft had some thickness.  And as it continued to rotate to the topside I could see a distinct transition from the edge to a raised ! middle section and a &quot;cockpit&quot; in the center of the disk.  The cockpit appeared to be of a &quot;teardrop&quot; shape - not symmetrically round as the rest of the craft appeared to be.  The &quot;pointed&quot; portion of the cockpit appeared to be the &quot;front&quot;, but that was more of an impression than anything else.  As the craft continued to maneuver, with the view transitioning from black to silver and back again, it generally drifted in an easterly direction.  When I first spotted the craft, I estimated it at about 240 degrees azimuth and maybe 25-30 degrees elevation.  By the time I lost sight of it, it was probably at about 210-220 degrees and maybe 30-35 degrees elevation. When I first spotted the craft, I immediately thought that it was part of the airshow and was &quot;waiting&quot; off in the distance for its turn for a demonstration.  The pilot of the craft looked as though he was having &quot;fun&quot;.  Lazily sliding and gliding up and down an imaginary slope of some kind just enjoying the ride.  But as time wore on, I began to think it might have been some kind of super-secret military prototype that the pilot was putting through its paces - sort of just practicing.  Further, since I had no frame of reference from which to judge the crafts dimension, I could not absolutely determine its distance from my observation point.  The two other witnesses sitting near me looked at the craft both with the naked eye and with my binocs.  It was difficult to see the craft with the naked eye because of what appeared to be its great distance.  One witness after looking through the binocs and then observing directly commented - &quot;...man, that thing is really up there...&quot;.  Oserving with the naked eye was difficult.  The observer had to know &quot;where-to-look&quot;, but when we looked at the right spot, the black disk was easily discernable and the silver side would flash brightly when the sun hit it at the right angle.  It was an altogether amazing experience, and an amazing object. Finally, after observing for so long, I began to feel fatigued, and put my binocs down to see if I could arrange a more comfortable and steady rest from which to observe.  I may have spent 5 minutes re-arranging things and when I returned to observe, the object was gone.  As I thought about what I had seen I tried to imagine the possibilities.  First, it could have been a UFO, I guess - whatever that actually means.  Secondly, I think the most likely explanation is a secret military plane of some kind.  And finally, I have to admit that it could have been some kind of a &quot;model&quot; or ballon - perhaps a hovercraft of some kind that could maneuver as it did.  The only thing that makes me hesitate to believe this possibility is that it appeared to be incredibly high for a model and it stayed in position for a very long time.  Also from my position and given the size of the Columbia river, the model would have to have been at least three miles away.  That seems very far to have been able to see what might be a 2-3 foot diameter model disk.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be an exceptional witness.  He was very objective about the sighting he reports above, and he has considerable training and experience as an engineer.  He was totally flabbergasted by the sighting, he reported to us.

I was observing the star Vega in the constellation of Lyra with a Meade refracting telescope and binoculars with a friend. When she commented that she had seen an faint blue flashing object in the binoculars just to the east of Vega. Passing the binoculars to me I panned slightly to the east of Vega and sure enough picked up a faint irregular flashing object on a northeastern heading. I was able to track the object for approximately 4 minutes. In that time it traversed possibly 15 degrees of the visible sky. At that point I lost the object from the field of view of the binoculars and wasn&apos;t able to pick it up again.

It was not an airplane as it did not have any of the usual strobe lights and did not make any sound. It flew in a straight line and could not have been a light shining on the clouds as it was completely cloudless at the time and there was no beam of light going up to it. The object was of a crescent shape and flew with the concave side forward. it emitted a white light which was steady and unchanging, somewhat clear throughout but a bit fuzzy at the edges.

Now, I&apos;m not really sure if it was triangular because we have a dormer window with a triangular section above the rectangular window.

Night before, I was sitting with friends on the west shore of the inlet and we saw 12 satellites in about 90 minutes. Have seen many over the years, but the object I saw at 10:41 PM was much brighter than any satellite I have ever seen. It was brighter than any of the stars visible to me (perhaps 3X). It was traveling in a straight NE direction. There were a few high clouds, and the object (light) was higher than the clouds, but either it was the intensity of the light or it just wasn&apos;t as high as what I would expect a satellite to be which really makes me wonder what it was. I first saw the object about half way across the sky. It was ahead of me about, and 65 degrees above the NW horizon. What made this different than an ordinary satellite was its brightness and the speed of its traverse (faster 2X), but also that I was able to view as it went well towards the NE horizon (15 degrees) with little change in the intensity of the light. There might have been a slight tail to the object when I first spotted it, but it was passing behind the high clouds, but was still visible, hence that might have given me the impression it had a short tail. The event lasted long enough for me to look at my cell phone to check the time and ponder who I could call to see if they could see it. I would say close to 2 minutes((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS))Dear. Mr. Davenport,RE: Shelton siting.Thank you for your reply. After reviewing the ISS tracking plots I am left doubting that what I saw was the ISS. The reason for this is that the track of the object was towards the NE and not the SE as would be indicated by the web site you sent the link for. The other issue was the fact the object remained lighted (reflecting?) well towards the horizon to the NE. The ISS website indicates that the ISS would not be lighted as it passed that far to the NE at the time of night (infact it indicates that the ISS would not be lit as it passed over the coast line of N. America. Perhaps you might get another inquiry about this. Just wanted to let you know.Regards,((END))((NUFORC Note:  We are still exploring the possibility that the sighting might have been caused by the ISS.

It covered approximately a 90 degree arc in eight seconds or less.  I tried to point it out to others standing with me, but nobody else picked it out.

We kept going toward Horse shoe lake and just as we got about the middle of Horse shoe lake suddenly there was a big hot red ball of fire coming down on the other side of the lake, as it neared the Earth it broke into three pieces and went down on the other side of the lake.My girl friend realy freeked out but I allready knew about alien space craft from my experience in the army.I was catching a military hop from Ft. Polk, La when a Airforce Pilot sat down beside me, He threw me a half inch thick book and ask me if I wanted some good reading. I looked at the book and inside a red square were these words TOP SECRET OFFICIAL US AIRFORCE FILES ON UFO&quot;S. I told him that I couldn&apos;t read it because it was marked top secret, He said go ahead their giving them to all the new pilots to prepare them for what they might see.So I began reading it and it realy blew my little country boy mind there were hundreds of pictures of UFO&apos;s of every discription. And with the pictures were complete follow up reports. One picture was of a old house the jets took one picture at 10,000 feet and another at 20,000 feet, it had a chimney and a front porch and every thing.The followup report said it just kept going right out of radar range.another was a huge disc shaped craft hovering over a high power line and like streaks of lightning going up from the power lines to the craft, the follow up report said the metering station reported missing 80,000 watts of electricy.There were cigar shaped ones triangle shaped ones many disc shaped ones, all kinds.There were interveiws with people who had seen aliens and of those that had been abducted and discriptions of alliens and pictures people had drawn of aliens.I promise you that as hard as it is to believe every word is true, I know the Government knows about alien space craft they just don&apos;t want the people to know so they cover it up.Thanks: ((name deleted))((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

High cirus clouds came across the eastern sky, which part of, and I know this sounds totally crazy and may be just my imagination, formed a face, which was a cross betwwen the feline face found on Mars and the face as seen on the shroud of Turin. The clouds slowly disapated and I closed my eyes for a minute and relaxed. Then I opened my eyes and looked to the north and saw a red glowing object halfway between the horizon and top of the night sky. I had my glasses on. There was no twinkle, just a changing light pattern which was due to the rotation of the object. I stared at it for a minute and then ran into the house to check the time. I came back into the yard and it was still there. It didn&apos;t move, then it moved a little bit to the left, then went dim. The whole shiting must have lasted 4 minutes.", "Extremely bright object- location central Transylvania  Seen in the very moments of evening no stars present, still sunset.

It appeared to be at about 1,000 feet or so and then moved farther up into the sky. Keep in mind that this was in the morning and almost no clouds. The light moved farther up in the sky and then I saw two such lights. They seemed to be very high. I called my wife to come out of the house to see the lights. Once she came out, we saw another light in a different part of the sky and it appeared to be very high, although it was impossible to tell. The reason is that we could not make out any shape, it was just a light in the blue sky. That light began to move across the sky at a fast rate of speed and moved behind the house roof. Very strange! I have never seem anything like it until I saw the pictures of such exact lights on the rense.com website. Here is the link. They looked exactly like these pictures-I would like to know if anyone else saw these lights. http://www.rense.com/general40/phoenix.htm", "Diamond shaped object in night sky S-S of Victoria BC at around 11 o&apos;clock positionLight that is visible in a fixed location in the night sky S-SW of Victoria BC approximately in the 11 o&apos;clock position in the sky.

I noticed it from my backyard and was visible through the trees, this is why it caught my eye. I&apos;m no astronomer so it could be venus or another celestial body, even a satellite but I have never noticed it before and it appears synthetic to my untrained eye. As of 1:57am it is still visible and appears to have moved somewhat. Not moving very much though.((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have witnessed the planet, Mars, which is quite prominent, currently.

The fog was so heavy as I traveled the gravel road from town to our country home that I had to open the window and drive using the ditch to my left as my guide.  I drove this road for five miles beside the river; then I made a 90-degree turn to the left, away from the river, but still with heavy fog.  A minute or so later I turned right into our lane and drove to the end of it, making nearly a 90-degree turn to the left, away from the corn field that was on my right. As I had driven the long stretch of the lane, on my left were railroad tracks, a narrow corn field, and then a ridge. The distance to the ridge was maybe a football field&apos;s length. I parked the car, got out, and started toward the house.  Something caught my attention.  I looked toward the lane I had just traveled and saw a luminous object hovering above the field.  It was maybe 50 yards from me.  Because nothing was near it, I have only a guess as to how big it really was and how high it was from the ground.  I think it was as big as a football field and 30 to 40 feet above the ground.  I heard no sound.  There was not even a breeze.  But the fog had cleared. What amazed me the most was that there was no sign of motion.  It appeared to be glowing metal.  It&apos;s shape was of a shallow, large soup bowl inverted over another large soup bowl the same size and shape, joined by a strip of the same substance such that it was perpendicular to the rims of the two bowls.  This joining strip had what appeared to be rectangular windows in it.  I don&apos;t remember whether they were horizontal or vertical.  I do remember that their shape was distinct--no blurring.  I wondered whether these really were windows and someone was looking at me as I looked at the UFO or whether these were energy sites.  They did have a different &quot;glow&quot; from the UFO, as though a light were behind them.  Nowhere could I see any opening or any notable feature.  As I stood riveted, it suddenly both rose and sped away to my right-! -at about a 45 degree angle to the field. It&apos;s disappearance took only a fraction of a second. Because I had no kind of drug in my system nor was I tired, I believe what I saw was real.  I went back the next day to see whether the ground below it showed any signs of heat or of radiation burns.  Nothing looked unusual.  I want to add that the area where I saw it was a path for low-flight jet maneuvers over the river, from a ridge on one side to a ridge on the other.  These jets were from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We will invite the witness to submit an illustration of the object, which we may post.

I had my compact 10 X 30 binoculars and spotted four separate white circles attached in a circlular formation. I estimate their altitude to be about thirty to forty thousand feet. They were clearly above the cloud layer that looked to be at least twenty to twenty five thousand feet. What struck me as odd was the appearance that they remained fixed in the same location for the five minutes I observed them. I periodically looked at them without the binoculars and they remained straight over my head. I also observed either an orange glow off of one circles&apos;s side or reflection of the sunlight. I was wondering why the jet stream and winds at that altitude was not pushing them away from our location. Maybe these were just some very large weather baloons at a very high altitude. After about five minutes the cloud layer moved underneith their location and obstructed our view.", "Strange orange glow like flame of hot air balloon - but without the balloon - over the evening sky in Burbank, CA.We were outside on Saturday evening in Burbank, CA when during a family reunion gathering, someone said, &quot;What&apos;s that?&quot; and we all looked up and saw what looked like the flame from a hot air balloon - except without the balloon.  At first I thought it was a hot air balloon that was just dark in color and we couldn&apos;t see the balloon because of the night sky.  But the &quot;flame&quot; didn&apos;t flicker like a flame at all, and was a bright brilliant gold color.  Further diminishing the hot air balloon theory ... the object went from moving rather slowly, it started to seemingly gather a lot of speed and altitude.  Not fast, slower than say a jet aircraft -- but certainly what seemed too fast for any type of ballon depending on wind. And the altitude was certainly way too high for a balloon.  Eventually it continued on it is &quot;up-and-out&quot; pattern and eventually became too small to see.  This event was witnessed by probably 12 people-- all of which were at a loss to explain what it was.  By the time someone got binoculars it was too high and/or far to make out any detail.", "It changed shape from a cigar shape to a circle and back again.After reading so many of your sightings sent in, I remembered my Dad and I standing in our yard and Dad says &quot;Look at that thing, it&apos;s changing!&quot;  It was indeed changing shape, from a cigar shaped to a circle and to a cigar shape again.  It appeared to be &quot;squirting&quot; along, like the shape change was part of it&apos;s locomotion.  This was a clear sky with a few high clouds.  The thing appeared to be metallic, but it didn&apos;t show the sun reflecting off of it like an airplane.  It appeared dull.  Was going pretty fast, but not so fast as to make it difficult to see.  Jets now go faster than it was going.  Dad mumbled something about a UFO, but I think he was joking.  I was 10 or 11, and am 35 now.

The edges of the object were illuminated by a red band of individual lights. The lights did not flash.

I considered stopping for a better look, or making a call to the sheriff or a radio station, but I did not have time. As I was driving to work on Interstate 71, I tried to locate the object, but I could not see it. The weird thing was that when I pulled into the parking lot at work (in the Polaris area of Columbus) at about 5:00 AM, I again saw the same triangle in the eastern sky, this time at a much higher elevation, probably 45 degrees above the horizon. It was probably four miles to the east. After looking at it for a few seconds, it seemed to fade away into the night sky. When I got into my car at 4:40 AM, I saw nothing unusual.

Third, isn&apos;t it wierd that i saw this over a busy town in the daytime? maybe it goes on all the time and we just don&apos;t notice because we don&apos;t walk round looking up all the time.And lastly, the thing that fascinates me most about this whole thing is the place where i saw it. For anyone who doesn&apos;t know a hospice is a place where people with fatal diseases go to spend their final months. Now what was this craft doing there in particular? I mean it was hovering right above it and it&apos;s an isolated building. so what did it want? Somebody tell me!((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.

We thought at first it may have been a aircraft as the object paced some of the vehicles on the road. But then realized that whatever it was had to be way to low for any plane to fly at night in this area. Eventually the object made a sudden move, or jerked across the highway to the opposite side and came to a stop. (HBCC UFO Note: I asked the witness what he meant by the object jerked. He told me it looked as if it would either stop for a split second, then start moving again, or as it moved a head it would side back just a bit from where it was coming from and then travel a head). As the witnesses watched it sitting in a stationary position on the west side of the highway, he said it looked like it gained a little altitude and then short off towards the west at an incredible rate of speed. Matter of fact the fellow who watched this take place said, &quot;if you were watching close when it sped off, you would have missed it due to how fast it was traveling&quot;. The witness guessed the two of them watched the object for approx: a minute before losing sight of it completely. He went on to tell me that this was not the first time he had saw something rather strange over the Terrace area. Last year (2002) his children dropped by for a visit, and one of the kids grown and now married, gave out a yell and all of them watched a huge glowing/golden colored &quot;thing&quot; moving over the town of Terrace. He said it moved fairly quick, but again stressed that whatever it was, was enormous. He had read articles on myself (HBCC UFO) in the Terrace Standard newspaper last year, but felt funny about coming forward to tell the story. But this year he said, I had to talk to someone over what we both saw, as it was just so strange. Thank you to the witness for the report. (Witness personal information deleted by HBCC UFO).

First i thought it must be a cricket stadium or some flyover but when i observed the lights for over half an hour i was shocked as those lights didn&apos;t change their position as my train was moving at a speed of over 60Kms per hour. I continued to stare at the lights till 1:00 for over 50 minutes when they were obstructed by the city buildings. There was no flash coming from them . they were dim just like stars and their position was stationary relative to my train (just like stars) which made me believe that its something not on the ground but in the sky. There were 2 symmetrical patterns of lights as though there are 2 disks . It might have been a spy plane or something but in that case , it should have changed its position when my train stopped at a station for over 10 minutes . But this didn&apos;t happen.

It was dark and I had gone approximately 1/2 mile from my house when I saw a flashing red light. Thinking that a local police officer was pulling me over,I checked my mirrors and was surprised to see nothing behind me. The flashing was pulsing on and off at at rate of about 1 Hz,1/2 second on and 1/2 second off.When I looked around to see the light&apos;s point of origin,it was not visible. I saw that the hood of my white car was illuminated in this pulsing red light, and thought it unusual that the light source was directly above me as I was still driving down the road at 35 miles per hour. I needed to get a look at what ever was above me and pulled my head up in front of the steering wheel and looked up through the windshield. When I looked up,I saw a pulsing, translucent circular red light that measured approximately 10 inches in diameter and two inches thick. It seemed to attached to a large,flat surface that was so dark in color that it was barely discerable and did not reflect any of the light. It it difficult to tell how large the &quot;craft&quot; itself was. The light itself was very visible,and measureable since it was only a foot above the roof of my car! As soon as I looked at the light,it instantly accellerated down the road ahead of me at incredible speed and dissapeared over the tree line at the end of the road. I had experimented with lasers in my high school physics lab, and it was quite similar to flicking a laser pointer across the ceiling. The light flashed once and appeared as a streak over a distance of approximately 2 miles to the horizon, then dissapeared. There was no sound,or force felt as it departed from over the roof of my car.The sighting was reported over the air immediatlely upon my arrival at the radio station, but I received no phone calls or feedback other than my fellow engineer who encouraged me to broadcast my sighting. I have never documented my experience until now,but have told many of my freinds. 8/19/2003((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.

It was not that the binoculars were unsteady, one object would race in all directions in front of another object which remained steady, so there could be no question about what it was doing. The motions, in all directions, including criss-crossing, were incredibly fast - about as fast as the eye could follow. Approx: time viewing objects was 2 minutes.

He approaches me and asks &quot;What are those things?&quot; I looked up and saw nothing. The sky was clear except for some high thin clouds.I asked him where and he points up to the high cloud and says &quot;they are in the cloud ,then they come out.&quot; I looked for about 2-3 minutes then spot 4 shapes that were higher than the clouds. They were nearly exactly vertical from our position on the ground.  They  looked like the USAF insignia without the star in the middle. (The =0= insignia on all Air Force aircraft.) The moved slowly and moved into a V formation. One minute later a 5th object appeared , it also moved into the formation then moved to the left of the rest.Another appeared and finally a 7th object came into sight. Four lined up in the attack formation, while the other 3 moved spread out to a sentry position from the other four.As we were observing the objects 2 boys asked us what were we looking at, we told them we were looking at something strange. They looked up and after approximately three minutes of searching, they also observed the objects. Once, one of the objects changed from a silvery color to a velvet-blue color than back to silver. The life guards also entered the search but could not spot the objects. They were higher than 30,000 feet as later I spotted a DC-10 at cruising speed and it was below the clouds. The sighting was over at 1615 hrs with only 3 boys ages 10-12 and myself being the only witnesses. I am 37 years old and a former USAF Sgt.

The visibility was excellent, there was no wind, and he was only about 50 yards away from us, moving just like someone coming in to land by parachute. But there was no parachute, nothing, only the figure of a man of average height. When he was about 20 feet from the ground he stopped and then moved off horizontally in a northerly direction, slowly gaining altitude and speed until, when he went out of site I&apos;d estimate that he was travelling at about 50mph. There was no noise. My partner and I are both teachers in our 50&apos;s, and we both observed exactly the same phenomena.((NUFORC Note:  One of two reports from the same source of the same sighting.

My wife spotted it first I looked and at frst glance thought that it may be venus because it was just stting there and it was very bright.  Then I noticed it was slowly moving laterally.  It seemed to flicker like a quasar but it was too far away for me to get a distinct shape I am in army aviation so I dimissed rotary wing aircraft because the consume too much fuel to just sit it the air for no reason and they have a definite hovering appearance.  I am not sure if weather balloons have lights or why they would be that far from the university.  And lastly could it have been a hot air balloon?

I looked over to the N/NW and saw a bright starlike object. I saw a falling star off to the right of the object and noticed that the object had made a swooping motion as if to avoid the falling star. It then continued to keep it&apos;s position in the sky where I had first witnessed it, yet constantly in motion. I began to think that I was perhaps imagining things so I went to get my wife who was already in bed asleep. She came out on the balcony and watched this phenomenon along with me. It continued to make swooping and other types of motion that I can say without a doubt was not the kind of motion you would expect at that altitude to be an aircraft of any kind.

I looked in the direction, high above a nearby tree, and saw a HUGE, but very far away, &quot;tube&quot; of light slowly climbing higher and higher in the sky.  By &quot;slow&quot; I mean that it was slow moving to my eye, but, with it&apos;s distance, it had to be really moving fast.  I yelled at my husband (who was playing with the dog) to &quot;look, what is that ?&quot; He turned, he saw it, and we both watch it for maybe 1 to 2 minutes.  At first we thought maybe it was a huge firecracker that was going to finally explode or start falling downward, but, that never happened.  It was too bright, but, did not actually &quot;give off&quot; light, I didn&apos;t light up anything around it like a lightbulb would. It steadly climbed, climbed and climbed, at maybe a 45 degree angle.  Then, it was as if someone flipped a switch and turned it off, it was just gone.  This sounds strange I know, but, it was as if it flew behind something, although there was nothing there for it to fly behind.

We had stayed out after watching a beautiful sunset and sitting in our sand chairs with perfect weather and an enjoyable evening. Sometime after 10:00 PM we both spotted what I would call a Fast-Walker, moving from south to north in a rapid long hopping or pulsing movement. Possibly with a reddish glow to it, brightening and dimming as it pulses forward through the sky. These are very fast and you can count four or five pulses as they skip across the sky in a matter of seconds and the they are gone from view. We actually saw two of these within an hour moving in a northernly direction. Those were exciting and I had seen one once before but what we saw at approximately 11:00 PM really excited me! I pointed and yelled out UFO, UFO, as these two objects raced across the sky in a very unusal pattern. There was no doubt that these were very annomalus. There were two objects which my wife says were gray lights. I have trouble with colors and take her word for the color. All I can say is that there were two lights and that they were speeding north paralell to each other and appeared two come together and criss-cross each others path four to five times in a steady rythm as they rapiddly sped north from the south along the Oregon coast. Kind of hard to explain a sighting that only lasted about 5 seconds and I probably wouldn&apos;t have reported just a fast moving light in the sky like a pulsing Fast-Walker that allmost seems to be common, but these twin objects or lights were extraordinary. They appeared to be lower than the other objects we had seen. Yet very high with no known noise or visible trail associated with them and what struck me as almost a playful flight pattern, zipping in and out of each others path as they streaked along.It is possible that they were not criss-crossing but mearly appeared to come together and then part in a repeated pattern as they raced across the sky, but it was my impression that they were criss-crossing and traveling extremely fast in a very exciting, annomalous sighting. There were over 50 people on the beach and about seven campfires as we did a rough head count of the activities around us as we stayed out untill about midnight on this perfect summer evening on the beach. I don&apos;t believe anyone else heard me or looked up soon enough when I shouted UFO, UFO, probably muffled by the ocean surf and distance on the wide beach.", "Return of the Sedro-Woolley Winking StarThis is a follow-up to a report filed on 8/18/03, in which my I, my wife, and a neighbor observed a winking light in the sky for 1 hour and 45 minutes as it slowly traveled in a n/w direction in the n/w quadrant of the sky.Tonight, I went outside after 10:00 pm to observe Mars.  I also scanned the n/w quadrant of the sky to see if the winking light would make a reapparance.   (It should be noted that on several evenings since our first sighting, my wife and I have gone outside to see about a repeat performance with no luck.)  I had been looking at the sky for several minutes when I thought I saw something flash directly above me in the sky.  This was out of my peripheral vision, so I focused on the area above me where I had seen the flash.  I did a mental count to 29 (as in the first sighting), and on the count of 29 was looking directly at the flash as it winked on and winked off.  The flash was white in color, just to the &quot;top&quot; of the northern cross (i.e., if the cross were right-side up, the flash was located above the top of the cross), and the brightness was equal to that of nearby Vega, if not brighter.At this point, I dashed inside, grabbed the video camera, and called to my wife, &quot;It&apos;s back.&quot;  I went back outside, grabbed a lawn chair and sat down, and looked up again in the sky.  As my wife came out, we saw it flash once more, very bright.  I started up my video camera and aimed it at the location in the sky and waited in vain.  It did not reappear.  My wife saw the second flash.  From its location against the stars, it appeared to be traveling in a generally east to west direction.At approximately 20:22, we saw another white flash, this time in a different location, further north in the night sky; just behind the back of Cassiopeia&apos;s chair.  We focused on that area and began our mental count to 29.  But only a few seconds after this new flash, we saw a second flash, which was also behind Cassiopeia&apos;s chair, but a few degrees west of the first flash.  That was all.  We watched the skies for almost an hour more with no luck.  We did see several shooting stars, airplanes and satellites.  They are all quite different from the flashing light we observed.((NUFORC Note:  We are acquainted with these witnesses, and we know them to be quite reliable, and credible as witnesses.

This was traveling pretty fast, and approaching the group of 3. It got in very close proximity to the 3, and all the sudden fell straight out of the sky and turned bright white. It sent chills straight down my spine. I slammed on the gas and tried to get closer for a look at the 3, got one last glimpse of it in a break in some trees, and then did not see it again. This was not very high up, it was lower than most small airplanes fly to the ground.", "two triangles in the night skyon the way back from the fair on the evening of aug. 18th  i observed  two objects in the sky about a 500 ft. in the air.  my mother noticed the lights first.  they were stationary with blinking lights on the corners.  the middle light stayed constant, about the brightness of Mars which was also visible to the east.  the closer we got to them they better we could see that they were not moving.  i was in the back seat of the car and i rolled the window down to listen for noise of any kind.  i was in the army as a scout and i can was trained to tell aircraft.  i thought they were blackhawks  just hovering there but there was not a sound.  they were about 100yds off the road so if it were a helicopter you could hear them.  you could see that they were darker than the surrounding darkness.  they were triangle shaped with three lights  one on each of the corners.  i was not scared just curious.  that night i could here alot of animal activity.  the coyotes were howling and barking most of the night.  i also noticed alot of military activity.  we have an air base that has a bomber group stationed there.  that night and on following nights there has been alot of fast movers coming and going(F-15s).", "I saw a super-bright light standing still for 30 seconds and a minute later it was movingOk I listed above that this happened on July 31st 2003 but I&apos;m not sure that is the right date. But I know this happened between July 25 and August 5th. It was approximately 0300 hours. I walked onto my porch and sat down on. I looked up at the sky and I saw an unusually bright light. I gazed at it for about 30 seconds and wondered what it could be. At first I thought it must be a satellite. But I have never seen a satellite this bright. Then I thought maybe its a planet, but I have never seen a planet this bright either. Well I dismissed it (by the way I wasn&apos;t drinking) and I dont use drugs. Well about a minute later I looked back up and it was moving about as fast as an airplane in a straight line for about 10 seconds until the trees obscured it. It was west of me moving westward. It had no flashing lights, no colored lights. Now I am a skeptic. When this happened I thought it must have been a helicopter, but it looked as high as a star and had no flashing. I thought maybe I should call an agency and report it but I am pretty skeptical about UFO&apos;s and I thought what are the chances that I, someone who doesnt believe in UFO&apos;s, is going to see one. So I figured I would get online and see if anyone else reported a UFO that night. No one did. I haven&apos;t told anyone except my friend because people would think I&apos;m crazy the same way I do about other people who report seeing UFO&apos;s. I was talking to my friend tonight and he is into UFO&apos;s and told me I should at least report it to you.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We suspect Mars may be the cause of the sighting.

Although my account wasn&apos;t as vivid as what they had relayed to me, it was just as beliveable.I was driving just off of highway 360 with a friend, windows down and the targa-roof off. We were doing maybe 45mph heading south-west when to the direct-south we saw an extrodinary green light on the horizon. It had to have been several miles out, but the glow lit up the sky above us like a pale day light. It seemed to pulse once, and then slightly less again to the west of the first. It was a quite night and we heard no boom or crack as if it was some sort of explosion. We spent the next hour driving south on 360 and around the mansfield/cedar hill area looking for the cause. None found, and no good excuse either. Theres a power plant out that way, but its natural gas, and it stood peacefully with all of its yellow lights on.

It had a bowl shape attached to the end of the cylinder, three dimensional. It was black in color the top of the object was silver. The top of the bowl shape was concave. It moved slowly and was about 200ft from the ground. We pulled over to watch it for about 10 minutes. above a field and then again from a larger field around the corner. It had a yellow hue around it and then the hue changed to blue. It wasn&apos;t a bright hue. It was very suddle. It was daylight about 11:00 am.

It was almost like lightning, but was bright blue and seemed to come from all directions. Also it seemed to be very close to the ground. That was weird enough but about 3 minutes down the road it happened again, this time appearing a bit more green. About 15 minutes later it happened again near a populated area, quite a way from where the first lights appeared. The third light definitely did not come from the same place that the first two did. There is a chance that the first two lights came from the same place, but it doesn&apos;t seem very likely. We later saw the light again, but from a distance.

It appeared to just sit there so we were all wondering what it could be. I got the binnoculars to take a lil closser look and it was bright red,half around the circle was more red lights aroun the object there had to be at least 20 lights but the same color as the object. all of a sudden it faded a bit and finally it disapeard as if it was sucked up into space.

It was a perfect equalateral triangle, and was very large...  the size of a commercial airplane in length.  I&apos;ve grown accustomed to seeing various aircraft in my area, as I live about 2-3 miles from an airport, so most air traffic crosses over my house, but it usually comes from the East when flying low, as that is the direction the airport is from me.  This craft came from the South... It was flying very low, just above my roof and the treetops nearby, traveling at a reasonably fast pace, but just slow enough over me to where I could stand in awe wondering what it was and memorize its every detail in passing.  Each corner of the triangle had a very bright light that was like a spotlight shining down on the ground, and each light was equal in brightness.  It wasn&apos;t completely quiet, yet it wasnt&apos; very loud either.  The noise it made was sort of soft humming sound. I first noticed it when I saw the bright lights coming over my roof as I was laying in the hammock in my backyard looking up to the sky towards Mars.  The lights were really bright and at first in the distance I thought it was a Police Helicopter spotlighting for a criminal or something, but it wasn&apos;t loud enough to be a helicopter so I thought it odd.  It came quickly over my roof, covering about a mile in a few seconds.  When it was over my back yard area, it slowed down quite a bit.  The 3 lights shined down into my backyard and then after it passed by it sped up again and took off so fast I couldn&apos;t see it anymore in a matter of seconds, due North. After seeing it, I thought it must be some hi-tech jet of some sort, but after looking for about an hour online thru various pictures of jets and planes, I saw nothing close to it.  Then I did a search on U.F.O.  and found a site that had drawings of a craft that looked EXACTLY like what I saw!  Then I came to this site today and decided to report what I saw last night. I am still amazed by what I saw... I don&apos;t know if this was something top secret, millitary, or something not of this world, but whatever the case, it was a phenomenal sight.

We were almost back home, walking up the road when we looked up and saw the figure of a man, dressed in what looked like black overalls, descending as if by parachute. He was coming down about fifty yards away behind the last house in the row. I thought he was going to land in the meadow beyond. But when he was only about 15 feet off the ground he levelled out and began to slowly accelerate, climbing very gently and heading off in a northerly direction. We watched as he crossed the valley and disappeared into the distance. But there was no parachute, or any means of propulsion. Nothing visibly attached to his back, no noise, nothing. All of this was on a summer&apos;s evening, blue sky, excellent visibility, and no wind.((NUFORC Note:  One of two reports from the same source of the same sighting.

I noticed a flash of light and thought it was travelling fast for a plane that was making no sound, so I walked to the end of the yard and saw a boomerang type shape, glowing orange, gliding silently through the sky. It was moving fast and as I watched it, it seemed to suddenly disappear after so many seconds, although I could see it for several seconds before it disappeared. It was not (in my experience) anything like a plane. And the weird thing was that it was travelling in a way that did not seem aerodynamic. Rather than travelling in the &gt; shape, it was travelling in a &lt; position. Shortly afterwards, there was a lot of activity outside. Dogs barking and I swear there were more sirens than usual in a long burst.

I was looking to the north at two stars, one a little brighter then the other.  I noticed that the brighter star seemed to be moving/dropping below and to the left of the dimmer star; the brighter star was as still as the dimmer one before it started moving.  I thought my head was spinning so I looked down and looked back to see if it was me.  It was not, the moving star/object continued to move downward, then the star/object got very bright, a very bright white with a hint of blue, it became brighter then any other star in the sky.  The star/object moved towards the north and faded out of sight, not at an extremly fast rate but at a faster rate then any airplane I have ever seen, and it was at a very high altitude.  I had to stop and ask myself, what did I just witness.  I started laughing and told myself, no that was the after burner of a military jet, then I looked towards the NE and saw a second very bright star, and the same event happen but this one seemed closer to the horizon and closer towards me.  It became brighter then the first one, again a very bright white, it moved off towards the NE.  I am very sure that what I saw was not a military jet. What I saw moved unlike any plane I have ever seen and I have seen most if not all of them as my father was in the AirForce for twenty five years and so we always saw the jets in action.

At this point, coincidentally, a Passenger jet was also entering south Florida Airspace from the South East, high enough to create a vapor trail. At this time, the &quot;Unidentified Object&quot; appeared to be standing still, directly in the path where the jetliner would soon pass. As the jetliner approached the object, suddenly, the object maneuvered its way down from the path of the jetliner, which from my &quot;Viewing Vantage point,&quot; avoided the collision. After the jet passed the high noon position, the object returned directly on the path of the jet where the vapor trail was left, &amp; hovered there until it began to ascend until it disappeared from eyesight. 2nd Sighting - At this point, about 2 minutes after the 1st sighting, another similar object appeared from the very same position &amp; angle in the south, &amp; began the same trajectory of flight towards the high noon sky, while the sun&apos;s light revealed a colorful spectrum of light flash, as the object hurdled across the horizon. Unlike the 1st object, this object did not appear to stop moving, as it also disappeared in the high noon sky. At this point, I placed a call to my local authorities. 3rd Sighting - A third object began an identical trajectory across the South Horizon. By this time, I grabbed my &quot;Camcorder,&quot; &amp; began filming its unusual flight patterns. When my local authorities arrived at my home, the provided the officer with a copy of my videotape. The officer told me that she was going to confirm the sightings, with local &quot;FAA Authorities.&quot; Strangely enough, about an hour later, the officer decided to return to my house in person to confirm that local FAA Authorities &quot;DID NOT&quot; report any Unidentified Flying Objects over South Florida airspace.", "-SAW TWO SMALL 3-4 FOOT TRIANGULAR SHAPED DULL METALIC OBJECTS BELOW THE CLOUDS MOVING IN A SYNCRONIZED MANNER  ROLLING END OVER END AND DIPPING AND CLIMBING VERY SLOWLY.

The reason of this delay is that I&acute;ve just found your site and I&acute;d like to give a report.It was late in the evening, almost midnight. Me and my friend were kicking football on a nearby field when I noticed something strange in the southern horizon. I saw a formation of star- or satellite- like dots moving from south to southeast. I know that there are satellites moving in formations but there were far too many objects here, over ten. The formation of these objects was irregular, but they were moving with a visible speed like satellites. Time to time these objects vanished slowly and then came back into vision. When noticing the phenomenon I told my friend to take a look of the objects too. (His face was heading north while I was the goalkeeper with my face heading south) He saw the objects and said only:&quot;Those are definitely UFO:s.&quot; Then we kept on kicking the ball and paid no longer attention to the phenomenon. However, this sighting has bothered me ever since. Do you have any idea, what this strange formation could have been. I can only tell that in July the nights here in Finland are quite light so this phenomenon could have possibly been something reflecting the light of the sun. Birds of course are out of the option. The sun had already set.((CLARIFICATION FROM WITNESS))Whoops! Made a little error there. The year of the observation was really 2002 but I just can&acute;t remember the exact date, sorry.

I noticed what at first glance I took to be just a commercial airliner at normal cruising altitude, not paying much attention to it. On giving it a second look there were no strobes and no navigation lights (red or green), what I observed was an irregular oval cluster of six white lights with one white light somewhat trailing the rest and off to one side. The cluster was moving to the west more or less as could be seen as it passed by known stars. The lights were not overly bright, about the same as what one would observe on a comercial airliner at normal cruising altitude from the ground.

She didn&apos;t pay any attention to it coming home so we went outside on the balcony to look at it. Just as we were looking at Mars a triangular or V-shaped object appeared from the southwest sky and moved towards the northeast. It was a dark gray color, which made it visible in the sky. It wasn&apos;t a smooth object but seemed like it had a rough and textured exterior. She asked me if &quot;I see that,&quot; and I said, &quot;Yes.&quot; She asked me &quot;What it was,&quot; and &quot;Is that a bird,&quot; I stated &quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; and we watched it move across the sky. It made no sound and had no movement except across the sky. The entire sighting lasted 10-15 seconds at which point it disappeared out of view behind a building. Afterwards, we kept asking each other what it was. If it was a plane it would have had lights (it didn&apos;t) and made some noise. If it was a bird or a flock of birds such as geese it would have had movement and possibly made noise. It did neither. I thought to myself that it could be a satellite but it was too low. I do not believe in UFO&apos;s but my girlfriend does. So my only conclusion is a government test plane.

Their hay field was directly west of the barn and when their son at the time was 7 years old and was standing looking into the field, he said. Daddy, there is a stop light sitting in the grain field. As they turned to look they all saw a softball sized, brilliant red light/object sitting just over the tops of the grain. As they watched the object moved slowly and along the way it changed it&apos;s color to white and then finally green.

Just a few moments ago I was looking out my window and noticed in front of a cloud something that appeared to be cylinder-shaped making tight circles.  At first I thought perhaps it was an eagle, as it did have dark edges and a lighter center, but as it circled I saw it catch the glint of the sun and shine brightly for a second.  At this point I noticed there were two of them circling round and round, in relatively stationary, tight circles.  They were likely several miles to the west of me, and I&apos;d guess about 5000 feet up -- perhaps 1/3 of the way from horizon to zenith.  I called to my co-worker and he came over and also saw these objects.  Most of the time only one could be seen, but a couple of times the objects were seen to move in an almost synchronised fashion.  They may have been cylinder-shaped, as they tilted while circling, but from my perspective it&apos;s hard to say -- i.e. they may have been disks.  I can say with confidence, they were not airplanes.  In any case, they were fascinating to watch for approximately 5 minutes, when I lost them in a cloudbank.  A few minutes later, at exactly 1.28, I looked out and noticed a dark airplane, flying relatively low -- an old, military-looking prop plane, from west to east.  It passed my building just to the south.

I won&apos;t make it a separate report, but I consider it suspicious; I wished I had my binoculars with me so that I could have confirmed whether it was a balloon!

While in our backyard, my son&apos;s 10-year guest first drew our attention to an object floating in sky at about 5:10 in the late afternoon. At first, the object looked like a dark dot in the sky and was too high to determine what it was even with my low-powered binoculars. Initially, I dismissed it a cluster of balloons set adrift. But then I noticed that the object was stationary which was unusual especially at this altitude. At times, it would sway back and forth to show that the object had an irregular shape. As it swayed, a lighter shade of color could be seen on its body. It was my wife&apos;s opinion that it was not balloons. After some ten minutes, the object slowly started drifting through the sky. During this period, a small non-commercial plane, at an altitude of several hundred feet flew by between us and the object. The object stopped once again after traversing what I think were miles. We were still unable to determine what it was. Then my son&apos;s friend alerted us to two more similar objects further out in the horizon. One of the objects slowly drifted to our direction but still not close enough to determine what it was. At about 5:40, all three objects could seen, stationary and distanced from each other by miles of blue skies. Eventually, my attention was drawn back to our backyard activities.

But the speed Between the position when I first spot it and the cloud, I estimate conservatively the distance to be about 5 miles. Five miles in 15 seconds is appreciatively 1700 per second!  When I finally realized the strangeness of this object, I tried to take a picture but the object was already too far and too small to be seen through the screen of my digital camera.", "It look like a star from my distance;I was sitting on my third story belconey looking over the north-northwest skies about 1:30 am enjoying the balmy clear nite sky watching the star&apos;s and looking for satilites. To the north looking over the Saginaw Bay I notice what I thought was a star in the lower portion of the sky. Nothing abnormal about it until it move into a loop and shot downward and upwards at about 70 degrees due north and faintly disapeared. I knew that it was not any type of aircraft, nor was no other aircraft in the vacinity at this time, because I was monitoring Cleveland Air Traffic Control Center. Where I live in Essexville MI, J-36 high altitude jet route cross over ar area. I believe this was some type of object that was sitting still for some time until it decicided to exit?((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

He likes to come out at our house, sit on our deck, and stargaze and watch the bats we have in the area.  I like to do the same things, so I always go out there with him.  My mom got up early since she was off of work that night.  She joined us out there for a while, but decided to go in and brush her teeth, so she never saw it.  It was between 4:00 and 5:00 a.m. CST when this occurred.  We had seen aircraft flying overhead that night and saw lights that we always dismissed as satellites.  About a minute, or two after my mom went inside I was looking westward in the sky and saw a bright blue light that looked just like a star, but it was moving.  I thought it was just another satellite at the time, but I noticed right away that it looked brighter than the normal satellites we see in the sky.  Most are usually hard to see, but this was clearly visible.  It was going north to south.  I told my nephew to look at it, so we both were watching it.  Then about 10-15 seconds after I first saw it, it turned from blue to a very bright yellow.  That&apos;s when I had my first real doubts about it being just a satellite.  In about 5 seconds period it slowly turned a very bright yellow and then dimmed back down to blue and then continued out of sight past some pine trees.  I say slowly since it was like a dimmer switch being turned on and not like an explosion, or something that happens suddenly.  It flashed a little bit when it turned yellow.  It also doubled in size, or got brighter.  It never stopped on its path, slowed down, or sped up, it just continued on the same path, going to same speed.  It wasn&apos;t going extremely fast, about normal for a satellite, or plane.  It didn&rsquo;t appear to be a meteor, since it didn&apos;t streak across the sky, leave a trail, or break up.  The light just changed color and got brighter.  There were planes in the area, but it&apos;s normal for this area, but this didn&apos;t act like the lights on a plane.  It ! also made no sound.  My nephew went back in side to get my mom, but it was already gone by the time she got there.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that a tumbling rocket booster would be the first possibility to be ruled out.  When then catch the light from the Sun just right, they reflect it so that an observer on the ground sees a flare of light as the rocket continues on its way in orbit.  PD))", "Local Call. This reported sighting took place just over Houston, B.C. A Houston resident telephoned me today to explain what she saw out her bedroom window. The witness had jumped into bed ready for a night&apos;s sleep when something caught her attention, her bedroom window faced the northeastern portion of the sky. She saw a extremely bright white light flying at a low altitude and it shot across the sky. When she first noticed it, the light/object was traveling in a straight line, but then before she lost sight of it the object it zig zagged and disappeared. (The witness is going to give me a sketch of what the event looked like). No tail was observed trailing the object, no sound was heard as the witness said she had her window open due to it being very warm out. The witness said the object was approx: the size of her finger nail. Another interesting thing about this sighting was that the light/object had a number of lights running around the outside of it, and all white in color. The event lasted approx: 4 seconds. The sighting scared the witness enough that she had a hard time getting to sleep that night.

PD))Bright yellow object in southern sky moved around constantly for 35 minutes while maintaining its position above the earth.Observed what appeared to be a star at first, but it was bright yellow, which seemed odd. Object was approximately 60 degrees above the horizon, and in a southerly direction from my vantage point. I saw it move and assumed it must be an airplane or helicopter, but after ten minutes of observation, its location did not appear to have changed, although it seemed to be moving from side to side. In fact, it was bobbing all over the place, although it never moved more than approximately 4 to 5 times its own diameter. I observed it for at least twenty minutes, and it was moving almost the entire time, i.e., it would remain stationary for five or ten seconds at a time, and then resume motion. At first I thought I might be imagining it, or that some atmospheric condition was creating the illusion of motion, but it&apos;s a very clear night here, and cool, and I&apos;m now convinced that the object was moving, although in general it appears to be stationary relative to the earth. It&apos;s now 5:11 am EST. I&apos;m going outside to see if it&apos;s still there. It&apos;s now 5:15 am. It&apos;s still there, and in the same position. If it&apos;s a star, it seems that it should be in a different position by now, 36 minutes after I first observed it. Also, I noticed that while there are a few stars visible in the northern sky, there are no stars visible in the southern sky where this object is located. I can&apos;t tell if it&apos;s overcast to the south - too much glare from the lights around the apartment complex. But whatever it is, it&apos;s still there and it&apos;s still bouncing around.

I was living in Terrace at the time but am currently living in Pr. Rupert.I am fairly sure that my experience occurred in the early morning of Sunday August 25, 2002.It is not what I saw that intrigued me as I really did not see anything, it is what I heard.About 4:30 am I awoke to go to the bathroom.  The window was open in my bathroom as it was quite a warm night as it has been lately.  As I was standing at the toilet a very loud and intense noise quickly filled the sky.  It was loud enough that I wondered if it would wake up anyone else in the area.  The noise lasted for approximately one to one and a half minutes and then was gone again quickly.  The noise sounded very much like a military plane flying overhead with one very distinct difference. This noise did not come out of or move into the distance.  In my experience with military planes you can hear them come from a distance and as they pass overhead you can hear them go off into the distance.  This sound did not move like that.The skies were clear and bright and I could not see anything in an direction that was visible to me.I&apos;m curious if you have had any other reports from that time or confirmation of any military exercises in the area at the time.

The first major sighting to occur in a series of sightings, which later were to become known as the &quot;Hudson Valley Sighting,&quot; occurred on March 23, 1983, according to &quot;The Encyclopedia of Extraterrestrial Encounters,&quot; by Ronald D. Story.  [Please see the NUFORC website for details of that publication.]  The Hudson Valley sightings continued into the year 1984.  PD))V shaped UFO tracked for miles by Ct residents  (Hudson Valley Connected)This sighting had taking place some time ago near the year 1983. It was witnessed by hundreds in Connecticut and I had later found out it was first spotted in Lond Island NY. I seems it was tracked form Long Island all the way to Waterbury CT. My sister had received a phone call from a friend saying there was a UFO comming towards our house and it had just passed her house. Well by the time we had gotten outside a few other calls must had been made because we were not the only ones out there. As we waited more people from the nieborhood came out to see what was going on. To my best count there were more than 25 people outside in the street just in our area. It did not take long for this object to appear. The houses in the area were all two story and pleanty of tree&apos;s that stood a bit higher blocked our vision so we all stood in the street that never reiced much traffic. As this object came into view over the houses no one spoke. There wasn&apos;t much to see as it blocked out the stars and the underside was lightless. No sound from the craft was herd as we looked upon it. You could make out shapes on the bottom but not clearly becuase of the lack of light and it all seemed to be the same color a dull dark grey almost black. It had taken a close to a minute to travel over us, it moved very slowly but steady. It seemed to be just over the tree tops wich made judging the size nearly impossible because you could not see all of it at once. Like I had said it just blocked out the stars as it passed over us like we wernt there. As it passed out of sight nobody said a thing and people just seemed to go back to there houses a bit stunned.My grandfather was ranting saying &quot; there&apos;s no such thing as UFO&apos;s when we received the phone call but after it had passed by he hadn&apos;t said much. We went into the house and he turned on the am radio (WICC in Bpt) and we listened as people called in about this object in the sky. People tracked it all the way to Waterbury and it was said it followed Rt 8 all the way there causing traffic to stop. People got out of there cars on a highway to watch. As it hit Waterbury new reports came in saying it had lights on it and that it was V shaped, something I could not see for myself. The lights were reported as large white lights and it had hoverd there for some time as hundreds of people watched. If I am not mistaken it left at a very high rate of speed but I did not see this and my memory of what I had herd is a bit cloudy now.My reason for writting this now is to gather more information on this sighting. I would like to research this further along with a few other sightings around that time. What I need is the exact date and time. I am planing to go to the library to see what I can pull up. You see this sighting was so huge that the next day it was in all the news papers dressed up as a hoax. It was reported as five ultralight aircraft flying in tight formation with huge lights on them that had come out of a NY airport. I can&apos;t speak for the sightings in Waterbury but what I had seen was by no means explained away by this. I have researched a bit about the Hudson Valley Sightings and I believe these are all linked but this one was seen by far more people than any of them I had read about.I have read many of storys that revolved around this and one even went as far as to speak of the military shooting one down that came on regular intervuls in Long Island. Something of a plasma weapon used to take it down and it was tracked with dobblar radar ( a military radar before used weather forcasters, or so its said) I&apos;m getting a bit off track here but if you have any information on this please post it here. It will be a great help to me... thank you.", "Heavy winds, Pulsating sound, Bluish/purple light , lots of electrical currentOn July 16th 2003 at Approx 12:00 a.m.,. I was getting ready for bed and just turned off the airconditioner and opened up the windows for fresh air. My husband was in the kitchen getting some mid-night snack. My 2 boys age 19 and 10 and their two friends age 12 and 14 had headed up to the grocery store on their skateboards to get some sodas. My last words to them was to be quiet when they get back. I looked at my clock and it was 12:30, I laid down and then it started, The wind picked up and was very strong, my blinds on the windows are very heavy and they where banging around as if a storm was moving in, I remember yelling out to my husbans., Boy feel that nice breeze coming in. Well anyways I closed my eyes and must have dosed off lightly, The next thing I remember is that my eyes opened and I looked over toward the window, and  I heard this Whum Whum Whum then a loud like explosion or something Then the power went out. I jumped out of bed and tried to find some shorts to put on as I was talking to my husband in the other room yelling: Did you see that Did you feel that Something is not right here something is not right here, I went out into the dining area to light a candle and the power went back on, My husband seen the lights from the livingroom and could feel the electric pressure on him.  No sooner as I was getting ready to go out side I heard the Boys running down the stairs to come in Yelling and just pumped up with energy : Did you see that, What was that , Mom we could&apos;nt move it went right through us I have never seen my boys so scared, They said the hair on them stood up .They could&apos;nt move.  I told them to stay in because something just is&apos;nt right That my husband and I are going to go outside and see whats going on. So we walked out to the back of the Apts looked around and then Heard chopper coming from the otherside of the building so we went to the front of the Apts and saw 2 large helipcopters flying toward us going North and they were very low and VERY FAST I looked c! losley and did not see any white stripe on them which tells me they were NOT Medi flight More Like Goverment DARK (maybe Black) copters. So we went back in the house to get keys to the car and told boys to stay in the house, that we were going to see whats going on. We got in the car and realized we had no gas so we headed toward gas station on Ols US 23 and Lee road, got out of the car and the lady that was working yelled out to us our pumps are not working power went out and on and we don&apos;t know how to reset them. One lady that was there said her battery went dead and I asked them what they seen and they said BRIGHT LIGHTS BLUISH IN COLOR. They seemed to my abit stunned. So we went to the station across the street and I went in to see if there pumps where working and they went sure so we tried to get gas and no luck. So we headed back home. Went in the house and the boys where still all pumped up and talking. They decided to go back outside and I told them not to be to loud it&apos;s late and don&apos;t wake up the neighbors. My husband and I finally went to bed and no sooner did we fall asleep the boys came tearing into the house and yelling Mom you got to see this,Mom you got to see this, So they brought me a small piece of branch from a tree and the leaves were dead and curled and I am thinking to myself (so it&apos;s a dead branch so what, and then my 19 year old said to me : Mom I cut through the wall everyday to go to work and move this out of my way AND IT WAS NOT LIKE THIS WHEN I GOT HOME TONIGHT. he was scared. I took the branch and told them to go wash their hands from what appears to be a white residue on it and I placed it in a plastic bag and put it in the hallway. I do have the branch now in a safe place incase anyone wants to study it.. I told the boys to write down their thoughts and how they felt because We needed our sleep and I know they would have stayed up all night talking about it and would have kept my husband and I up. Slept all night and went to work the next day and approx 9:15 a.m next mor! ning at work, The phone rang and it was the assistant manager from the apts asking me:  What the Hell was that last night? She also was woken up because her Cat jumped on her in bed and was just as how she put it VIBERATING. The cat never has done that before, she usally hides when there is a storm but no storm insight but something scared the hell out of my cat.  Well later in the week I asked many people in the area and some say nothing and some remember the power going out and 1 remembers his cat freaking out while he was tring to play video games and he knows power went out too. Meanwhile now we hear they found a crop circle in Howell that weeks time frame. So I guess my question is : Who can contact us to help ease the mind alittle of the events that happen around us.  My son and I have started a little file on the weird and bizzare pheomenons in our Hometown. Thanks for reading and hope one day we all can share stories together.((NUFORC Note:  We presume the event occurred on Wednesday morning, July 16, 2003.  We will attempt to document the alleged power failure.  PD))", "At first there were 2. I was the first to see them.  It was approx. 12.20 on a Friday night.  Above the adjacent town home I saw two glowing lights, they were in formation headed South, I believe.  They moved at a rather slow pace considering.  Within their formation they seemed to be moving independently as well, in an erratic, but quick short manner.  It was unlike anything I have ever seen.  They were circular, and they glowed, with a luminous type light. They were moving with a motive.  I was mesmerized and then my fianc&eacute;e said look, there are three more. They were following the first two lights.  They seemed to be in formation as well, never leaving their positions.  Within their position they seemed to be formation with the first two, but &quot;zig zagging in the same erratic way.  If I had to guess the speed, I would have to say they were moving about 30-40 miles per hour.  They were inclining slowly over the row of town homes we reside in. But it was a slow and gradual incline. There was absolutely no sound what so ever.  I don&apos;t believe they were perfectly round.  We didn&apos;t see any type of shadow or background behind the lights to suggest space ship.  But it was unlike anything any of us have ever seen.  The movement, the glowing lights, the formations, the erratic movement made independently, al suggested to all of us immediately we were definitely observing something amazing and not of this planet. We are all in our 30&apos;s, with predominant careers.  Two of us are realist, but spiritualist as well. Two of us skeptics by nature, until this amazing experience. We are all very well educated, in addition to group and individual continuous education. We  all believe in the evolution of intelligence. Two of us have had previous experiences and sightings.  Since this experience we have shared with many, and have been told amazing stories as well.  Each experience shared with us has had one thing in common, and that is the fact they never shared their experience with anyone else. They kept q! uite, until now.We waited outside in anticipation of seeing additional sightings. We all kept saying the same thing, &quot; what the hell was that&quot;, over and over again. All of us agreeing, it was not of this planet. All of us in amazement, but at the same time, fearful. My neighborhood is filled with military families, of all types. I am informing you of this because of what followed about 30-40 minutes later. A very big, military helicopter began flying above the area we last saw the &quot;UFO&apos;s.  And it was definitely military. It was huge.  It was long and with very few lights, except for in the back.  It was searching for something in the sky, because it did not use a spot light.  They looked like the black hawk down helicopter.  It began searching in a circular manner, and slowly widened the diameter of it&apos;s area, as well as gradually inclining.  If I had to guess, I would say it searched for about 45 minutes to an hour.  In a distance we could hear an additional helicopter.  Our view was blocked by our limited view, we were on the back deck.  WE didn&apos;t feel anything a far as energy, or  the climate nor the sky. Our bodies nor our minds were altered.It was simply amazing!  We all discussed it, and continue to do so.  We all had the same thought as we watched. Can it see us, and if so, does it know we can see it? I would like know if there were other sightings that night in our area.  Please do me this courtesy and reply.  My e-mail is PamelaJWatkins@aol.com.  I would also like to know how and where this information will be documented. I am sure you know my address, and will compile information on me.What now?", "A bright dancing light in the south-southeast sky.I saw a bright round light and at first glance I didn&apos;t think much of it, but then it started zig-zaging and dancing all over the place. I grabbed some high powered bino&apos;s and my cell phone to call my friends, and the light was moving all over the place! From what I could tell, it appeared to be a single bright light and when it seemed to dim, or turn it left a trail, and you could make out a few more dimmer lights on the side. My friends from Vesta and Van Buren reported the same thing. It changed degrees and altitudes several times until it seemed to rest in the southern sky.  Sometimes the dimmer lights would grow brighter, so I&apos;m not sure if it was just one or more.((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have been look at mars.

For some reason, and about at the same moment we both saw an object in the sky to our NNW.  At first, I thought it to be a balloon and called my wife to bring the binoculars.  This object, through the binoculars , was flattened, perfectly disc shaped and was wobbling and rolling side to side and up and down.It did grow a little closer to us and it reflected sunlight as it turned. Positively metallic, smooth and disc shaped. We watched it for a while and I ran in and got the camcorder and digital camera.

Anyway, first I saw what appeared to be a small bright light moving fast from the west moving to the east, from my right to my left. It stopped, appeared to hover for only a moment before changing shape and color. From the single light it appeared to generate 3 separate redish/pale burgundy lights that moved into a kind of triangle shape. The elapsed time at this point was about 20 seconds or so. Before it sped away to the east, it reformed into a single bright light and that&apos;s everything, I did not see it again although I kept watching for another hour.", "a large yellowish light appeared a couple thousand ft up to the south east of my home in long beach, ca.at near 11:00pm my sister noticed a bright yellowish light to the south east of my home in long beach, ca.it looked as if it were 2-3 miles away about a couple thousand feet up. it had no definable shape. after watching it for about 5 mins. it traveled straight up a couple thousand feet in about 5sec. i watched it for another 10 mins.,  it moved up again about 600ft. my sister saw it start traveling backwards.", "unknown lights flying across skyI&apos;m not sure exactly what time it was.  It was night time and i was going out to feed the animals when i saw a pair of lights in the south east heading towards the north west.  at first i thought it was a pair of lights on the wingtips of a low flying airplane so i didn&apos;t pay much attention to them.  but then it accured to me that i couldn&apos;t hear any sound of an engine so i looked at them again and noticed that there was nothing in between the two lights.  i then thought that it might be a pair of satilites moving in the same direction.  since i lived in the country, i had an excillent view of the night sky without any street lights or lights from buildings to obstruct my view.  as i took a harder look at the lights, i noticed that they left a trail, like a jet plane would leave, trailing behind them, but there were only two lights and i could plainly see three trails.  i called out to my brother to come and have a look, but he wasn&apos;t able to come outside, but my mother did and she saw them too.  i don&apos;t know what they were, but i don&apos;t understand how two lights can leave three trails.  As i was looking s.e.  one light was slightly on my right, the other on my left.  both moving at the same speed and in the same direction.  the two lights left thin trails behind them as they moved across the sky.  to the left of the light on my left, i could plainly see a third trail, a wider trail, but there was nothing there to cause it.  Another time i saw something was when i was out driving truck cross country.  my trainer was in the bunk sleeping and i was driving the night shift.  just as i crossed the state line from california into arizona, i saw a ball of light streak across the sky in front of me and appear to crash into the hills.  the ball of light was green.  the first thing i did was turn on my c.b. radio and listened to see if anyone else had seen it.  no one mentioned anything about it on the radio.  my first thought was that maybe i had seen it and no one else did or maybe it was my ima! gination.  then i figured it might have been a meteorite falling to earth.  the green glow could have been cause by copper deposits in the meteor burning as it went through our atmosphere.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

A husband a wife were out finishing up their farm chores when they both witnessed a bright white light moving quickly towards the northeast. They reported that the light was very low and flying over the town of Houston. I talked with the husband and he said the whole event lasted no more than a few seconds, but what caught them off guard was the fact that the light zig zagged low across the sky. He said it was the strangest thing, meaning they never witnessed anything like this due to the fact that the light moved so erratically and low in the sky.

I was staying at the Best Bestern (sic--Best Western/University Towers) Hotel in the University District of Seattle, WA. I was looking out of my hotel room enjoying the 4th of July Fireworks. My girlfriend had a room just above me on the next floor. I called her up to tell her what a great view we had of the fireworks. As I looked out the hotel window enjoying the multitude of shows (there were about 3 different ones going on) I looked on another part of the skyline where there were no fireworks but rather 4 triangular ships that seemed to be doing an acrobatic maneuver. First they simultaneously shot out in directions: North, East, South, and West and then they returned back to the original positions. They were not behaving like fireworks, I never saw fireworks act like this. Rather than think they were UFO&apos;s, I originally reasoned that they were miniature models of UFO&apos;s that someone had rigged up a radio control mechanism to. I called up my girlfriend that night to see if she could see them. Unfortunately she could not. I now believe that these objects were the same type that were viewed in Phoenix, Arizona on March 13, 1997 documented in Chuck Missler/Mark Eastman&apos;s book, Alien Encounters. I bought this book because of the sightings I had observed this July.((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnesses might have observed aircraft, which perform aerobatic displays just prior to the fireworks display over downtown Seattle and Lake Union.  In past years, a MIG-19 with pyrotechnic pods underneath its wings has flown over the waterfront, leaving streams of spark-filled trails behind it.

I told my wife I would be back shortly,  I drove down my road which only has a french school on it and is about a mile long. A car that was driving very slowly when I met up to it was my neighbor from several houses down the street,  he had his wife and child with him and he was pointing while his wife and child were lookingout the window, it was dark by this time, I looked up.  About apx.  1000 ft away, and about 500 ft in the air, a very bright white light in the middle, a flashing red light on both sides of the white light and a blue light flashing {slower then the red ones}on both sides of them. My first thought is that this is a helicopter,  it was close to the hospital and helicopters come and go from there frequently. My neighbor then pulled over to the side of the road and so did I,  we shut are cars off after watching it for a minute, this thing was not that far away,  it wasn&apos;t moving at all,  it was a lot larger then any helicopter that I&apos;ve ever seen,  and their wasn&apos;t one bit of noise coming from it....... we watched it idle and talked about it for a few more minutes, my neighbors left and I watched on, I drove my car a bit more up the road to be closer to it, after again turning off my car I watched it for maybe 5 more minutes before it started moving,  ....it moved very slowly toward my direction and just before reaching me made a turn again keeping its same slow speed.....no noise, it headed toward the east untill it went out of site.  ......sum it all up....I never seen anything like it, I phoned the RCMP and they told me to phone the airport and they put me through to the control tower at Ch&apos;town airport, minutes after speaking with them and reporting it,  their werea few small aircraft sent up to scout the area I mentioned to them.....but it was gone by then, I would also like to mention the fact that my road is very close to the airport....maybe 3 miles d! irect line...they told me at the control tower that their were no flights in or out of there in the last 2 hours, and that airplanes had a red light and a green light.......not blue........but then again...this was no plane.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

What he saw was quite fast; 3 triangular shaped objects above him.They looked like they where made of stone and there were no lights on it.

Somehow I was removed from my seatbelt and through a broken car window and placed some way away from the almost squashed car[ a Mercedes[. My flaskbacks are of being carried to that spot by a creature I would say was not from Earth, there was telepathic communication and a great feeling of compassion from the creature. There was also something else that I will not post here as I believe it is an important indicator as to when there are other creatures like this around.The dreams that followed the incident were very vivid and some sleep walking took place although it felt more like some type of hypnosis as I was aware it was happening but could,nt stop it. I saw other creatures on another occassion on one of these sleep walking incidents. They always communicate telepathically. Has anyone else had an experince like this? It,s slightly strange to feel watched like a goldfish constantly.((NUFORC Note:  We will request a copy of the accident report.

I pointed it out to my wife and she thought it was just a baloon at first, but it then it started to change directions and finally stopped and hovered (wobbeling) and moving short distances. I appeared white or perhaps silver in color (metallic?). Then we could not beleive it, a second indentical craft appeared out of no where and it appeared they began to chase one another in circles (less than a minute) then one the crafts just disapeared. Then the remaining craft acted bewildered as to the location of the other craft and just cruised slowly towards the west and then it appeared gain altitude rapidly straight up util it disapeared.

They were moving in formation - a triangle shape with the &quot;head&quot; light in the front - forming the &quot;tip&quot; of the triangle.  The other two lights were spread out behind the first one to form a perfect triangle.  They were quite high up, like I said they appeared at first to be stars - but upon seeing them moving in sync we realized they were not.  If they were a color I would have to describe them as slightly Bluish.  The four of us watched them (myself, my boyfriend and my two oldest sons: 16 &amp; 13) as they moved out of sight.  After that we were very excited and watched the sky carefully.  We also saw a light moving across the sky that appeared to change color from White to Red, Red to White.  It moved fairly quickly in the opposite direction of the other formation.", "Is this a UFO???The UFO was seen in a photograph taken on the beach.

We were still not in any metropolitan area, pretty much in the middle of nowhere.Off in the distance i saw a baby blue greenish and white light, spaced apart but on the same aircraft, which i took to be a helicopter. After a few seconds I look again and something about the way it was flying wasnt right. Just then my friend (the one was asleep in the backseat) in the passenger seat says, &quot; do you see that?&quot; I acknowledged it was wierd. A few seconds later it was right over us comming from the west to the east toward the highway at a pretty high speed. As soon as it was directly over us it flipped, reversed and started heading west again finally shooting away. When directly over us it could have been no more then 100 feet way. When it changed directions, i know something was up and just as it was starting to head away i stuck my head out the window to catch a glimpse and could actually see the craft. It was FLIPPING head over end as it turned! It was a greyish dull metallic i could tell. But as too its shape it was hard to make out being that i was doing about 70mph and it too was moving. But probably an oval or saucer. It had a greenish baby blue light on one end and a white light on the other. Me and my friend started yelling at each other ,&quot;DID YOU SEE THAT ((deleted))!&quot; waking my friend in the back who slept through it all. Well there was about 4 other cars around me who all had to have seen the thing too. So thats why i say there are probably plenty of other witnesses.

It seemed to shake every now and then, but hovered at the same altitude for about 10 minutes. A large jumbo jet started flying towards it, and the ball started moving up. The plane passed and I watched as the ball continued upwards. The sky was clear and blue except for a few wispy clouds. As the ball passed through one of the clouds the cloud lit up for a split second, as if there was a lightening storm within in, although it was clearly not a storm cloud.

It transversed the horizon in about app. 2-1/2 minutes. Time enough for me to run into my apartment and grab my binoculars. It proceeded in a west to east trajectory very smoothly.

At this point I called my mother and cousin who drove over.  I meanwhile also got my binoculars out and went back outside to get a closer look.  Then I noticed higher up in the sky 2 stationary circular blinking objets.

The trees in the garden restrict the observable altitudes to about 70 degrees. The sky was clear. Just when the ISS emerged from the west over the trees, we spotted a very bright white light moving in from the south at about the same speed as the ISS but with slightly higher magnitude. It looked as if it was cruising very high in the sky and there was no sound. This second &ldquo;satellite&rdquo; moved steadily for about 10 seconds along its path perpendicular to that of the ISS, and then suddenly started to fade. Within a few seconds its magnitude fell (in an orderly fashion) from brighter than the ISS to zero without changing direction. It had vanished before its path crossed that of the ISS, which remained visible until disappearing in eastern direction behind the trees at the other side of the garden. According to the &ldquo;heavens-above&rdquo; website there were no other satellite passes or iridium flares that could have explained this observation, neither was it an aeroplane. In view of the light intensity involved and provided that the respective heights match, the ISS crew may have observed the phenomenon.((NUFORC Note:  We have inquired of the witness whether he thinks the second light might have been a tumbling rocket shell (&quot;ullage&quot;) in orbit.

This report I have for you is of a orange glow in a mushroom cloud. It was about the second day of the Anarchist Mountain fire in Penticton. I was watching the clouds west over Okanagon Lake. Under the huge clouds were a string of smaller clouds lined up like beads. The heat haze and smoke from the south were over the lake and the whole picture was slowly moving north. The last cloud stopped, and slowly moved deliberately and casually down behind Terrace mountain, in the opposite direction of the sky flow. There was an orange glow in the center of the cloud.

Very light patches of cloud cover but mostly a good clear view of stars. I was looking toward the north and I caught site of what I thought was a shooting star traveling southwest to northeast. When I first observed the UFO it was directly overhead heading towards the northeast. It was a triangle shape with red lights on each point of the triangle. They were not flashing or very bright, just a constant red glow that defined the very distinct black triangle shape. The was no noise whatsoever. The speed would be compared to a shooting star. I was only able to view the object for a few seconds because of the extreme speed it cross the sky. The only thing I am not clear about is if it rotated slightly, not spinning but a slight rotation. My impression is controled flight. I do not know the size because I have no reference, but I felt I was at a very high altitude. I am not a professional observer, however I know what a plane and helicopter look like, I have seen satelites many times. I have even seen the space shuttle when it was docking with the space station.

Both times I was out walking my dog when it appeared.  The first incident the craft came quite close--seemed to be hovering over my neighborhood.  The craft could go at different speeds and could be stationary.  This craft stopped in the sky and turned on what seemed to be a very bright spotlight beam.  Three lights were visible on the bottom of the craft at all times except when stationary.  It was capable of being unseen while it traveled away and then later appeared again with the lights back on. I&apos;m sure many people must have seen this because it was over the East Valley of Phoenix for some time.  I walked my dog and saw it, went back to the house, left in my car to drive to the gym about eight miles away and it was still visible in the night sky.

His balcony faced north-west, directly toward the peak of Kaala, probably 15 or so miles away.  He already had his video camera running and told me about this light that pulsed bright and dim coming from behind the mountain, rising up through the clouds, and drop back down.  So of course I stuck around for awhile, I have never witnessed anything unusual like that my entire life.  After talking for about ten minutes, camera still running propped up towards the mountain, we saw the clouds over there get somewhat lit up from some light source behind Kaala.  It raised up, kinda like a sunrise I guess, and kept going.  At first I thought it might of been someone driving around up there, but when it raised up through the clouds, pulsating from a dull orange to a brighter orange, going from dull to bright in about a second, I quickly changed my mind.  It pulsed at a rate which had similarity to a sine wave.  It went up, hovered for a few seconds above and behind the clouds.  We could still see the light pulsating, reflecting off and through the clouds.  It then dropped back down, between the clouds and the mountain where we got a clear view of it, and then back behind the mountain.  It quit, then about 5 minutes after it disappeared, it lit up the clouds again but never surfaced from behind the mountain.  This was all on video-tape and we showed it to a few friends.  I transferred it to my computer, (about 4 Gigs worth).  So quite a few people actually saw the shot, and still had no idea of what it could be (One person said it could have been some machinery that they use for the pineapple fields.)  Unforunately, he ended up taping over it, and my harddrive crashed.  Government conspiracy?  Maybe not, but it was still cool.  Personally I think it may have been some flares, and there also is an airfield back there, where people often skydive, so I am still very skeptical and know there is a! realistic answer to this.((NUFORC Note:  We will encourage the witness to have his hard-drive reconstructed by computer forensic specialists.

There was a total of 6 of us outside that night.  Sometime around 2300 in the Eastern sky a bright object appeared which resembled a very large star.  The light seemed to be coming out of the craft at a even and constant rate, so basically it was a ball of light.  Not like any aircraft I have ever seen.  And I have seen a lot, my MOS was 6060 flight equipment tech. Anyway what was really strange was the speed and angles that it was traveling for some strange reason the craft made several(3 or 4) rediculously sharp turns at angles approching or exceeding 90 degrees.  The craft covered a good deal of space considering it was at least 7-10,000 feet in the sky.  The thing I really hate to say is the fact that it sounds like many other UFO sightings I have heard.

I would say 2 or 3 miles trailing the jet. If I held both arms up. It was about the distance between my hands. Usually I would right off lights in the sky as satalites or space foder. But This paced the jet perfectly in speed. What ever it was , It was able to block out stars. So it was definately larger than the light that was affixed to the object. I went inside for a while and returned an hour later. I saw another jet fly over. The jet got directly over head and then a streak of light shot in front of it. The jet made no course correction.

The one on top appeared to wobble slightly, I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, so I stared a little longer, the second object wobbled too. I went out to the front of my house to get a better angle away from my citrus trees.  I had a clear line of sight from my driveway.  The objects now wobbled together and one circled around the other, stop, do it again, this went on for about 45 seconds, then both began climbing rapidly westward, the one on top first, followed almost immediately by the other. At times when the two were briefly very close to each other, they seemed to form an upside down V shape, (but the haze was constantly changing shape as the objects moved,so the V shape might just be a subcouncious fabrication) There were starlike objects moving randomly within the balls of haze, at least two or three within each one. As they traveled upwards they got smaller, they circled around each other, clockwise and counterclockwise, stop, wobble and travel together again. I screamed/called my neighbor to grab his eyeglasses and come outside and tell me I wasn&apos;t imagining the whole thing. By the time he came out the objects were at about 80 degrees in the sky and much smaller, he confirmed two of them, the mist/haze appearance and the odd wobbling and circling behavior, as well as the rate of speed, we stood there for about 5 minutes until he couldn&apos;t see them anymore.

Then it dimmed out as if a gas or &quot;jet burner&quot; had went out. It was about 2 or so times the brightest object in the sky, which was Mars. I had not planned to report this again until an experience tonight. I walked to the Post Office to drop a letter off. A man was in an empty parking lot with a Meade &quot;Telescope&quot;. He was charging $2.00 to look at the moon. I paid him and had a look at the cratered moon. I then asked him if he had ever saw anything unusual like a ufo. He said that he never had. But a man who was standing there and had looked before me, said that he had. He then confirmed what I had saw in the night sky over Wilmington. That is what prompted me to write again. Also I am wondering at the odds of me waking up in the middle of the night by my dog on 2 straight nights, and seeing these lights which quickly disapeared? I have looked every night since when I go out with the dog, but have seen nothing.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the bright light in the southeast sky may have been the planet, Mars, but Mars should not move suddenly.  That part of the sighting may have been a perceptual issue.

Myself and my younger brother were driving to the local movie rental store, we live in a pretty rural area so there werent that many other cars on the road. i was driving ast a local highschool and on the opposite side of the school there is a field. a very bright white light caught my eye, and i wasnt sure what it was i had never seen a light there before. i thought that maybe there was a stadium light in the field, because thats how bright it was. then it began t move, so naturally i figured it was a plane. then my younger brother said , wow thats a weird looking plane. i turned and looked agian and there were more than grren and red lights, like on a plane, and  te closer i looked at it , the les it was shaped like a plane, but more cigar shaped, and there was a very brightwhite light and a purple glow like i had never seen before. so naturaly i picked up my cell phone to call my mom to tell her what we had just seen, but my cell hone had no service. i drive on that road every day, i have never had recepetion problems on that road before.and thats my story", "silver cylinder shaped object that appeared and then vanishedWe were on the golf course and seen a cylinder or oblong silver object in the sky.  We couldn&apos;t hear a noise and there were no lights and it just seemed to be hanging there and then it just vanished.

I WAS FACING E/SE WHEN I FIRST NOTICED A FLASH TO THE NE OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE. SEEING AS WE ARE CLOSE TO SKY HARBOR AIRPORT IN PHOENIX, I EXPECTED A PLANE AND REALLY THOUGHT NOTHING OF IT. 30 SECONDS LATER ANOTHER FLASH IN THE CORNER OF MY EYE. I TURNED TO FACE THE DIRECTION OF THE FLASH, E/NE AND WAITED. SURE ENOUGH, ABOUT 30 SECONDS LATER, ANOTHER FLASH. I POINTED THE AREA OUT TO MY AMIGOS AND WE WAITED. 30 SECONDS, ANOTHER FLASH. MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS TUMBLING SPACE DEBRIS WHICH CAN COMMONLY PRODUCE FLASHES AS IT TUMBLES IN ORBIT AND REFLECTS SUNLIGHT. THE ODD THING ABOUT THIS WAS IT WASN&apos;T MOVING. I&apos;VE SEEN MANY, MANY SATELLITES IN MY DAY, SOME FLASHING AND SOME LIKE A MOVING STAR BUT THEY ALL HAD A DISCERNIBLE MOVEMENT. THIS OBJECT STAYED IN THE SAME EXACT SPOT AS WHEN I FIRST SAW IT FOR A GOOD 13/14  MINUTES. NO HIGHER OR LOWER IN THE SKY AND FLASHING WITH A BRIGHTNESS LIKE THAT OF MARS, VERY BRIGHT, MUCH BRIGHTER THAN ANY STARS IN THE SKY. I RAN INSIDE TO GET BINOCULARS, ASKING MY FRIENDS TO PLEASE KEEP WATCH OF THE AREA. AS I RETURNED THEY HAD BEEN TIMING THE FLASHES AND THEY WERE BETWEEN 27-30 SECONDS WITH NO CHANGE IN LUSTER. INTERESTINGLY WHEN I PUT THE BINOCULARS ON IT, I COULD QUITE EASILY SEE THE FLASH BUT THERE WAS NOTHING THERE AFTER THE FLASH, NO MOVING OBJECT, NO DISTANT SMALL PLANE, NOTHING. BY THIS TIME I&apos;DE SAY 12-14 MINUTES HAD PASSED WITH THIS FLASHING LIGHT REMAINING FIXED IN THE SKY WITH THE SAME APPARENT BRIGHTNESS. THE 3 WITNESSES HAVE ALL SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME OUTDOORS, MY BROTHER IS A GUIDE ON THE COLORADO RIVER IN THE GRAND CANYON, SO WE HAVE SEEN MANY OF THE MISIDENTIFIED UFO&apos;S COMMONLY REPORTED, SATELLITES, METEORS, ODD ATMOSPHERIC PHENOMENA, THIS THING MATCHED NOTHING I HAVE SEEN BEFORE. I WOULD SAY THE LAST 60-90 SECONDS WERE VERY STRANGE. THE OBJECT STILL WAS FLASHING ON 30 SECOND CYCLES BUT IN THE LAST MINUTE AS IT FLASHED IT WAS GETTING LOWER AND LOWER! IN THE SKY, STILL VERY BRIGHT BUT OBVIOUSLY COMING DOWN(or moving away). THE LAST 2 FLASHES GOT VERY DIM, THE LAST BEING BARELY VISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE, AS MY BROTHER STATED TO ME. THROUGH MY BINOCULARS IT SEEMED TO GET RED, THEN REDDISH BLUE AND STOPPED FLASHING. WE STAYED OUTSIDE FOR 20 MORE MINUTES AND IT DIDN&apos;T APPEAR AGAIN. I SUPPOSE IT COULD BE A SATELLITE MOVING FROM SW TO NE AND SEEING AS IT WAS FLYING AT A CERTAIN ANGLE TO US ON THE GROUND, IT COULD ACCOUNT FOR A BIT OF MOVEMENT DISTORTION(like a plane coming straight towards you from a distance). HOWEVER I DOUBT 10+ MINUTES COULD PASS WITH NO APPARENT MOVEMENT, EVEN A SATELLITE SHOULD BE SEEN TO MOVE A BIT THROUGH THE SKY IN THIS AMOUNT OF TIME. IT WAS DEFINITELY ODD AND I&apos;D LOVE TO HEAR FROM ANYONE WHO HAS SEEN A SIMILAR OBJECT OR WHO MAY HAVE AN EXPLANATION FOR IT&apos;S LACK OF MOVEMENT. TO US, IT REMAINS UNKNOWN....&hellip;((NUFORC Note:  This is one of several similar reports NUFORC has received during July and August 2003 of tiny, long-duration, blinking lights, allegedly witnessed in the night sky by seemingly credible witnesses.

I looked out the window and I saw a bright blinking light, with 2 other lights below in the shape of a triangle off in the distance. The 2 lights below were not blinking, only the top one. I did&apos;nt think anything of it at first, until I saw it move. As I was watching it, the light would blink, then almost instantly, blink again in another spot in the sky. It&apos;s movements were sort of erratic, almost in the same sort of way an eye ball will move while looking at differant thing throughout a room. We live near a millitary base and I just figured it was something they were testing, and I just forgot about it, until I read a report on this site.  That is what I remember, but just for clearity, my brother would like to submit the way he remembers it too.   I was lying awake in my bed looking out of my window because I couldnt sleep when I saw what at first looked like an airplane with its landing lights on it didnt seem strange to me at all untill I noticed that there was no sound coming from this &quot;plane&quot;  by this time my curiousity peaked and i opend my window in the expectation that i would hear jet engins roaring however when i did all i heard were the sounds of a breez blowing through the trees in our back yard suddenly the light was gone and when it next apeared it was about three hundred feet from my back yard and about 100 feet above the ground. it came up to my house and pased over, it couldn&apos;t have been any more that 60 or 70 feet over the roof top as i saw it pass by it flashed a beem onto the house and the surounding area i followed it as best i could i went to my brothers room to see it(his room is directly across from mine)i stood at his window waiting to see what would happen but it just sat there no sound no movment so i thought quickly and woke my brother as to make sure i had a witness and that i wanst dreaming or crazy. and thats where my brothers story picks up.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We, my wife and I both pyschologically prepared ourselves to what we expected to be a loud explosion as it disappeared in the mountain range to the east of the interstate, but there was no impact. The interstate was pretty  busy and no one could have missed this display. Funny it hasn&apos;t been previously reported.

I noticed a bright light in the sky almost directly over head.  It seemed to be moving in an erratic pattern, sometimes drifting in a circular fashion and other times it would jump from one place to another.  The light changed color several times and at one point looked as though it split in two.  Also, at one point we all observed a bright green flash next to but not coming directly from the light.

I did not see them coming from down the beach, they were just &quot;there&quot;.  They did not appear to be high in the sky, but only slightly higher than my balcony which was on the 5th floor.  They were moving very quickly and with absolutely no sound.  They were in a V formation and in perfect unison.  It was very quick but I jumped up to watch as long as possible but they disappeared shortly past me, into what appeared to be a haze, though it was a clear night as I could see the stars in the sky clearly.  What confused me was that I had the feeling that I was focusing on something just out from me, and not far away, or &quot;in the sky&quot;.  Though, the fact that it was only lights, with a bit of a halo or hazy appearance and no sound, makes me believe they had to be far away.  I had been looking at the stars, a couple of planes high in the sky, the surf breaking on the beach, and lighted boats far out in the water......so my focus on these lights seemed close at hand.  If they were close the speed would make sense though the lack of sound, doesn&apos;t. If they were far away, the speed presents a troubling factor.

We had gone outside of the tent and sat down to stare at the stars and the mountain, it was approximately 23:30.  Then all of a sudden we saw a very bright light that started out small and just got bigger, the light lasted for about 8 seconds.  It was above the horizon and was due west from where we were camping.  It was so bright that my friend saw it because it was reflecting off of my face.  The thing about the light was that it was a very clean, white almost clear light, and was amazingly bright.  Since the moon had not risen yet it was very dark, this light illuminated the ground and lasted for 8 seconds.  Right before the light vanished it moved up slightly and disappeared.  About 10 minutes after that we saw two more lights that were under the horizon also due west of our position, they looked to be a little ways out from the base of the Tetons.  They were small but bright and were moving rapidly from south to north.  Then all of a sudden the lights started to move towards us from west to east, they were moving very rapidly then disappeared.  About 2 minutes later we saw them again moving south to north, then again they turned and came straight at us again.  By this time the lights had made it to the base of the hill that we were staying on.  The lights vanished again for another 2 minutes then reappeared.  They were hovering and moving in a figure 8 type movement, just back and forth behind the trees.  They vanished again for another 2 minutes and then reapeared.  Altogether we saw these two smaller lights 4 times.  It was very strange and somewhat scarry.  When they got closer our skin was crawling, it was like we could feel the presence of another being.  After the 4th time we saw these lights I just couldn&apos;t take it anymore and got inside the tent, I was to scarred to stay outside.  Just for your information there was an Indian gathering down the hill from us, it was a big pow wow that this tribe p! uts on every year.  the Indians were camping to the south of us about .5 miles away.  We do have 3 other witnesses for the first big bright light, but no other witnesses other than my friend and I on the two smaller lights.  If you need any more information or need me to be more specific in any way please let me know.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length, and we found him to be quite logical about his sighting, and very credible.  The first light the witness observed was not the ISS or the flare from an Iridium satellite.  The latter would not illuminate the ground noticably, and it would not illuminate the face of the witness, such that another person could detect the illumination on the observer&apos;s face, as apparently happened in this case.  The lights seen later could not have been satellites, if they were below the observer&apos;s (effective) horizon.  In addition, aircraft generally are not allowed to fly over national parks.

We had just passed the Nebraska/Kansas line and were a mile or two north of Marysville Kansas. (1/2 mile north of a railroad crossing). I was driving the car and everyone was awake. My wife was in the front passenger seat. My three kids were in the back seat. One of my kids said, &quot;What is that?&quot; I had seen the object but it had not registered in my mind as anything but an airport beacon. Every one in the car became aware of the object and saw it pass the car. The first thing we saw was a very bright blue/white flash south south east of the car (We were traveling south at about 65 miles per hour). In an incomprehensibly short amount of time (1-3 seconds, I would lean toward 1 second) it passed the car flashing 3-4 times. The object disapeared north north east of the car behind us. The first flash seemed to be the brightest and the last the dimmest. I had to snap my head over my left shoulder to see the 3rd of the 3 flashes that I saw. I thought it was an airport beacon but I realized that it passed way too fast for it to be a stationary object. We watched road reflectors pass the car and estimated that the object passed the car at least 5 times as fast as one of those and they are only on the edge of the road. This happened so fast that we could not tell how far away the object was. It was above the horizon but when we went back through the same area a week later we figured it must have been just above the tree line (perhaps 35-40 degrees above level ground). This still does not indicate the actual distance to the object. It has occured to me that the object could be one of those lights associated with earthquake activety but beyond that it was quite beyond my explaination. Fort Riley is just south of Marysville but a military aircraft would have had to be very close to pass us that fast and we did not hear anything. I am a teacher and I practice guarded skepticism abo! ut this matter.((NUFORC Note:  It is interesting to compare this report with that from", "They were in a straight line with blinking lightsThe sky background was full of stars.

They all had red, yellow, green and white flasing lights - all flashing at the same time and when I first saw it the way it was in the sky looked as if the lights aluminated the objects and it looked as if a silver line was connecting them.  It was the odest thing I have ever seen.  No airplanes fly in exact distance of formation like that.  We ran back through the foyer into the den and out the back door in seconds to see it from the back yard and it was nowhere to be seen in the sky.

PD))While walking at night, I saw an object with rod-like extensions and colored lights move directly across my path in front of me.I was walking down my small rural subdivision street in Brighton, Michigan with a neighbor at about 11:00 p.m. on a mid-summer night about nineteen years ago.  We were on our way to my house.  We were alone.  The weather was very calm and still.  There were no clouds in the sky.  I do not remember if wether or not the moon was up that night.  If it was up at that time, it was behind us and not very bright.  The night was very quiet, dark and filled with stars as there were no nearby city lights.  My neighbor was on my left side as we were walking down my subdivision street.  The street is straight and runs north (the direction we were walking)and south.  On the west side of the street is an open field and on the east side is thick woods with houses set back off the street about 150 feet into the woods.  While walking down this street (heading north), we both saw (at about the 10 o&apos;clock position) an object moving low in the sky over the open field.  It moved in a straight and horizontal path at a constant speed.  It was moving from the west to the east.  It&apos;s movement was exactly perpindicular to our path.  It did not rotate during our view of it.  It was approximately 50 yards from us as it passed over the street directly in front of us.  There was no sound at all!  There was no sound prior to seeing it, and no sound while we were witnessing it.  When it passed over the street it disappeared from our view as it moved just above the tree tops on the east side of the street.  From the time we first saw it to the time it disappeared from our view was about five or six seconds.  The body of the object was dark and generally round.  I could see the silhouette of it with the night sky behind it.  It&apos;s height was about the same as it&apos;s length.  It&apos;s body was about the size of four full moons as seen from our distance from it.  There were a lot of rod-like extensions protruding straight out of the body in all directions.  The extensions were also dark, just as the body of the object was.  The extensions varied a little in length, from about half the diameter of the body of the object to about the full diameter of the body.  I did not see a pattern to the extensions with regard to each one&apos;s length with respect to where it was protruding out of the body of the object.  However, the extensions appeared to be evenly spaced from each other where they protruded from the body.  From the one side of the object that was in view (because it did not rotate), I saw approximately twenty of these extensions evenly spaced around the entire body of the object.  At the very end of each extension was a single light.  The color of these lights were red, blue, green, yellow, and white.  None of the lights were blinking or changing colors or fading out.  All of the lights were steadily on.  When it disappeared from our view we stopped walking.  We stood there stared at where it disappeared over the tree tops in front of us and listened.  There was no noise and the air was still.  Then my neighbor said, &quot;What was that?&quot;  I said, &quot;I don&apos;t know.&quot;  We continued walking north towards my driveway.  We reached my driveway about two minutes later and turned to walk down it.  My driveway is straight and runs east off of the street with woods on both sides of it.  My house sits about 150 feet down the driveway on the south side.  The driveway continues past my house as a firetrail which deadends about 500 feet further back into the woods.  We had not taken ten steps yet on my driveway walking east when we saw the same object again.  It came into our view in front of us out of the north and was moving to the south.  It moved straight and perpindicular to our path just above the tree tops with a constant speed and horizontal movement, just as we saw it moving two minutes earlier.  The object passed in front of us at the same distance from us as before-about 50 yards.  Again, there was no sound at all.  The object disappeared from our view when it passed just above the tree tops on the south side of the driveway.  I immediate! ly felt as though this object was tracking us.  The speed at which the object was moving when we first saw it from the street did not allow for the time it took us to walk the rest of the distance to the driveway and see it again two minutes later in the same manner and at the same distance in front of us.  The disturbing feeling that we both felt as soon as we saw it the second time was that the object stopped and waited just out of our view from the street until we reached my driveway two minutes later.  That was about nineteen years ago and the two of us have not seen this object a third time.  I am reporting this today because of the recent reporting of the Howell Township, Michigan crop circles.  Howell is now my home town.  I read the local papers about these crop circles.  One article mentioned that there have been several hundred reportings of UFO sightings in the Howell and Brighton area dating from just this month to several decades ago.  I have never visited this web sight before today, but I felt that with all of these reportings in Livingston County, Michigan, I should report what I witnessed in case anyone that reads this may have seen what I saw nineteen years ago and would like to report their witnessing of this object.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

They moved due west very quickly, then he saw them change direction and head back due east. After passing to the east of the point where he first observed them, they headed toward the north. The lights stayed the same distance apart the whole time. Their speed was what caught his eye. The total sighting was less than a minute, about 17-20 seconds.

At the time the camera was set on a fixed tripod on telescopic, &quot;super night vision&quot; mode, and background stars can be seen accompanying Mars&apos;s progress across the night sky, while the point of light traveled in the opposite direction!

We are responding to an article that we read in the Bulletin covering a white light and the possible link to UFO&apos;s. We just wanted to bring to &quot;light&quot; something that we saw now that this article has been written. A few months back, we are &quot;best guessing&quot; in May, We were both laying in bed, and we both awoke about 3:00 a.m. to a bright yet soft orange/amber light shining in our bedroom window. While it filled the entire side of windows (bedroom and back door) we felt it odd and yet not concerning enough to get up from bed to investigate the light. Neither of us heard anything but were both awaked by the light. We furthermore didn&apos;t even discuss it until the next morning when one of us asked the other if they had seen it. To our amazement we had both not only seen it, but didn&apos;t say anything at the time thinking the other was  asleep. the next morning we joked about the possibility of the light being from a UFO as we tried to come up with ANY possible occurrences to account for how the light not only filled the windows but from where it appeared to originate, which was to the right side of the house and up. The light seemed as strong as a searchlight and yet as I said soft in color. No other noise was heard at the time and we BOTH saw the light and didn&apos;t mention it to the other until the next day. As best as we can recall, we are thinking the event happened either somewhere during the weekend of 5/2-5/11 or the weekend of 5/16-5/25. Neither of us have ever made any reports of this nature and it is only because of the article that we do now. We are interested to know if you have had any other reports of this nature during the May timeframe. We did ask our neighbor the following day if she had seen the light as we were new to this area. She had indicated she didn&apos;t because her bedroom did not face the same direction. We being new to the area didn&apos;t make any further note as we just didn&apos;t know what it could have been. Thank you for listing to us and we are actually quite interested in finding out if there ha! ve been any other reports of like type. Sincerely,  Thank you to the witness for the report.

I was camping of sorts on my balcony do to relitives visiting. While I was looking at the moon I saw a very large object. I just saw the bottom at first as it passed over the apartment building I was living in. I didn&apos;t know what I was looking at. The first thing I thought as I started to see more and more of the bottom of the craft, is that it was a blimp (having never seen a blimp). I noticed no sound because I could still hear crickets and palmento bugs cherping. The wasn&apos;t but maybe 100 feet off the top of the building. Once I saw the entire bottom of the craft it was huge. A massive rectangle in shape, I would say the size of a football field. That is 50 yards in width and 100 yards in length. It was close enough to see that the craft was made of what appeared to be metal. It had semetrical design that&apos;s to say I could see long flat &quot;beams&quot; (like I beams used in construction) they kind of criscrossed over the objects&apos; undersurface meeting in a triangel pattern. In each triangle had it&apos;s own semitery a circular indentation and a receded light that was not very visible a sort of green in color. As it passed completely overhead and I could see the end of the object I was looking for the balloon part of the blimp and it wasn&apos;t there, it wasn&apos;t until that moment that I realized it wasn&apos;t a blimp. The object was thin at Max. 4 feet in depth. That was when I ran inside screaming there is a UFO outside! I was met with &quot;ya right&quot;. By the time I got someone to come outside with me it had moved off so all me and my cousen could see the rear edge of the craft. She said &quot;where is the UFO&quot; I said &quot;it&apos;s right there&quot; (pointing at the object as it was moving away) And she said &quot;no it&apos;s not&quot; I replied &quot;Do you see something right there?&quot; she says &quot;ya&quot; I replied &quot;That is a UFO&quot;((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

For a moment we got quiet and I noticed my husband was in sort of a gaze.  The next second he said he had just seen a UFO.  I was critical and asked him what exactly he meant by that remark.  He had said he saw a light the size of a softball about hundred feet over the top of the neighbors house, hovering.  He then said it came towards our house in (specifically near our daughters deck which is on the third floor), stopped and then shot up in the sky and disappeared.  I asked him why he didn&apos;t say anything at the time and he replied because it was so beautiful he couldn&apos;t say anything. Earlier in the week, we were driving down the street we live on and he said I nearly ran over a deep purple light hovering on the road in front of us.

In her words it looked like a semi-circle of lights with beams or legs of white light, there was an egg shape obove the lights that was unlit but could be seen in the reflection of the semicircle of light. She observed this shape for approx. ten minutes, the shape then changed to a red egg or capsule of light, it then changed to a verticle column of golden light which she described as looking like a golden chain bracelet, it then changed  back to a red capsule or egg shaped light, she then went to sleep so did not see it leave, I am sending along a sketch that she drew the next morning, she drew it to approximate scale of what she saw", "Green sphere seen make a V path in front of our car in Northern Maine.We were driving up route 1 in Northern Maine around 10pm the week of Aug 7, 2003. We had to go to the bathroom and since there were no stores in that area we pulled over at a gravel pit. My husband, myself and my friend all went to the bathroom. We admired the stars since they were all so bright. I notice one that seemed to float downward but barely look like it was moving. My friend and I both saw it and thought it looked strange. Definitely not a plane or satellite since it was not moving much- but it did seem to move a little. We were a little freaked out. My husband did not see what we were looking at. We got back in the car and within 5 minutes my husband and I saw a green ball of light just above the phone lines in front of us. It looked like maybe the size of a basketball and was not really bright nor was it dim. It went down and then stopped and went up in a V shaped path. at the top of the V it vanished. We both agreed upon what we saw. We are both science teachers and could not come up with an explanation. It couldn&apos;t have been a meteor since it reversed direction and went up! My friend did not see it from the back seat since it was in front and above the car.", "Black rectangular observed around the Moon.Although I have always enjoyed looking up into the night sky I&apos;ve never seen anything that I would characterize as strange. Anything that looked unusual I was quite sceptical about and always looked for an earthly explanation. One occurrence although I was not able to explain away so easily. It happened while some friends and I were camping at Restoule Provincial Park in July of 2002. The time would have been about 11:00P.M or so. Five of us were at the waters edge shooting the breeze when one of us noticed something near the moon. As we all glanced up we noticed a black rectangular shaped object in close proximity to the moon. It moved from the top left down and seemed to be in an orbit around the moon. As it descended in a circular motion around the moon it slowly reached the bottom portion and than drifted further off to the left and gradually disappeared. Strangely enough, this object actually appeared to be the same distance as the moon which would mean it had to be of incredible proportion. I cannot obviously confirm this though. The whole incident took place over a matter of 5  minutes or so as we were all able to comment on it several times. The size of the object in proportion to the moon would have been about 1/5 its radius. What it was I have no idea but we all have talked about it since. It never unnerved us at the time, it was simply a curiosity. Witnesses personal information deleted by HBCC UFO)  Thank you to the witness for the report.

I was watching the northern sky when at about 11:30 pm, I noticed a fall of &quot;stars&quot; rapidly &quot;dropping down&quot; from above in the northern sky. I realized quickly that they were not stars but extremely fast moving lights. My friend then saw them: Four bright lights flying in formation, a straight line. They flew overhead very fast still flying in formation. They were much lower than a normal jet would fly and there was literally no sound. My friend and I jumped out of our chairs and looked up as they flew overhead. We turned around and watched them go South. This took maybe 5 or six seconds and they were out of site that fast. We were both quite rattled. My friend is a former scientist, having been in a UW masters program for chemistry, studying rocket science in a NASA program. I have no science background. We both agreed that this was unusual and couldn&apos;t find a logical explaination for what happened.", "saucer shape, no lights, no wings, extreme speedScroll down to the 4th sighting diagram in your past case history on this web sight. I saw that thing today against a clear blue afternoon sky. Oddly, the only difference is that what I saw was much larger- half the size or less of a 737 jet and the body of the craft was white, not silver as depicted on the website, with a silver area/stripe down the centerline. It accelerated from a speed of about 125-150 mph to several hundred mph horizontally at an altitude of about 2500-3000 ft in less than 1-2 seconds. It did not make a sound. I expected a sonic boom. It was not shiny, had no wings, tail rudder or lights. I realize that my description - white craft with grey/silver centerline pretty much describes an airplane. That&apos;s why I did a double take after first seeing it. The color scheme seemed airplane enough...but then the shape of it, the lack of noise/exhaust/contrail/lights and it&apos;s speed and sudden acceleration made me do a double take. I&apos;ve never heard of white being a stealth color either. The sun was at my back and I could see this thing clearly for at least 3-4 seconds before it rocketed out of sight. It was no airplane, chunk of space debris or naturally occurring astronomical phenomena. It maintained level flight at a very high rate of speed and fairly low altitude before I lost sight of it. I had company with me. Unfortunately, they faced the other direction and could only attest to the look on my face in response to seeing this thing.", "it was just therei had got up i could not sleep so i went out side to smoke and my dog had jumped the fince and i sat down with him and i was looking up at frist i though i was seeing things then i new that i was notit was a blue colored thing in the sky just over the bay from were i live i got up and walked to the back yard to get a beter look me dog had come with me it was just satting there no noise or any thing it was odd then me dog touched me andi looked down it him and when i looked up it was gone", "I saw a light in the sky that at first acted like a satelite, and then it  did not act like a satelite or anything else I&apos;ve ever seen!I went outside, to see if I could see any meteors, as it was around that day when we were supposed to be able to see the meteor showers.Looking up in the sky, towards the east, up , way way up in the sky, I noticed a light moving across the sky. At first I thought it was a satelite, but then it suddenly changed direction, and started heading northeast, moving at a very very fast speed, and there were no flashing lights to be seen like on an airplane.It &quot;zipped&quot; even faster, and completely disappeared.  I stood there and wondered what the heck I had just seen. When I came back inside I spoke with my aunt on the phone and described what I had seen. She laughed and told me I had just seen my first UFO.  I about fell out of my seat, and sought a place to report it, just in case that was what it really was.", "UFO over Randolph Air Force BaseI was working on the south aircraft ramp on Randolph AFB at approx. 00:30 after the 4th of July celebration when something caught my eye. I was in a truck and another guy was loading sand bags onto the back. I looked up and saw an object moving through the base of the clouds from southwest to the northeast at a very slow speed, about 1000 yards from me. At first I thought it was a lower cloud drifting along in the wind, then I thought it might be lights from an airplane reflecting in the clouds. But the more I looked at it the more detail I started to see. It was a saucer shape and appeared to be a dull grey color. It reflected the flightline light barely. It did not have any lights or windows or anything, just a smooth surface. I was looking at the side of the object since it was flying only about 100 ft over the tops of the trees. It was about as wide as a bus is long. It moved very slow with no noise to the northeast and then just dissapeared in the clouds over the East Runway. After the guy who was loading sandbags was done he asked me what I was looking at and I said I think I saw a UFO. There was about 75 people out cleaning up at this time. I didnt ask anyone if they had seen it as well.((NUFORC Note:  One of several seemingly credible reports from the same individual, who describes himself as being a member of the U. S. Military.

As i looked to the western night sky, i observed what at first thought to be a plane moving east to west, at incredable speed. My friend came outside, and i called him over to look, and then i noticed three more craft slightly south of the first object, all traveling in the same direction. The three that were together were in a triangle formation. All of the objects were as bright as a star, moving at least three times the speed of a normal jet aircraft. It took only about 30 seconds before the dissappeared on the horizen to the west.", "Circular object with v-shaped notch, hovering in daylightThe object was hovering over the Orinda BART station,  much like a hawk using thermals to stay aloft.  It was round and flat with a v-shaped notch at one point on the circumference.  The bottom was black and the top (which was exposed as it turned slowly like a plate balanced on a stick) reflected the sun with a bright metallic sheen.  As I watched, it slowly moved higher and farther away towards the southeast.  It seemed to be no more than 1 or 2 feet in diameter.((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS))Dear Mr. Davenport:I&apos;m sorry to say that I&apos;m the only witness I&apos;m aware of.  I was watching the object from the side of Camino Pablo (the road which runs under the BART station) about 1500 feet from the station.  While I gave some thought to stopping a car driving by and asking them to take a look, I did not do so, since they were going about 45 mph.  Unfortunately, at 11 AM there aren&apos;t many people waiting on the BART platform, and I think that the overhang might have shielded them from seeing the object.Next time (assuming it isn&apos;t 48 more years until I see one again) I will definitely bring my digital camera !((name deleted)) ((END))((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes self as having considerable technical background.", "@ large greenish/yellow lights seen hovering in a strange cloud lit up with pink/purple electrical charge from my airplane windowOn my flight home from FL to IN, within 30 mins. into the flight I had been looking out my window at the ground below and, as we ascended, the clouds beside &amp; below me.  I noticed a very large strangely beautiful cloud that was different from the others because it was lit up with what I perceived as a lot of electrical charge.  It was full of pinkish/purplish bursts of light at it&apos;s very center.  The outside edges of the cloud were so well defined against the dusky background of sky.  I was staring at this light show when I suddenly noticed a bolt of lightning come down out of the bottom of the cloud and strike dramatically towards the earth.  The cloud was almost perfectly parallel to my line of vision.  That is to say, it was directly outside my window at the same elevation as my seat on the plane.  I would estimate the cloud was approximately 500-800 feet away from the plane &amp; I could see above and below the silhouette of the cloud.  It was just after the lightning bolt struck that I noticed that inside the cloud, but at it&apos;s very edge nearest to me, I saw two perfectly round greenish/yellow lights hovering at the very outside edge of the cloud, with just a bit of mist or fog diffusing the lights slightly.(still bright, easily defined round shape)  The 2 round lights were approx. 1-2 ft in diameter and maybe 6-8 ft apart.  They reminded me of 2 green &quot;GO&quot; lights like you would find on a stoplight, only they were side by side &amp; perfectly motionless. I didn&apos;t think they looked like lights from a plane(too lrg) but if they were, I reasoned that they should be moving through the cloud.  I also could&apos;t imagine any aerial machine entering such a spectacularly electric-charged cloud.  It was alone, by itself, so I thought a plane would not be forced to fly THROUGH it.  I never thought it was a plane anyway.  I was in the 32nd row with my young child on my lap so I could see our right wing lit up outside our window in front of me.  It was nothing like those lights.  Our light was small, white! and sort of standing vertically &amp; blinking. My initial reaction was that it was some sort of hovercraft.(although I have never seen a hovercraft)  For an analogy, it reminded me of two greenish yellow eyes staring out from the very edge of the cloud.  They never moved their position within the cloud.  If the cloud moved, which it appeared it did not, then they moved with the cloud in the same position. I never witnessed a craft.  I never really thought to look for one at the time.  If there was one it would have had to be the &quot;front&quot; lights I observed with the bulk of the object hidden in the clouds behind them. Just a footnote, which will make this story sound even wackier...it probably has nothing to do w/this &quot;event&quot;, but while in a town north of me in IN I was with my mother previewing homes for my brother, whom is moving back to this area shortly. I own a real estate company. While traveling down a road towards our next home, a tornadic-like wind burst came out of nowhere and snapped a tree in half, which fell into the path of my van.  I was going approx 45-50 MPH and had I not swerved to get my vehicle off the road as I almost lost control in the grass alongside the road, we would have been crushed.  I have pictures I took at the scene which shows my van surrounded by the upper tree limbs, and across the front &amp; back of my van.  We were not injured.  The van had some damage.  I am glad I had my digital camera w/me...as I was taking interior photos of homes for my brother to see.  There is a Sheriff&apos;s report on this incident.  This story is not so strange, in and of itself, but when my mom called me later that night she said when she got home, which is 25 miles south of the accident site, and she was sitting on her back patio, she noticed that a tree she had  recently purchased by mail order(one of several)and had planted, that was no larger in diameter than your index finger had snapped in two at the center and was fallen over itself. The area had rain that day but no strong winds of any kind acco! rding to the officers at the scene of the accident, or as witnessed by my mother and myself, who had been out all morning/early afternoon.  Later, we also have discovered that both trees were poplars.(hers and the one that fell on us)  That happened 11 days before I saw the lights from my airplane.  If you cannot already tell, I am unnerved by the whole thing.  I am wondering where that burst of wind came from that snapped a 3 ft diameter tree in two as well as a pencil sized tree in half.(in two entirely different locations) Her rear yard is fenced and the gate is locked.  Her dog was inside until she went out back with him.

It could be an illusion of the mind or it could be our reality . Who knows . The unsual part is when it would move , it went in a pyramid shape direction , so it was forming a triangle in the sky .

Someone looked up into the clear night sky and asked, &quot;What&apos;s that?&quot; Looking up, we saw a large very bright white light hovering motionless at a fairly high altitude. From each side protruded bright, stubby appendages of light that gave the appearence of wings, as in the classical Egyptian &quot;winged-disk&quot; symbol. We watched it for over 5 minutes, when suddenly it began to move. After travelling in a straight line, it abruptly began making a series of rapid acute-angle turns as if tracing out a complex geometrical pattern.

When one of them looked over towards where they spotted the star, it was moving very quickly in their direction. At this point of the sighting, both sat up and took notice and watched as this bright white light got bigger the closer it got to them. A guess by the witness would have placed the light/object approx: 1/4 mile away when it suddenly turned to the south and flew off at an incredible rate of speed. (HBCC UFO Note: When the light/object changed direction the color of it changed from bright white to a dull orange).The men said they may have watched it for approx: 45 seconds at the most. Now looking back at the event, they wishes they had of kept their eyes on it when it was first spotted. But then they did not think much of it at the time. No sound was heard, and like both of them said. If it had of been an aircraft they certainly would have heard it as it being so close, and so low. Thank you to the witnesses for the report.

Were stationary 2 just vanished 3rd remained moving slowly towards the southwitnessed 3 objects/looking towards south mountain. blue,red green lights. first thought they were airlplanes 2 just blinked out. 3rd remained. appeared to be moving towards tucson/They were not airplanes. They were stationary", "Use of Spot LightIt started the night before the event took place.  I lived on the lake Allatoona,  I was on my pontoon boat with my sister talking, a normal conversation,  when she stop and said you would not belive what I saw.  She said she saw a blue looking object fall out of the sky,  fairlly close to where we were.  I thought nothing of it,  passing it off as a shooting star.The next night me and five of my other buddies went out on the boat,  it was a very windy night on the water which is very rare most of the time it is dead calm.  We were just talking when,  we noticed something fall out of the sky, in the decribed area my sister clamed the night before.  Again I was passing it off as nothing,  but I had a spot light on the boat,  and for fun sake I got it out and shined it in the area where the object fell.  I was ha ha UFO yeah right, continuing to shine the spot light into the sky.  Then I noticed a very bright light comming closer to our location.  This skared the people I was with so I stated the boat and went down the lake alittle ways,  This object stayed above us.  Then another object appeared and went ahead of the other object.  Through out a duration of two hours we saw four or five unknown craft morfing colors from bright yellows to red colors.  I was loving it I was thinking to myself you will never see anything like this ever again conteinuing to shine the spotlight.  Then there was a thought to be a boat heading straight at us.  I turned on my lights and this object headed back into a cove, across from us.  I wanted to get the attention of it to see if they had a phone so we could call someone to get a vedieo camera or just talk to someone because we were electicfied.   So we went closes to this boat and call out to them but no answer.  So we went closer and called out but still no answer.  I thought this is odd.  So we went ever close and called out are you seeing what we are seeing, long pause Then the most earrie voice said &quot;What did you say you saw&quot; then silence.  So we go closer and as we get to the point where we can start to see the boat our boat is engoulfed in this extermly bright light.  While this light was shining on us I was looking for a back wave from the boat, because it was windy and wavy and when a boat bounce up and down in the water it will give a back wave,  but this boat have no back wave,  This did it for me it really scared! me.  I stated out the boat and got out of there.   On the other side of the lake I tied up our boat and went to the dock where this object was it was move back forth right to left, and looking like it was comming towards us.  so we ran throught the wood back towards the house,  as we start to get to the house the front porch light went out,  I thought this is it we are about to be obducted.  I bangged so loud on the front door my nabor called and thought I was knoking on her door.  I told my dad the whole story, and he wanted to go back down to the lake one of the guyes we were with refused to go back down her was teriffied.  We went back down and it was as calm as glass.  Whatever it was was gone.((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event is approximate.  PD))", "My wife looked out the window at around 11:30 PM. and saw a light in the distance to the west over Manhattan.  At first we thought it was a plane, but it was not. It hovered in the distance slightly  moving or shifting position.  It was not a helicopter either. It was just one light that seemed to spin or rotate while changing colors from white to blue and red, often changing shape as well.  Or pulsing, and blinking. Then we went outside to watch it and I measured it&apos;s shifting against the buildings.  We followed it further until about 1:45 AM, it was still hovering above the city but by now far in the distance.((NUFORC Note:  May have been a celestial body, perhaps Mars, in the western sky.  PD))", "Large falling object looked like a shooting star at first but too big to be just one that burned in the atomosphere.I noticed what appeared to be a falling star (meteor) in the sky to my west.  I was about 4 miles from the Gulf of Mexico in the center of Pinellas County.  I saw it fall at a high rate and slowing towards the ground.  It turned from a bright white color to a blue then greenish color before disappearing on the horizon.  I thought it was a meteor which landed in a sub-division about a 1/2 mile ahead since it was so large (as it appeared to the eye).  After driving in the subdivision for 10 minutes, I decided to call a friend who drives a taxi on the beach and see if he heard or saw anything.  Sure enough, he saw the same thing.  We were both kind of embarrased to call anyone since it would of course sound like we were on drugs or something so when I called him and told him that I saw something he would not believe, he told me what he saw... it was the same thing!  He was less than 1000&apos; from the gulf coastline and saw it over the water so I knew it was larger and landed or went much further west than I thought.  I met up with him and we went to a local pier (Reddington Pier) and asked the gentleman who was tending if he saw anything.  He told us he was fishing and saw the same exact thing and pointed to the general direction it went.  There were also 2 boats there and he said they were not there prior to the incident.  The boats had pretty bright lights on board and were at least a few miles out.  The gentleman had stated that he, like us, had lived in the area for his entire life and never saw anything like it.  I then got a call from a friend who was with me about an hour prior and told him what I was doing, and coincidentally he saw the exact same thing.  He was at least 7-10 miles northeast of my location when I saw the object.  There is no doubt in my mind something landed in the water or fell/flew very fast towards it.((NUFORC Note:  Follow-up correspondence from a person in Florida who read this report.  The follow-up report also appears in the NUFORC database for a date in June 1994.  PD)) ADDITION TO REPORT&quot;Addition to PINELLAS COUNTY report of same date&quot;  I just wanted to respond to the recent report of a green meteor-like display over the water in our area. No sir, you are not nuts, and I guess I&apos;m not either, should this be the only consideration. Aproximately 9 years ago, my wife and I were driving on Coquina Key  late at night when I saw, seemingly just beyond the skyway bridge, to the SW, a very bright green &quot;meteor&quot; head apparently into the gulf. I remember thinking it might be a flare, due to the odd colour and the startling brightness,... but I considered the speed, (meteoric), the size, even if it was nearer than I suspected which is unlikely, and concluded that it was indeed some extraordinary low atmosphere event. It happened so quickly that my wife missed it, much to my consternation.&quot;", "3 of us saw a copper disk w/ a black solid circle slowly moving in a small clockwise circle tipping on edge showing the top &amp; bottom.It was a clear morning.  In the northern sky, a copper disk with a black spot in the center covering about 1/2 the entire area on top.  It was disk shaped &amp; one end of the disk was about twice the diameter with a wedge cut out at the larger end.  The wedge appeared to be about 1/16th of the entire circumference.  It appeared to be about 3000 feet above sea level.  We needed binoculars to see them clearly.  At first there was only one.  The 2nd appeared &amp; about a minute later they both disappeared.  I only saw one, but one person saw two.  I only know that one was moving in a clockwise small circle &amp; was tipping up on end as it went in the circle. It tipped forward all the way &amp; then backward all of the way.  It did not turn upside down, but just showed the top &amp; bottom as it turned.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))", "We saw a cigar shaped object flying at the cloud level maintaing constant speed North to SouthHi,  We were walking our dog about 8:15PM and saw a cigar shaped object flying at the cloud level -- it went in and out of the clouds maintaing constant speed. It moved roughly from the North to the South. We saw it move for several minutes and it was clearly visible there were no wings or tail fins. It was about 20 times as long as it was wide. There was absoutlely no sound. Aircraft later at the same height we were able to hear. There were no trails or lights. The sun was glaring to setting so we had a good look.((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnesses might have observed a contrail behind a high-flying jet aircraft, although that is a guess.  It is not uncommon that aircraft at cruising altitude cannot be heard by witnesses on the ground, we observe.  PD))", "Four or five  yellow glowing balls of lightWhile locking our car for the night,around 10:40 p.m., in our hotel parking lot located along the beach, I happened to look up at the stars and noticed a red light moving quickly overhead, eastward,into the dark ocean sky. When, what I believed to be an airplane suddenly had four or five yellow glowing balls of light appear one at a time behind it, in a line. I told my wife to look, which she did. We both watched the balls of light seem to hang in the air and then disappear several seconds later. All I could think is they were signal flares,she was unsure. Before the balls of light had disappeared the red light had changed course and sped out of sight to the south at the same high rate of speed. There were other people walking along the beach and fishing on a public fishing pier nearby who must have seen the same thing.((NUFORC Note:  We observe that the report is not inconcistent with a military jet releasing flares of some variety, perhaps the type designed to confuse an infra-red- homing anti-aircraft missile.  However, it would be unusual for an aircraft to do that over a populated area, we believe, unless the flares were released accidently.

The light is in the same area as before also.  I walked over to my neighbors house and we all watched it with our binoculars for an hour or so.  This time we were able to see a red light that seemed to change positions around the light at times.  It would move slowly around in the same basic vicinity.  I don&apos;t know who to report this to so I decided to sign on again.Myself and my husband and two of our neighbors all saw it.  None of them belived it to be a satillite.It is also back tonight again a bright light same approximate time and area in the sky.  So we&apos;ve seen it three separate nights in the last week.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the sighting may have been caused by a celestial body, either a star or a planet.

Noticed a light at zenith travelling S-N at the same sort of speed / brightness as a satellite. After about 10 seconds it faded &amp; brightened, apparently on a slightly different heading.  Thought it was an optical illusion, but this happened again and again, with the object fading &amp; re-brightening, bearing about 5 degrees westwards.  When I finally lost sight of the object it was heading west. I looked up agsin, and almost immediately noticed another object which behaved in exactly the same way, gradually changing from a S-N direction to an E-W. In about 10 mins observation, also saw several objects which looked / behaved like satellites travelling S-N, and about 5 meteorites, which seems an unusual amount of ariel activity for such a short space of time.", "Unusual craft followed by a white ball of light.A fellow called tonight to report seeing a unusual craft followed by a white ball of light heading from the southwest to the northeast. This took place roughly 3 kilometers away from Thronhill, Terrace British Columbia. The sighting lasted for approx: 4 seconds before it disappeared. No description was given as to what the craft looked like as it all took place very quickly, but he did say in that short period of time he could certainly see some type of structure  and was followed by a bright white ball of light.

I watched until it sort of faded away", "Tight formation of metallic egg shaped craftsDriving North on Interstate 5 a bright light or reflection was noticed on the West side of the highway passing through the city of Oceanside. The exact location was about 1/4 mi. S. of CA 78 and 1 mile S. of Camp Pendelton. The light slowly cruised over the freeway at which time I noticed it was composed of 4 roughly faceted egg shaped objects in a very tight diamond formation. Immediately, I suspected a helicopter of some sort, since they often cruise the highway to observe traffic or Marine helicopters out and about. The configuration did not register as a helicopter or any other conventional aircraft. What was observed were the 4 egg shaped objects bobbing up and down with respect to each. The altitude was low, less than 1000 feet. This estimate was due to the fact of the clarity of the surfaces reflecting the sun and the object&apos;s sharp outline against the clear sky. They appeared to be strongly metallic colored ranging from gray to black to strong sun reflection. Each one was alternating in these colors and reflections on different parts which also supported my estimation this was not a single craft. I followed them as they crossed my field of view high in my windshield until lost from sight as they flew overhead. I didn&apos;t hear any typical aircraft sound. There were many cars around me as I stuck my hand out of the window and pointed up. Someone else must have seen it too. After a short time I decided to look into my rear view mirrors and I was then able to see them once again in the same tight formation on the West side of the freeway directly over the city of Oceanside. I am hoping others who had seen this will report it since it was so easily viewed. Perhaps there is a logical explanation since it was so close to a major Marine base.((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes self as having considerable technical background.

There was no sound, no jet stream, couldn&apos;t make out any wings and both pieces now moved at about the exact same speed apart in the sky.

I am hoping he will have some of the others telephone me and make a report. Hope this helps a little.Take careBrianEnderby, British Columbia (follow-up)Date:  July 25, 2003Time:  8:30 p.m.This is a follow-up to the Enderby, B.C. sighting which was reported to Mr. Peter Davenport at the NUFORC. I telephoned one of the witnesses who reported a sighting for July 25, 2003 to gather a little more information on what the witnesses saw at 8:30 p.m. at Gardom Lake. The story is actually rather interesting. The gentleman I talked with, told me his wife was the first to notice one large single object sitting stationary in the blue sky. She gave out a yell and pointed into the sky. This is when a total of 6 people saw the unusual object. But by the time everyone else was observing the it, it had already broke (separated) into two sections. Both section after the break up were the exact same size. (I asked if there was any type of explosion which may have caused the object to break into the two section, and the witness said no. The single object basically spit into two parts).After it broke up, the folks said the &quot;objects&quot; went in separate directions, one heading north and the other south. The fellow I chatted with said the craft was sitting at approx: 30,000 to 40,000 feet at his best guess. Also they noted after the craft separated, and holding their hand up to get a rough idea how close the two section were to one another at the height they were at, they guessed them to be approx: one inch a part. The witness also noted that the two parts did not pass one another (stayed close to one another), but did slowly drift a part going in different directions until they lost sight of them. He mentioned that it was like looking at the chrome bumper of a car with the sun reflecting off it. The brightness to the objects were extremely bright. There was no sound detected, no contrail from any of the them. He also gave a approx: size each of the objects may have been. He estimated they might have been 1/4 inch in length, this using your finger nail at arms length. (Note: If the estimated size is even close, the objects must have been enormous in size). The sighting lasted for approx: 4 to 5 minutes. I am still hoping the other witnesses will call. Also the witness said he would get a drawing of what they saw to me, and there exact location.((END))((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude for his conducting such a prompt and thorough follow-up investigation of this case.

Trained my binoculars on it to determine if it was an aircraft. Did not see any flashing lights indicative of such nor any structure such as wings. Continued watching it slowly rising (assumed it was nearing) straight up with naked eye until it vanished aprox. 30 degrees above horizon. I scanned the sky in the general vicinity with binoculars for a minute however did not see anything else (I tried to find a dark object association). The light was much larger than a star, maybe 2 times the size of Mars in comparison, perhaps by a factor of 3 or 4 when it vanished. This is the second time I&apos;ve noticed such a peculiar object within the last year in the same area of the sky (I can&apos;t remember if the last was as recent as this year or not). This is my umpteenth sighting of extraordinary objects over the past 2 1/2 years in this area. I&apos;ve had security guard training years ago that taught me much about awareness especially as it pertains to recounting details of situations such as being a witness to an event.

It became stationary again, and started flashing a red beam.  There didn&apos;t seem to be any pattern to the flashing - sometimes it would be a long beam, then off, then two short beams, something like that.  The craft stopped flashing, and flew away behind the mountain.  The entire event took place for about 10 minutes.

Knowing the location and the time of night we were probably the only people on the beach for many miles in either direction.  My friend and I were sitting on rocks smoking a cigar that lit up our position on the black stretch of beach, watching the sky, and talking.  No more than 5-10 minutes after we got to the beach did we start seeing stuff.It is probably important to mention when we pulled up to the parking lot behind the beach the radio station we were listening to, 93.1... a very large Southern California radio station with a powerfull signal located close to where I live and really never prone to static or disturbance, cut out completely making very strange non-static disturbance sounds that resembled strange and loud medium pitched humming for about 5 seconds two seperate times as we were driving through the parking lot.  The radio station hadnt cut out once the entire time until we got there and the extended and very strange sounding 5 second periods where the radio cut out COMPLETELY and abruptly stuck in my mind.Also I would like to mention less than 1 minute before we actually saw craft shooting across the sky something happened to me, physically. Im standing up enjoying the ambience of the waves and the night when I exhaled and attempted to inhale .. all of a sudden out of the blue I couldn&apos;t breath or inhale a single breath. It was like somebody disabled the use of my lungs or shrunk them to 1/10th the size for 5-6 seconds, a truly frightening and startling experience ive never had once in my life.  I have no asthma nor any in my family and I&apos;ve never had even the slightest shortness of breath or problem breathing, let alone the complete inablilty to expand my lungs and breath for atleast 5 seconds.  During the 5 seconds i just stood there trying very hard to breath thinking both my lungs have somehow collapsed and contemplating how long i should wait to tell my friends im sufficating.  I&apos;ve been reading alot of ufo reports since trying to find somebody else who had a similair experience and so far haven&apos;t found anything so I dont know if it really does have anything to do with what we saw but it&apos;s timing was VERY strange... not to mention I have never had anything REMOTELY like that happen once in my life.Less than a minute after i had my strange chest episode my friend and I both spotted the craft simultaneously as it streaked southward across the sky, stopped in front of us, and back.   It came in what seemed like 200-300 yards off the coastline at medium-low altitude from the North at speeds that made the fastest shooting stars we saw that night seemed half as slow.  It traversed half the sky in a small fraction of the second and stopped INSTANTLY directly in front of where were on the coast a few hundred yards out.  The most incredible thing to me was the speed, what seemed like 10,000mph... much faster than most video cameras would even be able capture.  It hung around for maybe a second then shot back North up the coast in what seemed like the exact trajectory it came in on, parrallel to the horizon, not to mention it accelerated instantly from where it had stopped and shot accross half the sky in a small fraction of a second.Over the next 15 minutes we see what we figure is the same craft making guest appearances in other parts of the sky North of us, where it first came from, flying horizontally here and there back and forth up the coast line to the right of us.  I might mention that the craft we saw had no lights on it and was black against the sky when it briefly stopped out in front of us and we would never have been able to point it out stopped in the sky if we hadn&apos;t seen its trajectory coming from the North. In fact aside from stopping out in front of us we only were able to see it when it shot across the sky at mindblowing speed and lit up.   The second it would stop the light around it would disapear and unless you had it outlined against a lighter part of the dark sky that night you never would of seen it stopped.  It seemed to move so incredibly fast it was making the air around it glow giving the entire object a dull glow slightly brighter than the stars around it and easy to spot if you&apos;re watching the sky the fraction of a second it takes for it to shoot across it.  We stuck around for about 30 minutes afterwards watching the sky and saw the craft two more times to the North of us light up as it shot around making brief one directional and less dramatic appearances.My radio was perfectly fine on the way home at about 4:35am and I haven&apos;t heard that kind of disturbance before or since.  When i am able to i am actually planning on going back to the beach with a friend and a camcorder in the early hours of the morning again to see if i can capture what we saw last time.", "Boomerang-shape, &quot;dividing&quot;? objects.At about 3pm in the afternoon of October 6th 1996, my friend and I were laying on the track at the field on 6th Street doing situps.  My friend noticed something way, way up in the sky as if it were a star.  The sky was clear blue with just a few fluffy-like clouds scattered.  When I squinted to look at what he was looking at, I noticed a dark, greyish-metallic looking object which looked about the size that a star would look like at night.  The object was stationary, it did not move.  As I focused on the object, all of the sudden it took off toward the south at a high speed and went out of my sight.  This object went from stationary to high speed movement in no time at all.  I yelled at my friend so he could see that it had taken off, and he claimed it hadn&apos;t because he was still focused on the object.  I lay back down next to him on the track and began focusing on yet another object of the same description.  It was just there in the sky not moving.  Aparently, this second object was the one he noticed first, and when I looked, my eyes caught sight of the one that was next to it and took off.  As we stared at the object, something incredible and inexplicable happend.  The object began to wobble as we focused more on the object, we could see it was a triangular-boomerang shape.  My friend who has better vision than I said it had a orange-like glow to it as well.  As the object wobbled, amazingly, another object just like it came forth from it as if it had divided itself into two.  I know it sounds crazy or made up, but I will swear under oath and take a lie detector test or whatever is necessary, that this is what we both saw.  Now, there were two objects side by side.  The object that came out of the other one moved east slightly, so now they were aligned side by side.  I cannot recall which of the two began wobbling now, I want to say it was the original one that spit the new one out because I recall the third object being directly above the original or &quot;mother&quot; object. In any case the! object began wobbling again and yet another one seemed to appear from the other. Now there were three, one above the original one and the other still aligned alongside the original one.  At once, all three formed a triangle and stood there for a few minutes in triangular formation.  After a few minutes, the top one moved slowly along side the others so that they were now on the same level side by side.  The two in front now began to move together slowly eastward and the original or &quot;mother one&quot; stood still.  As we watched, the original one began to move as well, the two moving ahead together, in the same eastward direction.  Then they all picked up speed and disappeared East. This incident has haunted me and my friend all these years.  I was tempted many times to report this to someone, but did not know where or who.  I have seen other unexplained objects in the sky, but this was the most remarkable.  If anyone else has seen something like this I would love to know.", "silver disk near Elmont Elementary School in 1977I did not know you could report things that happened a long time ago, but when I was 7 years old and attended Elmont Elementary School, in Virginia I saw a silver disk with red, orange, white, and I think green lights around the outside of it. Elmont is a rural area of Hanover County, Virginia, about 10 miles north of Richmond, Va. It was in 1977 and I lived about a quarter-mile from the school and was walking to get there early to do some activity in the school library before classes started. I was with my friend and we were in the second grade. We were walking along some pine trees on the side of the parking lot toward where the school office and cafeteria were. I looked up across the parking lot and saw a disk that was silver and glinting in the sun just over the top of some oak trees that were in a horse pasture across the other side of the parking lot, which is not very big. The lights around the side of the disk may have blinked or changed color but I&apos;m not sure. I just recall being in shock like I was rooted to the ground and we stopped walking and just stared.The degree of shock at seeing it was almost like an electrical shock and I was terrified. The disk made no noise whatsoever. It was just hovering in one spot. Then, and I don&apos;t remember how long it was exactly, it was just gone and nothing was over the trees anymore. We went in and later that day I told my second grade teacher who punished me for lying. I have never forgotten seeing that and I know I did not imagine it. I still wonder what in the world it was. My friend at first denied seeing it but when I asked her a few years later she said she remembered it too. I have a law degree from the University of Virginia and am not making this up.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "White light increased in size and brightness and then shot off into space.I am a former State Section Director for MUFON. On Saturday night, July 26th, at approximately 10:55 PM, I was sitting on the outdoor patio of the 4th floor of the Crescent Hotel. It was a beautiful, clear night and I was looking up at the stars. I noticed a barely discernible white light moving in a northwesterly direction at a speed and altitude that seemed consistent with commercial air traffic at cruising altitude (30,000 to 40,000 ft). The light was fairly close to being directly overhead, at about 85 degrees above the horizon. I watched this light fly a straight line course for about five to ten seconds when, to my surprise, it suddenly increased in size and brightness. It went from being a pinpoint of light to being about the size of a match head held at arm&apos;s length. It also went from being a very faint light to being the brightest thing in the sky. The light became so brilliant that it almost looked silvery. It reminded me of a brilliant diamond. At about this time the object slowed to almost a standstill and rapidly faded from view. The impression I got was that it had shot off into space at a steep angle and at a high rate of speed. This would account for its apparent decrease in forward motion and the rapidity at which it faded from view. The total duration of the sighting was about 15 seconds. I am very knowledgeable in regards to aviation and astronomy and can not think of any prosaic explanation that would account for this sighting.((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to this former SSD/MUFON for sharing the report with NUFORC.  We have checked www.heavens-above, and no Iridium satellites would have generated a reflection of sunlight that could have given rise to a sighting on this date at the time indicated.  Please see the following website for details: http://www.heavens-above.com/iridium.asp?lat=36.401&amp;lng=-93.738&amp;alt=366&amp;loc=Eureka+Springs&amp;TZ=CST&amp;Date=37827.0253333333&amp;Dur=2PD))", "Slow moving, flashing lightMy wife and I were on our back porch to try and see a meteor or two, and while we managed to catch a couple in the full moon, we also saw an odd light that I&apos;ve never seen before. The object was a single point of light that appeared as a very short flash that repeated at a very regular interval.  It appeared every 32 to 35 seconds. It was first noticed fairly high in the sky, and very slowly moved due East.  We are surrounded by trees, so we could not track it very far, but it took at least 30 minutes to move the short distance.  Through binoculars, it still did not have any specific shape and looked white to slightly yellow.  There were no clouds at the time.  As stated above, there was a full moon up, and we are less than 10 miles from Seattle, so there is a lot of light pollution. I&apos;ve seen plenty of satelites in the past, but this seemed quite different.  I&apos;m sure someone knows what it is, I&apos;m just dying to find out. Thanks((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length, and we found him to be quite credible.  PD))", "Light seen in sky.0521, 7/25/03, Witness in Collegeville, Upper Providence Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, reported seeing a bright red light in the northwestern sky about a 45 degree angle above the horizon.  The light moved very fast and stopped.   When the light stopped it and started flashing and other points of light originated form it and shot out from and then went back into it.  The light eventually got dim and it moved away out of sight.   Lasted for seven minutes.", "orangeish light pulsing west of hopkinsville, ky on I-24, then 10 miles down the road againI had just graduated high school and my family and i decided to drive to florida from illinois. while on interstate 24 west of hopkinsville, ky. i looked out the passenger window and noticed an orangeish light (the color of street lights usually on the highway) pulsing in the sky. it was about as high as an average radio tower. i leaned over to my mom who was driving and told her to look, she dismissed it as something out of the ordinary. the object hovered and pulsed for nearly 5 minutes and vanished. about 10 miles later down the intersate, it appeared again the same way is was before and in the same direction. it lasted about 10 minutes this time. my mom saw it before i did the second time and then we realized it was out of the ordinary being 10 miles from where we saw it the first time.", "Triangular white lights with smaller red and blue strobing lights near the white lights.Driving west on Sehmel Dr.N.W. and saw an object in the sky just above the tree line. Could not see a shape because it was too dark, but it had three bright lights in a triangular shape with red and green smaller strobing lights adjacent to the white lights which would flash about every five seconds. The object dissapeared into the tree line.  I pulled into my driveway and rolled the windows down to hear a motor to see if it was a helicopter, an airplane, or possibly the Goodyear blimp which was in Everett very recently.There was no noise. I pulled in front of my garage and shut the motor off. There was still no noise. The object must have been at low altitude and was moving at slow speed like a blimp or helicoper would. If the object was further away it would have to be very large and the lights very bright. Again no silouete of an object could be seen because of the dark sky and bright lights.", "Four bright lights, equal distance apart, aprox 50 feet from end to end, stationary in a clearing of heavy forest (pipe line), no soundWe were at a family reunion, sitting around the camp fire as we do every night.  The reunion is held in a town of 200 in a heavily forrested area of northern Wisconsin.  My sister left to go home just before I did.  She flagged us down on the county road, an we pulled over.  She pointed to an opening in the forrest and said what is that. We looked at an area that is cleared for a natural gas pipe line from Canada.  The width of the clearing is about 100 feet wide and runs from Canada through the center of the United States. At the top of the hill about 1 mile from the road we saw four bright white lights, equally spaced. The two lights in the middle were brighter than the lights on the side, as if they were pointed in a slightly different direction. The distance the two end lights were appart was about 50 feet (it took up about 1/2 of the clearing).  We went back to the farm house that we had the fire at to get a pair of binoculars.  We came back with two more people and looked through the binoculars at the lights.  Through the binoculars we could make out somewhat of a shape, as if the lights were attached to a piece of equipment.  The lights seamed to pulsate when looked at with the naked eye, but did not when seen thruogh the binoculars.  We all tried to guess what this could be.  A piece of farm equipment, but it was on government land, late at night, not moving, no sound.  There was no electricity to power the lights, a generator or equipment would make a noise.  It was so quiet, you could here for miles.  No one wanted to walk through the tall grass to get a closer look, (in retrospect I wish I did).  We were not sure how far away it was.  My wife and I went back to our cabin.  When we told the story to our daughter and her boy friend they wanted to see.  When we went back, it was still there.  The next day we hiked about one mile to the top of the hill, though thick waist high grass, were we saw the object.  We saw no signs of anything.  The grass was not flattend, no tire tracks,! foot prints, ect.  What we saw was at the top of a hill, so it couldn&apos;t have been any further, or we wouldn&apos;t be able to see over the hill, unless it was higher than the hill.  We walked another 3 miles and saw no signs of anything.  Eight people in all saw this, and at this time nobody can explain what we saw.  We plan asking the locals if anyone was in the area at the same time.", "two objects in sky with flashing lightsMy husband went to look outside to see if he could see Mars.  He spotted flashing lights that were stationary.  He first thought either a helicopter or a plane.  After 10 minutes of watching he called me into the garden to have a look.  I watched for about 10 minutes with binoculars and the naked eye (the clours flashing were to me blue and red).  The lights did not move.  We both watched as an aeroplane higher up than the lights went past it and past us, so this confirmed it was not an aeroplane nor we agreed the local police helicopter.  We then spotted another light that was lower and off to the left of the first one, this was hidden by low cloud.  After about 15 minutes and returned indoors.  My husband had gone in and got the video camera and carried on filming the lights and did not come indoor until 23.30.  During this time the lights did not move and as I am typing this I&apos;ve sent him outside to see if they are still there.  Having never experienced anything like this before and being of an open mind about ufos is there an rational explanation for these lights?  I have just gone outside with my husband at 23.50 and the two lights are still there they have moved slightly from their original places but one does seem bigger than the other. We were stood in our garden with backs to a fence and there were no lights from houses behind us and we had no lights on in the garden.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a twinkling star is a possible explanation for the sighting, although that is just a guess.  We will invite the witnesses to look at the same area of the sky at about the same time on the next clear night.  PD))", "HBCC UFO talked with a gentleman who resides in Houston, B.C. The witness told me he packed his camera and tripod up and headed over to one of the fields on their farm. He was going to capture some shots of the planet Mars and the Moon as it is so beautiful right now. As he was setting up his equipment he noticed something very odd. In a totally clear sky he watched a cloud starting to form very quickly. As he mentioned it came out of no where and seemed to be shaping up in a oblong shape. Due to the Moon being bright he had no problem in watching this phenomena. The fellow also said there was some type of disturbance which was taking place in the cloud itself. He tried to explain what he saw, and the best example he could come up was: From end to end of this narrow formed cloud, it appeared to look like someone had taken a shot with a powerful gun, and the force of the shell was cutting through the cloud. Causing a disturbance within, or center of the cloud which ran from end to end. There was no lights/object seen at all, just this strange long mass of cloud which appeared right out of nowhere. It sat stationary for approx: 4 to 5 minutes and dissipated. Thank you to the witness for the report.
