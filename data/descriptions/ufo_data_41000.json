["daughter&apos;s abduction  500 Lights On Object0: YesI was at a friends house about 15 miles west of Boston in the Town of Weston. A saucer shaped craft came an hovered over my friends backyard where some 20 plus people were playing frisbee, volleyball, touch football and enjoying a hearty cookout. The craft came down and landed in my friend&apos;s backyard. a door opened and two tall, slender gray colored, about 6&apos;2&quot; and about 6&apos;4&quot; beings, came out and floated across the yard. The crowd panicked and backed away. My friend&apos;s mother ran out of the house screaming for everyone to get back. My friend&apos;s younger sister was frozen like a statue. These two beings floated across the yard,toward the frozen blonde haired young lady. Her mother ran right at the two beings screaming no you can&apos;t take my daughter. One of the beings raised their hand knocking the running mother over backwards, rendering her unconscious. The two beings came and took the daughter by the arms, floated back to the hovering craft, doors opened, in they went and the craft left slowly at first, then disappeared very quickly. The daughter was never returned. Since the summer of 1978, my friend&apos;s sister has never been seen again. The mother had a complete nervous breakdown, as she told of her own abductions. Officially the daughter&apos;s disappearance, has been categorized by the local police and FBI as an unsolved kidnapping. Everyone I have told this story to has never believed me. The mother told me of her own abductions as well as her daughter&apos;s abductions as a small child. The daughter had just become 18 years old about 6 weeks before she was taken.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I usually see them as lights at night, assuming they are the same ones...? At first I was watching a plane and then I notice a bright white dot behind it and I knew what it was. It started to move parallel to the mountains headed west I think, north bound if it was a car on the 101. It was so far away I could&apos;nt really give you a distance but it was behind the plane and it was a small dot so I am assuming pretty far away, a mile maybe?? As I was watching that move across the sky from a stand still I saw another dot materialize in an area of the sky the first one had just crossed and started to watch the second one start to move west also. Then I noticed another one in a different part of the sky standing still. One of them dissapeared.... WOW!!!!!!!!! I called my mom over and she saw them too but barely... It was really hard to see them up there so unless you are looking for em or they get your attention they are very hard to see...  I frantically ran around looking for my cheap $20 binoculars. They magnify 10x25  so it wasn&apos;t much help but when I looked through them at one of the ufo&apos;s and it was close enough to see that it was definetly a very shiny metallic craft and it looked like a cluster of about three to five spheres!!!!!!!!!! this is truely amazing and I am so excited that they are coming here but for what reasons? I think we will all find out soon enough...........I hope... this world needs change!!! BADLY!!!!((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I thought at first it might be a plane, but the thing was moving extremely fast so I thought that couldn&apos;t be it. I have never seen an object streak across the sky like that. I saw it streak accross the sky for a few seconds, then it looked like it shot straight up, and then it just vanished.

The Sun was still rising on the right side of the vehicle, so both the yellow sphere of light and the sun were in view.  The object was roughly 10-15 miles ahead of me, and from that distance, it appeared slightly larger than the appearance of the Sun, so I would estimate it was about 1-1 1/2 miles in diameter.

It is very hard to come up with a approximate size or distance since the sky was so nice, but for one second I thought it might be a hot air balloon  so I asked my aunt  if she had binoculars or something like it, she went inside and handed me a set of bird watching monocular ( it looks like only one side of a binoculars. It took me a while to sight the object with the monocular but finaly I did and TADA! it was not a baloon, The best description of the object is a big red sphere with three smaller orange smi-spheres toghether, one thing that was very interesting was that we were able to see  some sort of &quot;vapor&quot; around it (like when the asfalt is very hot) The object started moving slowly  north, almost like drifting, then it stop completly and started moving south east this time a bit faster and longer to the point that we almost losted in between houses but all of the sudden the thin just rocketted  north west to the oposite side, the speed was not super super fast but but it was faster than anything that I have ever seen flying including fighter planes specially considering how hight it was. just a second after the thing blasted across the sky what it look like a business &quot;lear&quot; jet cross the sky with the same trajectory almost as if it was fallowing IT.", "Four lights in the southern sky, one stationary and the three others had a methodic illumination patternOn February 28, 2007 I was traveling from Mesa AZ to Somerton AZ (just south of Yuma AZ). I was west bound on Interstate 8.  At 7:22 PM at mile marker 89.5 I saw a light appear to my left in the sky at approximately 30 degrees and what appeared to be approximately &frac14; mile away. I saw this one light appear and my first thought was, &quot;It must be a radio tower.&quot;  Then a second light appeared right next to the first light.  Approximately one second later a third light appeared.  The lights then went off in reverse order then came back in the order in which they appeared the first time.  In all there were four white lights.  One was stationary and the three appeared and disappeared in a methodic manner.  It was not totally black out as there was a nearly full moon.  I could make out that it was a craft of some sort as it appeared to rotate slowly. It made no sound. Then, suddenly it was like someone turned off a light switch and it was gone. I got on the phone with my wife and explained to her what I had seen. While on the phone with her I was looking around the sky trying to locate the light. I looked to the North (the complete opposite direction) and way off to the north on the horizon I could see the same light pattern. In both instances the object did not appear to be traveling in a certain direction.On the way back from Somerton AZ two days later I carefully reviewed the area where I had made the sighting. There were no mountains, No towers and no homes. There was only open desert and a cow every so often.I called my dad in Indianapolis after speaking with my wife that night. I began to explain what I had just seen and in the middle of me explaining he chimed in and finished my sentence. He said he had seen the exact same thing about 30 years ago in Greenfield Indiana.Please let me know if there were any other sightings around this time period.Thank you.((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness observed, but the first possibility we would want to eliminate is military flares over Gila Bend Firing Range, to the southwest of Phoenix.

When I looked up I saw a orange bright ball in the sky.  We were near Burbank Airport, so I thought it was a plane coming in for a landing, but there were no flashing lights typical for planes.  Then I noticed how slowly it was moving and it was slightly wobbling, moving left and right as it traveled.  This lasted for about 1 minute or so.  The object then stopped and hovered for about 15-20 seconds when it began to flicker.  It then ejected a smaller object.  It then began to fade in the sky.", "Reddish orange oval object that hovered over and dipped in front of my car during the 15 minute drive into townI was driving home after a long night of studying with my father.  He had rented a small home near Woods Reservoir Lake part of the Arnold Engineering Development Center Air Force Base.  My drive home is on a highway that cuts through the Air Force Base-it is all trees for several miles.As I reached the highway I noticed a red/orange glowing oval shaped object that hovered to my left as I drove and seemed to go with me.  Occasionally it would cross my path and dip in front of my car and quickly go back to the left and hover.  At first I thought I was seeing the reflection of my cigarette in the window and so I put out the cigarette and the object was still there.  It continued to hover and dip in front of me many times during the 15 minute drive.  As I reached the edge of town there is a large curve in the road and as I made the left turn on the curve the object flew above (instead of dipping in front of) my car, crossed over and to the right and disappeared over the trees to my right.  It was reddish orange, oval shaped and seemed to be brighter on either side of the object.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

There were 3 perfectly shaped triangles flying in formation, in an irregular way (not like normal aircraft). They were flying low, below the upper level clouds. In fact, that was the only way to see them in that they blotted out the stars and the clouds above then. There were no lights at all. There was no sound at all. I have seen stealth aircraft several times (even at night) and they do not look perfectly triangular. These were, equal sides with no &quot;Flaps&quot; or appendages. They flew quickly accross the sky, zig-zagging and speeding up/slowing down in an unusual way. Then they sped off at a great rate of speed and were gone from sight. This was right over the intersection of I-4 and International Drive, in the toutist district. We thought that it was pretty bold of &quot;whosever&quot; they were to fly over the city. But, in truth, unless you were looking right at them you would not see them. Later, it appeared to us that some jets flew accross the sky in the same direction, perhaps in pursuit?

The objects were light blue/green and formed a triangle pattern.  My friend&rsquo;s father had a telescope and I closed on one of them.  I saw a large diamond with the color mentioned before, but it had bright lights in the middle.

One evening he &quot;borrowed&quot; a tape from his job and showed my wife and myself along with his wife a satellite launching from the shuttle.  As the launching took place, we could see the earth behind the launching and between the shuttle and the earth we saw at least 3 triangular shapes which glowed brightly flying extremely fast from east to west. These unknown crafts had a dark line from the point of the triangle to the middle and then to the other points of the triangle. The UFO&apos;s then flew north and stopped and appeared to be observing the satellite launch.  The stopped and sat in place for a couple of minutes and then sped off in formation at an extremely fast speed.A couple of weeks later I asked my relative if I could see the tape again and he stated that it was a &quot;top secret&quot; tape and was taken by the government.Several weeks after that I again asked him about the tape and he stated,  &quot;What tape?&quot;.I have mentioned this to him several times since then and he denies the tapes existence.

During the sighting, a commercial jet airliner flew over from East to West. The UFO appeared to be much higher than the jet. Because the UFO was above the cirrus cloud when it &ldquo;disappeared&rdquo;, and because of the resolution in the binocs, it&rsquo;s my opinion this was a huge object or objects at very high altitude (60,000 to 70,000 feet).It is possible that the two disks could have been spheres, but they looked like disks to me.", "Two crafts and orb in Jakes Corner with possible abduction, 5 witnesses  In late August of 1987 I was moving out of Arizona with my young son and had stopped to spend the night at my grandparents house in Jakes Corners. A friend of mine came by to say goodbye. I&apos;d been loading the car and was standing in the yard with my friend, son, and grandparents. I then saw a very white light that looked like it was driving around the ground across the street on a hill. This happened just at early sunset. I was looking straight at the hill when I saw the object come up around the side of it and into view. At first I thought it was a dune buggy, but it only had a single beam out the front. In utter disbelief, I watched as it drove around to the top of the hill and then continued into the air. It moved very slowly and without sound. It was an extremely bright light and slowly moved across the street towards where we were. At this point we were all watching it. It was like a floodlight. After watching it for some time, maybe 15-20 minutes, my friend and I decided to get in his car and drive down the street to see if we could get a better view from another angle. At this point it was nearly over the street. While driving down the road I first saw a very small red light fly up from the ground and then fly up to the object. It seemed there was activity at the object with other smaller lights moving around it. Then to our left on the side of the road was another object. There are no houses or other structures in this area and nothing had been at this location previously. The object was very close to the road. It had an extremely bright white light shining out of an opening. We could not see the objects shape but it was very big, like the size of a garage. There was what resembled a hatch and the white light was pouring out from it, but it was too bright to make out any details inside of it. We decided to drive up to it. As we neared it, perhaps 40-50ft away the car engine died. Simultaneously with the engine dying what appeared to be the hatch began to close shut. It finally cl! osed com pletely and we were getting scared. The engine kicked back in and we returned to the house. By now the object in the sky was over the house. My grandparents were watching it with binoculars. We were not able to tell the shape of the object. My grandmother called Luke AFB and they told her they hadn&apos;t received any reports. At this point, and I realize this is strange but it&apos;s true, everyone seemed to act like &quot;so what, theres a ufo over the house&quot; and we got sleepy. My grandparents and son went inside to bed. My friend and I decided to go to sleep - on the front lawn, as if that was perfectly natural. We just fell alseep out on the ground. At one point I woke up and couldn&apos;t move and saw a blue light flooding the area but couldn&apos;t see a source. I then recall what may be a very strange dream. (?) Small people approached us and said they were going to check our feet and that they would not approach my grandparents. They did some physical exams. My friend was completely unconscious but I was awake and speaking to them in some manner although I was not able to move. The people did not move their mouths when they spoke. At one point they told me a being was there, I understood it to be a type of scientist. The creature or thing was like nothing I can describe, it somewhat resembled a giant praying mantis. It was fish or bug-like and was abosultely the most horrible thing I&apos;ve ever seen. I became terrified and was fighting them. It was my impression that this creature did not have any compassion for humans. It did not speak to me but had a very cold presence. The next thing I know, my friend and I woke up in the morning still laying on the front lawn. Everyone - my grandparents, son, and friend actted like nothing had happened. They were like &quot;oh yah, we saw a ufo&quot; as if that was perfectly natural. I was the only one that seemed to think something incredible had occurred. We spoke about the examination of the feet and we realized that my friend had webbed toes which I didn&apos;t know, and I have double jointed toes! as does my son. Over the years my grandparents referred to this ufo event from time to time, and my son remembers the episode and says that one of the beings spoke to him. 2007 is the 20 yr anniversary of this event. I&apos;ve often wondered about what happened that night, and although it sounds incredible what I&apos;ve related is true. After the event I had an interest in science and have since earned a masters in astronomy.

I woke up early that day and peered out the window as I often do in the morning.  But this morning I saw a cigar shaped silvery object at low altitude streaking across the sky in an easterly direction.  I thought it must be a jet--but it was to low and no noise was present.  Even more confusing, there appeared to be no wings on this thing.  I am still unsure of what I saw.  It seems very strange to me to say it must have been a UFO, but I cannot rule this out.  I have never seen anything remotely the same since that day.  Like everyone that day -- nothing seemed real.  However, I imagine if it was a UFO and this craft was moving eastward it is likely that the craft could have been on an intercept course to observe that mornings terror that would follow. I am not a UFO fanatic, and I do not aspire to be one.  However, I have wondered if anyone else saw anything weird that day.

For a while he just decided to stay and keep watching the sky when he looked up and saw what appeared to be a red circle doing semi circles in the air.  It was big or low enough to see with the naked eye.  When using the binoculars, he could see that it was actually two orbs stuck together.  He said that it wasn&apos;t light, like a flashlight, but more like internal, luminescent light, sort of &quot;glowy&quot;.

It was coming in at treetop level from the other side of the river toward Somerset and barely or slowly moving and made no sound at all. Needless to say we where stunned and stood there looking at this thing until it came to a complete stop over the center of the river and still due to its size and us kind of being in a valley we could not see the whole thing at once and it was right there, Right in our face and larger than any object that we have seen in our lives.

Once we started, believe me we where so scared that we did not even look back and was very happy to see our vehicle. We sat there in the car for a while and waited for people to be scrambling every where, We knew someone had to see this thing due to its size, We knew that hundreds had to view it because it was so big.

And this was after we informed him that we had not been drinking. He said no he had not seen it and immediately started telling us about a ghost that he has seen on the bridge that is located above the falls and I knew at that time that we where in the middle of a wasted conversation.  That has been many years ago and I never thought about putting it on the web until now when I was searching to see if there were any other sightings around that time.

This is a current interest of our homeowners association which the Board of Director is now considering for our community.  We live on a 28 acre lake so some members of the Board of Directors were thinking about placing a large colorful fountain in the middle of the lake for esthetics. To support this project, I took my Canon 20D, a high quality 8-megapixel digital camera, and set it up on a tripod at our community pavilion using a ISO or light sensitivity rating of 1600 for night time photography. My photo shoot went well.  I probably spent about 20 minutes getting all the photos I thought I needed. I was not aware of anything in the background night sky as I took my time lapse photos. I was only interested in getting good photos with proper focus and good exposure. It was not until I returned home, took a nap and woke up again about 11:00 PM that I decided to download the digital images from my camera to my computer. As I was going through these images I noticed a fuzzy spot near one of two radio broadcast towers that have powerful strobe lights. The two towers are located about 9/10ths of a mile east southeast of the location where I took the pictures you&apos;ll see below. When I zoomed in on the photo of the radio tower to the left in the photos below I could see that my camera had captured an image of something I&apos;d not been aware of at all when I was taking these photos. While I was taking the digital images I noticed there were some aircraft quickly passing overhead but didn&apos;t think much of it except to curse a bit because of the visual interference. However, I knew I could easily eliminate these streaks left by airplanes by using my graphics software. Below you can see one such aircraft that came into view while I was shooting my photos. It left a visible trai! l in my time lapse photography.  All of my photos, except one or two, were shot using time lapse photography. I used a 5 second exposure time, set the ISO to 1600, the F-stop was set at 5.6 with manual focus set at 55 millimeters. So any moving object in my field of view would have presented a trail, as you see below, caused by the time lapse photography. The UFO I later spotted in my imagery did not move. It was fixed in place as you&apos;ll see below. A plane moves across the night sky on one of my first images of the night sky  (Photo)  Below at the arrow is where you see the movement of that plane during my 5 second exposure.The camera is facing southeast. You can see the vertical ground-up illumination of the background sky lighting. This image was depixelated to enhance the ringed view of the city background lighting effect. I saw this plane in my viewfinder as I was taking the photo. So this plane was very obvious because the lights on the aircraft were somewhat bright. The azimuth of the aircraft heading was about 100 degrees or ESE.aircraft in flight  (Photo)   At 8:05:40 PM on Feb. 24, 2007 something quite mysterious and unexplained appeared in a series of digital images I took which you&apos;ll see below. An unknown object or UFO  appeared in my images after I came home to view them on my computer. When I describe this as a UFO sighting I certainly don&apos;t mean an alien spacecraft. I don&apos;t even know if this object was flying.  In the context of UFO I mean that I haven&apos;t yet figured out for certain what this particular UFO phenomenon might possibly be. One assumes that the object which shows up in my digital imagery must be some type of unknown aircraft or perhaps some type of light generated phenomenon in need of an explanation. I&apos;ve conducted studies of the physical properties of &quot;light ducting&quot; phenomena which occurs in atmospheric layers and also have considerable field experience in atmospheric physics.  I&apos;ve even written scientific papers on super refractivity and the UFO phenomenon. I spent a two year stint working on a government program to examine UFO sightings reported by foreign governments who sought to understand their own UFO sightings which they reported to the U.S. government. In nearly all cases our government scientists and astronomers could easily attribute a reason for nearly all of these sightings reported by foreign governments.  After considerable thought and research they most often were explained as falling space debris, likely meteors, astronomical sightings of stars or planets or other known celestial phenomenon.  Occasionally these UFO sightings are of earthly origin such as migrating flocks of birds and even large swarms of insects that catch light reflected from earth. Some sightings of insect migration even present radar returns on occasion. So I am no stranger to the fascinating subject of UFO&apos;s.  What I&apos;ve been able to tell from my initial examination of my UFO photos of February 24, 2007 --- that you&apos;ll see below --- is that the unidentified object captured with my digital camera remained aloft in my field of view from 20:05:40 PM until the last image I captured of it which was 20:15:52 PM. I&apos;m assuming it may have been present beyond 20:15:52 PM but I just don&apos;t have the physical evidence. I do know for certain that it was not in view prior to 8:02:02 PM because I have imagery of the exact same area and nothing was present in my imagery. The period in which my camera imaged the UFO was over a 10 minute period of time in a very small area of the sky. Airplanes quickly transit the sky as you see in the first photo above. They are very easy to distinguish. However, I was taking time lapse photography and the UFO in view was almost motionless during that 5 second interval the images were made with my Canon 20D. That long dwell time in the sky in a near motionless presence is very strange indeed.......unless the object was hovering or was a very far away. The UFO did slowly move in relation to the tree tops below but this movement was less than 10 degrees as it remained fixed about 4 or 5 degrees above the horizon. This was right above the pine tree tops at a distance away of 1,000 feet. All the time I was taking photos I was unaware of this object in the dark sky. It was almost pitch black sky at 8:00 PM and the moon was not out. Only the small amount of illumination from house lights and street lamps was available. So my vision was not nearly as good as you see in these photos which were taken with a $1,500 digital camera. I used an ISO setting of 1600 and a time exposure of 5 seconds which allowed my digital camera to see what I did not take notice of. The resulting images with a high ISO can literally turn night into day. However, I was not after that effect. I only wanted to capture realistic evening photos so I later could superimpose a fountain onto the lake and then be able to present the im! age to o ur homeowners association Board of Directors. Again, it was only hours after I took these photos that I realized there was something unusual on the digital images that I couldn&apos;t explain. Not only did I see in the images a suspected UFO, but I also saw a very large globe appear in the sky which you&apos;ll see in one of the photos below. This is a phenomenon that I do not attempt to explain except to suggest it may have been some sort of visual artifact within the camera. However, there is this perfectly round globe inside of which is the UFO as observed in several of the photographs. Again, I reiterate that I was not able to see these strange things while I was taking these images. I am able to slight enhance the presence of the light colored globe but have only done so in one image you see below. This globe-like halo effect is the most mysterious thing I see in any of these photos. I am mystified by its unique appearance. I have the original 8 megapixel images on my computer but to make the images you see below I have depixelated them which imperceptibly degrades the quality of the images. Any seasoned photographer, even an amateur photographer understands that sometimes there are artifacts of light that get into their camera lenses and bounce around.  This sometimes produces visual effects that obviously were not seen with the naked eye when the photo was taken. Often these artifacts are passed off as real ghosts by true believers. I&apos;m sure there are UFO&apos;s reported that are nothing more than extraneous refractions of light that get into the camera and somehow distort images. However, in this case I have 8 photos of the UFO object and all were imaged at high resolution using an 8 megapixel camera. I have all these images in their original native format. The first image I have of this UFO was taken at 8:02:48 PM. The image below shows the UFO with four white lights and what appears to be red lights interspersed between the white lights. The white dot below the object is either a star or perhaps a bad pixel. This UFO object is very large in the sky but it&apos;s really not that bright, certainly not as bright as any of the aircraft I saw flying last night. Aircraft are usually seen as small points of moving light and the aircraft engine noise is sometimes faintly discernable. When using time lapse imagery these aircraft always move along a ray trace on a photograph as you saw above. The unidentified object below, which I never observed visually with my own eyes, was really quite wide. As you see I am a careful not to say flying because I don&apos;t know if it was flying and, in fact, I suspect it was NOT flying because it remained somewhat stationary in the same approximate location in the sky for over 10 minutes.. So I use the term UFO very loosely to suggest the object simply remains unidentified, at least by me. I have measured the angular width of the UFO and determined that it is 1/4 or ) 0.25 degrees (or 15 minutes) in width. For reference purposes the width of the sun and moon are both 0.5 degrees. So the object below would be just 1/2 the width of the sun or moon. Using simple trigonometry it now would is possible to determine what the true width of the UFO would be for any given distance. See the on-line trig calculator at http://www.carbidedepot.com/formulas-trigright.asp . If the UFO was exactly one mile away its width would be 23 feet. If the UFO was 5 miles away the width would be 115 feet. At 10 miles away the width would be 230 feet. At 15 miles away 345 feet. And lastly, at 30 miles distant the width would be about 690 feet which is typical for many cruise ships. Sailing 30 miles off the coast of Florida is typical for these cruise ships.  The home you see in the photo below is directly across the lake and is exactly 1,010 feet away from where the camera took these digital images.Below you see the first appearance of the UFO  (Photo)   The next photo was taken a full minute and 20 seconds later at 20:06:00 PM.THe UFO seems to have slightly repositioned itself with respect to the bright star which now is perfectly in line with the object. The lateral movement is about 2 to 3 degrees to the right when compared to the photo above  (Photo)  Same photo as the image above. Notice that there are two radio broadcast towers in the background.  The taller radio tower you see in the image above is located along an azimuth of 126.5 degrees (ESE) with ref. to True North and with respect to the camera. The tower is 0.875 miles or 4,625 feet away. It&apos;s calculated height is 438 ft. high. Ground elevation is 26 ft. above mean sea level. North is up in the photo map. The tallest of the two FM radio broadcast towers is located at 28-02-50.50 North latitude and 80-40-31.69 West longitude. It has two strobe lights.  The shorter FM broadcast tower with only one strobe light is 241 ft. high and is located at 28-02-55.08 North latitude and 80-40-32.54 West longitude. It is located 0.82 miles or 4,311 feet from the camera. The azimuth from the camera to the tallest tower with two strobe lights is 132.2 degrees (w/ref. to magnetic north) or 126.5 degree w/ref. to true North. This corrected azimuth applies the year 2007 correction for magnetic declination of 5 deg. 44 min. West for this particular location. The shorter radio tower lies along a magnetic north compass azimuth of 128.5 degrees which also is corrected to 122.75 degrees w/ref. to true North. This means there is 3.75 degrees of angular separation between the two FM radio towers as observed at the point the camera took the photos.   The terminus of the white line is the radio tower with two strobe lights located 0.9 miles away from the camera.(Photo)   Below is a satellite view of the tallest broadcast tower you see with two strobe lights as noted in the images above and below.The measured shadow length of the tower is 386 feet. I suspect that with the sun angle observed that the shadow approximates the actual height of the radio tower. However, when I checked with the FCC licensing for this tower I saw that they only permitted the licensee to have a 100-ft height tower. It therefore may be an illegal height. (Photo)  The image below was taken at 8:06:22 PM or about 22 seconds after the one immediately above. The object remained at the same range or distance. I simply zoomed in or blew up the size of the image differently in both the images above and below. The angular width of the UFO remains at 0.25 degrees in width. As you can see in this next photo the UFO is really quite bright in the night sky so it surprises me that I didn&apos;t take notice of it when I originally was shooting these images. But the fact was my wife was cooking dinner for me so I wanted to hurry along and get this photo shoot done and return home. Never in my wildest imagination did I think my images would show the presence of a UFO in view.  The next image you see was taken at 20:14:56 PM EST.  During the post processing phase I digitally zoomed in on the object to see the individual pixels that clearly show that there are four distinct white lights with what appears to be red lights in between the white lights. The lights look to be equidistant to each other. The object is angled at about 45 degrees in this image. I should note that lights transmitted within atmospheric ducts or between thermal layers of air as well as desert mirages often become angled, distorted, inverted or even twisted. In this blow-up it appears that the object is colored both red and green. There definitely are pixels in the image that recorded red and a few also were recorded as green.  This appears to be the best image I got of the UFO. To the right is the tall radio tower with the two strobe lights.The UFO is just below the arrow. Using a precision Suunto clinometer I accurately measured the height of the tallest tower to have an elevation angle of 5.4 degrees above the horizon. The angle above the horizon for the shorter tower is 3.2 degrees above the horizon. The azimuth of the UFO is 119.95 degrees w/ref. to true north and the elevation angle is 5.5 degrees.  The next photo was taken at 8:15:07 PM. It is the brightest image of this UFO I imaged on Saturday night, Feb. 24th. You can see in the image below that the UFO appears to have been rotated on its axis. Now we see only three white lights.  We also see a red light on the left side suggesting this rotation.  Azimuth of the UFO is now at 120.875 degrees w/ref. to true north  Now something changes in the angle of the object with respect to my camera view of it. The time of this image is 8:15:18 PM, or 9 seconds after the image above was taken. (Photo)  Below is the full view of the object seen just above. The UFO is seen at an azimuth 121.75 degrees w/ref. to true North. Because the sight picture has changed so much it suggests that this is an optical aberration and not some kind of aircraft or alien spaceship. (Photo)   Now we quickly see an entirely different view of this object. This image was taken at 20:15:38 PM or some 20 seconds after the image seen immediately above. We now see 8 white lights and perhaps no red lights. Because of the double rows of lights I am inclined to think this is an artifact of light refraction. The image actually seems to have been split and set in parallel rows with four other lights.  In the photos that were taken between 8:14:56 PM and 8:15:52 PM there is the presence of a very strange light globe in the imagery contained in five frames. You cannot discern the angle of illumination for the globe in the photo immediately below, but you can see it in the photo that follows the one below. The angle of light illumination is not vertical as one might expect if the globe was the result of city light illumination. This aspect of the photo is very puzzling. The UFO is inside the light colored globe just above the radio tower strobe light. I was not aware of this light colored globe in the night sky when I was taking these photos. It is very discrete and only discernable with time lapse photography. It was much later after I looked at the digital images that the globe was first visible to me.The azimuth to the UFO is about 122 degrees (ref. true North)  The photo below is greatly depixelated to show the angle of illumination on the mysterious globe in the background.This is the last image I took of the UFO at 8:15:52 PM. It may have lingered for a while longer but I was never aware of its presence, otherwise I would have taken dozens of images of it in rapid succession using 5 second times lapse photography. In this image the previous parallel lines of four lights each now seems to be bent at the near end.MY THEORY ON WHAT THIS EVENT WAS:  So what do I think these strange lights in the night sky were? From my scientific field experience in the South China Sea a quarter century ago, I believe the most likely explanation for this sighting was atmospheric ducting phenomena. This occurs under somewhat unusual but not rare circumstances called temperature inversions. What my camera imaged is possibly a light source that was coupled into an atmospheric duct or a laminar flow of warm air inverted above cooler surface air creating a low level ducting channel. This type of duct permits light and even radio signals to be transmitted great distances without any appreciable loss of energy. When I draw a straight line from my observation point where the images were taken along the 121 degree azimuth of the UFO sighting, the line travels towards the Bahamas. In fact it passes close to Grand Bahama Island where Freeport is located.Another possibility is that this sighting of strange lights was possibly a cruise ship at sea about 30 miles from Melbourne, FL. Some of these ships are very tall and could serve as the light source for the UFO sighting. These ships also are very well lit at night. The map below shows various cruise line routes to the Bahamas and the Caribbean Islands. They depart for these cruses from Port Canaveral located 40 miles north of Melbourne and head south not far off the coast for some distance.(Google satgellite view of eastern Florida)   Why was I able to photograph this phenomenon?   All I can conjecture is that for some reason the unexplained light suddenly decoupled from its light channel about where I was located when I took the images.  Perhaps the decoupling out of the atmospheric duct occurred overland and it was simply fortuitous that I was in the right location at exactly the right moment in time.  There&apos;s no doubt that my camera recorded something very, very curious. However, my inclination is to seek a rational understanding and not speculate that extraterrestrials came visiting on February 24, 2007.I&apos;ll just have to guess that this light show I observed in my imagery was nothing more that light passing over the Atlantic ocean which warmed the air.  The light was then sandwiched by a cold boundary layer of air from land.  This caused a condition of super refractivity resulting in the unusual sighting of strange lights. Below you see a ray trace in red which is the azimuth along which I first sighted the UFO. At the bottom left corner of the graphic below you see a scale which depicts distance in miles. So 50 miles is about an inch on this graphic.", "Two UFO sighted over Tacoma&apos;s Commencement BayI am submitting a report of a UFO sighting which occurred on Saturday January 20, 2007 at 12:35 pm. I am a construction worker, and I was working in Tacoma Washington at the Simpson Pulp Mill at the mouth of the Puyallup River on the edge of Commencement Bay.I was working what is called a shutdown on the mill, this is when the Boiler is taken off line and is repaired, my boss was setting me up on a job to replace the hanger rods on the primary exhaust which feeds directly into the smokestack which is at a height of fifty to sixty feet. Scaffolding had been erected around the duct as to give us access to work. The sky at that time was partially cloudy with a 30% to 40% cloud cover. My lead man and I were climbing one of the ladders on the scaffolding when I noticed a round brilliant white object at a high altitude moving across the sky it looked somewhat like a weather balloon and I pointed it out to my lead when he reached the top of the ladder. My lead man asked me what I though it was, and I told him I wasn&rsquo;t sure but it looked similar to a weather balloon, and it was moving slowly from west to the east, and we watched it for thirty seconds or so, my lead man then said common I want to show you something else which pertained to the job.We stepped out of direct sight, but I kept looking back into the sky at the object. The object continued to slowly move to the east at almost a 12 o&rsquo;clock position in the sky. I then noticed a second object which looked identical to the other it was positioned directly in the path of the first at the same high altitude, but it was stationary both objects appeared to be about a quarter the diameter of the sun or slightly less. The first object then stopped and held position close to the second both not moving, I then summoned my lead man and said check this out, there are two of them now. My lead man then asked what do you think they are, and said &ldquo;I am not sure what they are! but they are UFO&rsquo;s.&rdquo; My lead man then stated that I must be smoking something if I think they&rsquo;re UFO&rsquo;s, to which I replied &ldquo;it must be the same thing your smoking because you&rsquo;re seeing them too,&rdquo; but neither one of was smoking anything, and they were real. The boss said common I&rsquo;ve got to show you something else and we moved out of visual contact and when I came back they were gone.The whole encounter didn&rsquo;t last five minutes, but I remember looking at my watch several times to confirm the time, it read 12:35 pm. One other thing that was kind of strange is that I kept thinking, to myself that they must be surveying our industrial progress, and I am not sure why I was thinking that, but they were directly over the heavy industrialized area of Commencement Bay.", "Light travelling, turning.I was lying on my hammock in my backyard looking North/West at Orions Belt at 08:35 pm. when a dim light treked through my line of sight.

From my window seat at the right side of the plane, I observed an object to the north, not much lower than my airplane. Object was within 1,000 feet or maybe less by my estimate, &amp; was large enough to be seen clearly. It had a metallic orange color, and was a rounded, triangular shaped solid object. Its appearance reminded me of a kite or a top, although thicker in proportion than a kite &amp; similar to the helium balloons at the supermarket. Although it was observed in a very bright sky, there was not a shiny metallic reflection, and no visible seams, markings, windows, edges or lights. It was positioned vertically, as if it was standing on end, and did not have a horizontal (flat) flight appearance. Speed and direction could not be estimated visually with any certainty or accuracy, given the effect of the airliner&rsquo;s flight speed on perception of movement outside the plane. However, I had the sense that it was flying east, which was opposite the direction of my flight.  At that relatively close distance it was only visible for perhaps 2 or 3 seconds, before the wing obscured further viewing of the object. My first reaction was that I thought I was seeing a near miss. Not dangerously so, but too close to be within normal tolerances. It definitely was not any kind of airplane, and if that was a weather balloon, it sure seemed like it was too close to our plane for safety!  I wonder if the cockpit radar registered this object?  As far as my background, I am a 46 year old male self employed in real estate consulting. I was not drinking or hallucinating, and have no history of delusional perceptions or behavior.

When out of the southern sky, I observed 5 / 6 black objects flying directly overhead and then disappearing into the northern sky.  Two of the objects were flying erratically: moving side to side.  They had no lights and there was no sound.  They were flying in a formation of some sort.  Each object had what appeared be bent wings.  I wondered if it could be birds even though I could not see any wing movement, but I&rsquo;ve never recalled a time when birds flock together at night and flew in formation.

It was about 8:30 pm in the evening and I had just lay down and turned out the light to catch a nap. Suddenly the brilliant light flashed into my room with a thunderous sound.  The whole room shook. Frightened, I ran out of my room.  Girls every where in the hall where screaming did you hear that, what happened?  No alarm went off, but about 10 girls at the large window at the end of the hall, yelled for us to come and see what was in the sky.  It was a typical winter night sky, I don&apos;t remember a moon, but I do remember thousands of beautiful stars. We looked in astonishment as large star like object hovered distantly in the sky.  It danced like a &quot;Mitch Mitchell&quot; music ball all over the horizon. Suddenly it lifted itself high above the distant mountain peaks and 5 smaller orbs separated from the large one and just went crazy in the sky; zigzagging everywhere. Then all six orbs flashed into the sky and disappeared. We called security and they said we were just seeing things, that we, a whole dorm-floor of girls were just playing a hoax.  It was no hoax.

We were looking up at the sky as it was a perfectly clear night with a crescent moon. I saw a blinking white light zipping along from north, north east to south, south west.  I pointed it out to my wife &ldquo;look a satellite, watch it blink as it tumbles&rdquo; we watched it until just past 90 degrees directly over us.  Then my wife noticed a second object, &ldquo;Look there&rsquo;s another one!&rdquo; only this one wasn&rsquo;t flashing.  I thought &ldquo;that&rsquo;s odd that two would be orbiting so close together.  We&rsquo;re lucky to see this.&rdquo;  As the second light passed 90 degrees above us I could make out a flashing collision light that seemed to be mounted to the tail of an aircraft, and we immediately heard the sound of a jet that struck me as quite loud (the first object made no sound at all which had me convinced that we were looking at a satellite). The distance between the two was maintained until they both disappeared from our view. I would estimate that the objects were around three to five miles apart as they were the distance of a 12&rdquo; ruler held at arms length.  Both objects were moving quite rapidly and were only visible to us for around 45 seconds.  We could hear the jet well after it was out of sight.  We live near the approach corridor for Charlotte Douglas Int&apos;l, so we are familiar with the behavior, look, and sound of civilian jet aircraft.  We heard this jet for nearly a minute after it was out of sight.  My wife even commented on how long we could still hear it, &ldquo;is that the jet we still hear?&rdquo;.  This leads me to believe that this was a military aircraft chasing something with the afterburners lit.  This would explain our still hearing it even after it was long of sight, and both aircraft appeared to be at extremely high altitude.  My guess would be between 35 to 45 thousand feet as neither appeared much larger than the stars that were visible. Military aircraft are never seen near here due to the high concentration of civilian aircraft that pass over our area.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report elects to remain anonymous; provides e-mail address only.

Silver saucer/disk shaped object hovering in the sky completely motionless at about 6000 feet.This is the description of what I witnessed on Wednesday morning, January 17th, 2007 at approximately 10:30 am.  Let me give some background, I am married, 40 years old, 2 children, I am a general contractor, self employed in the construction trades and have worked in the northern Lake county, Illinois, area for the past 19 years.  Prior to the 17th, I remained skeptical on the whole UFO issue, since I had no direct experience to justify any existence of such phenomena one way or the other.I was driving to the jobsite about 10:30 in the morning, heading eastbound on route 120 in the Hainesville, Grayslake area I turned onto Alleghany road southbound about 45 mph. the stretch is perhaps three miles to Peterson road, about halfway I noticed something in the sky at about 45 to 50 degrees south-southwest of my position, it caught my eye I believe because it was not moving, just floating-hovering stationary my best guess at about 5000-7000 ft. .I drive a G20 Chevy van with a large windshield; it appeared about &frac12;&quot; in size as I watched through the windshield. The object was saucer- disk shaped and very silver, the sky was clear and its definition crisp, no movement at all; it appeared as if someone held up a silver plate in the sky. I watched the object for about a minute or more until I reached Peterson road, when I turned east it left my field of vision.I have always had sort of a photographic memory and as the minutes progressed it started to hit me what that may have been, I then regretted I did not stop to observe it further as I never saw anything like it, motionless just sitting stationary, I think back and believe now I should have stopped and called the police because it was close enough to plainly see it was not any recognizable aircraft or a balloon, it was a silver saucer.I suppose I was in a state of denial at the time but it just keeps coming back to me and I can still see it. That night I remarked to my wife and kids that I saw a flying saucer on the way to work in a matter of fact way as if the reality of what I saw did not quite compute, it seemed ridiculous in a way, I tried to shrug it off.  In a strange way it has taken some time to process this, because silver saucers don&rsquo;t just float in the sky.I told a couple of other people about it, one person mentioned that UFO&rsquo;s were recently sighted over O&rsquo;Hare airport, so after about 10 days of still picturing it just hovering in the sky I googled &quot;&ldquo;O&rsquo;Hare UFO&quot; and came up with a photo someone took over the airport, and I thought to myself that that was what I saw, except more crispy defined and silver.Its been a few weeks now and I decided that I have to tell someone who could possibly make sense or use of this, I am trying to reconcile the fact that I really don&rsquo;t believe in UFO&rsquo;s with seeing this thing, this just won&rsquo;t go away, silver saucers don&rsquo;t just float in the sky and its starting to mess with my mind, I am a very rational logical person not given to superstition or the like so I pass this information on to try to lay it to rest.I do not know what good this will do but to possibly validate other like sightings in that area, in any case the above I affirm to be as accurate in fact as I can testify.If for any reason you need anything that I did not think of here feel free to e-mail back to this address.

The object fell very rapidly. I&rsquo;m not sure the distance, but I would think it was pretty close. Maybe a range from 5 to 20 miles, depending on the size of the object. If it did indeed fall on the island of Oahu, it would have landed somewhere on the Wai&rsquo;anae mountain range. I don&rsquo;t believe it was an aircraft. I&rsquo;m not sure about flying saucers. I would more believe it to be a meteor. Either way, I&rsquo;m open to suggestions. I used &ldquo;Google Earth&rdquo; to show the direction of the fire ball I witnessed.

Initially I thought it was a bright star, but as it appeared to grow in size and move, I got a pair of 10x binoculars and went out on my porch to view the light.It appeared to descend down into the Suslota Creek drainage slightly below a 6400ft ridge that runs east to west on the north side of the drainage.  Several times the light was out of view because of the treeline.  The light then started to rise as if following the terrain and slope of Suslo Mountain 5 miles east north east of my cabin.  The altitude above ground level could not be determined, however, as it passed over the top of Suslo Mountain the light was close enough to the ground that the light green color reflected off the snow cover.The light then descended down toward the Tok Highway and seem to level off approximately 500-800 feet above the ground, traveling westward, then turned back to the northwest and began to ascend diagonally across the face of the mountains to the northwest of my cabin.  After reaching an altitude that was at least 1000 ft. above the mountains, the light moved off to the west north west.  Observation was lost at this time as the light was obscured by the mountains.The total time that the light was observed was 20 seconds. Weather at time of observation: wind 330 at 8kts, temperature -8F, baro 29.35, visibility cavu.  The straight line distance the light traveled while observed is approximately 35 miles.  There was no sound associated with the light, no satelite tv interference, nor did my housedogs or sleddogs react to the light. No distinct object shape or structure was seen, just a pastel pale green glowing light, similiar to a ball of St. Elmo&apos;s Fire or ball lightning. All turns and movements appeared to be deliberate, smooth and co-ordinated, and the speed at which it travelled appeared to be constant as best determined by this casual observer. No abrupt changes in speed or direction were noted.With nothing to compare size with in the darkness, I would estimate from the reflected light in the snow cover of Suslo Mountain and at the distance of closest observation of 3.5 miles that the light was 30 to 50 ft in diameter. From the east-west direction that the light was traveling to the point observation was lost,  it was obviously and deliberately terrain following along the southern slopes of the Alaska Range.It was by chance that I was sitting at my cabin window and glanced outside at the time of the initial sighting, had I been elsewhere in the cabin, it would not have been seen and there was no other unusual occurance or sound that would have brought it to my attention.  It would have passed totally unobserved.The observer is a 60 year old male, 40 year resident of Alaska, former Coast Guardsman, a license vessel Master, and Commercial Pilot with fixed wing and rotorcraft ratings.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we suspect that he is an exceptionally well qualified witness.

It could not have been Sirius as i&apos;ve been mesmerised by Sirius for some time now since i discovered what a previous sighting i had from home was the dog star via the greenwich observatory.This &apos;star&apos; as ill call it was so, so bright and just hung there in the sky.  it was constantly there just moving as we did so perhaps it may be explained as a planet.  it definately wasn&apos;t a plane as we came past stanstead airport and planes were taking off and landing and showing all characterristics of planes whereas this was just there.Stopping off at a place called Fourwentways in Cambridgeshire i could not see this &apos;star&apos; even though this is a open place and the &apos;star&apos; was so bright it should have been seen.Watching the skys as i always do on this long journey from Norfolk to London whilst keeping an eye out for this &apos;star&apos; i noticed on the horizon various other extremely white lights or &apos;stars&apos; and then every so often there would be a bright red &apos;star&apos; which appeared to move.  one going high into the air and then back down to earth again.  I assumed these were arials of some kind but i then say some closer ariels that you could make out to be arials that the red light didnt move on yet these other red lights moved.Just past Stanstead Airport almost on the borders of Essex in a field to my left was what looked like a huge circle of flame but it was in such a way that it could not have been a field on fire it was moreso a complete unmoving circle of flame but it was only lit 3/4&apos;s round and not a complete circle and it wasn&apos;t out of control as a field fire would be.So stunning to see and then it was gone.My partner saw the bright star i was looking at but he was driving thus concentration on the road was paramlount.  the only other witness was my 1 year old baby who i dont think would be abe to tell you anything!((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus in the southwest sky??

As we traveled about 50 yards, the driver decided to pull over and I do not know if the car stopped running or if it was on his own accord, the passenger (Martha) saw the object too. We exited the vehicle (a 1979 Datsun 210) which is when I saw the object moving across the sky. I previously was in the back seat and could not see what the others could see. The object we saw moved very slow, about 15 miles an hour, and did not have much sound to it. It was at tree top level (about 100 to no more than 150 feet above) Lights shot from the pointed end to the back of the object and then again to the forward point in different colors. It made a low humming sound. As it passed over us, we manuvured around the tree&apos;s, backtracking from where we had come from to get a better view of the object.

While growing up, two siblings and myself shared a bedroom. I&apos;m not exactly sure of the year, but I know my older sister was married and my other sister was married in 1973. I finally had my own bedroom. My brother was still @ home and sleeping. Mom and Dad of course were sleeping in their room. I would have been 20 years old @ the time. A bedroom window was over my bed. To the north of the house was a Maple tree which was outside my bedroom window. Early morning. Still dark outside. Clear sky. I was awoken by a very loud sound, that sounded like a low airplane. I wanted to see what the sound was so I got up on my knees and looked outside the window. What I saw has stayed with me for 33 years. Just above the tree-top was a disc shaped object that had colored lights at it&apos;s base. The lights seemed to have a pattern of rhythm changing in and out or maybe rotating.  It slowly moved just above the tree top heading north. I cannot remember a deafening loud noise at my window then, but a humm sound. It was summer. There was no motion of the leaves or tree limbs (like strong wind) when it passed over. I lost sight of it after it passed over the tree. I ran into the bathroom (which was the next room over)to look out that window (which faced the same direction) and it was gone. It&apos;s like it totally disappeared quickly. What&apos;s amazing to me is nobody else in the house was awoken by the LOUD noise. It&apos;s like I was the only one meant to see it. My brother, maybe 10 minutes later was up.

I was a student of Engineering  studying in Jabalpur (State MP) then and was visiting my parents during the summer break . On this hot evening between 4 and 5 PM (it was still bright enough), I was engaged in some conversation with my mother on the roof-top of our apartment when she pointed in a direction asking in an amazed manner, &quot; What IS that?&quot;  I gazed in the indicated direction to see what I can best describe as an Orange colored cloud flying (or floating at enormous speed) at an altitude much lower than that of normal clouds. It was quite far when I first noticed it, but in a matter of less than 10 seconds, it had crossed over and disappeared on the other end. (A normal air-craft would have taken more than 3 minutes to cover that distance). There was no sound or noise of any sort associated with this flying thing and neither had it any regular shape.  Just a random cloud shape. It could have easily passed for a cloud but for it unusual dark orange color and its super-high speed.  In my opinion, there was a solid object really flying but with the cover of a randomly shaped orange cloud around it that not only masked it&rsquo;s appearance but also perhaps suppressed any associated mechanical sound.  My father later informed me that many others in the neighborhood had mentioned having seen the &lsquo;fast-moving-low-altitude, silent-orange-cloud-like-thing&rsquo;.

The first was the moon and the 2nd was a BRIGHT white light below it located in the NW sky. The object caught my eye because of the size and location; it was much closer to the earth&rsquo;s surface than any other stars I have ever seen. It wasn&rsquo;t the North Star that&rsquo;s for sure. Also the brightness of this object was amazing. As I looked at this bright white light I notice every 10 to 15 seconds that it would put of a reddish pulse around the stationary white light kind of a glow. This object resembled a star. It was not moving in any direction .It looked like it was in orbit kind of but slowly descending from below the moon. I know this wasn&rsquo;t a star or airplane or satellite or anything I had ever seen before it was to close and to bright and the red pulse made it even stranger. At this point I was looking at it with my naked eye. I went in the house to grab my video camera the object didn&rsquo;t appear to be going anywhere. I set my camera up on a tripod what I would see next as I zoomed in on the object was truly amazing and unreal. At this point my wife and two next door neighbors were looking at this thing with binoculars. As I zoomed in and focused on the light the object took shape and color it was oval looking and would kind of tear drop on the top and bottom. The light it was putting off was bright white and energetic looking and you could see small black circles around the entire object almost like heat vapors and then it would pulse a reddish glow. It looked like jet burst from behind the object. The bursts were not consistent and would last about 2 seconds, but the object didn&rsquo;t appear to move. I now this sounds crazy but I got 45 minutes of this on video. I am trying to get it on my computer so I can send it in as well. The object would disappear into the fog layer that moved in.

All the lights were the same color as I has seen on the reported Phoenix Sighting several years ago.   I turned right on Lake Street (west) at the next intersection.   The lights were still there but the rear light was no longer visible.  I sat in my car and watched the lights for a couple of minutes.

After a while about 10 to 15 minutes later they all starting moving and dispersing from the sky; my friend was trying to take pictures with her camera phone but the resolution was very poor. I later went back to our office and I tried to contact the FAA to report it, but I was not able to get in touch with them, I called the 24 Hour Safety Hotline at 800-255-1111 and all I got was a recording but I never left a message about this incident.I hope this report is helpful to you, and should you find something relating to our sighting please let us know.

I was driving towards a red light at a corner, and over the trees up above we saw a cone-like object moving at modernate speeds but seemed faster than a convetional airplane.  It was moving rather slow, yet super fast, almost hovering . . . as an airplane wouldn&apos;t fly like this.  There was an intense white and yellow pulsating lights around it. The cone-like object seemed super small. Like half the size of my vehicle. So I would say that it was around 6 feet across, and around, at the minimum.  The object wasn&apos;t too high up, but the trees made it hard to see until it appeared that a plane was coming into its path and it did a complete 180 degree turn to the left and then went straight up. When I turned on the red light, I turned to see where it went but it was completely gone.  However, we did notice a very bright, unusal star hovering very high above.  But it was much larger than the object we had seen.  This very bright object was in path with the smaller object.

The sky was crystal clear blue with sunshine and no clouds at all.  I saw a rectangular shaped object with rounded edges to the west of Rt.11 which appeared snow white against the blue sky.  As I kept glancing at it as I drove, I realized that it was not moving.  It was hovering above the former Augusta Military School and Augusta Stone Church at approximately the height of a small plane or helicopter.  It did not appear to have any visible means of propulsion. There was another motorist pulled off on the right side of the road directly in front of the old school with their window down and appeared to be observing the object with binoculars.  The object gradually began to slowly move westward.  After turning left on the next road, I pulled off in front of the Fort Defiance High School to watch the object.  With no sound or any means of propulsion, it shot away to the west at a very high speed and was completely out of sight in less than 15 seconds. I am a college graduate who works at our local hospital and have lived in the area since 1975 after graduating from James Madison University. I have very good eyesight and know that I observed (as well as another motorist) something very unusual in the sky that day which can not be explained.

My friend and I witnessed a very very bright set of lights in the Northwestern sky.  They were triangular in shape.  I asked my friend what it was and neither of us could figure it out.  We were leaned forward in the car watching the light which was stationary only a couple hundred feet off of the ground.  As we got close to the light it suddenly blinked out, the sky just went black. There was no sound what so ever, and no trail left of any kind.  Suddenly a low flying plane came out of the north headed to the area where the lights were.  It circled around the area and headed back towards Whiteman Air Force Base.

Imagine a picture of clear night sky in Photoshop.  Take a small rectangular section and move it across the picture.  At first, I had the impression it was an aircraft without the usual lights a plane has when flying at night.  The only lights on this object, or these objects, since I could only see one after I turned and lost sight momentarily halfway through the sighting, resembled a faint group of stars, similar to the Pleiades, but fainter.  Since it was obvious this was no ordinary aircraft I removed my headphones to listen and I heard nothing.  I followed it for a total of about 30 or 40 seconds before I lost sight of it.  This is how something would look if you wanted to camouflage an object to move through the night sky without being noticed.  I suspect some sort of military aircraft, but the lack of sound baffles me.  Anything with a normal propulsion system would have to be very high to be silent and if so, based on the area of the object(s) and the angular speed, it would have to be incredibly large and fast.", "Large half circular object with small orange dotted lights at the straight ends of the half circle, other small white and coloured lights around the circular part of object.

I was standing by my car when I saw the light about 2 miles away. Then within a matter of seconds it was over my head moving towards the east. It was a bright amber sphere and was moving extremely fast without sound or without leaving a contrail. I tried to drive to keep it in my sight. By the time I had driven three blocks the object had moved about 15 miles eastward. I decided that it would be pointless to pursue any further since it had traveled so fast. After that I headed towards the northwest side of town where my friend lived. Just before arriving at his home, I saw the same object fly over me again at an incredible speed, this time toward the west. I called my friend since the object would soon fly over his home. My friend didn&rsquo;t believe me thinking I was making a joke. There were three of us at my friend&rsquo;s house, when about 21:30 I decided to make a food run. As I was driving I saw the same object again, but this time there were two objects one just above the other. I stopped my car to make sure that it wasn&rsquo;t a perception problem. I called my friend and immediately drove toward his home again. The three of us saw the objects slowly move, stop, hover, and move again. The movements of the objects were very erratic and they moved independently from one another. One friend, that was watching these objects with me, was in the navy and worked as an aircraft identifier on a carrier ship. He said that there was nothing to his knowledge that would exhibit that kind of movement and fly that close together. We watched these objects as they slowly moved across the sky.

I was driving in the northbound lane of I95 between Brunswick and Bodoinham Maine.  It was the late part of dusk, about 75% dark.  The object that I saw was on the opposite side of the highway, hovering perfectly still about 10-20ft above the tree line, which would make it about 50-60 feet in the air.The object itself was an equilateral triangle approximately 15-20ft on the side.  At each point, on the underside, was an almost painfully bright bluewhite light.  The sky was in the period of late dusk, but not entirely dark.  Thus, it was possible to see the edges of the craft more or less clearly in contrast to the sky.  The object was perfectly still, and made no sounds that I could hear, even after rolling down the window. Timeline: The part of the highway in which the sighting took place consists of a long gentle curve to the right, with the southbound side of the highway on slightly higher ground than the north.  As I began the curve, the object came into view.  It was very bright in the near-dark lighting conditions, and my first thought was that I was looking at some strangely lit new radio or cell phone tower, and even remember thinking, &quot;Gee, that&rsquo;s awful bright to put right over the highway like that at night, its as bright as a car&rsquo;s headlights on high beams.&quot;As I got closer to the object, I realized swiftly that as far as I could see, there was no tower supporting it.  It was at that time that I realized I wasn&rsquo;t looking at a normal object, so I slowed down considerably, and really did my best to take in as many details as I could before I drove out of sight.The object was triangular, and black as far as I could tell.  The corners and edges were very sharp and distinct.  I did my best to take in as many details as possible.  I rolled down the window to try to hear anything, did some mental evaluations of the height above the trees, which wasn&rsquo;t very great, and I tried to look at the underside, which I got a great view of from my angle as I drove by/under it.Something about what I was seeing made me uneasy.  I felt like I was missing a crucial detail, even as I did my best to get all that I could.  It wasn&rsquo;t until I sat down to start composing this account that I realized what it may have been, and it is simply this:  The bright, highbeam intensity lights on the bottom of the object did not light up the trees, the highway, or the underside of the object, which they clearly should have.  Looking back, something I felt that was odd was how completely black the underside of the object was.  When I say black, I mean black like it was almost absorbing light.  It is an eerie realization to make after the fact, because at the time, all I thought was how weirdly perfectly black it was.   It&rsquo;s the thing that now, in retrospect, makes me even more convinced that what I saw was out of the realm of the ususal.Something else that I thought was odd was that, despite the fact that there must have been 6-10 cars on the highway going in either direction, no one even slowed down or seemed to take notice of the object.  Admittedly, as interested as I was, I didn&rsquo;t stop either.  But it was something interesting to note.The final piece of possibly related information is that less than 5 minutes later, I saw a helicopter moving very slowly over the highway perpendicularly to road.  It moved from my side, over to the southbound side.  In more urban areas, the sight of helicopters is fairly common, but up in rural Maine it certainly is not, especially moving slow and low over the highway.  Now, there is a small airforce base in the Brunswick area, which might explain why it was there, but in the many years of traveling this route at least once a week if not much more frequently, never have I ever seen one.After traveling out of sight, I tried going over every reasonable explanation of what I saw in my head.  In the end, there were only two mundane explanations that are at all possible for what I saw.  The first is that it was a helicopter, since helicopters are the only conventional aircraft that can hover at that height.  However, the was no wind-displaced debris, as there would have been, and as close as I got with my window down, I would have heard it as well, which I didn&rsquo;t.  These details aside, the fact that I clearly saw a helicopter 5 minutes later at a very low altitude and a very slow speed means that it wasn&rsquo;t a helicopter.  The second possible mundane explanation was that it was in fact a new radio/cell phone tower.  Keeping this in mind, I specifically drove slowly along that stretch of road on my return trip looking for a tower, or for anything for that matter, that could possibly have given off that light.  Needless to say, had I found something, I wouldn&rsquo;t be filing this report with good people.Thank you very much for your time and consideration, and please feel free to contact me for any clarification or further questions you may have.", "One &quot;starlike&quot; light observed making rapid turns, accelerating and decelerating.I am ((xx)) years old now.

We were preparing to sleep under the stars at his farmhouse.  At about 11:00 PM, we were all laying on our backs looking at stars under a clear moonless night.   One of my friends pointed out a bright &quot;starlike&quot; light at about the zenith.  It was about the brightness of a zero magnitude star.  It was a single steady white light.  There was no apparent sound.  The light appeared to be a great distance away.  As we watched it, the light moved around the central part of the sky in a random path.  It sped up and slowed down.  It made abrupt turns at about 90 deg.  It moved around an area of sky about 10 degrees.  We watched it for a few minutes.  My friend ran into his house to bring out his telescope which was a department store 2 or 3 inch refractor.  Once he got the scope out and set up we lost the object in the sky.  We watched it for about 5 minutes total time.  Its brightness did not change.  Its movements were erratic and unlike an aircraft would make.  The turns were sharp, not like an aircraft.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We were watching the stars and just talking about life in general when all of a sudden we saw something moving. At first we thought it was maybe a star twinkling or even an airplane until it shot off. The object was no larger than any of the stars and looked no different other than it seemed to be blinking. We laid there in complete awe at its ability to dart in any direction, stop, and then continue to move rapidly throughout the atmosphere. It seemed to only stay in a small area of the sky rather than move around to many different corners of what was visible. We watched it for probably twenty minutes until it seemed to just disappear.

We were traveling by car from Barre, Vermont to a summer house on Nelson Pond in Calais, Vermont. I believe the time to have been about 8 pm, possibly a little later. It was dark outside already but there was enough light in the sky to see the silhouette of the tree line. We were driving up a small hill, with a field on either side bordered by woods. We were in a green Chevrolet Impala sedan with four doors. My older cousin was driving, I was in the right passenger seat, my younger sister sat in the middle. As we mounted the hill, we noticed a large bright ring of yellow and red lights in the sky to the left. It was relatively nearby, about 800 to 1200 feet in altitude is my guess, and it maintained its location for about 3-4 minutes. My cousin stopped the car and we just stared at it. I began to notice that the lights I had seen were on the bottom of a larger short cylinder shaped object. The cylinder was darkish brown, a little bit like anodized aluminum. The object was probably 5-6 times larger than the ring of light in the bottom. Rods or pipes, or maybe antennae extended from the sides of the cylinder. I remember thinking that there might be a window or a rectangle of light on the side of the cylinder, but that rectangle shape was not as intense as the ring of lights on the bottom. At first I was calm, and fascinated. Then my cousin locked her door, reached past me and locked my door, and might have locked the back doors. I noticed my cousin was edgy, and had tears in her eyes. My sister began to cry. The object began to move from left to right, which I believe was west to east. It did this quickly but also sort of jerkily, in a series of short quick moves. It maintained the same height for about I guess 3 minutes. It seemed like we were stopped for a long while. I remember the sound of the car, the headlights on the road, and the dashboard lights. The movement was from about 10:30 in the sky to about 1:00. Then it moved rapidly upward, a similar quality of motion: fast but a little jerkiness to it. The object stayed in that position another minute to two minutes and then rose upward again very fast until it was no longer visible. Almost immediately we began moving again. My cousin only said we&apos;ll have to tell our dad, and her husband, who we were meeting at the summer house with my mom. When we got to the summer house (we say camp even if it&apos;s quite finished) my dad and her husband were very dismissive. My dad suggested we had seen lights on a radio transmission tower. I knew we had not. Her husband joked about it. Many years later my sister and I from time to time draw what we saw. We will do it in separate rooms. And the pictures are very similar. On several occasions we have drawn the scene from a perspective outdoors, looking down on the green Impala. Once a friend who saw those pictures observed that it was curious we drew it that way given we were in the car. As a boy I was fascinated by space, the manned space program, and the possibility of space travel. I think that is why the initial response was just fascination, not fear, until my cousin began locking the doors. Later in life I wondered if what we had seen might have been a product of our defense intelligence, or a spy vehicle from the Soviet Union. Reports of similar experiences from mature friends, one in Wisconsin, and one in Maine makes me wonder about this. The edge of this thing were so sharp I can not imagine them to have been fog or vapor.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

When I reached the stop sign, there was a very bright light shining inside my car.  It was like a spot light from a police car.  I looked behind me and did not see a police car or any other vehicle.  I looked up and saw an orange light in the sky that wasn&rsquo;t moving.At a steady speed it came from a couple miles up to ground level in approximately 5 seconds.  It hovered over the ground about a 100ft away.  The craft looked like it was the length of a city bus.  I could see the grass moving as it rotated.  It stayed there for less than a minute. When it was at ground level the lights dimmed, and I could see the craft rotating horizontally like a wheel with blue colored lights blinking around it with white light coming off of it. It turned brighter and the grass was moving faster.It lifted and turned about 80 degrees and took off about 3 times faster than it came down.As it took off, the craft was a very, very bright blue. The whole craft was shining brighter than a light bulb, more like magnesium burning.When it left, my radio started going nuts. It stopped working. My car wasn&rsquo;t running. There wasn&rsquo;t even a light on my tape adapter (for CD). This shows I didn&rsquo;t even have the battery working. After the craft left, my car would not start for 1 minute. A minute later it came back on by itself and the radio did. I didn&rsquo;t have to turn the key to start it.I was able to take pictures of the craft (with my cell phone) as it was coming in, when it landed, and when it took off.The whole event seemed to take place in less than five minutes.I am concerned that I felt fatigued when the &lsquo;spotlight&rsquo; was on my car.

It demonstrates the very reasons I have not reported events to UFO center sites,  besides the fact that I would want to do illustrations and 3D simulations to show .In 1992 NASA&rsquo;s HRMS, High Resolution Microwave Survey, is launched at Goldstone Observatory outside Barstow, California and at the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico.  As I had a colleague doing art for them and was soon to be working with SETI and was also involved with NASA and the other astronomical organizations I was able to get my wife ((name deleted)) and myself invited to the Barstow event and the Goldstone ceremony.  I knew a few people there and a few astronomers I had worked with as well as a couple artist friends.  I felt an outsider most of the time not being able to afford the dinners and hotel events.  I borrowed a friends 8mm video camera and had my own SLR and lots of film, so spent most my time shooting the event.  I was able to meet Carl Sagan and was able to shake his hand and thank him personally for his work in educating myself and the public so beautifully with the PBS Cosmos series.  Just a few minuets with him though.We where bused into Goldstone on the military base for the ceremony where I shot film and video of all I could.  We had a great time participating in the historic event and got photos of Carl, friends and other dignitaries.   It was a good event and history in the making.  When it was over we just wanted to go relax somewhere.As was our tradition at the time, when we are down that far south we always try go through or stay a night in Death Valley, a favorite place to this day, having spent much time there hiking and camping as well as exploring through college and after.  My wife and I spent two weeks just below the monument for our honeymoon in 1980 and I had done several road trips and backpacking high in the mountains in the seventies.  So we where very comfortable in this desolate beauty and powerful nature spot.We arrived in the monument from our Barstow hotel in the late afternoon.  Not wanting to miss a shot at a sunset session there, we went to the sand dunes directly, grabbed our day-packs and photographic bags and a borrowed Hi8 video cam and ran (walked fast) out to the deep dunes.As we walked, my wife and I where having an argument probably due to our depleted neurochemistry from erratic sleep, road-food and stress.  As we stood 10 feet apart and speaking loudly at each other, about nothing I remember, all of a sudden a bright light in the sky over ((deleted--wife)) drew my attention.  I was facing mountain Tucki Mountain looking south across the Panamint Mt. range  The range was had mountains as high as up to 11000ft.   This Tucki Mt. was over 5000 ft. I know because by that time in my life I had climbed Telescope Peak there (11049 ft.) in 1976 and had hiked the valley many times, so was familiar with the distances and geography first hand.As I looked at the light I noticed it was like a super bright flare slowly arching down from what looked like a massive black triangle 70% oblique to me.  I estimated it was close to the mountains and probably we where at or below sea level, observed the object at about 4000ft I estimated.  I yelled at my wife to look!, thinking she missed the &quot;spark,&quot; but as she turned, another bright spark came out of the craft and flew slowly down and out.  What we where left with was a view of this seemingly football-field sized or larger black triangular shape with what I remember was maybe many colored lights on what looked like the leading edge.  It was moving slowly, silently and deliberately northward along the range. By that time it was dusk heading for twilight and the light was going.  I had film with ASA rated for daylight but attempted to get a shot after a few minuets of checking ourselves and confirming we where seeing the same thing.  I could not get any exposure, shot some blanks on the off chance they would show, but no luck.  The Hi8mm cam I had could not even show an image it was so dark.  In retrospect I could have narrated a detailed description on video.  I did not think over the ontological terror of seeing such a thing at the time. So we stood in the sand dunes for about 20-30 minuets watching as the object slowly moving north along the mountain range until we lost sight of it in the extinction, haze and darkness.  Our legs where like rubber and we where very excited and a bit concerned for our safety as we thought we where totally alone in the vast valley.  So we made our way deliberately to our car parked a mile back through the dunes.  As we reached the parking area we noticed a motorcycle had come while we where gone and parked with its owner sleeping on top of one of the few picnic tables.  I was too spooked and in too much of a hurry to wake the person and ask him if he saw anything or warn him of the possible danger we felt.   We headed rapidly for the Stove Pipe Wells campgrounds with our heads rotating 360 for any other sights.Later at home, I referenced topographic and standard maps of the area and noticed that just the other side of the range but several air miles south from Tucki Mountain was the military test range China Lake Navel Weapons Testing Range.   So the military is all over the place down there.So although I had no visual record of the event we experienced, we had solid memory as you might imagine.   This is the first time I have written about this.  I have told some friends, but that is all.  I am producing a documentary segment for the event in 3D high resolution animations.  I also have a Google Earth KMZ file showing the site.  Much more research also on file.So who would believe such a story?  An artist, a Sci-Fi fan and lifetime UFO interested person coming from a SETI event?  Not a chance.  I could have physical evidence and people would just laugh.  I would probably not blame them either.", "fire like triangular object  with sapphire blue cloud that pulsated  Lights On Object: YesI was at a stoplight in a car after picking up a friend from work facing north at 10:45pm.

The last sighting however was in Arizona. I work in telecommunications and I do a lot of traveling. This is a little out of date (Nov. 2005; date of the sightings) but I would like to share this with you because I read similar reports that occurred in Arizona. My account lasted for an hour and a half. I had been out to Parker Dam working and was on my way back to Phoenix. When I got back on I-10 at Quartzsite, right at dusk, I noticed an orange/red light that illuminated out in open desert (South of I-10) that appeared to be no higher than a distant street light. When I saw it I knew that in that area there was nothing but desert. I watched it as I was driving and it faded out and disappeared. I wondered what it could have been but I had no idea. A few moments later on the left side of the highway (North of I-10) at a further distance and higher in the sky I saw another red/orange light, it appeared like it was turned on with a dimmer switch. It came on dim and increased to a bright illumination and inreverse went completely out. At this point I began watching. For the next hour as I was driving toward Phoenix I saw numerous red/orange lights appearing slowly then brightening only to slowly disappear as they appeared. Some of the lights appeared close and a few seconds after one would go out another would appear but at a much further distance and then close again. I called one of my co-workers and was telling him of what I was seeing. I called my wife back in Kentucky and was talking to her as I was witnessing the appearance and disappearance of these lights. Up to this point I was only seeing one light at a time sometimes they would be five minutes apart or as little as twenty seconds and would be miles apart. When I was east of Tonopah I saw one light come on and this time it stayed on. Then a second and third came on and just hovered. This time it was right! beside the interstate and I know others had to see them because there was steady traffic. These three lights were stationary and stayed on for close to a minute then they individually went off in the order they appeared. I stopped after these three came on and got out with my digital camera to see if I could get a picture but they went off before I had the chance. I waited for about twenty minutes and never saw them again that night. For an hour and a half I observed these lights. At first I thought possibly they could have been flares but realized after about the first twenty minutes these were definitely not flares. These lights came on and were stationary and at times great distance apart and seen for a stretch of 90 miles.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I would say it was about 100 feet off of the ground. There was a light pulsing from the object that was somewhat like a strobe light although the lights did not move like a strobe light. The light was pulsing and was very bright, almost incandescent. I only saw the object for approximately 4-5 seconds and then it disappeared as if the light was suddenly turned off.

What I saw was the most profound experience of my life &ndash; it happened over the duration of my stay &ndash; I arrived on the 26th of December and every night from the 28th-29th I was visited by something in my room.  I had someone staying with me and he saw it as well.  The first night I was sleeping and was woken by a kind of grinding noise, like a car revving &ndash; I was laying on my right side of my body facing the wall which had curtains across it &ndash; when I woke I didn&rsquo;t immediately open my eyes, but I listened I thought it was something outside my window of my room &ndash; later I learned the curtains only covered a small window but they spanned the whole wall of my room.  I listened and when the sound got louder I opened my eyes.  Directly in front of my face, in my room, there was a ball of light &ndash; about the size of a basketball &ndash; it began to move way from me as soon as I opened my eyes.  It moved in and thru the curtains while moving away from me, but still in my room.  It got to the end of my bed &ndash; sound of the revving still present &ndash; then floated out my balcony window.  I stared at the wall directly in front of my face, and I could see the light thru it as it backed thru the forest &ndash; I could see the shadow of the plants and trees blowing the wind on the wall of the interior of my room.  Then slowly the light faded away and the wall became solid.  As I lay there I thought of every possible explanation: someone shining a flashlight in my room, I was dreaming &ndash; but I wasn&rsquo;t and they weren&rsquo;t &ndash; it happened.The second night I went to bed with the anticipation that something might happen again.  I had told my friend who was staying with me what had happened the previous night and he didn&rsquo;t believe, he thought I was dreaming.  We went in to our beds and turned out the lights, and I lay there for a bout 2 mins with nothing happening.  Then from the corner of the room &ndash; the opposite side from the window &ndash; I saw a light.  A small round light formed in the corner of the room, and it began to float over to me and floated across the room and over the foot of the bed until it was directly over my body.  The ball of light was slightly different from the other &ndash; it was bluish in color and had tentacle like streams of light coming from it.  If I had to draw a parallel to something &ndash; I would say a jellyfish, but it wasn&rsquo;t a jellyfish.  I woke my friend up by calling his name &ndash; I didn&rsquo;t turn on the light and I told him to look and tell me what he saw and he said he saw it and he described it as I saw it there floating in my room.  We were both quite shaken over it and turned on the light - after several minutes of talking about it, rationalizing it we turned the light out &ndash; and we could see it floating there still.  I asked him to turn the light on again and when he did &ndash; the light wouldn&rsquo;t come on immediately &ndash; instead it flickered, like an old movie reel &ndash; we could still see it &ndash; the flickering of the light allowed us to see it still as if the light was on &ndash; the light flickered for what seemed like forever, but was only a couple of seconds.  When the light came on &ndash; I have to admit I was terrified.  Then I heard a sound &ndash; like a plane coming from a distance, but the sound became louder and louder &ndash; then I realized it was the same sound from the night before &ndash; like an engine revving, but clearer, more defined and definitely louder.  My friend said it was it was in the room &ndash; I know it was there and it was loud and frightening, there was no light show or anything &ndash; the room was lit and I couldn&rsquo;t see anything, but the so! und was there and then all of a sudden it wasn&rsquo;t.  We slept with the lights on that night.", "There were nine or ten of these object flying everywhere and seemed to come from the dull star in the West.I took my dog out really late last night, when I noticed a different colored star in the sky, kind of dull looking, West in the sky.  Then I noticed that there was an object that had come out of nowwhere by the dull looking star.I first thought that it was a plane.  Then it moved in quick zig-zag and stopped and continued to go East across the sky, it had red and white flashy lights on it and moved much to fast to be a plane!!  And there were more of whatever that was flying through the sky and coming out of the dull looking star.The object got lower and lower and then looped around and went straight down infront of me, it was probably 40 feet away.  The object was straight up and down with red lights on it and white flashy lights on the bottom of the object.  It seemed to be stopped in the air about 10 feet from the ground.  The red lights on it reminded me of the towers you see for planes to land at night.I was so scared I could hardly move, I managed to back up and get in the door, I ran down the stairs to get my mother up to see these things.  When we got back outside, the object that was infront of me was back up in the sky and there were 9 or 10 of them flying all over.  They almost looked like planes but then they would stop, or zig-zag, or if one was going East it would suddenly stop and start going West and then stop and continue East again.  They seemed to mainly all be flying towards the East.My mother was trying to rationalize what see was seeing, she would say maybe the government is testing something new, but the UFO&apos;s were all flying from something in the sky.I woke my sister up next to see the UFO&apos;s and she decided to get the binoculars out, but we couldn&apos;t catch any of the moving objects.  Then I looked at the star they were coming from.  My sister looked after I did and we both saw tiny green dots where the star looked like it was.  The dots seemed to be lighting up whatever it was, a ship, a run away for the UFO&apos;s?

I then immediately pointed out that  there was one &quot; ODD &quot; smoke coloured trail that ended abruptly which looked like something got shot out of the sky.  As we approached Highway 10 or so we saw a blue white strobe lighted line going from south to north...however, nothing was visual except the lights.  I immediately suggested that this is a remote drone of some sort.   it hovered in the northwest over the Halton hills for about 5 minutes.   As we approached Erin Mills parkway we encountered a very bright flash in the vicinity of the delta Hotel, many other motorists saw this flash....which was only about 500 feet up.  cars breaked to get the visual, which lasted about 4 seconds. It was way too low for a meteoroid, meteorite.  As we passed highway 25 things got very interesting....I noticed a very unusual light signature in the sky which wasn&apos;t a plane....it was a looong streak of bright spot light.  I told my wife immediately that this wasn&apos;t &quot; A PLANE &quot;....well it WASN&apos;T.....we pulled over on highway 401 near cambellville...and watched the spectacle while others obliviously drove on by !   IT WAS A LARGE AIRLINER BEING FOLLOWED BY A SMALLER aircraft flying at subsonic speed.  never have I seen this formation before, both planes were separated by approx. 1,000 feet or so.

I am assuming my observations were correct...a military , spy or drone exercise was carried out over southern ontario at dusk on march 11, 2007.  the telltale signs were the odd vapour trails which were clearly visilble when we were over toronto.   The drone observation and bright flash took place over  Mississauga, with the last of the! vapour flash right over Erin mills parkway and the 401.  whoever else saw this please post...this wasn&apos;t a normal occurance as i am well educated with the night skies.  I was initially pointing out Venus to my wife when this all unravelled.    Our friends saw this bright flash from all the way down in detroit.  something was going on.

They were black and flying at a very low altitude.  They weren&apos;t moving fast, in fact unusually slow for any aircraft, slower than even a bird would normally fly.  One could say they were hovering but moving at a very slow pace.  I was in the library studying for school at the time the sighting occurred.  I just happened to look out the window I was sitting next to, and there they were. I also saw a light on the object.  I couldn&apos;t tell if there was a light on all three of them, but I only saw one light appear at a time.  The light may have been blinking, or I may have only seen it every so often because the object was rotating.  It was hard to tell what exactly happened although these objects were very close to me.  They changed directions like this while all three of them remained in a very tight formation all moving the exactly the same speed.  They did not slow down to move around one another or anything. What really seemed out of the ordinary was that the objects were extremely close to one another.  At times it was hard to tell if there was more than one of them; not saying that they became one at any point, but that is how close they were.  The rotated around one another, perhaps in a circle each one taking turns being the lead craft. They left my sight however as my view became obstructed by the edge of the building.  I then moved to another window to see them, but I did not see them again. Also peculiar was that there seemed to be more jets than usual after I saw the objects.  Now I have just moved to the city about six months ago, but I know where the airport is and what it looks like when jets and planes leave for takeoff or come in to land.  I saw three different jets, too far away to tell if they were commercial airliners or fighter jets, but it was very unusual.  Usually when looking into the sky there may be one plane every ten minutes that one could see in the sky from where I was, for there to be three at once was very unusual.  They were flying at seemingly random areas of the sky, not anywhere near where they would be if they were coming in to land or were just leaving the airport.  The jets also seemed to be climbing in altitude at an unusually high pace, for whatever reason, but I do not think that commercial airliners would climb at this high of a rate.  Whether this had anything to do with the objects I saw, I do not know, but I do know that this alone was very unusual. After I saw this occur, I went out again to see if anything else was out there, but there was no sign of any strange objects.  I then went inside while the jets were still flying above me. I could not unfortunately get a picture of the objects as the camera I have on my phone is could not take a clear picture of the bright sky.", "Seing is believing!I was getting off the bus from the airport, I looked up and I told my dad  &quot;look that&apos;s strange!

I figure that the altitude was about 6 to 7 thousand feet high.  It was the size of a big watermelon and shiny.  We were still looking at it when from zero forward speed, took off with no sound and in a blink of an eye went eastward leaving a long comtrail.  We heard a loud exclamation and there was a soccer game and almost 100 people watching the game and they saw the craft very close to them and they saw it move to the location where we first saw it.

He said as soon as the NCO&apos;s went to bed he saw the craft in the revine to the west of our position.Not knowing what to do he hopllered for anyone.Only the next day would one of the NCO&apos;s report he heard him holler but could not get up.He was a seasoned military man and this behavior was abnormal.The next thing the guard related was three beings exited the craft and came towards him saying &quot;in his mind don&apos;t be afraid we don&apos;t want to hurt you&quot;.The guard became hysterical and threw an aiming stake at the three objects.The next thing he relayed was one of the beings was behind him so he ran away about one quarter mile to another training site.Trying to get some of the other members there to come back with him with no success they calmed him and said wait until daylight.He did so and came back to our position at daylight and said he saw a silver cigar shaped craft in the revine and thought to himself we all must be dead.He ran back to the previous position and relayed the information to them.Still they would not come with him to our position.We awoke to find no guard on duty and at the same time saw the guard aproaching us from the hill crying saying I thought you were all dead.That is where the story began for me.This guard was exited from our company and the commanding Colonel said since only one person saw the actual event he couldn&apos;t file an official report.The tracked 13 ton vehicle I drove was completely fried as far as electronics  go.I have no doubts I will ever know what happened this night but wish I could.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Around 11:00 P.M., he noticed the big dipper.  But something was wrong becasue there were two (kind of overlapping each other), but one of the sets were moving at a exceptional speed. The set of the seven stars in the form of the big dipper were going south by south west.  Later the rest of my family came out and witnessed it to.   As we looked closer I also noticed that a few of them had little red light probes going around it (though very hard to see).  Some may say that stars don&apos;t move becasue of clouds or something, but we measured the distance with our roofline and other stars.  Other starts weren&apos;t moving, just that &quot;big dipper.&quot; Eventually after 30-60 min it disappeard.

Noticed that the &apos;satellite&apos; was really moving fast compared to the normal amount of time for satellites.  Object then changed course in a tight curve (at that speed, current tech, gotta be about a 5 - 9G turn at what sure looked like 3,000+ mph) and proceeded straight again for about 10 seconds where it met up with another &apos;satellite&apos;.  At this point the two objects started doing a criss-cross of flight paths, while making another high speed tight turn (tight being defined as hold out hand at arms length, spread thumb and forefinger, the turn occured within that space at arms length...tight turn.).  Both objects continued criss-crossing each others flight path while making two more turns &apos;together&apos; before I lost them in the light pollution of the city.  Objects were dimmer than the airliner I initially spotted, no visible running/collsion light on either of them, no visible plume like the airliner.  Airliner was at an estimated 25,000 - 30,000 feet in altitude (assuming that would be normal over Calgary, AB when not stopping) and the first object was noted to pass behind the plume from the airliner. It is possible that it could be modern fighter craft, but it would have to be one tough model of aircraft to execute that kind of turning.  If so, very impressive...and very impressive G-Suits too considering...", "While traveling home after shopping and running a few errands, I noticed a bright light that seemed to be following at a fixed distance. It was too bright to be star/planet. It did not have the blinking lights of an aircraft, but rather a fixed bright light.  It followed parallel to me for several miles, then I took a 90 degree turn towards bright light and it continued to maintain the same distance despite traveling approximately 5 miles towards it. I took another 90 degree turn and once again it maintained a parallel flight pattern. I then took another 90 degree turn and it followed behind at a fixed distance. I repeated the rectangular pattern of travel and the light maintained an equal distance. At this point I drove straight in an attempt to outdistance the light and it grew smaller indicating that it was in fact flying relatively close to the surface.  I continued direction of travel and light grew dim, but when I made a 90 degree turn I noticed the light maintained a parallel flight pattern albeit at a greater distance than before.  I then drove toward the light once again and it then rapidly grew distant and small. It appeared that several aircraft in the area with blinking lights also may have seen the light as they were seen hovering in the area.((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of NUFORC?

I want to emphasize that I did not witness a UFO during the time period described. Back in 1978, when I was in high school, I vividly recall a major UFO Flap that occurred in February and March of that year. My friends and I were very excited by it because almost every day there were reports on the local news and radio about another UFO sighting. Some of them were quite spectacular.  However, this major UFO flap seems to have been forgotten in the UFO literature, so I did some research at a local university library of The Detroit News from that time period. I was disappointed that only one article was written during that time. The article has been sent electronically via email. It discusses some of the UFO sightings, but not all of them.  The one I remember most distinctly occurred during afternoon rush hour.  The local television news reported that many witnesses reported a low flying UFO buzzed down the I-96 expressway in Brighton, over hundreds of cars. Apparently, many people got out of their cars to get a better look.  This occurred a week or two before the report about the UFO following the park rangers, which is in the article. I asked a coworker if they remembered the flap.  He said that he did. Surprisingly, he went on to explain that his father was a narcotics detective for the Detroit Police Force and that one of his father&rsquo;s friends flew the police helicopter. During the time period in question, the Detroit Police helicopter pilot stated that a UFO followed his helicopter. He tried to lose it but could not. I wonder how many other incidents like this may have occurred that were never reported. I will continue to inquire regarding this interesting time period.  Perhaps other readers of your website remember this flap also and can add further details or historic sources.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

After supper I would be the one to wash dishes and look out the window.  Most nights I was entertained by watching the red lights in the sky.  I tried several times to get my mother to come in and look at them, but she simply didn&rsquo;t find it as interesting as what was on TV.  She saw them but said it must be airplanes (Even though they didn&rsquo;t move!).   I have asked her if she remembers this and she doesn&rsquo;t.  It is very odd to me that everyone I have talked with doesn&rsquo;t seem to remember seeing them. When we went to basketball games we would gather at the back of the bus and watch these lights follow us.  This went on for months and months.The lights were red and perfectly round. They didn&rsquo;t glare but were bright.  It is hard to say how big they were, but when I saw one next to a window at a neighboring house they appeared to be about two feet across, maybe less.  They never moved--they would appear, disappear and reappear somewhere else.  The number varied. Most times there was only about five, but I counted about 15 one night.  They would appear up in the sky in perfect geometric formation. If there were four they would appear in a square, evenly spaced. If a fifth light joined them it would appear at ninety degrees. Sometimes they would have a couple of different groups. If one would disappear from one group it would appear with the other one. There was a vacant house about 1/8 mile up the road that had a security light. A light would disappear from the group and appear at different places around the vacant house. It was like something was checking it out.  I never saw one around our house.Often I would go to sleep in my bed by the window watching the lights.  I was totally amazed. What was more amazing was that nobody else thought it was worth noticing.They made no sound. Have you ever gotten any reports like this?  Surely I&rsquo;m not just imagining this! I have a couple of other things to ask about as well if you are interested.  Like strange marks on the back of my hand, like a brand.   And a glowing globe of light, very large that hovered over my car.I would appreciate some feedback. Thanks((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date.

Long enough for all of us kids to go get our parents and they were standing out there looking at it too. I don&rsquo;t remember if I walked closer to look at it but it seemed to me that if I had stood on the block wall that circled that apartment complex I could have touched it.

I don&rsquo;t remember feeling afraid or in danger.  I can&rsquo;t even remember it going away or if it was there so long that I lost interest.

PD))", "Multi-light triangle shaped UFO over Caribbean Ocean, as viewed from a cruise ship.The following is an account of a real UFO sighting from the balcony of a cruise ship in the Caribbean in 2002.  I&rsquo;m not sure why I have waited this long to file this report, but once an ardent skeptic of most UFO tales, everything changed on a late summer night in the Atlantic Ocean.  So although late in arriving, here is my story:  On August 27, 2002, while cruising aboard the ship Carnival Pride, I woke up from a deep sleep, only to find myself oddly sitting on the edge of the bed, facing our cabin&rsquo;s patio door.  The drapes were drawn.  I do not know what alerted me to arise from my sleep, nor can I explain what prompted me to go out onto the cabins private balcony that early morning.  It was approximately 2:30 am.  As I stepped out onto the balcony, I moved forward to the balcony railing.   Our ship was roughly 200 miles out from land, with the first destination stop, being Half Moon Cay, Carnival&rsquo;s private island.  Our cabin was positioned on the port side of the ship, facing west, traveling in a southerly direction. At first glance I was drawn to the front of ship, as the moon was out and nearly visible through a small bank of clouds.  The illumination of the moon cascaded over the dark blue pristine waters below.  Then I proceeded to glance upwards, staring straight port side.  To my amazement I spotted a very large cluster of multicolored lights. One light appeared to be very bright and white at its center, while a series of smaller individual lights of blue, green and red surrounded it.  I can&rsquo;t be sure, but it appeared very much as if its shape were triangular. My best guess is that it was approximately 70 degrees off horizon and its scale, although difficult to determine would have covered a bald fist at arms length.  By this determination, I gather that this object was very large and probably close.  It did not move or make a sound.  It merely hovered.  A very slight misty cloud obscured about 25% of the visible object. It took a few minutes for my brain to register what it was seeing. I watched it for about 10 seconds.  I was stunned! It definitely was not a plane. It was also unlikely a helicopter, especially given the distance from any land mass. I must admit, despite the initial state of shock, I was quite proud of myself, in that I immediately recognized the rare nature of this observance and quickly took action.  It registered with me, that only a photo or a video of this object, would exonerate me of any embellishment, should I choose to share this unbelievable sight with another.  So the following actions occurred within the frame work of 7-9 seconds:  I quickly remembered I had left our camera bag, just inside the patio door, on the floor, out of the way of the normal traffic aisle. The small quarters of our cabin made this a logical storage place.  Coincidentally, it would also offer me the shortest distance in retrieving the cameras and film this object.  As I turned to open the door, I placed one foot inside our cabin, keeping my other foot outside, thereby propping the door open.  I reached in for our video camera and as I backpedaled to the open balcony railing again, I opened the lens case, activated the camera, all at the same time.  This is why I reference the time frame of 7-9 seconds.  Why is this important? It will become perfectly clear with my next testimonial. As I swung the camera upwards and toward the direction of the object, to my utter dismay, it was gone.  It had simply vanished. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. Only a few seconds had passed.  I was however, not deterred.  I noticed off in the distance, a very small but bright light.  At first I thought it might be a planet, such as Mars, which as I recall, was highly visible in the Western sky at that time of the year.  I still decided to zoom in and film it, in the event it might have been what I watched in total astonishment a few seconds earlier, and twenty-times larger!  I took nearly two minutes of video.  I used the railing cap to steady my camera.  While I realize, that a digital camera, zoomed to a near infinite range, can cause square pixilation&rsquo;s and that some subjects, illuminating brightly as a source, can create false images, such as a rainbow effect with twinkles of various colored lights; what I saw, was something far different. It seemed to have a single image of light, countered by the surprise emergence of a second (different) colored light from behind.  Then a third colored light.  I don&rsquo;t think Mars would react that way. At that point, I felt I had recorded a sufficient amount of tape to make a convincing case for something obviously unidentified as nothing short of an unexplained, unidentified flying object (UFO).  It was now time to wake up my wife. While keeping our two children sleeping, I would soon add a second set of eyes, in a sanity check, to see if I was imagining the whole thing.  I went inside our cabin and awoke her.  Despite her groggy state, like a good trooper, she trudged out on the balcony with me, to add an equal witness to this sighting.  While she manned (woman) a set of binoculars, I continued to film the subject.  Once again and much more clearly, a red object immerged from behind the larger brighter object, as if hovering or orbiting around it. The mystery only became more bizarre, as within minutes of the sighting, a group of three ships floating on the water, off in the distance, suddenly appeared.  I know for certain that they were not there before.  After discovering them, my film shows at least one of them floating on the surface. To conclude, I can only surmise the following:  Did (what ever it was) possess some artificial intelligence that flagged it of my observing presence on deck?  If so, did it react by speeding away at an incredible rate (as I&rsquo;ve heard of, in other cases) to avoid a video camera image that clearly would have rivaled the one I eventually captured?  To film it at maybe 1-2 miles away vs. perhaps 20 miles?  I&rsquo;ll never know.  And what significance did the surprise appearance of three smaller vessels on the ocean have to do with this experience.  I have enclosed snapshot pictures or frames of the video I shot.  I have kept the video to myself.  As of this writing, after 4 &frac12; years, only 6-7 other people know of our UFO encounter.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We were in a large open field, approx 30 acres.  We had a good view of a clear night sky.

We looked around 360 degrees and saw no fire anywhere.  We watched this &lsquo;ember&rsquo; fly across the sky, rising and falling and looping around until it had flown out of sight behind the tree line.Observations:  It looked and moved like a glowing ember off of a fire.It was not close to the ground and appeared to be extremely high in the sky, or even in space.

I saw a craft come down off of Morrison Mountain, following the contour of the ground about 250 ft from the surface. It went by us, 100 ft to the north, and continued along the river valley, and went around Blacktail Mountain out of our line of sight. The craft was traveling 25 mph and made no noise at all.

They left the area separately and they all flew in a northwest direction.  It looked like there was a mother ship hovering above that was much larger with different lighting. Took some pictures.  There is absolutely no doubt in my mind these were UFO&apos;s", "Extremely bright light lit up huge area behind hill, happened 5 times then somehting flew over us.Whitianga is a small tourist town next to a river, harbour and beach in the north island of New Zealand.I live in Auckland and drove to Whitianga to work on a yacht I had bought there.  The yacht was moored at the furthest end of the river, I travelled there with two friends of mine; all of us are in our 40&rsquo;s. We arrived at the boat ramp just before midnight; it was a very clear night, with no wind.  As Whitianga is in the country, the stars there are very bright and we had often seen shooting stars.  The countryside there is very hilly with a mountain range between us and Auckland on the opposite side of the river.  Auckland, our biggest city is about 100km from Whitianga. I reversed the car down the boat ramp and proceeded to unload my inflatable and the rest of the gear with Barry.  After about a minute I heard one of my friends, Peter yell out.  He said, &quot;What is that!&quot;  Barry and I turned around; Peter was looking at the other side of the river.  We replied, &quot;What?&quot; Because we couldn&rsquo;t see anything.  Then, after about 2-3 seconds, a huge bright light, absolutely massive, lit up the entire sky for about 2 seconds then went of again, after 2-3 seconds it came on again.  It did this 5 times, including the time that Peter saw it without us. The light was so bright, and covered such a vast area that I could only imagine that a nuclear explosion could cause something like that. After the fifth time, there was a pulsating light that covered a very wide area of the sky above us and was traveling over us, it was not very bright, but we could see it, and it also made a very low kind of growling noise like a dog snarling, but duller, it passed over us and was gone. I had seen UFO&rsquo;s on two other occasions, but both Barry and Peter were skeptics, needless to say, they aren&rsquo;t now.", "Green and white flashing light over Bushey, Hertfordshire, England. has been observed for past 40 mins.The object has been observed for the past 17 minutes, and as I write is still visible in the night sky. Weather conditions are fine and clear with excellent visibility and a full moon.  It is at present situated 149 degrees SSE and I calculate it to be approximately 23 degrees above the horizon.After first sighting the object, I mistook it for a bright star/planet.  However, as I watched I noticed that the object was flashing the colours white/green/white/green and so on.  I instantly dismissed what I thought was a star/planet for an aircraft.I returned inside my house and gave the object no further thought.I returned to my rear garden between 5 and 10 minutes later to discover that the object was and still is, clearly visible.  My interest now aroused I decided to study it.  I called to my wife and pointed out the object to her, and what I had already seen.As we began to watch, I had a feeling that the object was not in the same position it was when I had first seen it, unfortunately I could not be sure. I timed our study which lasted 17 minutes. Within this time we saw the object move in a manner I would describe as follows; far to slow for a plane, too high and in one position for too long to be a helicopter and too fast for a satellite.The constellation of Orion is clearly visible in the south eastern sky and having just looked the object is now in the 8 o&apos;clock position as you look at the constellation.

The object made no noise. It was very close to the ground. It went no higher than seven thousand feet. Two other people witnessed this sighting. There was only one object. The lights within it were colors of green and blue with some red. The lights looked like stars almost. The lights were all moving together in unison. The lights were all the same size.

I had napped previously, so was not drowsy.  I happened to look up at the bright stars in the clear sky and noticed what looked like a group of shooting stars coming down from the extreme upper right cornerof my field of vision (traveling fast, from SW to NE).  I expected them to fizzle out, but, instead, they halted and a globular formation of probably five to seven bright, white balls appeared, perfectly spaced.  They hovered high above the highway, to the south of it,  each ball appearing much larger than an aircraft, smaller than the moon, not blinking but shimmering somewhat. I pulled the car over and watched as they hovered there, appearing to be at about the height of a helicoptor, with no apparent change in color and no sound.  Suddenly, the group of lights disappeared, then reappeared very quickly to the north side of the highway--as if they had just shifted in unison, apparently not changing configuration at all.  After a few seconds longer, they just shot off abruptly to the NE, rising at about a 45 angle--just as they had appeared, but reversing the pattern and looking again like shooting stars.  It left me awe-stricken.I reported this on another site, but never heard back from them, then finally contacted a group headquartered in Denver and have just been told to check your site for the many other sightings of similar ball-shaped lights which occured over Colorado at just about this same time.  I was stunned to read all of these reports, but also gratified to have some confirmation that others may have seen the same thing. I have never seen a UFO before, but I firmly believe that to be the only possible explanation for what I know I saw.  I am a high school teacher who works in Denver but I commute on weekends to my family home in Montrose; I know the route well.

At first I thought they might be a pair of sea gulls but they didn&apos;t move - they stayed in the exact same spot. We had some high altitude cloud whisps  in the general area but they were not clouds - they were too white and very distinctly formed. I watched the objects for approx 30 seconds and then moved to a different position to get a better look and when I returned to that part of the sky they were gone. While the objects were visible I mentioned to another construction worker but he didn&apos;t bother to look. Approximately 5 to 10 minutes later I happend to look up again out of curiosity and spotted a single white round object moving slowly from west to east. I first spotted the object to the west - what I would estimate to be over the hills that seperate Castro Valley (in the west) and Dublin - this object appeared to be in a high altitude as well, but not as high as the first 2 objects. This time I was able to get the construction worker to look up and he thought it was a balloon - which was my thought as well as it was moving very slowly but in a staight line. As it passed over head I moved to adjust my view again and when I looked back up it was gone. This happened 2 more times over the next approx half hour. The third object was almost in the same exact spot when I spotted the second and it moved just as slow and in a straight line from west to east only this time it was red. Again as it passed over head I adjusted my view and again it was gone.  The third and last time this happened the object was again white, it moved in the exact same path that the previous white and red object had moved, at approx the same speed, but this time I kept my eyes on it (thinking that it maybe a balloon again) but after it passed overhead, it proceeded a ways - to what I would estimate to be the Altamont Pass hills area east of Livermore - and! then it stopped!  I continued looking and I used my hardhat brim to try to see if it was still moving, I kept my head absolutely motionless and used the Satilite Antenna on a distant hill as a reference point to make sure I wasn&apos;t moving my hardhat at all. The object was still in the same spot that it had stopped in but it was becoming dimmer and that&apos;s when it came to me that it must be moving up.

About halfway across the lake it shifted and started flying towards queen anne hill.  Once over the hill it started to fly towards the city once again unitl it turned west and flew out over the water and out of sight.  I first thought it may be a group of balloons that had gotten loose but quickly realized that was no possible as the object was spinning at a constant rate too fast to be balloons.  Also, the object never really gained any real elevation throughout the whole time I saw it.  The object was about the size of a very small aircraft, except that it was round.

Multiple following sightings.Returning home to Yakima winding up I-82 south of Ellensburg, WA, I noticed many lights in the sky moving below the low cloud cover to the west of me. I-82 climbs a large ridge a few miles south of Ellensburg. It was a very dark night so the many various color light stood out. When they first caught my attention they were a few miles away from my position. The clouds cover was solid and low over the Umtanum Hills. I watched them with interest as I continued winding up the highway which goes over this ridge. My memory is of alternate red, yellow, green, and white lights in a circle with no specific pattern of appearance or distance between.At first I thought it might be helicopters from the US Army Firing Center but the lights had no familiar pattern that I could identify. My curiosity caused me to stop my car on the shoulder so I could study the object. At first I just rolled down my window expecting I might hear the familiar sound of the helicopters (which is what I tried to convince myself it must be). Hearing no sound, I then shut off the ignition, turned out my lights and then eventually stepped out of my car. I do not remember seeing another car on the highway going in either direction.There was a light wind blowing from the direction of the lights and I strained to hear any sounds. There was none except that of the wind. The UFO moved slowly on a level plane north of the ridge. Now as the lights got closer I could see it was large and I got more frightened as it got closer. now I knew I was seeing my first UFO.It was approaching slowly but steadily in my direction. There was no decernable sound at all coming from the UFO. I wanted to get back in my car and speed away but I didn&apos;t want to draw attention to myself. I now shivered in the wind but was afraid to open the car door to show any lights.The object seemed to stop directly above me for a few moments. The sky was black with clouds.  It did not appear to be a perfect circle but neither could I say it was eliptical. Size of the UFO would only be a guess because I really didn&apos;t know how high above me it hovered but its size as I saw it there would have more than spanned the 1/2 of the freeway I was traveling, maybe 300 feet end to end as I saw it. I strained to see more but all I could make out were the lights which I guessed was the perimeter of the UFO. The lights were constant and not flickering. Soon it proceeded its tract to my east and eventually moved over the ridge south where I lost sight of it.As soon as it was out of sight I got in my car and raced up the highway wanting to get over the ridge and get another look at it. As I drove I couldn&apos;t help but wonder what the hell I saw, and then began to wonder how long this experience had taken. I hadn&apos;t thought to check the time.I got to the top and started down the other side of the ridge. As soon as I got to an open area where I could scan the area, I stopped my car and scanned the sky. About 1 mile further down the road from this point is a military parking and staging area. The UFO was not visible but I noticed what looked like the 2 red tail light bars of an older Ford T-Bird in the sage brush beyond the parking area. I thought it odd that a car would be where it was when the two lights suddenly seperated and in an instant went different directions over the hill away from me (a distance I guessed at being about 2 miles away).Struck in awe at this second sighting, I sat there a while longer. A couple minutes later I saw two lights going through the brush in the same approximate location as the previous lights had disappeared. These lights looked like they were the lights of 2 motorcycles, like 2 riders were racing each other through the brush, except that 1 light disappeared down out of sight and the other shot straight up and dissappeared in the night sky.I sat here for maybe 15-20 minutes wondering if I might see something more before I proceeded south toward home in Yakima. As I was going down a slow grade toward a bridge which spans what I think is called Indian Creek I couldn&apos;t help but notice the area was well lighted. I stopped just short of the bridge. Up the creek to the west, hidden from my direct view I could see the area was well lighted, almost like Las Vegas was just around the bend. I was tempted to jump over the fence and climb the hill to see what was happening. This is government property well posted and part of the Firing Center so I decided it had to be a military operation.I proceeded home it was now about 2:30. I called the Army Base, asked for the duty officer and reported the lights and activities up Indian Creek, asking if there were any military exersizes going on. He said there were none. I left out the UFO part afraid they might figure I was a nut. The duty officer said he would send someone to investigate and promissed to get back to me. The following day I called and asked for the same officer and was told there was no such person ever on that base. There was no record of my report and no investigation was noted.In retrospect, it is about 35 miles between Ellenburg and Yakima on that highway. What would have normally been a 1/2 hour drive took me about 2 - 2 1/2 hours. It didn&apos;t seem like I was there that long but I can&apos;t honestly tell you how long I watched the first UFO or how long it stood over me. I went from curiousity to awe to fear and then finally relief.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It moved across the window within 1-2 seconds and disappeared behind trees while never losing altitude. My feeling was that it was both very large and high up, out of the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, or about the size of a small plane and flying at a higher altitude a small plane would fly at.

We took a picture of it because it would float by each night at the same time -when I took the picture and the flash went off -four large red lights flashed on at the bottom of the craft blinking in this order first, third, second, fourth The object was quite large and as it went over our building I noticed that the bottom of the ship was a huge conglomeration of microchip configurations-there was no empty space except the space occupied by the lights. It appeared to have a mesh or screen like covering over the bottom-this had to have some sort of feet to land, there is no other way.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I am a professional who works in the medical field radiologic imagery (not X-ray).  This incident occurred when I was 14 years old.It may seem strange to describe the exact circumstances of my observation, but you have to see this through the eyes of a teenager.  I had a cassette player which was the type that your regular portable unit which was about the size of an elongated cigar box.  My parent&apos;s house was about 5 blocks from the ocean.  At night, the next door neighbor would come over and she would sit at the dinner table with my mom and talk for hours.  So, to play my music and get away from my surroundings, I would take refuge by easily ascending to the rooftop by clmbing a palm tree via the ac unit.One evening after dusk, 9pm, I was listening to music, not to loud on the rooftop, when suddenly, the tape stopped playing.  At first, I thought the batteries died, but I could see the rollers were still moving.  I fiddled with the volume wheel, but it was not that either.  Perplexed, I sat there for a minute thinkin that the tape was bad or my player was going bad.  I honestly do not remember why I looked up, but I did.  Then I just leaned back and stretched my arms behind my head.  I noticed something odd, but I could not figure out what I was seeing.  Something to the east and to the North was moving.I saw a dark triangular object that looked to me at the time like a black hang glider up in the clear star lit sky traveling from North to South at a speed of maybe 300 mph or more.  It was dead quiet and it was definitely up there.  No lights but it was so clear out, that I could see its shape.  Now, Ironically later in life, it seemed to me to look more like an F-117 stealth in its overall shape, but this was in 1983.  Whatever it was, it profoundly etched itself in my memory.  About 30 seconds after traversing the peripheral of my view,  the tape player started playing music again. It was playing the song as if it had missed the part where the track was silent.  Before this incident, and after, I never had any problems with the tape or the machine, until I got rid of the player a few years later.I do not claim to have seen a UFO or a secret military craft.  But what I saw defied any satisfactory explanation to this day.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

This was like none I have ever seen in my entire whole life.  I was camping with the family since it is winter there are no leaves so the sky is wholly visible.  I was tending the campfire, thinking about this and that, when all of a sudden blam!  Two white spheroids appeared before my very eyes.  They were about a quarter mile away, just seeming to float.  They merged together into one unit, though it maintened separate parts.  It was making strange noises as well, though it mixed with the sounds of the woods to make it indistinct.  When the two spheroids came together, I don&apos;t mean to be crude, but it resembled a human &quot;buttocks&quot;.  It kind of shook around and made me angry.  I didn&apos;t like it one bit, but can&apos;t really say why.  The two-in-one was the only one I observed, and the only one I ever care to.  After a while, five minutes at the most, it went dark, and its luminescence faded from the bottom up to the top, till it was completely gone.

I like smoking there cause i have a nice view of a lake and all i can see how the moon reflects on the lake.  The night was cool and there were no clouds just in the distance that look like fog in the sky. It was really high in the sky and it capture my attention how these little tiny lights were going around and disappearing and it looked like they were crashing with one another.  There was a plane underneath and i thought it was the plane&apos;s lights or something.  The plane would get closer the lights would get brighter and motion was faster.  It came to a point that the plane past by me and the lights were still in the same place. I started to wonder if what i was seeing was for real, tiny little lights shaped like little jupiters going around in circles around and around looking like they would crash.  I stared at it and i would see how from 6 lights i was seeing it was dimishing one by one each one going around for the last time and disapperaing, i would not see where it would go until i saw the last one leave. i was not afriad but excited that i was able to experiment this.  I wish i knew if what i saw were flying saucers or maybe just thunder or advertisment lights. but there was not anything coming from the ground.

The tail would grow to about the length of my thumb and then recede back into the star. The effect almost looked similar to that of say, a jet afterburner being turned on and then off. The object appeared to be about the same height as aircraft flying, I would guess around 30,000 feet? However, it did not appear as though it was a star. It made no sound or noise and was stationary during this time. I watched the object and this tail grow and then shrink slowly (maybe the process of its tail going back into it took about 30 seconds, hard to recall). for about 20 minutes. I then checked into a nearby hotel, the Hampton Inn, and told the woman at the front desk about what was outside. She said people sometimes see weird things all the time and followed me out into the parking lot. When she looked up, she saw the object as well and remarked that it appeared to be changing colors, red, orange, and I believe yellow. After that I decided to take my 35mm camera and drive west on I-180, back towards the desert and away from any lights, to take some photos of the object. I wanted to be sure that I captured it as best as possible so I took the photos with the aperture left open for around 30 seconds. Unfortunately I did not have a tripod when taking the photos and tried to position it on the ground braced against my jacket. Some of the photos, it is apparent that there is movement from the camera itself. Other photos clearly show the &ldquo;tail&rdquo; in question. After taking photos for roughly 15 minutes and beginning to get creeped out (I was in the middle of the desert and it was probably 12:30 or 1:00am) I saw a plane begin to approach the vicinity of the object. At this point, the object started to move in I think was an S type pattern. After that I was too freaked out to stay out &ldquo;alone&rdquo; in the desert and headed back towards town and the comfort of my hotel room. A few days later I arrived in Los Angeles (my destination), and had the photos developed at a 1 hour photo lab. I specified that the negatives not be cut so that they could be scanned at some point.

We saw some truly spectacular lights up in the sky to the south east.  We pulled the car over, and watched for nearly a half hour.  It was clear that these lights were lightening up in some low-level clouds; never striking the ground (maybe 1500 feet? 2000?).  It was a semi-cloudy evening, extremely dry air, and warm (68-70 degrees)--no rain.The colors lit up as red/pink, white, aqua, green and an ivory color.  After about 10 minutes of watching, (roughly 11:15) a Redmond Police officer pulled up and watched the remainder of the &quot;show&quot; with us.  Because of the odd lack of actual bolt lightening strikes and lack of audible thunder and the funky cloud cover, some of the lights actually looked oval or round, but it was clearly a reflection of the light off/in the clouds.  It was truly one of the most spectacular lightening shows I can ever remember seeing--especially in Washington.  The air literally felt and even smelled &quot;electric.&quot;   As you likely know, dry lightening storms are rare in Wa.The &quot;storm&quot; appeared to happen in a very localized area of the sky.  Very near Union Hill, but I&apos;m sure it could have been seen by anyone on Novelty Hill and the Redmond Plateau (perhaps even Education Hill) as well and seemed to be contained to one &quot;group&quot; of very puffy, white, billowy clouds. For as long as I watched these lights, I have no doubt that it was just a very cool weather anomaly all friends and the Redmond Officer all agreed that is was lightening, albeit very strange lightening.  The color flashes would have been really wild if you were on top of one of those hills which are about 500-800ft in elevation.  As far as I know, the &quot;storm&quot; was never reported, which I thought was odd since it lasted for about a half hour and it was so vivid. I recall watching the news the following day to see if it would end up on the weather report, but if it did, I never caught it. It may be worth noting that the officer got no calls on his radio while he stood with us on the shoulder of the road, and he was with us for 15-20 minutes. I don&apos;t recall him radioing anything in either.Original Report:   Occurred : 8/16/1995 23:30 (Entered as : 08/16/1995 23:30) Reported: 10/18/2003 5:19:37 AM 05:19 Posted: 10/31/2003 Location: Redmond, WA Shape: Unknown Duration:5 minutes redmond washington sighting 1995  in one evening in the summer of 1995, when i was living in redmond, washington i was in bed with my girlfriend and my dog was in the room in her basket, we were watching tv it was about half past 11 at night give or take 15 minutes. All of a sudden the dog started crying put its tail under her legs and hid, and then as if on cue this blinding red light came through the blinds and felt a humming in my body but could not hear anything, my girlfriend who was right next to me at the time felt exactly the same thing, we were both scared to death i have read a lot of books and seen a lot of documenterys on ufo&apos;s and aliens and this has convinced me and definately convinced my girlfriend who was not a beleiver in this. we both tried to peer through the blinds but the light was just too blinding it was just hovering above our house and where we lived in redmond was on the top of a hill over a valley so there was absolutely no doubt that this is indeed genuine. i now live in london and have done since early 1996 and i hope the zip code i gave you is correct because i do not have my u.s. license anymore and the zip im pretty sure is correct. this craft if i may call it that was incredibly bright and huge and would be amazed if nobody else saw this craft, i cant stop thinking about this sighting it really has got me hooked on trying to find the truth behind all of these sightings and beleive me they do exist i just hope that a member of the public from redmond also saw this and could verify my story.((NUFORC Note: Date is approximate.

We arrived at about 7:05 pm, we saw the white/orange colored lights, not as bright as before. The light seemed to be hovering in place but it seemed as if it was dropping extremely slow. We could see a reflection of the light on the Waccamaw River and noticed that the reflection was decreasing in light. We decided to leave because it was cold, then as we got into the truck and started to leave, out of nowhere another orange colored light was moving in a straight line from right to left until out of sight. We get out of the truck once again and thought it might be an airplane but it didn&rsquo;t have any blinking lights. We looked over to the first light and noticed it was almost gone, behind the trees.

At 8:10 p.m., I noted (at the 11:00 position) a flashing red and white object overhead.  It was traveling at a slow pace, then stopped and hovered.  While heading back going west on Bollinger Canyon Road, the object appeared to keep pace with us.  We then headed north on Dougherty Valley Road, then west on Crow Canyon Road, toward Danville.  The object kept pace with us; it was at a fairly high distance, so we could not determine its shape.  While in Danville, going south on Brookside Drive, I again spotted this flashing red and white object.  As we turned a corner, still on Brookside Drive, this object turned, lowered its elevation, and headed toward us.  At this point, we realized it was heading straight toward us.  We became frightened and as this object came closer, I turned my car around and headed back, north, down Brookside Drive.  My son stated to me later that &quot;if you threw a frisbee into the air at this thing, it would have hit it.&quot;  At the point in which I was turning our car around in a driveway to get away from this thing, my son was able to see the object up close, from the passenger side.  He states this object had one blue light on the one end, and rotating red and white lights all around at the bottom.  He states it was circular and &apos;HUGE,&apos; although could not explain to me how many feet in circumference it seemed to be.  We decided to purchase soft drinks at the McDonald&apos;s off of Crow Canyon/San Ramon Valley Blvd.  As we sat in the parking lot, we noted we could no longer see this object.  As we headed back toward home, going east on Crow Canyon Road, my son stated he saw the same object, but this time it was pacing us at a much higher distance.  Once we reached Dougherty Drive, we no longer saw the object.  The timeframe for the above is approximately 15 to 20 minutes.  At approximately 9:30 p.m. that night, I took my dogs for a walk down our street.  I was walking toward the west down our street;! when I turned around, I saw a flashing red and white object hovering down the cul-de-sac, past our home.  I became frightened and kept my eyes on the object as I was walking.  It was moving in a zig-zag motion, very slowly and cautiously, toward me.  I went inside the house and informed my husband and son what had happened.  I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been so frightened in my life.  We decided to take a drive, the three of us, to see if we could see this object further.  This was at approximately 10:00 p.m. that night.  We drove in the same pattern as I had taken previously, then headed back home.  We didn&apos;t see anything during that time.  As we were headed toward home, I took a street called Monarch Drive and decided to go up Monarch Drive, which is on a hill, overlooking the Valley.  We were headed east.  We got out of our car and saw three objects, each had flashing red and white lights.  We were not able to see their shapes, but noted that they at times would just hover, and/or move very quickly, first right, then left.  Eventually, we headed back off Monarch, onto Bollinger Canyon Road, going west.  As we headed home, we noted that two of these objects were now pacing us, one in front of the other.  All of a sudden, the object behind the other picked up speed and literally flew over the object in front of it, seemingly missing the object in front of it by inches.  I&apos;ve never seen anything like in my life.", "On Feb.22 around 7:45 that evening a friend was leaving.

Both of which are tourist beach resorts located in Oriental Mindoro, Batangas, Philippines.It was a 30 minute journey back and we have just finished a big meal from the Coco beach restaurant so we were all very tired.  Everyone around me just closed their eyes and I followed (except for the boat operator of course).At about 10-15mins after, I opened my eyes to look up at the sky.  The sky was clear and I can make out the star formations.  Exactly after a minute, I thought I witnessed a Shooting star as it appeared to shoot in one direction and quickly disappeared.  For 3 seconds I was thinking to myself I should make a wish.Then it reappeared moving in different directions at incredible speed. It had different coloured lights. I witnessed a colour formation of white, red, orange and blue. I froze and kept my eyes on it as I was afraid I&rsquo;d lose sight of it. I couldn&rsquo;t tell the distance but I know it was very far as it was more or less the same size of an average star.About 5 minutes of watching, I woke up my boyfriend who was snoozing with his head on his arms at the very front of the boat.  I told him to look up at the star that was moving in the dark sky and as he was in a daze he quickly dismissed it and said &lsquo;Nah it&rsquo;s because the boat is moving up and down&rsquo; (as in his own words).But I remained quiet until it reappeared brighter then proceeded to point again. &lsquo;There it is, over there&rsquo;, I said.  This time he was quiet trying to focus and concentrate.  We watched it swerve in zigzag motion and a straight line, speed up and then slow down again.For a split second I took my eyes of the UFO to look at the sheer concentration on my boyfriends face he let out a &lsquo;Wow&rsquo;.  I looked back at the object and he informed me that it just made a spectacular circular motion, which I just missed.  My boyfriend proceeded to record the object on his camcorder but resigned to the fact that it was too hard to focus on the object at such distance especially at the night sky. Another significant detail was that there was an aeroplane that was coming from the far right moving towards the west and we conversed on comparing the two. I said, &lsquo;there is no way that UFO is a plane. We have nothing that moves that fast&rsquo;.  And so we concluded the same as the two objects aligned directly above each other. Then we watched the UFO move the same way it was towards the west until it faded. We arrived at the shores in complete awe. It was one of the most memorable moments in my life and will probably never come across a UFO again.", "Object with white trail but left nothing behindI was driving back from picking up my kid with my wife from friend home.  Then suddenly appear I saw this 4 speed flash with a short trail on them but left nothing behind.  The distance within about 1 mile a part and about 15,000 feet above from south east to west I didn&apos;t think that was Airliner because Air jet will leave a smoke behind and slower speed. My wife and my kid were also witness those flash and I thought it was meteor or comet passing by earth.  But, one of them was zigzag so I don&apos;t think meteor or comet make a zigzag.

It was around 10 pm under clear skies in late December of 2006. We were almost home from an evening of visiting our son and his family when, as we reached the bottom of the off ramp, straight ahead of us in the air we spotted a ball of orange flame hovering in place in the sky. I told my wife to &apos;look at that helicopter up there.&apos; I said that it had to be on fire and she agreed. It was dark outside but a clear night and unless the &lsquo;helicopter&rsquo; was completely painted in florescent orange paint with spotlights shining all around it, the craft we saw had to be engulfed in flames. We fully expected it to suddenly fall to the ground, but to our amazement, it instead just quietly hovered in place until finally it made a lateral move, exactly as a helicopter might do. But where are the blinking lights I said? Any flying craft would have to have some sort of blinking lights on it so as to alert others that it&apos;s there, no doubt it&apos;s an FAA law. But there were no lights, only that glowing orange ball. It was no more than a 1/4 mile away from us, hovering over the Banana River, roughly about 150 feet in the air. Cars began to back up behind us so we left the scene. Was it a UFO? I believe so. I thought so then and I think so now.  A sighting by a retired Air Force Colonel in Arkansas not long after our sighting was similar in appearance, as he was fortunate enough to get a picture of the orange ball like object.

Neither of us drink or do drugs, nor do we, as a general rule, look for or care about the subject of UFO&apos;s.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))", "Solid red lights over O&apos;hare airport.I walked outside and noticed a plane to the southeast at approx. 10,000 feet over O&apos;hare airport traveling north. I then noticed that the two red lights ( on the wings? ) were not blinking.  This attracted my attention, so I kept watching. As it got east of me and passed, the two red ligts (on the front?) became two white lights with a red light in the middle.  Still no blinking or strobing. As it traveled north, it had more the look of a satelite in speed and altitude.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

My mother-in-law, a very successful and down to earth woman was on vacation with her mother in New York in early 2006, and as part of their trip they were taking the tour to the Statue of Liberty.Before boarding the boat to cross the harbor, they were standing on the shoreline, taking in the sights. My mother-in-law is an amateur photographer with a very nice camera (I&rsquo;m not sure what kind off-hand unfortunately, only that it is a very expensive camera, and has been used many times for family functions and such, so I know that the quality of photos it takes is extremely high, and the camera is in perfect working order).While she was taking photos of the harbor and the island across the way, she captured a metallic object hovering just above the water. Her goal was to take a photo of the statue from the shoreline and then take another photo of where they stood on the shore from the island once they crossed (she was playing with the idea of mirroring her position for fun). Once on the island, she took another set of photos, facing the spot they had stood before.In both photos the object can be seen clearly. It was a bright, almost entirely clear day, sometime in the early afternoon and the object was in nearly the same position as before. It appears to have hovered in place for at least the length of the crossing, and if you examine the photos you can tell that it is the same object.Oddly enough, this appears to be a chance UFO because she states that neither she nor anyone else saw anything the entire time (I don&rsquo;t know exactly how long the ferry ride is, but I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s at least twenty minutes or so including the time between photos) In fact, as she was showing us pictures, she started to skip past these as &ldquo;silly&rdquo; because she was having fun with the camera, and never noticed anything unusual about them until I bolted upright in my chair and asked her to let me have them. Once I pointed out the object, she said that she thought they were buoys (which she still thinks) My mother-in-law is not very receptive to things outside the norm (like I said, she&rsquo;s very grounded), so I think she is dismissing these photos for that reason.However, I have enlarged these photos many times, as far as I could without pixelating them all-together, and the object is not in any way connected to the water, much less floating in it. It is clearly metallic, and vaguely oval in shape, and as I said, it either stayed in place unnoticed for the length of the ferry ride, or reappeared, which seems less likely to me (but that is speculative). There seems to be an off-yellow/reddish &quot;aura&quot; or sheen around the object as well when the photo is enlarged. There doesn&rsquo;t appear to be a large disturbance in the water around it, and there are definitely not any disturbances or ripples like those that would show up if it were floating in the water, with the water splashing against it; further indicating that it is just above the surface. Also, if you look at the photos, you can get a sense of scale against the images in the background. I&rsquo;m not an expert, so I don&rsquo;t want to hazard a guess, but if you look at the object as one point in a vector, or triangulate, it seems to be fairly small, but certainly not as small as a balloon or anything like that, and again, it remained in place far too long to be debris. As I mentioned the camera is in perfect order, and by the photos you can tell that this is not an imperfection in the lens or anything. Anyhow, those are some of my own observations using limited resources. I am sending scans of the original photos along for your inspection. The first photo is much clearer, and easier to distinguish details in, but the second provides an interesting view of the object against the city in the background, and if you look you can see the dock where they took the first picture off-center to the right for perspective. These are completely untouched, and uncropped. I would be very interested in knowing your opinion of these pictures. Speaking for myself, as someone who has studied the UFO question for over twenty years, I am convinced that this is some sort of UFO, but I&rsquo;m curious about it because it is very small, and it&rsquo;s odd for it to be there for so long in the first place, much less without being noticed on such a clear day. It does look somewhat like other objects I&rsquo;ve seen captured on film, but those have usually seemed larger. Anyhow, if you have another explanation, please let me know.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  We have not received copies of the photos, yet.

We went for beer after work at a local bar near to the sea side, after about ten minutes somone beside me said what is that in the sky above the sea.  I looked over towards the sea then sighted about 18 small low lights orange in colour all moving at exactly the same speed and all the same in size.  We moved closer towards the lights to get a better look it seemed to me that it was one very big object then it sunddenly went dark", "Rapidly floating, pure silver object seen from an airplane window.Last summer, upon my flight from Mexico back into the United States, I was looking out the airplane window and saw what I initially thought to be a satellite--a silver, tilted rectangular object floating away from the airplane. I turned to a relative to ask if there happened to be satellites at this level, to find out that we were miles upon miles too low.I looked again and saw the object much futher away, yet still very visible. There were no markings whatsoever on it--in fact, it was perfectly smooth with no indentations, bolts, lights, exhaust, or anything of the ilk. It was floating rapidly in a straight line. No accelerations--just a steady fast, straight dash.A moment later, it was completely out of sight. I had a good 25 seconds to inspect this object, and I know very well that I was not hallucinating. There were no clouds at that level, and it was initially close enough to see with perfect accuracy.What it is, I don&apos;t know--but I do know that I&apos;ve never seen (or honestly, heard of) anything like it before.", "Green circle stayed in clouds moving in a circular formation for 6 minutes at least 250 feet above usI observed 1 object it was a green circle going in circles and it only stayed in the clouds", "As I was walking across my yard,I heard a deep low humming sound which prompted me to scan the ground around the yard,I saw nothing,until I decided to gaze upward.As I looked up,I saw a metallic disc shaped craft,hovering roughly 90ft.up.The craft had 2 windows &amp; a oval shaped structure on the bottom which had an array of light which appeared to be rotating.Almost Immediately as I looked up at It,I saw two humanoid like beings staring downward at me.The beings had larger heads than humans,they wore robed clothing,and were about five to six tall. The background or interior of the craft was Illuminated In a bright yellowish light.I&apos;d estimate the craft was about 35 to 40 ft.in length &amp; 15 to 20 ft.wide.The object just hovered emitting a deep hum-like sound.The exterior of the craft was metallic In nature having a dull luster,somewhat shiny though. About 30 to 45 seconds Into the sighting a third being appeared in front of the ships&quot;window,now there were three beings glaring downward at me.Then about ten seconds later one being,with it&apos;s hand gave something small to the other one.As I watched,all three aliens were staring downward at me,which caused some concern,I was thinking something bad was going to happen.My next move was to quickly run into my house &amp; I told my mother about the sighting,which to no avail she didn&apos;t believe me.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

PD))", "Several UFO sightings in Chicago, IL during a four hour time spanI live in Chicago, IL and I believe that I saw several UFO&apos;s yesterday. I was running late for work and I wasn&rsquo;t paying much attention to the sky as I headed to an elevated train station.  But I had just missed my train as I was climbing the stairs to the platform, at around 5:52 p.m., I knew I was definitely going to be late, because I had to be at work at 6, so I decided to relax since I was going to be late anyway.  I walked to the middle of the platform, which is my favorite spot because there&rsquo;s an open lot behind the station and a clear view of the sky.  I listened to my MP3 player for a few minutes and for some reason I decided to turn east and face that open parking lot, this was probably at 5:56 p.m.When I did I noticed a round brightly lit ball just sitting in the sky.  The lights didn&rsquo;t blink.  So at first I thought it was a plane, because I wasn&rsquo;t expecting to see something different than that.  I soon realized that it definitely wasn&rsquo;t a plane because it was dark outside.  Although planes have lights that are visible at night their frames aren&apos;t.  Planes also always move while they&rsquo;re mid-air, and they&rsquo;ll appear larger or smaller eventually depending on which direction they are heading.  This object seemed to be a ball that was illuminated all over, it didn&rsquo;t move, and it appeared the same size the whole time I looked at it.  Then as I looked further past it, eastward, I saw two other objects that were identical to the first one.  They all were in a perfectly straight line with one another, the line made a diagonal from where I was standing.  These objects didn&apos;t move either.  I know they had to be miles apart realistically, but from where I was standing they only seemed about 50 - 75 ft. apart from one another.Suddenly I saw the first object head westbound straight across the sky, it covered the distance pretty quickly, I&rsquo;d say more quickly then the average plane would, but not astronomically so.  I didn&rsquo;t hear any noise as this happened.  The other objects stayed in position and didn&rsquo;t move.  About 30 seconds after seeing this, my train arrived at my platform; this was at 6:02 p.m.  I sat down and looked out of the window, and kept my eyes eastward on the sky for the length of my trip.  As soon as we&rsquo;d covered about 4 or 5 blocks, I noticed that there hadn&rsquo;t been two other objects behind the first one that had flown off.  There had actually been 3. I saw that even though this one was the furthest away from me, it was brightly lit and looked identical to those others, and it was next in the diagonal line, and it too just sat there in the sky as well.My train headed north to the downtown section of Chicago, and even as I covered at least 30 blocks worth of distance, from the original point at which I saw the objects, they were still very visible, and very bright, until some of the high rise buildings started to block my view. I know that they weren&rsquo;t moving, because as I was riding on the train and looking out at the objects, they started to appear as if they were moving with me, in the same direction I was traveling, which is how the moon, or water towers of local suburbs, used to appear to me when I was younger riding in a car. Obviously a water tower is a fixed object, and it looked like it moved with me, so I know the same has to be true of these objects.My trip to downtown took about 15 minutes, because I arrived at work at 6:17 p.m. as I said, a few minutes before, my view of the objects had been blocked, but my eyes were still on the sky in case there was a clearing. I didn&rsquo;t see the objects again, but I did see another aircraft flying a few miles higher than me, but parallel to the train I was on. I only glimpsed it for a few seconds because the buildings blocked my view. It could have been just a plane, but it was so low, and I think there&rsquo;s some sort of a no fly zone, in downtown Chicago, so I don&rsquo;t know why a plane would fly so close in that area. This is the only object whose shape I can&rsquo;t really describe, it was possibly rectangular, but I didn&rsquo;t get to really look at it. I just remember it flying in between one of the high rises, and it was brightly lit, but the craft itself was dark, probably brown. I felt that it looked odd because it didn&rsquo;t look like a plane, yet it was flying. It was also bulky and heavy, looking, but quickly disappeared from my view. I definitely know that it didn&rsquo;t resemble a plane at all. I eventually went to work for four hours but I really hoped, that the objects I&rsquo;d seen by my house would still be there when I got off, so that I could show someone in my family what I&rsquo;d seen. I didn&rsquo;t remember to look at the sky when I was on the platform because I was in a rush to get home, but when I was on the ground, about a block east of the train station, I walked southeast where there&rsquo;s an open area of sky because of a parking lot. As I was crossing the street and heading south, I saw one of the objects or perhaps another one that was in the same vicinity of the ones I&rsquo;d seen earlier. Only this time it was way closer to the ground than the ones I&apos;d noticed earlier. I made my way onto the sidewalk and realized that the big concrete roof of the parking lot was blocking my view. So the object had to be very close to the ground because the roof of the parking lot is only about 15-20 ft high. I decided to back up a few feet and I walked in the street instead of the sidewalk in order to get a good look at the object. I did, and basically I saw an object that resembled a saucer, but it wasn&rsquo;t a flat thin disc, it had layers. The top layer was full of deep burgundy lights and so was the bottom one, I think they were on but they were very dull and nearly blended into the dark sky, that&rsquo;s probably why I didn&rsquo;t see them earlier. But the center layer was bright, bright white. The whole object was saucer shaped, and all of the lights looked like they were framed by rectangles. So they just looked like panels of lights. I do not know if I&rsquo;d imagined it from the influence of TV and movies, but I do remember thinking that it hovered and rocked a little, instead of being completely still, but that could have been my mind adding that part in because I was so excited. As I kept walking south, my view was blocked again by the roof of the parking lot, so maybe the object had moved. About 20 seconds later, I&rsquo;d moved past the parking lot&rsquo;s roof, and parallel to the entrance of the parking lot. This entrance isn&rsquo;t enclosed by a roof, so there&rsquo;s a very clear view of the sky but I still didn&rsquo;t see the object. It was gone. I continued my way south and walked past the apartment building attached to the parking lot, which unfortunately blocked my view, because it too, is a high rise. About another 20-30 seconds later I continued my way south and crossed the street opposite this high rise, where there are just small houses and apt. buildings, which leave a better view of the sky and I still saw no objects, I headed east to get back to my building, and there still was no object in sight. But I kept my eyes on the sky for most of my walk and I did start to notice the stars, usually I don&rsquo;t. They were visible, but since it&rsquo;s Chicago and we have lots of lights and air pollution they aren&rsquo;t blindingly white. So when I saw another object later on, I was totally sure it wasn&rsquo;t a star. I arrived inside my apt. at around 10:35 pm. About ten minutes later I turned off the light, in my bedroom and looked out of the window. I noticed a blinking object, west of my back window, which is further south in Chicago. It was much higher than the last one I&rsquo;d just seen, and I would have taken it as a star if I hadn&rsquo;t looked at the stars a few minutes ago when I was outside. This object was far away, but it wasn&apos;t as far as the stars were, and it was much brighter and bigger than the stars. It&apos;s light was white but it blinked on and off. I made out a reddish light that came from it as well. It too seemed to stand still and I think it was probably the same object that I&rsquo;d seen 20 minutes before, when I was outside. But I&rsquo;m not sure, I couldn&rsquo;t tell its shape from so far away. As I was gazing at the sky, I then saw a really large object traveling somewhat close to the ground, maybe 30 miles above that had a bright light attached underneath it. It was large and it was loud. I ran to the front of my apartment to get a better look, because it was fast and I believe this was a plane, but I do not believe it was a commercial plane, because it was so bulky, and because of the light coming from it, and because it was a dark color, I think it was a brown or bronze type of shade. It quickly covered the sky and was out of my sight within a minute or two, so I went back to the my other window to see the blinking object. It was still there, but it looked even further away, yet it was still very bright though. So I just decided to watch some TV because I couldn&rsquo;t do anything about it and then I went to bed.", "Bright orange light first appeared on the southwest horizon then moved to the immediate western horizon and seemed to disappear under the horizon. After waiting to see it again it appeared out of know where at an elevation of 2500 feet in the southwestern sky. The object then hovered for about a minute then moved left then vertical then left again like it was climbing stairs. After if performed these manauvers it begin to move slowly from the southwest to the southeast over Rose Valley lake then continueing across the sky until it was out of sight in the northeast.", "Here not only we(People) My buddy and I work for moving company in Canada .

I was on the east side of the Sacramento river, facing west, having just come off Sutterville road and about turn on Riverside. It appeared to be just on the west side of the river, not quite straight ahead, and it was just a little to the right. My first guess was that it was a meteor, and I looked all over the local news next day for stories of a meteor hitting the ground somewhere in west Sacramento, but there was no story. According to a map of the area, the most probable area of impact was in a place with very few streets, which probably means very few houses. It may have struck and not been noticed, or it may not have hit the ground at all. That is what makes it interesting. It should have struck the ground after it went below the top of the trees. It wound seem unlikely for a meteor to evaporate just a couple of hundred feet before it reaches the ground. They usually do so while still high in the atmosphere. I have seen a few of them do just that. It crossed the entire arc of visibility (to me) in less than a second, and did not fade or slow down as it went, as it would have if it was going straight across the sky from behind me. If it was farther away than west Sac, or moving horizontally at high altitude, it had to be huge, and going at an unimaginable speed. It appeared round, and I estimate its size to be about half the diameter of a dime held at arms length. It appeared a little bit fuzzy, so I can&apos;t be more exact than that. These flashes in the sky are interesting, but I have never seen anything I can positively identify as an alien vehicle of any sort. I will watch this site to see if anyone else saw this object.", "rectangular/cigar shape object with glowing blue lights, glowing blue body and blue &quot;exaust&quot; trail.This happened on the summer of 1990, while I and my father and a few other people were camping out in the mountains of South Kazakhstan (Tian Shan mountains).  We were outside  watching a movie on the movie projector when all of sudden both my Dad and I looked up to the sky.  There was no sound that would attract out attention or anything causing us to look up, yet we did.  The sky was clear and dark, since it gets dark in the mountains quite early.  There was a long rectangular/cigar shape object that went across the skies very fast.  I could not tell exactly how high it was above the ground.  It was glowing bright blue light, similar to those modern LEDs.  It was dark, but had lights all over the body of the object.  Somewhat similar to a sky scraper at night.  All the lights were same glowing blue.  Additionally, the craft left a glowing blue trail behind itself that disappeared very quickly in the air.  The object went across the sky extremely fast, with no sound, and disappeared behind the mountain.  I can provide a picture (not a photo but a drawing)  that I made to better remember how how it looked.  Please let me know if similar object have ever been reported.

We were facing the back yard, seated in lawn chairs, talking, and all of a sudden the entire back yard (about an acre of ground) lit up in blue light. We looked over our left shoulders (both of us, there was no sound and yet oddly we both looked over our left shoulders at the same exact time) and there was a bright blue light hovering there.  It was just that... a light and it stayed there pulsating for about 5 seconds I&apos;d say... then it started to move and just disappeared. My mom and I don&apos;t tell anyone about this because we know people will think we are nuts.  This is the first time I&apos;ve ever put something like this out there.  We have no reason to try to make people believe that we saw what we saw.  I just thought I&apos;d post this so that others out there that also have witnessed something as strange as this don&apos;t feel like they are alone.  I&apos;m sure that some day what we all saw will come to &quot;light&quot; - pardon the pun. By the way, from California to the east coast people saw this blue light at precisely the same exact time of day.  It was noted in the papers and news but was dismissed by scientists as possible meteors... though my mom and I, and everyone else who witnessed it, knows it could not have been - for it never hit the earth and it was hovering.  A meteor would not stop in the air.  I was not scared of this light... though looking back on it I&apos;m surprised that I wasn&apos;t ... because it was so incredibly &quot;odd&quot; (that&apos;s the best word I can use right now to describe it)...nothing I&apos;d every seen before and I don&apos;t necessarily believe in aliens or things of the like.  I did feel afterward that night that we had been &quot;observed&quot;. It&apos;s a strange thing to say...and it was a strange thing to feel at the time. My mom and I joked that it was taking our picture...then over a year later we were talking about it again and discussed the possibility of it being some government testing type o! f object...but that too sounds too strange to believe.  Anyway, don&apos;t feel like you are alone...all of you who have seen something like this...but then again don&apos;t try to convince anyone who didn&apos;t see it for themselves because they will only think you are nuts.

I watched the light for approximately 20 minutes, during which time the object did not appear to move at all. Very suddenly there was a second white light that appeared to be hovering quite close to the first. I do not believe that this was an optical illusion, given that I closed my eyes several times to find the same set of lights in the sky when I reopened them. This second light appeared brighter than the first, and it was slowly moving within close proximity of the first light. Moments later it was gone all at once, only to return again a few minutes later. At this point I began to walk toward the nearest convenience store, and when I arrived there, I was able to point the lights out to a strange man who was getting into his car. Together watched the lights dance, and soon after they disappeared.", "This sighting was by my step daugher and her step sister.  This is the second sighting by my step daughter.

I watched it for over ten minutes while driving down a heavily congested street called Northwest Highway and no amount of gesturing could make anyone whose eye I could catch look up.  Nothing on the news of course. Back to the Wilmer night sighting.  I am not sure what time she told me it was, but the reason it caught her eye, was that it looked like a black hole in the sky.  It blocked out all the stars in a huge circle.  No lights, just a black hole.  Since she was driving and couldn&apos;t watch it intently, she does not know how it dissappeared. In the field below it asks me to submit to a collect call.  I don&apos;t want to do that but exchanging emails would be acceptable.

So if these two things were flying away from each other at the same altitude then I knew this was no airplane. So I looked back at the Cigar like object and figured it must not have wings.

There appeared to be a UFO near the jet.  In an effort to obtain objective evidence, I started taking digital pictures of randomly selected jets passing overhead. Then I examine the photos on my computer using the zoom enlargement option.Today (3/05/07 @ 9:35 AM), I took a picture of a jet with a possible UFO in the photo.  I did not see the UFO, but my Canon SD 630 recorded it.  The object appears to be viewed on edge with two black ports facing down.  Curved areas appear to be reflecting sunlight off metallic looking surfaces. Because of the detail in such a small image, I would say this was a very large object at high altitude. Also in the picture is the jet which provides a good reference for image resolution.

Every once in a while, a few would vertically fly up to the sky and new ones would come down. The sun gleamed off the surface of the crafts, and they made a metallic clinging when they would bump into each other. They made whirring noises and I knew they were not insects because when we approached them to see what kind of insect they were (my spouse is an entomologist, they backed away as one and seemed to join together to form a vertical column and drifted straight up into tht sky.

My vantage point was from outside my office in Woodland Hills, CA.  I noticed a large (747) FedEx jet flying over my office and I thought it was strange for such a large jet to be headed towards Burbank Airport, as this airfield is generally for smaller commercial aircraft.As I watched to see if the plane would turn into the landing pattern for Burbank Airport, I noticed a bright point of light in the cloud directly behind the FedEx jet.  At first I only saw one object then I noticed there were at least 2 others.The lights I saw were an amber color. Almost as if the object was reflecting the setting sun to the west. I believe I saw 3 distinct objects.  But they were only visible as a group for a short period of time.  Each point of light would vary in intensity.  From very bright (they seemed to expand as the light got brighter), to barely visible.  The lights had to be quite bright because the objects were clearly visible while being either in the cloud or behind it. And the cloud itself was rather dark.Now, these lights were moving in some rather strange patterns.  I would describe the flight patterns as parabolic.  They would move in one direction and perform what I would describe as a &apos;U-turn&apos; and move back in the other direction.  These &apos;U-turns&apos; were executed at a high rate of speed.  At one point I saw multiple lights performing these maneuvers. It resembled two squirrels chasing each other around and up a tree.At one point one of the lights was performing the parabolic maneuver (on an off axis) and it stopped in its tracks.  It hovered in that position for roughly 10 seconds.  Then without a noticeable acceleration period, continued the maneuver at the same high rate of speed.All of the movement I witnessed was at a relatively high rate of speed.  I would estimate the altitude to be about 10,000-15,000 feet and the distance from myself to the objects at about 20 miles.  I have never seen an object in the air travel this fast or maneuver like these objects did.At no time were these objects visible outside the the cloud that was moving past.The whole episode lasted 8-10 minutes.  At which point the cloud had changed its shape and had moved off into the distance and the objects were no longer appearing.", "Venus type light arcing across sky and sky flashes.We walked out of our house and I immediately saw a very bright light slowly moving across the dark sky.  It was roughly the same size and intensity as Venus (which was visible off to my left) travelling from north west to south east.  No aircraft lights were seen on or near the object as would be expected from a conventional aircraft and before leaving our sight it blinked very quickly once. We drove off in the direction of the light but never saw it again.  The night before we were out walking in a snowfall and saw five bright blue flashes that lit up the entire sky (cloud covered).  These appeared to not come from any one point but seem to light up the entire sky like a flash bulb.  This after a relatively quiet time in Sonora regarding UFO/strange activity (several things seen in past year).", "Light moving in strange patterned flight over Pigeon Forge, TennesseeI was at work at a log cabin resort where I work nights. I stepped out on the balcony to smoke a cigarette. I looked up at the sky and saw several stars and noticed one that was particularly bright. As I watched it, I noticed that it was moving in very distinct and changing patterns. Thinking that I must be moving, I steadied myself against the railing and the object was still moving. Thinking I must still be moving, I backed up against the building and placed my back and head against the wall...still moving. I looked at the surrounding celestial objects (stars etc) and they were all standing still. As I watched, the object moved back and forth at breakneck speeds. It wouldn&apos;t curve when it changed course but, instead it would reverse direction in a straight line. Occasionally the object would stop and just hover in place, then it started moving in patterns, sometimes in a circle, sometimes in a figure eight, sometimes in a triangle pattern, always stopping and hovering before changing patterns. This went on and on, after twenty minutes, I went and got the two ladies working in the laundry and they confirmed that they saw the same thing. They also noticed that the object was changing colors, always white but sometimes bluish whate and other times a greenish/yellowish white. During the incident, a helicopter flew over, I could hear the helicopter but the object made no noise whatsoever. Still trying to disprove what I was seeing, I thought perhaps that a thermal was rising in front of the object making it appear to move but, just before dawn a heavy fog rolled in and eveything in the sky disappeared except for this object which was still faintly visible. Around 7am, two other female employees came in and I showed them and they saw the exact same thing. It was the weirdest thing I ever saw, I am going to try to take a video camera to work in case the object returns.", "triangular craft ,with lights on each tip and darkness in the center, passes over rural VermontAt roughly 8 PM, I looked out the window of my home, and saw three orange/pale yellow lights flashing in the northern sky. I said, &quot;Honey, that&apos;s weird. Look at this.&quot;  At that point, my husband, child, and myself, went to the window and tried to figure out what we were witnessing.  We quickly concluded that, even though the separation between lights was considerable, it was certainly one aircraft.  There were lights on each tip of what would be a triangle.  In the center, there was a black void, darker than the night sky.  A slight &quot;whirrrrr&quot; could be heard as it passed over. It is hard to say what size the craft was, other than to say it was huge!!! (bigger than a football field)  We couldn&apos;t figure out how far away it was.

Besides the strong light in the front, we saw green lights (which weren&apos;t blinking) on the borders. The sky was already dark at that time, but it seemed that this object had a dark color too. Between dark grey and black. I was driving with a speed around 80Km/h which allowed us to have a small glimpse of some of its details.If it was a normal aircraft for sure it hadn&apos;t any normal patterns.", "Round, white light  with halo effect appeared briefly in the vicinity of the Big Dipper on clear, cold night..Small white light with halo effect observed near Dubhe, (the lower star at the outside edge of the Big Dipper&rsquo;s inverted cup.) It was a cold night and the sky was perfectly clear, with the Moon setting low on the western horizon. I was outside looking at the sky in the area of the Big Dipper&rsquo;s cup when a round, white light suddenly &quot;turned on&quot; just to the left (west) of Dubhe in a horizontal line with the star. (I was facing North.) The light was visible for about one-half second and had a distinct halo around it. Other stars in the sky exhibited no halo effect, including the setting Moon. The light remained in the exact same position during the entire time it was visible. For comparison, the light was roughly the size of a nickel held at arm&rsquo;s length. When viewed with the naked eye, the light appeared to be about twice as large as the star Dubhe and roughly twice as bright. Its duration was brief, but the light was steady in appearance while it lasted. It did not flash or fade in and out--it simply turned on, showed a halo effect, and turned off. After the light disappeared, I held my hand against the sky to estimate its distance from the star Dubhe. It was about three fingers distance from Dubhe in a horizontal line to the left of the star. I couldn&rsquo;t estimate the altitude of the light with any accuracy. It seemed to be at a great distance from me and gave me the impression that it might be beyond the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere in space, but it was clearly visible. I retrieved my binoculars from inside and swept the whole sky in every direction to see if I could detect another light like it, but I saw nothing unusual for over an hour. I served in the military and am familiar with all sorts of military and commercial aircraft and their navigational lights and I recognize satellites when I see them. The light I saw was not like those objects. Most commercial aircraft uses a flight pattern well to the East of my town and we do not see military aircraft here on a regular basis. Our night sky is very quiet.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I immediately pointed it out to my wife and we continued to watch the object make a wide banking turn from left to right and then back to the left again.  It then continued west until our view was obstructed. Our first observation was that the only thing visible was a single, bright blue-white light, which dimmed very little even when we last observed it until approximately 3 miles away.  No colored or blinking lights could be seen from the multiple angles from which we observed.My first guess was that it could be a helicopter, but the speed was seemingly far too great for the perceived altitude, I could identify no other lighting, and the peculiar brightness of the object as distance increased.The object may have been following the Santa Ana River toward the ocean.

Airport is directly in front of my house, if I were to use a 757 at 3000 feet to guess the size I would guess it to be wider than and longer than the 757. There were 6 lights directly in line on each side flashing they were white most of the time though I think no. 2 from the front alternated red. As it was dark it was hard to guess size and speed. There was no noise.

I looked up and saw a bizarre oval shaped craft that seemed to be moving east/west very quickly.  At first I ruled it out as being a UFO since I am very close to the airport, thinking it was a plane.  But I have never seen an oval shaped plane before.  The craft continued to move back and forth east/west when it began to glow a mysterious green color.  Suddenly, the craft took off to the north and was gone.  It must have been going hundreds of miles per hour because it was gone in the blink of an eye.  I don&apos;t know what it was but it was not a plane or a helicopter.

Egg shapped saucer, very glossy gun metal. I would say 12 clear lights in a circumference. Other lights not in a particular pattern that&apos;s recognizable, but other lights of different luminescense. The color of these guide/spotlights were white-yellowish. I think I did notice 1-2 of the same sized lights with red or blue colors. No light was larger then the other. They all had the same base lighting I guess. I came home I assume around 6:30 pm, and it was sitting above my home hovering. It moved in its on axis and didn&apos;t seem to be limited by any direction. I could not hear any engine at this point. As it got darker it lowered itself, and I thought I was going to make contact. I watched it for the whole 30 minutes (or until 7:15) when it became dark, and then a light appeared to open from the front like a flash light ahead of itself. It quickly closed, and then it finally had a sound. It sounded like tubes with a myriad of propellers pushing hard against the wind, and then it began to leave the &quot;southern&quot; sky, and move straight towards the north Eastern sky, slowly speeding up. I chased it until it was at a point that it was intersecting traffic at the top of my hill. It had one guiding light as it flew. It flew flat and straight. I took two pictures when it was evening with my sprint cellphone. There&apos;s one photo where you can barely see the lights on the leftside, and the other picture I have yet to transfer from my phone. Nothing was around. No one was around. No cars going up and down my street. It was like the perfect day for me to just witness this large craft, and have no reference but my self, and my &quot;unbeleiving&quot; grandmother LOL  I drew a sketch of it how it looked when it hovered, and how it looked in flight. I will draw more detail with how the whole scene looks, if the picture I send cannot be seen. Someone has to do some &quot;buffing&quot; to bring the whole craft out because the photo is PITCH black.

My wife and I went out on the back patio around 9 PM to enjoy a fire and stargaze. After seeing the occasional shooting-star we decided to call it a night and head back inside about 10:30 PM. As I took one last look at the sky an object caught my eye.At first I wasn&rsquo;t sure that I was actually looking at something, but as my eyes began to adjust I could see that there was something there and it was hovering or moving very, very slow. What immediately alarmed me was that this flying craft made no noise on a night that was so quiet that you could have heard a car engine a mile away let alone the engine of a large aircraft.I grabbed my wife and asked her if she saw what I was looking at and after pointing it out she saw it too.When I first spotted the object it was between my location and the southern end of the San Tan Mountains, about a mile and away hovering at what I would guess about a 1000 feet high. As it began to slowly move in a southerly direction I got a better glimpse of this object.It had no running lights and was dark in color and I could see its shape and size silhouetted against the starry sky. The object did seem to produce a light greenish auora at times, but it was very faint. It was the biggest flying object that I have ever seen, much larger than a 747 and shaped like a &quot;boomerang.&quot;  My wife and I observed the object for several minutes before it disappeared over the southern horizon. It spooked us both and she still doesn&rsquo;t like talking about it.I went online to several UFO reporting websites and filed a report with one, mainly to see if I would get a response from someone else in the area that might have seen this thing too. The funny thing is a few days later my posting of the sighting had been removed for no apparent reason.At the time I knew nothing about the mass sighting over Phoenix in 1997, but after some research and hearing accounts of what people saw that night, I would say that we observed was something very similar to what they did. A giant, silent flying, wing like object. I know some time has passed since this UFO sighting occured, but I feel obligated to report none the less.  I still gives me the chills to think about it...", "exploding ball of light flooded kitchenMy wife,step-daughter and myself  had sat down for lunch. We have a large kitchen window facing southwest.

The round ball appeared to be tree top level at a distance. The glowing light flooded our kitchen,however, in a second it was gone. No sound at all.

Truthfully, it has been so long that I may be off by a year or so on the date, but it was the middle of summer. LVGC is on the west side of the peninsula, near the top of the hill above the Pacific Ocean. The time was about 5 pm or 6 pm and the sky was clear and sunny. As I began to drive down the hill towards the ocean on Hawthorne Blvd, I noticed a strange flying object, near the cliffs on the water. It was moving slowly, no more than 20-40 mph. The position of the object was south of the Point Vicente lighthouse by about a mile or two. The object was very angular, oblong and shaped oddly which is why I believe that I noticed it at all. We were used to seeing small planes, helicopters and the Goodyear Blimp flying around the peninsula.  The thing I witnessed was not any of those. It did not appear as if it should be able to fly. No wings, no rotors, no jet engines (it was not disc shaped either). As I drove down the hill, I had a pretty good look at it, but it was probably about a mile or two away (as a crow flies). I have attempted to sketch what I saw in the &quot;1-2 miles away&quot; drawing. This first half of my sighting lasted about 15-20 seconds. Then as I was driving down the hill I lost sight of the object behind fences and houses. Once at the bottom of the hill, I pulled my car into the Safeway parking lot and got out. I had a really good look at the thing for about another 10-15 seconds as it flew between some hills. My second sketch depicts a side view of the craft. Again, this view showed the angular construction of the object but this time it was closer. The color was dull gray. I could clearly see rectangular, opaque panels on the side of the craft. A notched cutout was visible on the bottom near the front. No lights at all were visible but again it was still very light outside. It was moving slowly at low altitude, no more than 500 ft up. I have never submitted a report of this incident. Back when it happened, I absolutely expected that I would soon be reading about it in the newspapers. Nothing was ever reported that made the news, at least not that I saw. I am still amazed that a bunch of people did not see and report this flying object. The only thing peculiar that I can think of regarding the location of the object was that it was near the old NIKE missile site up on the hill. This NIKE site was converted and now houses city government offices. During the twenty odd years that have passed since I saw this thing, I have never seen a picture of a UFO on TV or otherwise that looks like what I saw that day.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

LightsI&rsquo;m reporting this incident after looking through your past sightings and realizing that there is one that corresponds with the time and description of a sighting I had as a teenager.I&rsquo;m fairly certain the year was 1994, I was 14 or 15. It was a summer night and my gut feeling is it was July. I was camping out with approx. 5 friends in a friend&rsquo;s sheep pasture near his house. I would like to note that we were sober and there were no drugs involved. Two of them had snuck a couple of beers from the house and drank them but were not intoxicated.It was a perfectly clear night out and around midnight or 1am someone noticed the stars were moving. We all looked up and in increasing numbers there were lights zipping through the sky, at what appeared to be a distance outside of our atmosphere, they were small and the size of stars. As in the report I read on your site, our initial reaction was that it was a massive battle in space. The lights changed direction on a dime, curved and moved incredibly fast, changed color as well as disappeared and reappeared. Unlike the report on your site, I remember retaining the impression that this was some sort of battle and remember bursts of light similar to explosions and they were doing what appeared to be dog fighting.Growing up in a rural community I&rsquo;ve spent many a night watching meteor showers and shooting stars and can vouch that this was neither of these things.The lights slowly disappeared similar to how they had started until it was completely gone.

One of the byproducts of the fuel exhaust is water.&quot;The air is very cold so the water condenses and forms like drops very quickly and then these drops stay behind the plane until eventually they warm up and they evaporate.&quot;  Wynn-Williams doubts little green men from Mars are behind the UFO&rsquo;s.&quot;Some people just think differently than scientists and they like to look for the fanciest most exciting explanation. Those people would like to think it&apos;s little green men, I think that&apos;s very unlikely.&quot;  According to published reports this is not the first time a UFO has grabbed the attention of Hawaii residents.In December of 2004 an unexplained streak of light was captured by a camera on Haleakala moving southwest to northeast.

Since the sun was fully visible and the clouds were thin I couldn&apos;t understand how the blimp was casting a shadow if it itself wasn&apos;t visible where it should be located.  As I watched the shadow, it headed slowly to the North changing shape as it moved over the edges of the scattered clouds as one would expect to see from a large moving object above them creating the shadow.The cloud layer wasn&apos;t too large so the shadow finally disappeared as it left the layer on the right after about 30 seconds.  I continued to watch for anything that could have created the shadow thinking it would appear out of the sun maybe or was obscured by the clouds.  Nothing was ever seen in the sky for the 15 or so minutes I continued to watch and no other clouds were in the sky that afternoon at any level that could have caused the shadow.No sound was ever heard and considering the size of the shadow and the estimated four to five thousand foot cloud layer, from past experiences if it had been the blimp I&apos;m sure I would have heard it as it would have been upwind of my location and not all that far away.This &quot;sighting&quot; has haunted me for months now without an explanation and I am submitting it in the hopes that someone else around this time period may have witnessed it as well.I consider myself to be a credible witness being a private pilot with a passion towards anything that flies.

About 10 miles north of the Melbourne VOR and on the 343degree radial northbound, I witnessed a metallic spherical object 500-1000ft below me to my 11 oclock.  The object appeared to be about 3-5m minimum in diameter, could have been bigger, and was completely shiny with nothing interms of design or edges, a pure metallic sphere and passed over onto my wing side where i saw it, was about 500-1000 ft from me, and like i said about 500 ft to 1000 ft below the horizon and I can definitely see it in contrast to the green background of the ground.  It may have been hovering or traveling at a very slow speed.  With the sun reflecting the front portion of the sphere, I can literally focus on the rear and from there I followed it and made sure it was in fact a sphere and shiny metallic surface.

Before collapse, one stopped, the other made a half circle around.Around midnight, while vacationing at the farm in Kurilovo, Vladimirsky Region of Russia, I went for a night walk.  Once I stopped and looked at the black sky, full of stars.  I looked for a minute, admiring the myriads of stars from horizon to horizon.One light, the size of the average star, appeared to be moving fast enough to catch my attention. I starred at it, thinking first that this is some airplane or a comet. But very soon I noticed, not far from it, the light from another object, which was moving with the same constant speed, straight forward to the first object. They both moved toward each other, being on the same parallel line.I figured out, that very soon they might hit each other! So I prepared to watch what will happen when they meet front to front, certainly understanding, that the distance between them might be thousands of miles at that moment.But in two seconds before the possible collapse, or simply crossing each other&rsquo;s path, the first object, which was moving from East to West, suddenly stopped completely.But the second object, without making any stops or slowing down, completely changed it course to the South, and made a perfect half circle around the first object.As soon as the second object returned to the same parallel, but now being behind the first object, this first one immediately moved forward as fast, as it was moving before it, and they both continued to move in the same directions, as they have moved in the beginning.In a half minute or so, they both moved away from each other and I lost them.After what I have seen, I decided that UFOs are existed. The flying machines made by us, humans, as I know, can not make a sudden stop in the space, or change direction of flying almost at 90 degrees. Those guys were showing us what they can do, so we should believe in their existence.I made a graphic design of what I have seen, and published it on internet, to show their movements exactly.

The moon was spectacular Monday night.While waiting for the moon to rise I caught a glimpse of light out of my right eye.  Initially I thought another street light had come on and didn&rsquo;t give it a second thought.  However, a few seconds later a second light appeared relatively close to the first light.  The first light disappeared.  A third light appeared close to the second light. When the third light appeared the second light went off.  After the  third light went off they all came on at the same time.  Then itstarted over again.  The lights were on about 15-30 seconds each time.By this time my adrenaline was at it&rsquo;s all time high.  I became anxious and scared.  I left the parking lot to go get my husband,  by the time we got back, no more lights.  If there is ever a next time, I will stay.The lights came on and off very deliberately.  There was no movement that I could see.  I got outside my car to listen for noise.  There was none.  The lights were very low in the sky and seemed to be very close.  The lights appeared to be over the High School.The  lights  were on the same plane, close together,  but were  not the same distance apart.  The color of the first light is what initially caught my eye.  The lights were very bright, had a yellowish tint and were uniform in shape.  The lights came on quickly and they seemed slow to turn off.  The lights were not the same color as the stars.Fort Leonard Wood is very close to Salem.  There is fighter jet activity over Salem all the time.   I tried to rationalize the lights coming from some sort of aircraft  from Fort Leonard Wood.

PD))", "1978 Atlantic Ocean Sighting&quot;While around 90 miles off the eastern coast of Georgia on board a military vessle that was stationary in the water giving a foreign freighter needed fuel, a contact appeared on the radar scope that was verified as a &quot;true echo&quot; as well as not a craft that is from the United States or an allied nation.This echo was showing up at 900 feet altitude which is the exact height that the surface search radar ends &amp; the air search radar begins. As the echo faded from the surface search radar it began appearing brilliantly on the air-search radar, then vise versa.Around 10 minutes later, upon exiting the radar room to go outside for a possible visual, it was immediately noticed that it had become quite foggy outside! Visibility was less than 50 feet! Yet, the last weather observation was low humidity, 74 degrees and calm wind!  It was at that point that previous books read pertaining to U.F.O.&apos;s, sightings, abductions, etc. became the thinking while going to the port-side of the ship.( In one abduction case written about, the author had written about how aliens went about preparing the abductees for viewing what was to be a sort of weather show that the aliens were about to conduct).Upon arriving to the port side of the ship &amp; looking upward about 45 degrees towards the baring the echo showed on the radars, it was witnessed that within the fog was a diamond shaped object that was showing various colors like that of a gem was seen.There was no sound whatsoever coming from the object, nor was it moving. Once atop the bridge (called flying bridge), a &apos;bolted-to-the-deck&apos; double lens telescope was swung towards the objects direction. Once focused onto the object, one could see what was the outline of what appeared to be the window area of a saucer or ship.The various lights emitted from this craft seemed to come from all areas except for the windows area. The windows area appeared as a dark tinted set of windows, and that there seemed to be motions coing from inside the glass though one couldn&apos;t get a very clear view through the tinted glass along with the fog that was drifting past the windows in waves.The windows area appeared to be angling downward towards the ship, the bottom pointed end of the craft appeared to be slanted back while the pointed top appeared to be pointing forward as was the tinted windows just below the top point of this craft.It was decided to go back to the radar room to attempt to get further data established without alerting any officer or crewmate. Once back inside the radarroom, the echo was still appearing on either the surface search or the air search radars. It was then that it was decided that this craft is aware of the radars antenna&apos;s &apos;beamwidths&apos;!  The width between the two antennas is mere feet but enough that if a craft has the ability to trace the ships electrical output from those antennas that craft could in fact hide between the two radar antennas without being detected.The good thing was that this craft was not completely successful in hiding itself completely either with the heavy fog nor between the beam-widths of the two antennas. As minutes passed, it was noticed that this echo began to move!  This echo was plotted during 3 complete sweeps from the air-search radar (set at 350 miles). After the 3rd sweep  the echo disappeared completely off the radar screen! The results of the 3 plotted marks were; 1. Altitude 1000 feet, speed 400 knots, 2. altitude over 15,000 feet, speed est. near 800 knots, 3. Altitude surpassing 50,000 feet, speed est. over 5000 knots!   It was then decided to go back outside for any further visual possible. Once outside, there was no fog whatsoever present, the sky was completely clear with the sun shining which was the precise weather just before the contact had first appeared on either radar screen!   As for the name of the military vessle, any other witnesses, etc., it has been kept annonymous. Though noone on board the ship was alerted to this sighting, others did notice and it was talked about by fellow radar operators, crewmates, etc. for days to come afterwards.The above information is of fact to the best of ones knowledge, and is in no way a hoax or the like.Also, this report is not the 1st sighting ever seen by oneself. Another sighting can be traced back to either 1966 or 1967 during the summer which was located 60 miles north of Albany NY &amp; was printed in a small column in the local newspaper there (Post Star).Footnote; there are other details of the ocean sighting that were omitted due to protecting witnesses as well as oneself.

It was 4 stars almost dipper like when one of the stars took off from the constellation at a steady speed and course across the sky to the north. We watched it by eye and telescope for roughly 5 min (the approximate time it took to cross the sky to its end point) at which point it literally disappeared.  It was the same size of, color of, and shape of the stars. White, tiny and sphere, for lack of better term. After freaking out about this for about 10 min. we went back to watching the skies, and from another constellation in the same are but just a little west of the first one, another star took off.  Same speed, same shape.  They were both very high in the sky, too high to be a plane and after research there were non estimated sattelite crossings that day.

We weren&apos;t sure, and looked in the sky for another aircraft as a reference speed and found one.  When we looked back, we noticed it had started to go from left to right in an upwards direction.  It continued it&apos;s course eastward, then suddenly went upwards moving slightly towards the east much much faster than it moved across the sky, in a matter of seconds it was out of our eyesight.

A group of us from the same Department were on a recreational basketball team that played in the evenings.  As we stood in the parking lot on a very cold night, talking, all 9 of us saw:  Approaching from the South, an area of sky that was dark, meaning the stars were covered by an object.  It was low in the sky, moving very slowly.  As it came closer we could all see it was a huge triangular shaped object, wider than it was long, similar to a B-2 bomber, but much larger.  I estimate it was at least 100 yards from &quot;wing&quot; tip to &quot;wing&quot; tip, and about 25 yards long.  There was no light of any type, just the obvious blotting out of the night sky, which was full of stars in our small town. As it came directly overhead, and slightly East of our location, the most blatant thing that stood out was the lack of any sound from the object.  I estimate its altitude at 500-1000 ft.  Even as it slowly passed, and continued north, there was no sound at all, and no lights.  While we had barely said a word while it was in sight, we all started talking about it, comparing details.  We all agreed that, due to the very slow speed, and lack of sound at its low height, that it was not an aircraft.   (Our small town was on Victor 32, an airliner &quot;freeway&quot; from California to Seattle, and we had all seen and heard a lot of aircraft before.)

All five lights were round, the same color and were steadily lit.  The aircraft was black and triangular.  It was a clear night. We didn&apos;t hear any sound come from the aircraft but of course our windows were up.

It was approximately early afternoon and the wind was really blowing very hard.  We were approaching Auto Outlet (a car dealership).  It was common practice for the car dealership to have balloons (this month I seem to recall single purple and yellow helium filled balloons) tied to the front posts and lot lighting fixtures.  Due to the velocity of the wind the balloons were straining against their ties and leaning towards the Auto Outlet buildings and away from I-35 in the direction of the wind.  I was right at the northernmost corner of the Auto Outlet property and my husband was approximately 4 bike lengths ahead of me (he is a faster stronger rider in a hard wind or just about anytime).  We were on the western side of I -35 on this access road. We were on our way home from a pleasant ride that day. The Auto Outlet property has a bill board, or it did then, on the McCarty side of the lot where south bond drivers on I-35 can read about their car dealership.  This bill board is about a standard large bill board size that businesses pay for ad space so highway driver&apos;s can read the signs. My husband and I look above the roof line of the Auto Outlet buildings and observed a very strange sight. There was a rectangular, 3 D object floating slowly straight up above the buildings.  Next to that object was a 3 dimensional square cube object.  This object changed over time in appearance and navigational mode so I&apos;ll do my best to try to explain what I observed.  The larger object was the rectangular object.  From what I observed the side closest to me, the bottom, the back end and  the front end were a purple grey type of material that had no seam lines.  The object appeared to be filled with gas and the fabric covering the shell without seam lines did not undulate but kept a rigid straight line appearance on all edges and sides that I could observe while lifting slowly up at first.  On the end closest to the billboard side of the building there was a short distance to the cube, and there were no connecting ropes, guy lines etc.  The cube was rotating on a 360 degree pattern, always remaining at the same end of the rectangle.  The cube rotated that 360 degrees at a faster rotation rate than the lift rate of the two objects together.  The cube straight up lift rate was the same as the purple grey rectangle.   The cube appeared to have a purple bottom and alternating purple grey on one side, red on line side and yellow on one side and black on one side of the cube accounting for a 4 sided cube.  The cube like the rectangle had no seam lines, appeared to be of some kind of fabric, without seams, and kept the edges and sides perfectly straight and rigid there was no undulation in the fabric like a cloth baloon would be expected to have.  Also surprising there was no visible frame structure such as internal piping retaining the outer edges of either the cube or the rectangle. As the objects continued to slowly rise, I noticed as did my husband, that if these objects were filled with a bouyant gas, it sure did not move away from I-35 as the Auto Outlet yellow and purple lot balloons did.  The objects did not respond to the very gusy wind that day in terms of speed and direction.  The objects were going straight up slowly as though no wind were present at all!!  It was so gusty it was hard to ride the bikes sideways to the wind.  The winds slowed our speed.  It took a lot more effort to pedal against this kind of wind and move. It was very surprising to my husband and myself that no one on I-35 tried to pull over on the shoulder and stop and look at these two objects.  It was as though they did not see the objects as unusual or they had no frame of reference with which to relate to the objects.The objects did not make any sound at all as they moved.After the objects got above the height of the &quot;along the access road power lines&quot;, they changed configuration.  The purple grey rectangle shifted somehow as on an invisible axis and moved from horizontal view to an up-ended view and as it did so the cube moved with it, still rotating as it did so in relationship to the very same end of the rectangle.   The cube ended up above the straight ended up rectangle and continued its rotation at all times.  Remember please, there were no guys, no ropes, no attachments between the cube, the space between and the end of the rectangle.Once up-ended in a vertical arrangement, the purple grey fabric of the rectangle began to undulate like a catepillar&apos;s segmented body trying to move up a leave blowing in the wind.  Pockets of gas started to undulate upwards inside the rectangle towards the top end of the object.  As more gas was moving upwards, gas from below leaving the lower portion, caused the object to lose the rigid rectangular shape from the original lift, sinking in in that region and narrowing the formerly rectangular lower end section.  The top section closest to the cube was rounded now and the fabric was bulging out from the increased gas pockets inside.    The overall structure looked like it was climbing up not just floating up.  All this while the cube kept its perfect cube shape and continued rotating without attachment on the same end of the other object it always stayed in configuration with.This continued until the object was quite small and as high up as the air space normally traveled by a stunt plane pre-jet.  At that height, it appeared to resume the shape originally seen during the lift and turned the cube end west ward.  Originally the cube end was facing the south.  With the cube facing west I could only see the bottom of the purple rectangle and the back end of the original purple grey rectangular larger object.  At this point, the objects took off at a vastly increased speed, while not as fast as a jet air plane it was noticeably faster than any derrigle I have ever observed.  The rate was possibly faster than a private beechcraft plane going approximately 120 miles an hour or more.  My brother owns one and I have flown as a passenger in his plane before.I have never seen anything move like this before, constructed like this before, change shape like this before, and my husband and I do not believe the objects were man made.We do believe it was some kind of  surveying unit or probe for close observation of the environment.  Something like a mobile environmental collector.The area is close to the Balcones fault line, the Edwards Aquifer recharge zone, Canyon Lake area.  So there are geographic anomalies close by.  San Marcos River is entirely spring fed from the Aquifer.Close in calendar time, we read an article about the US Government considering budgeting funds for high flying spy derribles.  However, this was before that project was funded because the news story stated lobbying was going on to obtain support for a bill in Congress to fund the spy derrigibles.  Such spy derrigibles were to be extremely high altitude units.The objects we saw flew close to the ground and in normal air space.  They simply moved as nothing else ever observed and were constructed in a unique way out of unique materials.It would appear from when we first saw the rectangular 3 D with rotating cube on one end that it had just lifted up from the lot behind the Auto Outlet and we had arrived at the frontage access road just as the slowly rising object topped over the top of the buildings.  We did not take pictures.  I do not know if my husband would consent to talking about this to anyone for fear of derision.  I want to protect my anonymity because I am a licensed state professional.Second first hand account  My husband and I were driving into Austin Texas on I-35 and observed two grey apparently gas filled tubular shapes, the length of a standard pick up truck undulating in movement floating very close to the ground but never touching the ground, down I-35 next to a concrete divider wall (units for use while road construction is in progress), between Onion Creek and Town Lake.  We both were amazed.   The objects paced our vehicle perfectly, we were going about 65 mph because traffic was heavey in broad day light.  The objects were directly in front of us and over to the driver&apos;s side closest to the concrete divider.  Then we watched in total amazement as one object went straight throught the concrete divider having turned with the movement of an eel towards the  concrete divider it had been traveling next to.  The other object  undulated sideways and up and over the top of the concrete divider unit and down the other side.  Both left our view at that point.  We both agreed they did not appear man made, had no seams.  These two units were grey gas filled like tubes that undulated like eels and/or worms,  were longer than a man is tall, and seemed to make decisional changes in direction and speed. They also appeared translucent, which the tow objects described in first hand account were definately not translucent at any time that we observed.  It was almost as if the grey tubes were life forms.  No eyes, no mouths, etc.   The skin on these two objects did not look like any kind of fabric but rather like a membrane.  The closest thing I can think of is imagine a picture of a cell under a microscope without the internal elements and cilia.We did not take pictures.  No camera on hand at the time.  I am not sure that my husband would agree to talk to anyone and I am a licensed state professional.Family related experience  My California Aunt and Uncle (Uncle is now deceased) had a home on private land that adjoined the Tahoe National Forest.  This couple owns more than one home.  They had a hill top home with a sliding glass door and outside deck overlooking a forested valley towards Tahoe National Forest.  They get so many grazing acre rights inside the forest for having land adjoining the forest.  This is why they located there or so my mother has told me.  One night they were both sleeping with the curtains open where they could see out through their sliding glass doors as they feel asleep.  At the same moment they awoke to see a blinding white light fill their bedroom and the space outside the sliding glass door.  As if mesmerized they felt drawn to go outside on the deck to try to discern the shape of the object and make out what it was.  The object they told me later was huge and appeared to be round due to the light.  They never could see the defined edges of the object because the brightness of the light never diminished enough to make out the actual edges.  The object made no sound and drifted or floated towards the valley floor below them.  After a while it appeared to land and the lights went out.  When the lights went out, because they were out in the country there were no surrounding lights to reveal the ship.  In the morning they got up determined to attempt to travel to a road closest to where the ship landed and to hike on foot to try to find the landing sight and see if the ship was still there.  They wanted to know what was going on where the ship had landed.  When they got approximately where they would have to pull over on the shoulder of the road and hike to the site, they saw a man that looked exactly normal from a distance.  They drove right up to him, stopped and got out to speak to him.  The man was dress in a white shirt, white pants, white belt, white socks, white shoes, all in white.  His hair was soft and his face was unlined.  The man was normal height and had black hair, black eyes with undiscernable pupils from the color portion of the eyes, fair skin like a caucasian and normal looking features.  However the air there felt charged and something about this man did not feel right to my aunt and uncle.  At this time my aunt and uncle  were in their mid fifties.  The man appeared no older than his thirties.  He was lean and fit.   They asked this man if he had seen the bright light in the sky last night and if he was there looking for what had landed.  They asked him where his car was.  The man was in the middle of no where so to speak and there were no other people around, no animals in view, no bicycles in view, no motorized vehicles of any kind save my aunt and uncles car.  They asked him if he needed assistance or a ride somewhere.The man at first listened to their questions but said nothing.  When my aunt and uncle fell silent and stopped asking questions the man looked at them like he really meant business and told them that it would be in their best interest not to try to find the landing site, not to hike in the woods that day, not to stay in the area and that they should leave the area immediately.  They left feeling not at all comfortable with the situation.  Having driving less than a car length away my uncle said he stopped the car to look back towards the man to see if he had failed to observe anything else important.  The man had simply disappeared from view.  There was a distance of at least 100 feet or more between the road and the tree line of the forest and nothing man made or geologic for the man to hide behind.  The man had simply disappeared from view.  They said they never saw anything like this before or after this experience.  They told me they were certain the ship was a UFO and the man was not a human born on this planet.My aunt and uncle did not give me permission to release this information but they told it to me first hand.  They did not take any pictures.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Low clouds were moving in with the stars still visible through the breaks. I only say this because there was no storm brewing (ie. not lightning). A car was driving by and there was (what appeared) a flash of light which illuminated things around me. I figured it was a reflection and paid it no attention. Then it happened again. At that point I went to the railing to see where the flashes were coming from and just at that moment I saw a bright bluish-green flash to the south of me with a very distinct rod-like center. It was just a single pulse that lasted only a second. I stayed outside for another few minutes hoping to see more, but nothing happened. I spoke with a meteorologist the next day about the possibility of it being lightning, but he said that under the conditions, it probably wasn&rsquo;t lightning. I&rsquo;m an artist by trade and have always been open minded to alternate possibilities. Plus I have always been prone to witnessing strange things.

I know what a fighter jet looks like at 600 MPH and the sound it makes.  I&apos;m surprised I even saw this object but when I looked up for some reason there was this object whizzing overhead and ascending up and out of site away from me at a speed faster than anything I have ever witnessed.From my perspective it looked about the size of a basketball but I was able to see it disappear into clouds.

I was told that the zoom on the camera would allow pictures to be taken of a meteoroid shower that I was told would be taking place that night. I was taking random shots of the beach and of us and then just to test the camera I aimed it at the sky and snapped. At first all I got were black shots with tiny little dots for stars and then I got something that I had never seen before. At first I thought the meteoroid shower had started, but I couldn&rsquo;t see anything with my naked eye and plus, these lights were going in all different directions. So I snapped another shot and again, the black screen with just the dots. Then I tried the &ldquo;series&rdquo; option on the camera (takes several photos in one minute) and what I got was amazing. A couple of the shots were just black, but I got 2 more pictures of these light streaks and I was baffled because I could not see any of this with my naked eye, only when I snapped the picture, and only 4 times out of the 50 something shots I took. I showed the pictures to my boyfriend and when we got home we uploaded them and took a closer look at these streaks on the computer. You can see many different colors, shapes and even a orb in one!

Object/light hovered in one spot for about 2-3 minutes, then disappeared when camera auto-focus beam went off. This just happened last night.  I was at the computer...my wife was doing the dishes...we both kept hearing an unusually loud, low pitched, rumbling sound, going overhead...We could not tell, from inside if the sounds were jet engines, or the wind.  I had gotten up and looked outside on three earlier occasions to see what it was, or if I could see something flying overhead.  There was, in fact, a constant howling wind all evening.  But, there also was a steady stream of jets, aircraft, or something overhead.  I couldn&apos;t see them because of the cloud cover, but I could hear them, that is, apart from the wind.  And, I could hear the Doppler pitch change in the engine sound as they passed by. Except for the chemtrail planes (I have 100&rsquo;s of photos) there are no regular flight paths over my place. There also are no major airports nearby.  We have two community airports, Potsdam &amp; Massena, each about 12 miles from my location; one due west, one due north.  Fort Drum is approx 80 miles southwest of my location.  There were no stars or moon visible, there was a low cloud cover, and it was quite windy...I could not tell from inside if the sound I was hearing was the wind or a jet engine...which is why I kept going outside and checking. Just before I went outside for a fourth time (and this is where it gets a little weird), I said to my wife: &quot;I keep getting a sensation like I am being watched, or stared at;&quot; like when someone is standing behind you and is staring at you, and you can almost &quot;feel&quot; it.  The thing is, she was off to my left, in my field of vision, doing the dishes; and we live alone?  I went outside and this time there was a single very bright white light, shining like a star over my neighbor&apos;s barn, who happens to be a Detective, BCI, with the NYS Troopers, and who was outside with his family observing and commenting in an excited way about the light/object...we live approximately 150 yds apart.  The light wasn&apos;t reflecting like the moon...it was shining, sparkling, or emitting light, and so bright, I could only see light, I could not see an object, just a light.  I was looking slightly North of West, up at an angle of approx 35&deg; from the earth...the object was slightly smaller than my thumbnail extended at arms length...there were no other lights in the sky...I live in the country, there are no streets lights or other forms of light pollution.  The object must have been quite low in the sky, because there was a low, visible cloud covering/ceiling last night. I asked my wife to get my camera, a Canon Power Shot S2-IS (it gets a little weirder here).  As I pulled the camera up to my eye, I was thinking I was going to have trouble finding the object in the viewfinder, shooting in total darkness and all.  I was surprised to see the object, right there in the view finder, no problem at all finding it...I zoomed in some on the object and was I thinking; &ldquo;I&apos;ll take this picture, and then I&apos;ll take another with the flash up/on and see if the object responds to it.&rdquo;  I had the auto-focus on, and when I squeezed the shutter to focus, of course it shot out that green laser beam.  Then, just as, perhaps slightly before, the shutter went off (I have the camera set to make a sound like an old 35mm) and there was a slight delay in the shot because the camera had set the exposure to 1/8 of a second&hellip;. just after I zoomed in, and just before the camera locked on and froze the image, I saw in the view-finder the object change from a bright shining white light, to a blue, violet, and green sphere with white light shining through the colors with a blotchy sort look...it kind of looked like a picture of the surface of sun, except this was blue/violet/green...that&apos;s when the shutter went off...and that is what the picture shows. I can&rsquo;t say if the object actually changed in appearance, or if it was the &ldquo;zooming&rdquo; that caused me to see it differently throught the viewfinder?  My wife didn&rsquo;t see what I saw, the change in the objects appearance/color from bright a bright white light, to a blue/violet/green sphere&hellip;she had just turned to shut the front door, it was chilly out, and when she turned back, she asked; &ldquo;where did it go?&rdquo;  I could not see the object in the viewfinder anymore...it seemed to just disappear&hellip;.I didn&rsquo;t even think I got anything on the exposure.  I pulled the camera away from my eye to see if I could re-find the object without the camera.  There was a glowing in the cloud cover where the object had been.  I could hear my neighbor and his family saying to each other; &ldquo;Did you see that?&rdquo;&hellip;Everyone sounded quite excited, so was my wife and I.  It looked as if the object was now above the clouds and illuminating them from above.  Although, I could not see anything of the object anymore, or make out any shape...just the clouds slightly illuminated from above where the object/light had been.  The illumination was growing fainter quite fast...so, I pulled the camera back up and tried to get a second picture...it doesn&apos;t show much...just looks like there&rsquo;s some slightly illuminated fog. I haven&rsquo;t talked to my neighbor yet.  I&apos;ve known him since he was born, and I don&apos;t know if he&apos;ll even admit to me, let alone anyone else, that he was outside looking up too?  I can&apos;t imagine he&apos;s going to go on record, considering his position...he&apos;s a detective with the NYS Police, BCI, 25 years.  I hope to see him tonight, or perhaps this weekend, I&apos;ll see what happens.

I have seen chunks of cosmic debris burning up as they pass in to our atmosphere in a variety of colors, shooting stars, satellites, and all sorts of aircraft, YET I&apos;ve NEVER seen anything like this. I was on the phone with my friend and decided to go outside for a bit.  I was looking up in to the clear night sky when all of the sudden, my eyes caught unfamiliar movement.  I focused in on the movement.  My eyes revealed to me two triangular shaped crafts.  They were dark in color and had white spots all over the bottom.  I assumed the white spots on the bottom were for lights.  They looked like lights that weren&apos;t turned on. The crafts were flying due North.  They seemed to be at the height of a low-flying plane.  A few odd things I noticed:  -They flew like birds gliding through the sky.  No noise whatsoever.-As the went off in to the horizon, they were flying towards eachother, but didn&apos;t seem to be impacting one another.-While they were shaped like triangles, they were not equilateral.  Not only that, but they were not flying aerodynamically.  What would visually appear as the head of the triangle, was NOT the front of the northern moving ships.  It was like they were flying sideways. This sighting lasted about 15 seconds.  It all happened so quick that I was not able to even think about getting my camera inside.  Way too dark, way to short of a sighting.  However, I am a skeptic at heart.  I have NEVER seen anything like this, and know what I saw was valid. The mystery to me is: were these man-made craft that are just being kept secret, or are these extraterrestrial craft?  Either way, they were most certainly UFO&apos;s to my eyes.", "Strange light looking like a satellite moving slowly at first suddenly darts around the sky back and forth then stops.My mother and friend and I were walking outside a populated area at night around 8:30pm on the 17th of march 2007. we stopped for a fire works display in honor of St. Patrick&apos;s day and it was a fabulous display lasting about 10 minutes. After the display was over we continued looking at the sky it was a beautiful clear evening. Suddenly we were looking at an object that appeared out of nowhere it looked like a satellite moving in the sky. satellite look like slow moving stars so thats what we thought it was at first. we commented on how cool it was to see such things like satellite in the sky, as our eyes followed the bluish looking star object drifting slowly to the right of us it suddenly darted to the left of the sky then the right then left again then hovered slowly and stopped. my mom pointed it out to our friend was a student pilot, she said wow thats really strange planes do not fly that high or move that fast and satellite do not dart quickly across the atmosphere. We left the area after the object stopped moving and just looked like another star in the sky. It was odd how it appeared to us after the fireworks like maybe the strange light was drawn to the area by the other bright lights.I have never seen anything like this in my life and I can honestly say I have found no explanation for it but it definitely left me with a confirmed feeling to my core that we are not alone in the universe.", "I think I have had a close encounter in Oranger County CaliforniaI was observing and airplane overhead going west, and I could hear it.......... just then I saw a silent formation of 5 aircraft flying east in formation all in one row, each about the size of a 727, guessed size from  lights, they were in my view for only 8 - 10 seconds and disappeared.  There was not any sound from these 5 aircraft at all.  The odd thing is the silence and the fact the lights disappeared when it was a clear nite, I could have followed for at least another 2 minutes, but their lights were gone.

The object had no discernable shape or size (but must have been somewhat large due to its apparent distance from our location). It was very bright white, or blue-white, or orange, or red-white in color; which constantly changed in no particular order or sequence, and continuously varied in intensity. The light intensity of this object was at least an order of magnitude higher than that of any current aircraft landing or taxi lighting system I am familiar with, and the object was observed traveling away from our location, therefore, by comparison, landing and/or taxi lights would not be very apparent, if this object was a landing aircraft traveling away from us. In addition, the familiar blinking of aircraft position lights was not present at all. We watched the object from an initial distance of approximately 4 miles and approximately 15000 feet AGL (which seemed to vary somewhat), as it traveled away from us from east to west, for about &frac34; of an hour. The height AGL of the object was approximately constant (about 15000 feet); therefore, after &frac34; of an hour, the object was about 16 miles away.The most disturbing aspect of this object (and the character that caught and held my attention) was its &lsquo;amorphous&rsquo; nature. We viewed this object for almost an hour, mostly through field glasses and a high powered camera lens, and were struck by the constant change of its shape, size, color and position.The experience was disturbing for us, since we could not explain its behavior. However, if the flight path is extrapolated on a map, it does come close to Ft. Hood, TX. Perhaps the object was a new military aircraft undergoing flight qualification testing?", "Green Flash seen during Long Beach Black Outthere was a black out tonight around 2:00am on thursday february 8 (just right now). The only problem was that only one side of the city or street I don&apos;t really know was blacked out. But the other side had light. The weird part was when I opened my blinds to see outside, I saw this green light in the sky just flash. Sort of like a lightning bolt but faster. It was pretty weird.

It was a C130 between 5000 - 7500&apos; altitude heading West on climb out having departed from Andrews Air Force Base just across the Potomac River in Maryland.  Nothing unusual, but then I noticed above the C130, at a higher altitude, around 30,000&apos; two translucent white &quot;round&quot; objects on a North East heading.  I would never noticed these objects had I not looked up at the C130.  They actually intersected the path of the C130 at the moment I was looking, with the objects being higher up than the plane.  As the plane continued on its western heading the two objects continued North East over D.C. and out of sight.  The first object seemed to move steadily on its course.  The second object seemed to be several hundred feet behind and moved in a manner as that of a child lagging behind a parent and not moving directly straight ahead, still keeping pace with the first object.  The two objects appeared to be as large or larger than a commercial airliner and left no contrails.  While I was watching this, a military jet at a much higher altitude 50,000&apos;+ was heading in the opposite direction of South West.  I used the military jet as a comparison in determining the size of the two circular objects.  All craft just continued on their way without interuption.

Then I saw that it was a black triangular shape. It looked HUGE as it passed slowly and silently over me. I stopped the car and got out to watch and study it, as I had never seen anything like it.  I wanted to memorize every detail. It was close enough that I could see that it had lights recessed under the wings and they were of different colors.  There were 4 down one wing and 3 down the other. I watched till it disappeared behind the trees, heading west.  Oddly I didn&rsquo;t feel any fear of it, only intense curiosity. I went home and told my husband who just kind of blew me off so I didn&rsquo;t mention it again.During the night I got up with the baby and had the radio on.

I happened to be facing North toward a double glass sliding door.  The front of this home faces East.  Immediately I noticed what seemed to be two fireballs falling from the sky.  They seemed to falling from right to left, at an angle of approximately 15-30 degrees.  The first one was larger than the one following behind.  I would estimate the size of the larger one to be at least &frac12; the size or perhaps even &frac34; of a full moon.  They were both bright orange and yellow blazes of light, as fire is.  Those who did not see them thought it could be fireworks. I have never seen sparks from fireworks this large and bright.

As I watched it I couldn&apos;t believe what I was seeing, another object this one round looked like a metallic ball, decended from the bottom of the stationary object.  The size of this object was one tenth the size of the other.  The round object then procceded to fly in our direction (west), staying at the same altitude. The speed was incrediably high, I cranned my neck to keep my sight on the object, I watched it fly overhead until it disappeared over the trees behind us, this took only a few seconds and it was gone.  I then watched the original object for a few seconds more, the it slowly moved in a northern direction dissapearing into the clouds.  Still trying to located it, I then noticed two fighter jets, I couldn&apos;t see the markings.  The jets were flying at a high rate of speed, chasing the object.

We decided to forego the tent and sleep in the car as it was so late. I was preparing my sleeping bag which he smoked a cigar and went to the restroom. While laying in my bag, I was looking at all the stars through the sunroof. He was standing outside the car.At some point, I looked into the woods in the direction toward the restrooms. I saw lights that twinkled and appeared to be moving slowly. The best description to give would be that they were similar to when a group of people have flashlights and walk, the lights stay somewhat level, but move back and forth, up and down a bit. The lights also would go off completely and come back on.At this point, I wasn&apos;t scared. I asked my boyfriend what the lights were since he had walked over to the restroom a minute ago. He said he didn&apos;t know and that we should just leave. That scared me since he is typically not scared of anything. So he jumped in the car and started driving while I was climbing from the back into the front seat.While we drove, I looked into the woods. The lights went off and did not come back on.The easy explanation is that these were hunters, or people who lived nearby. But there were no houses around for several miles, and no cars parked at the side of the road. There were no other campers in the area and many camps were closed down due to the season.My natural feeling what that we should go and explore what the light was, and that scares me.I can&apos;t say that this was a UFO. But I can say it was not human, not a building, not a campfire. This area of the woods was very small and there was no way it could have been anything easily explanable.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

As it traveled I realized that it was orange cause of the reflection of the sun.  But it still looked a little odd.  So I yelled for my wife to bring out the binoculars when looking through the binoculars I Noticed that it was red on the bottom and it had no wings like a plane.   With Closer observation it looked like the object was gliding instead of flying.  My friend and my wife looked through the binoculars and described seeing the same thing.

It was really bright and very low, I drove into my cousins driveway and told the occupants to look outside because I thought I saw a UFO or something.  One of the boys looked outside and said, &quot;Oh yeah I see it, it might be a star.&quot; Then I left the house and continued to watch the object in the sky.  It kept changing colors to red, blue and yellow-orange.  I then picked my boyfriend up and I told him about the UFO. We went on the grade near Hays and parked there with our lights off and watched this object for 10 minutes.  It started to change and look like a fireball, changing colors again, red, blue and orange and a little blue green light came out of the right bottom side of it.  The object or fireball began to dance side to side up and down then it would stop and it started to grow larger. My boyfriend said, &quot;You better start the car it looks like its coming toward us.&quot; The object started to come toward us as it moved back and forth.  It seemed to know that we were watching it, I started to get scared and started the car and when the lights came on in my car the object disappeared from view.  We then drove home and called friends in neighbors about the UFO.  Apparently alot of these objects or UFO&apos;s are sighted over Hays.

They did not seem to be flying that fast and appeared to be about 1000-1500 feet up, but it was hard to tell. I saw them for about 30 seconds. They were not planes or balloons.

March 13, 2007My daughter and I were driving home at approximately 7:40 PM (PST) on Tuesday, March 13, 2007 in Simi Valley California when I caught something blue out of the corner of my eye. It was airborne and flying at a very high rate of speed. I looked to my left just as my daughter, who was sitting in the passenger&rsquo;s seat, did. I saw two blue lights flying side by side. It looked as if there were two vehicles flying side by side at extremely high speeds, one slightly above the other. As the vehicle approached, and was in front of us, there appeared to be only one, not two. The vehicle flew very low, low enough for us to make out certain details, but not low enough to skim roof tops or anything of that nature. The only way I can find to describe this vehicle sounds rather silly. It looked like a snowboard. It was rectangular with slightly rounded corners. There was a blue light on each end and the bottom was illuminated white, although no white lights were actually visible. It was bigger than a plane that seats two but smaller than a large passenger jet. The vehicle itself was platinum colored, very shiny. There were no windows visible. It looked very thin in reference to &quot;cockpit&quot; height. I don&rsquo;t know where someone would have been sitting? Maybe reclined a bit?  My 10 year old daughter was frightened and asked me &quot;Mommy, what is that?&quot;  I simply responded, &quot;I have no idea honey,&quot; as I could think of nothing to relate this vehicle to. It had no wings and made no sound. It flew like nothing I&rsquo;d seen before. I am not aware of any vehicle that our military possesses that could possibly fly as fast as this was flying. My daughter and I were evidently not the only people in awe of this sight as there were people driving in the same direction down the same side street that I was, 3 other vehicles, and we all stopped! I never even looked in my rear view mirror. There were people out walking; the weather was beautiful and very warm that evening, as well as watering lawns and they were all stopped and pointing up. I was approximately 3 blocks from my home, short neighborhood blocks, not city blocks. I looked away for a second when I realized that I was literally stopped in the middle of the street. Every other car was stopped as well, including a black vehicle that was stopped dead center in a crossing of two streets. It was surreal, like something you&rsquo;d picture in a movie and as I sat there, I kept trying to make sense of what I was seeing. As soon as I got my bearings, I realized that I had been holding my cell because a few seconds before I saw the lights, I heard it ring the voicemail tone. I hit the speed dial for my husband. I kept saying, &ldquo;go outside, go outside and look up!&rdquo; He was totally confused and was asking in which direction? I told him to &ldquo;look east toward Santa Susana Pass because there is something flying in that direction that is unbelievable!&rdquo; He wasn&rsquo;t fast enough; he only saw the two lights far, far in the distance. My daughter and I had been driving North on the side street and had to make a right turn on our street, going east toward my home. As I reached the intersection of my home street and the street I&rsquo;d been traveling on, I could still see the vehicle in the distance. Again, it looked as though it were two and not one, with one light slightly above the other, side by side. I looked away to the left before making the right hand turn and when I looked back up, it was gone. When the vehicle was in front of us you could clearly see that it was traveling end to end, but when it was coming toward us and passing us, it appeared as though it was flying side to side. My daughter still insists that it was two, they came together (she uses her hands to describe this), and when they passed, they split apart. I tend to think that it has something to do with the angle it was flying at that makes it appear as though it was two, an optical illusion I guess. I had assumed that there would be many reports of this as I was on a tiny side street and there had to be at least 12 probably more like 15 people on that street alone! It was flying the length of the Valley; I can&rsquo;t imagine how many other people saw it, but it had to be a large number. It wasn&rsquo;t 100% dark, it was clear and there was no way you could miss this thing as low as it was flying, unless you happened to be looking down. Unfortunately my older daughter and her friend were out on the drive way of our next door neighbor&rsquo;s house, drawing on the ground with chalk, and missed the whole thing! My older daughter kept saying &ldquo;But we didn&rsquo;t hear anything!&rdquo;  I don&rsquo;t know what it was, but it was ridiculously fast, silent and wingless. It flew in a straight line and the lights on the bottom were constant, no blinking etc. It doesn&rsquo;t appear that anyone reported it, or if they did, I haven&rsquo;t read anything about it. They probably feel much the same as I do. You don&rsquo;t want people to think you&rsquo;re crazy and you don&rsquo;t want to be audited every year for the rest of your life for asking the government what it was! lol  I&rsquo;m posting this to try and get a reasonable explanation to help my little one sleep better at night. Like I said, she was frightened, I on the other hand thought it was amazing but was not in fear at all; more in awe.", "Extremely bright white (sometimes greenish) flashes of light blocking house windows. Central Scotland.My teenage daughter woke up the other night (3 am) to extremely bright lights in her window. She sat up in bed and watched them for about 15 minutes as she said she knew it wasn&apos;t anything she&apos;d seen before (not lightening, headlights, etc.) She then woke up my other daughter and they watched the lights together. At 3:30 am they woke me up to see the lights. Both were visibly scared. The light was very bright, white and sometimes had a green tint. It came in flashed occuring every 3 to 4 minutes or so. We live in the country but do have a few houses near us. I wanted to call our neighbours to see if they could see the lights too but as it was 3:30 am I didn&apos;t feel I should. Now I wish I had. We saw no object and heard no noise, just this extreme bright light that completely blocked out the windows, lasted all of 1 or 2 seconds each time and went away (a flash). Again, I have seen numerous lightening storms in my life and have never come across anything like this. I am so curious as to what could have caused this. If I hadn&apos;t been so tired and if we didn&apos;t have to get up for work and school the next morning I would have stayed up as late as possible to investigate more. The only explanation we could come up with are the Northern Lights or Aurora Borealis.

The condition was clear for a change and I was noting the light pollution due to an article I recently read in Sky &amp; Telescope.Just as I was gazing near Castor and Pollux a pair of red lights set evenly apart was moving at a very fast rate from those star locations towards the east.  There was no noise.  The width these light were apart was just about the width of a finger held at arms length away from the body.  The lights remained evenly apart the whole duration.  I could not determine any kind of shape between or around the lights or if it was one or two objects.The only aircraft that was near was a plane coming from the NNE and headed south towards Buffalo and that made a definite noise.  About 12:15 or so I went inside to consult the NASA http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/tracking/ website to verify where the ISS was located, which was New Zealand at the time.The only thing I can conclude it was too fast to be a normal passenger aircraft and not quite a communication, ISS or other satellite and I have witnessed the ISS before.", "A blue, oval shaped craft with glowing panels through the center flying in odd patterns and hovering around the area.It was 1975 in Bourbonnais/Bradley IL.

This was broad daylight.Soon, a crowd formed and the police were called. They responded and just stood and watched  like everyone else. The ship would hover, fly quickly  towards us and then  turn and fly off in another direction just to stop and hover once more in a different position than when it started. At one point, an officer grew alarmed and ducked down behind his squad car door with his weapon drawn because the craft had turned in our direction and came closer than before.I had lived at the opposite end of the complex from where the crowd was gathered and walked back to our apartment to get a drink of water.  As I was returning , the ship flew over the area where I was walking and I got a close look at it.  It stunned me when it came down lower because it was so big that it looked as though it might crash into the nearest building.  It hovered a minute and then went back to the general area that we saw it in originally.After about 40 minutes or so it turned and flew off as quickly as it appeared.

Suddenly I noticed something moving in the middle of where I was looking. It was not obvious at all as it was not emitting any light at all. The only way I was able to see it was due to the fact that the moon was pretty bright that night and the shadow underneath this object provided just enough contrast to see it. It was travelling east to west and held a steady speed comparable to a helicopter. It looked either relatively close (like a helicopter) or very huge. Really, it seemed both big and close. It is hard to tell with no light coming from it though. Either way it would have been close enough to hear if it was a helicopter or airplane or anything with an engine. The shape was large and seemed round. It was absolutely silent and gave me a very creepy feeling. It was dare I say it...camoflauged against the night&apos;s sky. I looked away a few times to make sure it wasn&apos;t a spot on my eye or something in my head and found it everytime I came back to it. I called my friend over after I could make some words out.

They were protecting from sub attacks.((initials deleted--witness)) does not remember the aircraft carrier name.The aircraft carrier also reported three bogies on their independent on-board radar.Albany&rsquo;s radars were set on sector scan to focus on bogies.The jets reported over the radio that they had radar contact with bogies.Jets never got closer than 20 miles (thus no visual?).Jets move about 1/4 inch per radar sweep at 1350 knots.  The bogies began to move away in approximately 3/4 inch jumps per sweep.  Bogies maintained triangular formation.  Bogies disappeared from radar within 7 sweeps. Jets were still visible on radar.Officer of the watch was present talking the Albany&rsquo;s air traffic controllers.Jets still in flight broke off pursuit and turned back to the air craft carrier.Radar went back to full 360 scan.  Radar operators were to keep a lookout for similar aircraft/bogies.The two air controllers (lieutenant two bars) smiled at each other and one turned to BR and said, &quot;this incident never happened.&quot;((initials deleted--witness)) suspects the air controllers were acting under an order not to discuss the incident but was never personally ordered not to discuss the incident.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The underneath was like a large configuration of computer chips with no empty space except for the lights, the bottom was covered by a screening.  I could see these things in the sky because the oval lights would make you thin they were twinkling stars at a distance.

I like to watch the birds, and have bird feeders in a tree outside this room.  The sun was coming up and was very bright that morning.I noticed 3 very bright lights in the woods across the road from our house.  The lights were very unusual.  They  formed a side ways, &frac12; circle shape.  No unusual noise was heard.  The lights did not move or change colors.  Most of the trees across from our house are probably 20 to 40 foot tall.  These lights were probably &frac12; way up the trees, in the dense woods.  We have lived on this property for about 13 years, and I know there are no houses or anything in that direction.My husband had gotten up and was getting ready for work.  I called him to the window and asked him if he could see those lights. I asked him if it could be the sun reflecting off something, and what he thought they were.  He replied it was something in the woods, but he didn&rsquo;t have a clue what it could be.I grabbed my digital camera and tried to take a picture, but could not get a good shot from where I was.  He told me to give him the camera.  He went outside and climbed up on a ledge beside the porch and took 2 pictures, then the camera went dead.

I guess about 20 minutes. had passed, by the time I finished cleaning off the table and washing dishes.  I went back to the window and looked, but the lights were gone.  So I went about my day. Later that night I decided to download the pictures to see it they even turned out.  What a SHOCK!!  2 pictures turned out, but in order to see what looks like a space craft, you have to enlarge the picture.  I am having the picture blown up to a 8x10, to see if it will pick it up even better.

On my way home from work I was driving on the 215 Freeway.  In the evening sky there was a huge lentricular cloud formation that looked an awful lot like a ship under cloud cover.  To the right and left of the huge middle cloud were three smaller perfectly saucer shaped clouds on each side spaced at an angle so that it looked as if they were in a V formation.  My passenger in the car was a committed non-believer.  Even he had to do a double take when I brought them to his attention.

We first saw a stationary orange rectangle on a ridge line about a quarter mile away.  As we drove along the base of the ridge about 20 seconds later we noticed an orange reflection in the windshield, and at that point I rolled down the window and stuck my head out the door to look straight up.  What  I saw at that point was a pair of rectangular orange panels moving in sync directly above our vehicle, just above the treetops, mirroring our path along the winding road.  This conitnued for about two miles.  The objects made no noise, and there was no wash of air hitting us from above.  I believe the panels were part of one object, located at the rear of it.  I kept my eyes fixed on it the entire time and when we came to a stop sign I jumped out of the vehicle and it shot straight away from us, slightly gaining altitude, but made no noise.  It did not disappear over a horizon line, but disappeared from view in the distance in less than two seconds.

We apparently live in a flight path as we often have jets from Davis Monthan AFB flying over and often helicopters at a lower level. As we were talking, I noticed what my mind assumed were jets practicing for an upcoming air show in the sky behind my friend. I had this initial thought because the maneuvers of the 3 &quot;jets&quot; seemed very much like what we see when the pilots practice. As I was talking my eyes kept going back until I had to interrupt the conversation. I suddenly realized they were not only very oddly shaped, (oblong and black) but they were very close and there was zero sound. We got up and went to the edge of the yard as they were coming closer. My friend said they look like sky divers as they were apparently connecting then releasing in a triangular and straight pattern. It looked as if 2 would connect and let go then all three would do the same. This went on for a few more minutes and we both commented on things like weather balloons of some sort or perhaps some kind of weather anomaly. We were both trying to figure out the explanation. They began flashing what would be best described as, a silver light. Not in a specific pattern (not that we recognized) but random and they would stay lit when they connected into the straight pattern. It became more and more obvious that we had no idea what we were looking at. When they connected and lit, it seemed as if they &quot;melted&quot; into a single craft. Then a jet passed over the area above them. This reinforced the lack of sound as we could hear this jet quite well and it was farther than the unidentified crafts. They then began to rise into the sky as we watched the display of aerodynamics and the light show. My friend called her daughter in-law who was in the neighborhood. She told her to go outside and my friend tried to help her locate them over the phone. I ran in the house and took a 12&quot; x 12 mirror off the wall. We h! ad alrea dy decided that a photo at this point would be useless. When they were at their closest, we were still trying to rationalize and now they would just be too far away.  I went back out and tried reflecting light towards the ground at first to see if I could get the same reflection off the mirror in proportion to where I was situated on the ground. (They were NNW of my home when we first spotted them) After realizing I could not reflect in this direction I began trying to flash the mirror, in theirs. Perhaps I was looking for some kind of a response. My friend went to meet the daughter in-law as she was terribly excited and wanted my friend to point out what we were seeing. She was not able to find them again to show her daughter in-law, after she left my house. I watched them a total of about 30 to 40min more until they had gone so high, they were just a periodic spec of light, and then they were gone. I am no aviation expert but I have never, ever seen a plane or any other piloted craft go so high up. I keep trying to make sense of what we saw. If I had been alone, I would not have told anyone what I had seen and I would have been sure to stay out of the sun for the remainder of the day. I am considered by others and myself to be a skeptical person, so I welcome any logic that could explain all of this.", "Just found your sight and saw listed a sighting from Arkansas (4/17/97 22:45 Bismarck/Caddo Valley (between) AR Light 30 seconds Orange burst of light that sped out over the lake).

We were making our approach to Atlanta Airport, but still about 75 miles out.  I saw a bright dot outside the window that I took for Venus because it was sort of scintillating.  Despite the fact there was complete cloud cover that night, I still thought it was Venus somehow breaking through.  It was too bright to be another aircraft, unless it was pointing a landing light right at us.  But it couldn&apos;t be Venus, because we were moving in relation to it.  I watched for 15 minutes, on and off again, as we &quot;passed&quot; it.  It must have been as far as 50 miles away, so it took time, but it wasn&apos;t fixed like Venus would have been.  And, it didn&apos;t move at all, like another aircraft would have. 20 minutes in, we were coming in for a landing and I could still make it in the distance.  Even at that distance it was brighter than all the other incoming planes.  It was mostly a bright white dot, but I could make out shades of red and yellow that occasionally shifted.  Waaaaaaay too high up to be a radio tower of any sort.  I had a camera, but thought &quot;what&apos;s the point?&quot;  It would just be a dot.

I am not positive at what point I first noticed the light, but I saw an extremely bright, low light in the sky. At first my mind processed it as a star, but it was huge, low (seemed just above the treetops) &amp; too bright for a star.  The light hovered; there was a smaller less bright light above &amp; to the right of it.  I realized these were not stars and kept looking. I slowed down. There were other vehicles on the road, but only a few, I was surprised they did not slow down to look.   The incident was fleeting.  Basically, there was this huge bright light (and a lesser ,but too large for a star light above it) , it seemed like hole was punched in the sky.  Within it (both) there appeared a string of blue lights like the outline of a circular shape, but only the blue lights were visible.  These lights did not move at first, the entire scene hovered.  Then, suddenly, quickly, the blue lights in the large light spun diagonally and dropped vertically, then &quot;sucked&quot; into the light and the entire image closed.

Traveling cross country from Houston TX, to San Diego, CA, I slept in El Paso Texas, then headed west on Route 10.   About 25 or 30 miles into Arizona, I stopped to stretch my legs in the desert.  The weather was exceptionally clear, stars were almost on the horizon and there was a full moon.  One maybe two cars passed in the roughly 15 minutes I was there. Looking South to Southeast, I saw an array of lights just over my right shoulder, close to Zenith, slightly to the West. I listened for a sound but there was none. I first thought it might be a helicopter. Its overall shape was indeterminate except for the elliptical/oval array of lights which were sharp and distinct. There were two (2) colors of lights, evenly spaced, alternating blush red, and a sort of mercury blue. For a minute or so it was motionless, perfectly stable as I tried to make out an overall shape, determine what it was and it&rsquo;s altitude. Not knowing its altitude or size I couldn&rsquo;t estimate either. I guessed that the elliptical shape of lights could be circular depending on its aspect or tilt. It then moved purposefully but slightly to the North, then back just a little toward the South, and stopped. From a full stop it then instantly accelerated over the Eastern horizon in what I estimated to be about 4-5 Seconds. Its path was perfectly straight without any random motion or bobbling. I stood and waited for about a minute believing I&rsquo;d hear a sonic boom but there was no sound, sonic boom or otherwise. A diffuse blue contrail was left in its flight path, perfectly illuminated by the moon. This gradually turned to very thin white puffs and disappeared. No other aircraft were in the area. I thought about what I&rsquo;d seen.  Thinking the Eastern mountain ranges were maybe 5K to 8K feet in altitude, it seemed to clear them by about 5K feet (estimate) so I assumed the craft was maybe at 12K-15K feet altitude. My confusion was how a craft or a missile could go from a full stop to 3 or 4 miles per second without any sound. I&rsquo;m not exactly an untrained observer.  For 10 years I worked on the development and launch of more than 20 rocket-borne and reconnaissance aircraft systems.

But when I went to look again ten minutes later it was gone, poof. Not sure of what I saw but it was incredibly bright. From visual comparison to plane I would estimate object was nearly orbital and about the size of a pea at arms length. Just a sidenote.

Crafts profile was thin, dark in color, 25-30 ft long 3-4 ft high, conical in shape. On the topside, an elliptical shape object, white light emitting at about 1 second intervals.  Light not extremely bright, the object being opaque between flashing, all three craft emitting at the same frequency.

I ran to the window looking into the sky expecting to see a plane on fire. The blast was very loud and a plane explosion is the first thing that came to mind. When I scanned the sky line I noticed a bright oval glowing light in the sky. I then stepped back to open the window to get a better look and when I looked back in the area the light was gone. I then turned on my police scanner and the dispatch was getting numerous 911 calls (around 30 from what I heard) from people in the area. All reporting a bright blue flash that came with the blasts. From the calls it seems to be that the callers ranged about a 1/2 mile in distance. The Police scanned the area for 2 hours. And also contacted the Power Companies to see if any transformers had blown. All seemed to be ok, and the Police could not pin point the area of the blast. Lights did not flicker at all so I ruled out a transformer blast early on. The 2 blasts sounded like a sonic boom, but the blue flash does not match up to a boom of that nature.

First I thought they were some birds but I quickly realised they were something else.  From my flat they looked horizontal but not much else I can tell.  The third one was different because there was some kind of orange in it but it&apos;s diificult to say.  All I know is that it was cloudy and windy and that the object was there in the sky. It was stationary.  It was no plane, helicopter or birds.  No light or sound.

I was the only witness to this event that I know of (no one I know made any mention of it, anyway), though anyone could have seen it, provided they had the right view. At about 12:11 AM on New Year&apos;s Day, 1-January-2007, I witnessed a single, strangely bright, white light in the sky north of Cedar Falls, Iowa.  At first, I thought it was either an airplane or an unusually bright star.  I realized it wasn&apos;t an airplane when I noticed that not only were there none of the telltale noises of an airplane, but there were none of the characteristic blinking lights either. My suspicions of it being a star were disproved when it slowly began growing in size and moving slightly upward, as if whatever it was moved closer to my location.  It stopped where it was after about 20 seconds, and at this point it was about the size of a pencil eraser when held at arm&apos;s length.  It hovered in the same position for about 40 seconds.  It then moved slowly to the east for about 5 seconds, before moving first up, then down, all slowly.  It returned to its original height, then moved back west to its original position.  It stopped again, then moved west and began the same process once more: up, down, middle. It returned to its first stopping position once again, and repeated the same ordeal, moving up, then down, then middle.  It then began moving slowly to the east once more, and when it stopped in the same position it had before, I thought it was about to repeat the whole thing over again.  But after sitting still for about 15 seconds, it began moving fairly quickly to the southwest, which, from where I was standing, almost seemed like it was just circling around the east side of the city and heading south.

I thought it looked like an airplane at first but then the lights changed colors and started moving back and forth and moving like no airplane we had ever seen all while changing colors every 20 seconds or so.We kept watching the lights until we lost them behind some trees on the side of the road. Every once in a while we would catch site of them as the trees cleared and they seemed to be getting closer each time we spotted the object.  Eventually we came to a stop sign and again had a clear view of the object.  It appeared to be at least a mile away and stationary.After watching the lights for about 15 seconds they started coming towards us at a very rapid speed.  I was starting to get scared so I told my brother to drive.  He made a left turn and I stuck my head out the window to get a better look at the lights and see where they were.  This may have been the scariest moment of my life.  The lights were directly above and behind us maybe 50 feet.  I was too scared to sit there and stare at it so I put my head back in the window.  Meanwhile my brother asked where the lights were and I yelled that they were &quot;right here&quot; and told him to drive.As my brother was driving (still accelerating to the speed limit) a green white light shone on our vehicle.  My brother yelled out a curse word which I thought was funny for some reason.  After 2 or 3 seconds the light went out and the object was gone.

UNKNOWN FREAKY ORB DREW EYES, IMAGINATIONS ACROSS AREA   Earthlings, you&apos;ve had an otherworldly experience, a cosmic encounter. About 8 p.m. Wednesday, something peculiar flashed in the sky - something twinkly, something colorful, something eye-catching.Something strange. And blue. Or green. Or blue-green. &quot;Bright blue-green ball with a white tail,&quot; says one man from Shelby, who spotted it just west of Blacksburg, S.C., after dinner at a Steak House. &quot;A greenish-like light low in the sky,&quot; says a woman, driving home from church with her kids near Matthews. &quot;We thought a small plane or helicopter was going to crash.&quot;  &quot;A slow-moving bluish glow,&quot; says a man from Polkton and who watched it while soaking in his hot tub. &quot;Large, bright green ball,&quot; says another man, who was headed to Chick-fil-A in Gastonia with his wife and four children after church. &quot;Had a haze about it.&quot;  &quot;Almost looked like a flare,&quot; reports a lady, who was on Interstate 485. &quot;Kind of creepy.&quot;  Venus, perhaps? It&apos;s often a suspect in UFO sightings, particularly when it&apos;s as bright as it is right now. Not Venus. It vanished beneath the horizon about 7 p.m. Stricken plane?  Nope. All aircraft accounted for. Space junk? Errant satellite?  Negative, says NORAD. No re-entries of the sizable man-made objects they track. OK. So ... alien object?  Bingo. But not the E.T. variety. &quot;A fireball,&quot; says the observatory director and astronomy professor at Appalachian State University in Boone. Based on the reports, the director believes it was an unusually bright meteor that burned up about 30 miles high in the atmosphere somewhere above Charlotte. Sightings came from more than 100 miles away. Many witnesses say the light appeared to fizzle at the end and break into pieces, making it a special kind of fireball called a bolide. In the universe of meteors, they&apos;re A-List entertainers, known for their splashy finales. Each day, an estimated 4 billion meteors burn up in Earth&apos;s atmosphere. Most are the size of sand grains, but rocks tumble in, too. NASA estimates that the Earth packs on several tons a day in meteors. Some witnesses who contacted the Observer on Thursday wondered whether it could be debris from the recent anti-satellite test by China. Probably not - but maybe, says a spokesman for the North American Aerospace Defense Command near Colorado Springs, Colo., which tracks satellites and space junk - everything from lost screwdrivers to astronaut gloves. He says he&apos;s been getting an unusually high number of calls this week about things spotted in the sky. China&apos;s satellite-zapping exercise has probably increased space litter by about a million pieces, making it nearly as untidy as Interstate 77 in Charlotte. &quot;It&apos;s anybody&apos;s guess,&quot; the spokesman says, &quot;what direction this stuff has gone.&quot;", "Red light stayed in sky for over 1 hourThis in in reference to the Washington sighting on 5 march 07.

This night I was not alone my sister her boyfriend and their friend, they had all seen this to but they don&rsquo;t remember or care as much as me. I started to talk about these lights I&apos;d seen, and they were actually interested. This conversation continued and I remember saying &quot;I think its just a matter of looking up at the nights sky once in a while&quot; and I was looking.About an hour had passed the conversation had changed. I had this feeling or intuition to look and I looked straight at the same three lights. I stood up and yelled &quot; that&rsquo;s them&quot; and sure enough I wasn&rsquo;t crazy because they all seen them. We watch the 3 lights move together in a triangle. I said &quot;lets see if they cross over a star&quot; I wonted see if it blacked out the star when the triangle covered it. We followed them to not see them do so when I said &quot; I hope they do something different&quot;. And sure enough the did before I could finish saying it. I remember the front light shut off(disappeared) then a second and the third in a 123 type of rhythm. I was like Woh that&rsquo;s different, but they were gone. My friend spotted them again as they reappeared where they started. to do the same triangle thing traveling in the same direction at the same speed. But they didn&rsquo;t move as far because the triangle stopped moving forward and then in a manor where it flipped and turned and didn&rsquo;t look like a triangle anymore. we could  tell that this wasn&rsquo;t a solid vehicle but three individual  lights. This all was happening very fast and continued to do so. the three lights moved closer to each other to only to go into a chase that was all mathematically perfect. they chased each other in a perfect circle so fast and so tight to form a perfect bright white ring. then they split into three directions in perfect angles from each other and then disappeared after a very short distance, to not be seen again. we all went nuts and climbed on to the roof of our trailer house. we were all being very loud and hopeful we&apos;d see them again. but we didn&rsquo;t and I haven&rsquo;t again yet. I remember my mom getting pissed about all the noise.I am certain this wasn&rsquo;t a manned vehicle maybe controlled remotely (robotically).  But again the vibes I got makes me certain that it was not man made. I felt like it was trying to communicate but I really don&rsquo;t know. I just know I&rsquo;m a believer.I&rsquo;m not lying. I never do.

I noticed a row of lights in the sky and pointed them out to my husband.  There were 5-8 lights in a straight line almost directly overhead.  For a split second I thought they were some planetary alignment, but quickly realized that they were too bright and too perfectly aligned for that to be the explanation.  The sky was perfectly clear and it was still too light for any stars or planets to be visible.  We watched the lights for a brief period of time and discussed what we were seeing.  We weren&rsquo;t sure if it was one object with lights on it or a well-aligned formation of separate objects.  Suddenly the lights started to dim and move closer together as if they were moving outward.  This movement was so rapid that it was similar to the effect in Star Trek of &quot;going into warp speed.&quot;  At the time, we made a call to a local T.V. station to ask if anyone else had seen it.  The next night, there was a brief report on the weather portion of the news that a number of people had reported strange lights of unknown origin.  The weather reporter said that the lights were multiple planes lined up in a flight path for landing.  My husband and I were very certain that this was not a reasonable explanation for what we had seen. We recently saw a news report where the former governor of Arizona disclosed his sighting of the Phoenix lights around March, 1997 (just a few weeks before our sighting).

It would move slightly, but was practically still.  We heard no sounds, although, if there were any, they likely would have been drowned out by the music.   We stared and did not speak, watching the object move forward slightly through the clouds.  Then the object disappeared, analogous to someone turning off a light.   After it disappeared, my friend and I looked at each other and confirmed what we had both seen.  Two other couples sitting on benches to our left had the same gaping mouth expression as we did, and asked if we had seen the light as well.  While we were recent high school graduates, the two other couples were in their mid- to late-60s.

He came out to his garage and we both noticed an unusual set of fairly-bright lights back toward the southwest.  I got back out of my car, not looking away from the set of lights, and asked him if he was seeing those lights as well.   He commented out loud that he&rsquo;s never seen anything like that before.  (He and I work for the same company, where he&rsquo;s been a technical engineer for 25+ years.)  The two set of lights were approximately the size of peas, at arm&rsquo;s length.  The lower set of lights seemed to have blinking/nav-lights on the outer edges.  Basically, both sets initially appeared the same; three lights across a plane with the middle being brighter and the outer two blinking at times.Both sets of lights hung motionless for approximately 3-5 minutes.  The lower set started to dim then slowly dropped downward and arced off toward the east.  We lost sight of it when it dropped below the ridgeline.The remaining (slightly higher) set of three lights, still hung motionless for another few minutes.   After simply hanging there for a few minutes, the middle light started growing in intensity.   So much so, that my buddy and I were still talking out loud about it (not taking our eyes off of it) asking each other if we were seeing them same things.My six year old daughter came outside and saw them too.  She freaked out, hearing us talking about them in wonderment, and ran back inside.  (We had a good chuckle about that.)  The middle light grew so bright, that the three lights appeared to merge into a single light.  That&rsquo;s the best I can describe how much it grew in intensity.After about a minute or two of that brilliance, it appeared to also start descending and arcing off toward the east.The point at which both of these sets of lights dropped and started arcing off toward the east, it really reminded me of the way a normal aircraft would have localized and turned toward the traffic pattern to land.   However, neither of us has ever seen anything quite like this before.  (I have been an aviation enthusiast for 25+ years and consider myself very knowledgeable of the subject matter.)  I watched the local news reports, hoping to see/hear any references to this event as I&rsquo;m sure this happened near, or just to the north of, Nashville proper.

Planes crossing the Atlantic, arriving at Lisbon&apos;s International Airport usually do their approach exactly over the area where I live so I&apos;m very used to watching them and I recognize their navigation lights.I can say for certain that it wasn&apos;t a (conventional) plane because the light was completely different, it was much lower than a plane, and it crossed the sky alot quicker than a plane, as it completely disappeared from my sight in about 1-2 minutes.At the time of the sighting there wes a civilian plane on the sky, so besides the obvious differences I also had real time comparison with an actual plane.I called the Portuguese Air Force 30 minutes after the sighting and told them what I had seen, and they were very helpful and asked me the (I assume) usual questions: estimated altitude of the object, duration of the sighting, etc. and told me they would get back to me.They did, 10 minutes after that, and the person told me he had contacted civilian and military airtraffic controllers and they didn&apos;t saw anything on radar.I&apos;m sorry I didn&apos;t took any pictures or recorded the sighting, but even if I had a camera with me, I don&apos;t think I would have anyway, since it didn&apos;t even crossed my mind long after the sighting was done. I was just mind blown looking at it.", "Orange lights appearing and disappearing, again in Southeastern Missouri.I have looked at alot of Missouri sightings in your files on these orange lights, and wonder what they are. Almost all of the sightings are fairly close to where we were on March 3 2007. Well, here&apos;s what happened.Me (38) and my wife (38) went to Lake Hanna about 4 miles North of Ironton Missouri. This place is in St. Francois and Iron Counties. We went back to the far lake (Iron County) to see if we could see the lunar eclipse. But it was to cloudy and a little to late.We preceded to look to the south-southwest towards Pilot Knob Mountain and Taum Sauk Mt. (highest elevation in state). The clouds started to clear and we could see a bright star (possibly Venus) and the moon peaking out from behind the clouds. It is very dark out and we were amazed by how much light the moon emitted.Then, around 19:39 we noticed a orange-amber colored light appear in the sky in the same direction (S-SW} between the mountains, then another, and then another. The lights appeared to split in two and then disappear in same order they appeared. Me and my wife looked at each other and said what in the world did we just see? It almost seemed like they came out from over a cloud cover.The sky had cleared pretty much and we were watching the sky in hope of seeing something else. It had been about ten minutes, 19:49 on the van clock. Then it started again a bit different. The lights were bigger this time and appeared to be spinning with other lights shooting out of them. One looked like it shot toward the ground. Another light looked like it split and was making a banked turn on an angle. These lights looked like the size of streetlights (dime size).  We saw 4 of these lights appear and then disappear in same order.  Lasting I would say around 10 to 15 seconds each.It had been completely silent to this point when we started to hear fighter jets. We could not see them. The reason I know they were fighters is because I live a couple of miles from Scott AFB.  Every kind of plane imaginable has flown over our house at all hours of the day.  We go to the lake every weekend if possible.We got out of the mini-van to see if we could see the planes.  To this point we were watching out of the windows.  I called a friend down at the lake to tell him to come out here and what we saw.  Just as I got off the cel phone, it started again.This time the lights were even bigger (quarter size). Five lights appeared in the sky one by one till all five were lit. Then disappearing in same order. With the lights being bigger you could see more detail, it looked to me like the orange-amber lights had little white lights spinning around them in the middle. I looked at the clock and it was 19:57.We continued to watch the sky and saw four jets heading east in a single file line. That seemed strange that they were not flying in formation. Then we saw two more heading north and then two more way up there heading northeast. Eight jets we saw in total. Another strange thing was that the jets didn&apos;t have any flashing lights just solid red ones.We watched the sky for about another half-hour and didn&apos;t see anymore lights. It almost seemed like the jets scared them off. I know that they say the full moon and lunar eclipes have strange effects on things. I don&apos;t know if it had anything to do with that but on the way back to the cabin we saw three deer walk right down the side of the road by our van it seemed like they had no fear. We looked at them and them at us almost to say &quot;Did you see that too?&quot; We have gone back the last three weekends to the same exact place hoping to see the lights again. We haven&apos;t seen a thing.My wife and I have two children, married 16 years and never saw or believed in any kind of et stuff, but this really makes a person wonder. Me and my wife are both educated and working.My wife told a Air Force Colonel what we saw and he said it was probably the Air Force flying manuevers. I don&apos;t know exactly what we saw and probably will never see anything like it again. I hope someone there can tell me what we saw.My wife was able to get one picture on her cel phone and I will send it to you as soon as I can figure out how to get it on my computer or a picture of it.", "4 sliver round objects moving East to West at High Altitude4 silver circular objects moving in loose and random formation.

I was hanging out in the driveway at my best friend&rsquo;s house on N. Greenfield Ave. in Waukesha, WI between E. Broadway and Ellis St.  I had parked &quot;my&quot; 1980 Chevy Malibu on the curb in front of his house. As my best friend and I  (and possibly one or two of his other brothers, I don&rsquo;t remember) were standing in the driveway a new black Lincoln Town Car with tinted windows pulled up behind my car, blocking the driveway.  As soon as it stopped three men (possibly four, I can&rsquo;t remember) including the driver; got out of the car, walked up to the sidewalk and faced us.  They all were all wearing black suits and dark tinted sunglasses; all of them normal build and physically fit. The strangest part of the incident that I recall is that the one man immediately addressed me, as if he knew the Malibu was my car.  &quot;I will give you $2000 cash for your car.&quot;  He was as far as I can remember totally expressionless, as were the others.  As far as I was reading into the interaction, he would hand me cash and drive the car away immediately.  Apparently a title was not an issue.  Still kind of dazed by the weirdness of it all, the only thing that I managed to reply was, &quot;It&rsquo;s not mine to sell, its my dad&rsquo;s,&quot; which was true. That was it, they made no more attempts at trying to deal.  They turned around without a word and drove north on N. Greenfield.  They didn&rsquo;t stop at any other houses as far as we could see. At the time I knew nothing of men in black stories nor did my friend.  We both stood there awestruck and after rehashing the event came to the conclusion that two grand wasn&rsquo;t worth being implicated in a felony acted out by clean cut secret service types.  Interestingly enough my dad sold the car a few weeks later, I think he got less than $500 for it. My friend may be willing to back up my claim, if he remembers.

I was on my third floor balcony having a smoke at about 10:30pm on the evening of 1/22/07.  At first I thought it was a star because it just appeared to be a weak white light in the sky.

Next, the light began to shine brilliantly, pulsing between red, blue, green, purple and white while flying again in a perfect horizontal line - only now it had dropped below the tree line.  But because it was winter and many of the trees had lost their leaves, it was still fairly easy to track.  The light would extinguish sometimes and then reappear in seconds a mile or so away - and at different heights.  And after watching it for about 7 minutes, it finally disappeared.

It was about the same magnitude of an ordinary star, and sometimes you&rsquo;ll see a satellite in the morning or at night when the sun from over the horizon hits them just right.  For reference it was moving slightly faster than the satellites I&rsquo;ve seen in the past. That would mean it was either moving faster than a satellite, or at a similar speed, but lower altitude.  It was moving on an almost perfect easterly heading, if anything a little east to northeast. It did not appear to maneuver or change directions. As I watched it arc across the sky all of a sudden it was surrounded by a brilliant flash.  That&rsquo;s when I knew it wasn&rsquo;t an ordinary satellite I was seeing it was something else.  The flash was not like a strobe light of an airplane, but more like a cloud of plasma that enveloped the light.  Relative to the size of the light I saw moving, the flash appeared to be about 10 times its size.  Then it flashed again about every 5 to 7 seconds.  I watched it until it was out of sight, but then I saw another flash even though I couldn&rsquo;t see the light itself.  Whatever it was, it just kept on going. While technically a UFO, I&rsquo;m beginning to think I might have seen a high altitude spy aircraft, or black aircraft.  The flash could have been a pulse detonation type of propulsion system, or atmospheric skip vehicle.  If it was emitting a pulse, or skipping the atmosphere at the altitude I think it was, its exhaust, or the interaction with the atmosphere might have created the flash / plasma effect I was seeing.  The color of the light / vehicle, and the flash were identical, both appearing a brilliant white, similar to a white LED light in color temperature.  There were no other colors or lights that one might normally associate with an aircraft.  Other than the light / flash I could not distinguish the planform of an aircraft or any structure. Again, it was dark, moving fairly fast and at high altitude. Here comes the strange part.  As I watched the light arc across the sky, all of a sudden I see a shooting star or something cross its path immediately behind it.  Whatever that was, it was a very very quick streak of light, but in an amber color.  The streak was moving on a line I would estimate to be north to northwest in direction. So I&rsquo;m thinking did something just shoot at this thing? Or was this a total coincidence.  Very odd, hopefully someone else saw this too.

Further, I had inadvertently photographed an object that looks identical last August in this same location. These objects are so close in color and brightness to the background sky that they would go unnoticed. I noticed them because I used the Clarify option on PaintShop Pro which increases the contrast on low contrast large areas like sky. It&apos;s nice to bring out the features of clouds but it also makes these objects more noticeable. The object was to the north of Richmond Beach and the that I had photographed last August was to the north of Edmonds. Either the object is intentionally matching the sky color and brightness to be stealthy or it&apos;s semi-transparent or translucent.  It&apos;s not merely reflective or it would reflect the dark water underneath.

It was a shinny metalic object and from where I sat I could see the reflection of the sun on the rear end.  It had no windows,wings,stabilizer or anything sticking out. It made no sound and left no trail behind it and my best estimation of it&apos;s speed was 200 to 250 mph and an altitude of around  1000 to 1500 ft. I called my wife out to see it so we both saw the same thing.In Oct. of 2006 I was sitting on the same porch with the same kind of weather and looked east and saw a contrail of a very high flying airplne. It was so high I could not see the craft it&apos;s self so I went into the house and got the bynocuylars.  As I was looking at the plane this very same egg shaped craft flew trough my field of vision and was traveling very fast(est.3 or 4000 mph) on incline upwards. I was employed by a major airline for 27 years so I do know the difference. I have never seen this type of craft before((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

As the bar closed, we proceeded to walk home, living only a block from one another.  We decided to cut through a park down the street from our homes, and being a very beautiful, warm evening, lied on the grass and BSed for a few minutes.  We were staring up at the night sky, which was completely cloud free, when, at an incredible speed, 3 bright objects in triangle formation flew over head without making a sound.  We were stunned.  We began discussing the possibilities of what it could have been.  I also recall that, do to the speed it was going, we estimated that if it wanted it could travel around the world in about half an hour.  Then, about 20 to 30 minutes later, the object returned, not from the horizon it was traveling towards, but from the horizon it came from the first time.  This time there were two more object in the same triangle formation, making up 5, and behind the object was another single object that seemed to be tailing it, at the same speed, with a visibly bright orange object pulsating around it.  The following month me and a lot of friends were at a barbeque.  The sky was clear, and it was dusk, the sun had not yet set and there were no stars visible.  Traveling in an East/West direction a friend and I (different friend this time) witnessed a bright orange object shoot across the sky at incredible speed.  About 30 seconds to a minute later it was followed by, again, 3 bright, star like objects in triangle formation.  I live 10 miles from a small airport and am very familiar with the look, speed and behavior of private and commercial planes, and have even flown a plane on one occasion with a pilot I knew.  These objects were not planes, not weather balloons, and certainly not the reflection of light off the stomachs of ducks, which have all been given to us as possible explanations.  They say seeing is believing.I&apos;m a believer!", "An object with two lights flying across the western sky -- didn&apos;t seem like airplane.I was standing on a second floor balcony with two students talking about physics and philosophy at around 9PM, when one of the students pointed out a couple of lights passing by in the sky. I looked at the object, which had two lights, one following the other, I don&rsquo;t remember the color of the lights, but I remember the motion of the lights going across the sky. We also observed a bunch of planes in the sky, but these had the distinctive tell sign of blinking red lights. The object we saw didn&rsquo;t have blinking lights and from what we could tell didn&rsquo;t make any noise--as it seemed to be relatively close to the horizon. We were looking west. We stood for a few minutes wondering what we had seen, because it was so unusually--the speed and the lights.", "Strrange Fireball over Goodyear ArizonaWe witnessed a large strange fireball circling in the northern sky of Goodyear,  Arizona, at eight in the evening.  A total of five people witnessed this strange fireball which also had a long tail.  The fireball circled the northern sky about two times.  My family and I thought that the strange fireball was possibly an airliner that was on fire.  The fireball then disappeared into the northern sky heading east.  The fireball could be seen for about five minutes.", "Circular Object with many lights.I was sitting outside on my back porch talking on the phone to my grandmother. I was watching the planes go over head and since I since I live near an airport there are at least 7 planes flying in the sky at night. I looked over the trees and saw a very strange cluster of bright lights moving very slowly. I told my grandmother that I think I see a UFO. The lights were flashing all the way around the center of the craft as it slowly headed over the trees. My grandmother kept insisting that is was a plane but it was too close to the trees to be a plane and it would&rsquo;ve made some kind of noise. You can hear the planes when they are only tiny dots in the sky. The UFO made no sound whatsoever and it was moving way too slow to be plane.", "Green light over ChicagoBright green light brighter than jetliner hovering over Lake Michigan on the North/East side of Chicago.  Hovered for 5 seconds then quickly descended in an arch formation and then disappeared.", "Fast moving blue object over Alaska sky. No trail. It then vanished.I was standing on my front stoop, which faces South.  Something to the West, low in the sky caught my sight. It was moving too fast to be a human made craft.  It was a bright blue color, moving North West, at least it appeared to be moving in that direction.  It left no trail, which was odd.  It then vanished.  My first thought is that it was a hot, vaporizing meteor. I have never seen one bright blue.

I went out in the backyard around 10:30 PM to take the dogs out, a normal routine prior to going to bed.  I usually have a great view of the sky and love to star gaze. Blinking lights on the NW horizon amongst the trees caught my attention.  At first I thought it was bright stars in the distance.  But I noticed they would disappear while I stood in one place and reappear in another.  As I moved to find them they would appear and disappear. I tired of this event and began looking straight up at the brilliant stars hoping for a shooting star when a series of flashing lights appeared in the western sky.  At first glance it looked like a plane but as it got closer overhead I began to watch and follow its unusual movements and shape.  The object was moving from west to east at a speed that was faster than an airplane, its shape was unrecognizable even though there was a full moon.  The object moved in an erratic nearly snakelike formation.  Many lights could be seen flashing across its middle girth in a very random, flickering red and white pattern.  I couldn&rsquo;t judge its distance from earth nor its size but I believe it was larger than a plane. Once the object disappeared in to the eastern horizon, I heard the tremendous trailing noise of a jet-liner back to the east where the object first appeared.  I noticed a flash of dull white light, similar to a lightning flash, illuminating a cloud in the sky, as the rumbling of the aircraft tried to catch up to the object. Could it have been traveling faster than light?  I watched the object for 20-30 seconds and the noise lasted nearly as long.", "Jutting lightAn object was spotted high in the sky shortly after darkness on Hwy 21. The object appeared to be a distant light. When viewed through the video camera, it &quot;jutted&quot; in a box-shaped pattern, occasionally shifting out of the pattern.

I didnt notice this blurry &quot;thing&quot; on the picture only when i started looking pictures in fullsize on computer in January 2007. There is the possibility that this undentified flying object might be dust on the lens or some &quot;mistake&quot; the camera made, altough it is not seen on the next picture made few minutes later. I am also 100 % sure that the dot on the picture cant be plane nor a fight plane, altough there were fighter planes flying by at the same day, but the noise they made cant be unnoticed. Pictures was taken in the mountains, therefore it is also impossible for that thing to be a plane. I didnt see the thing myself, but noticed it half a year later. It was supposed to be a landscape photo. Camera used was olympus FE-140. Hope it helps", "quiet, close, super-sonic, white, round white lightI was up late trading foreign currency on my computer, when i saw a light moving very fast across the western sky.  It was moving south at an incredible speed...much faster and quieter (complety quiet actually) than than the L-39 and F-16 jets i have encountered  during my life.  I am a licenced skydiver and canopy pilot with 603 jumps and have &quot;logged&quot; over a year of residental (night and day) time at airports.  I have been witness to close encounters with all sorts of conventional aircraft, and this event does not fit the bill...AT ALL! I also love to (try so far) photograph shooting stars, and have witnessed many.  Some during the day, but most at night. They always have some sort of trail of either smoke or still burning fragments.  Also, when they are traveling in the lower atmosphere, they actually burn a more red color instead of the white plasma seen in the high atmosphere stage.  This I can say for sure...It had no tail, it was close (maybe 650 feet away at 60 degree angle to horizon), it was completly quiet.  it was traveling pefectly straight/level/south, the light looked the same coming and going, it was round, and the light (which was all I saw) had a very strange quality to it. It was very clean or pure looking, and didn&apos;t blink at all.  Like a giant l.e.d light, that had a sligly stronger output of blue spectrum.  I swear on all that is good in this world, that this is not a hoax, and that I have truthfully relayed all facts in this matter in the way that I understand them to have occured.", "Large craft 2000 feet above groundOn January 20th 1989 I and two employees left my car dealership at approximately 6:00 pm southbound on route 45 in the town of Bourbonnais Illinois. We were in a large sedan. I was driving, one person in the front pass seat and the other behind me. Making a right turn westbound on Latham drive, a newly paved 4 lane road, I was talking to my friends and glanced to my left and noticed a large &quot;something&quot; above a K Mart shopping center approximately 1000 yards across a bean field. Being a private pilot I would estimate this thing at about 1500-2000 feet altitude. I immediately rolled down my window (electronically) for I thought there could be some kind of reflection. Not so. This structure, suspended in mid air was not aerodynamic and looked as it was a large building or even a group of buildings clustered together. I immediately commented to my friends &quot;now what the is that?&quot;  Both passengers with me noticed it and as I stopped the car on the side of the road it changed shape to a vertical cigar shape and looked to us as if it was going to crash right in to our immediate area, causing one of the passengers to scream. It moved towards us at an unbelievable rate of speed. It then changed back to the shape it was in (cluster of buildings) right above us. Dusk was changing to dark. There were many (6 or 7) small ships flying around this large ship at no particular pattern. Again I can not stress how big this thing was. I am from the Chicago area and it was for sure as big probably bigger than the sears tower downtown Chicago. Above us it moved slowly to the northwest, maybe one or two mile an hour for 500 yards. While directly underneath the ship we noticed three large circular lights or burners ignite with the highest intensity bright white light I&rsquo;d ever seen. At that time the ship started to slowly become transparent meaning we could start to see through it until it had completely disappeared. Note as it disappeared it did not diminish in size.", "Morphing object seen in the day in the same location a green-strobing object which was seen at night 2 weeks before.Two weeks ago I observed a green strobing light in the sky.   There are no mountains in that direction as well as no radio towers.   Today, I observed an object in the sky in the same general area.   The object was round, and with the same strobing pattern/frequency as the object I previously saw, changed between a cigar shaped object oriented up and down, and the sphere.", "Large Triangle object in sky over North CarolinaThis night in question takes place years ago.  I don&rsquo;t even know the date, but it must have been from say early October, or until the end of march.  The reason I say this, is because my best friend and I had gone to watch NC State play basketball.  So it was definitely during basketball season.  The year was 1985, or 1986.  The only reason I&rsquo;m reporting it, is because I see others who have seen similar objects.  I&rsquo;ve (We&rsquo;ve) kept it to ourselves all these years.  Oh, we have mentioned it to a few people, but you can imagine what kind of ribbing we took.Anyway, it was after the ball game, and that would have been between 9 and 12 pm depending on what time the game was.  I really don&rsquo;t remember if it was a 7:00 game or an 9:00 game.   We were on our way back home on 50 highway from Raleigh towards Benson.  We were driving in a small pickup when we noticed a huge black object to our left.  It was really low, if I had to guess, I would say maybe 600 feet or less.  I would guess the object to be at least as long as a football field.    We pulled over and both of us opened our doors, got out, and looked up as this huge triangular object passed over us.  It was solid black, with no discernable lights except for the very tip of the triangle.  The other thing worth mentioning, is that it was slowly rotating as it moved.  Well we stood there and watched this object move from the left to directly overhead moving to the right of us.  Since we were on 50 south, that would have been East to West.  As we looked up, we were both in awe.  It made absolutely no noise whatsoever.  Completely silent.  I think that was the eeriest part of the whole thing.  How could something that huge fly the way it was flying, and make not a bit of sound.  We tried to follow it somewhat, but because it was so low to the ground, it was out of sight in less than 2 minutes. Gone behind the treeline.We&rsquo;ve often discussed it between ourselves, but not made too many waves.  We never heard anything else, and we figured something that big would have had to be seen and reported by other people.  I know what I saw, and I&rsquo;ve watched a lot of shows about our military, and never never have seen an aircraft like what I just described.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure the stealth was not out at that time, but even if it was, it did not fly in the manner with which I witnessed that night.  My main reason for posting this, was to see maybe, just maybe someone else saw the same thing my friend and I did, and about that same time frame.  It would validate my experience somewhat and verify that I was not crazy!!!!((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Then it went out for about 2-3 seconds, and when it reapeared, there was a second one with it.  Then they both went outfor 2-3 seconds and when they reapeared there were three.  Each time they reappeared they were in a different spot, almost as if they were warping to get to the next spot rather than flying. I asked my wife was she seeing this and she said yes. I asked her what could it be, neither of us had an answer.  This went on for about two miniutes, then they just vanished.  I&apos;ve never seen anything like it.

I could not tell if it was very close and small, or if it was far away and large.   If it was close, it was not dangerously close.    But it didn&rsquo;t seem that we were passing it.  It seemed to remain in my sight for a very long time.  Maybe 15-20 minutes.  I think I may have stopped looking at it at some point because I don&rsquo;t remember eventually &quot;passing&quot; it or it disappearing. At the end of the flight I asked the pilot if he saw it, and he said no.  I asked him what it could possibly be.  He said sometimes they see weather balloons.

So I know what I was looking at was very very far away, and thought that birds don&apos;t usually, that Im aware of dart aggressively towards one another.Upon focusing on the objects, I noticed one central one towards the top of the almost formation.  There may have been five or six others, I could&apos;nt count them, they were moving too quickly, almost like in training, the top one did&apos;nt do much, but the ones underneath seemed to be following orders or something. They changed from looking white, to opaque when they sped up. I even lost track of them for a few seconds even though there were no clouds in the way, maybe they were moving so fast I could&apos;nt see them.The whole time I&apos;m witnessing this, I&apos;m yelling for my boyfriend to lay next to me to see what I&apos;m seeing, he laughs at me and contiues to fly his kite.  He missed out on a once in a lifetime experience.  I was afraid to take my eyes off the area, afraid I would lose sight of them.  Finally I got my son to lay down and he got to see just as they started to disappear.  I told my boyfriend that if I saw them then someone else had to see them too.  I told him I bet the government knows their there, and I told him that I bet a jet or some type of aircraft will go to that area, and I pointed the area out to him, and maybe within a few minutes, a jet went right past that very area I pointed out.  I believe, that is the other reason my boyfriend believes me, because the jet was probably sent by the government, and he know&apos;s I would never make up a story like that, and he knows I don&apos;t lie.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I played with the gamma correction, and noticed these, &quot;balloons,&quot; were dark in the center and had a (white) structure at the top and bottom roughly in the form of a cylinder. So if I am looking east, and the sun is setting behind me in the west, why are the balloons dark in the center?  It was an overcast day, so maybe this explains it, but I don&rsquo;t see how. Maybe balloons simply look like this--I have never photographed balloons. I will now attempt to send this picture.

It was flying in a northwest direction as it flew past my house in Holland, New York.  It appeared to have a circular shape as the main lights, 4 of them, were in a circular pattern.   These were visible in dark night sky.  The lights had different colors and I think there was 1 curved line of light going between 2 of the main lights.

Local sighting near Prescott Valley, Arziona suggests mysterious orbs may be coming back!On February 5, 2007 at around 9:00 p.m. MST I was in the passenger seat of a car heading south on Highway 69 from Prescott Valley,AZ towards Dewey, AZ .  To the south (looking towards Phoenix, Arizona) I noticed three lights equally separated in a triangular shape, hovering just above a local mountain range.  I quickly recognized these lights as resembling the largely talked about Phoenix Lights above Phoenix, Arizona spotted 10 years ago on March 13, 1997. I quickly pointed them out to my friend (who is a very well-respected woman who works in one of the local school districts) who was driving the car and she agreed that these lights were very out of the ordinary. I watched the lights start to quickly spread apart, one orb heading east, one heading west, and one heading north. My view was then disrupted by a hill on the side of the road for about 5-10 seconds. When we finally passed by the hill, the three orbs had disappeared into the night sky leaving me in a state of awe.((NUFORC Note:  Because of both the location, and nature, of the bright objects, we strongly suspect that the bright objects may have been aerial flares, launched from aircraft over the Barry M.

I was standing in East Huntington area, Altizer to be exact. I was leaving my work place for a 30 minute lunch break and I immediately noticed the glowing orange object and I said to myself, &quot;That&apos;s a weird and unusually bright star to be so low in the sky.&quot;  I estimated it to be approximately 10 degrees above the horizon.  From  my vantage point in the parking lot it seemed to be across the Ohio river over southern Ohio and in The Procterville  or Scottown (if it was further North) area. I walked to the furthest end of the parking lot (away from the bright street lights and light washout) to get a better look.  It seemed to be at least 3 miles away or maybe 5 miles away over Procterville.  I kept studying it, as it was an unusual orangey fire color and seem to undulate.  All the time I remained reserved in my opinion as it seemed to grow and shrink or maybe even pulsate. From the East, a small plane was coming in and going toward the West (possibly towards the Chesapeake airport [a very small landing strip] in southern Ohio).  I could easily see the red blinking FAA light on the left wing as it traveled from East to West or from my right to left, as I looked north.  As the airplane flew from East to West, from my right to left direction), it went directly underneath the orange, glowing object and the object shrank to a small point of light.  After the plane had passed under the object, it enlarged and brightened again and appeared as an undulating, flaming top.  This is when I began to lose my reservations that it was just a low or rising star.  I continued to watch it and noted that the sky was clear with visible stars and the crescent half moon but the exception of some moderately quick moving clouds coming from the West.  It was a very breezy also.  I watched until the Object dimmed down its intensity and blinked out in two or three seconds.  It seemed to collapse into itself as it disappeared. I walked some more, scanning the sky to try to relocate it but I never saw it again.

The front end, perhaps half the length as the sides, may have been somewhat rounded.  The back end was perhaps half the length of the front end.

I would be able to ask my sister to verify the year and month if the researchers here would like me to.  Neither my sister nor my mother ever officially reported this sighting to anyone, (outside of family and friends) at any time, but, even after all these years, I&apos;ve decided it should be on the record.

My sister drove around on some side streets near our home then drove toward a near-by school, Eastland Jr. High, to practice parking in their lot. As they approached, my mother suddenly noticed a large, metallic &quot;saucer&quot;, with rectangular windows hovering very low over the school and parking lot. It was lit up inside. My mother yelled to my sister to stop the car. My sister hadn&apos;t yet seen the UFO and assumed she was about to hit an animal or something so she slammed on the brakes. My mother jumped out of the car and walked toward the craft. When my sister got out of the car she spied it and grabbed my mother&apos;s arm trying to stop her from getting closer. My sister kept saying, &quot;what is it?&quot;, my mom kept saying, &quot;You can see it, you tell me.&quot; My mom then told my sister to go knock on the door of a near-by house to try to get another witness but my sister refused to leave her side. My mother said it made no noise, my sister says she heard a low hum. My sister says she saw a &quot;shadowy&quot; figure in one of the windows as it slowly rotated, my mother insists there was no figure. After hovering there for several minutes, it started to slowly move away.  My mother told my sister to get back in the car, and with my mother now at the wheel they tried to follow the UFO. It finally disappeared behind some trees. My mother said that was the last time they saw it, my sister said she actually saw it zoom up into the sky and disappear into space. I think they also reported an antenna with a light on it attached between a couple of the windows. They both repeated this story to me and others many times over the years. They always completely agreed about all the main parts of the story. They always disagreed about only these three things; the figure, the hum and the zooming away. Their stories never wavered dispite a falling out that had them not speaking for years. My mother passed away in 1995 but my sister still tells the story. One other thing to note about this. One day in 1979 I brought my mother her mail. It included the April edition of OMNI magazine which my mother subscribed to. There was a drawing of UFO&apos;s on the cover. As my mother flipped through the magazine she suddenly said &quot;Oh my God, that&apos;s it!&quot;. She showed me a picture then called my sister&apos;s husband (they weren&apos;t speaking during this time) and told him to go buy the magazine and give it to my sister. An hour or so later my sister called and actually talked to my mother about the photo. They both agree this was what they saw. I have my mom&apos;s copy of the magazine still but it&apos;s packed away somewhere. I can find it and pinpoint the exact page and picture if asked or scan and email it.

In the southeast sky, above the treetops (mature black spruce about 20 feet in height) was what looked like a very bright star bouncing (or dancing) around - akin to a balloon or bag that gets caught in the wind and remains aloft. I know what satellites look like, and planets and plane lights, etc.  This wasn&apos;t it - in fact, at the time, it was almost like I knew intrinsically that this was something otherworldly, a feeling I have no explanation for.I watched it for about 30 seconds before bounding upstairs and waking my mom. I had witnessed practically the exact same &quot;star-like&quot; performance on Oct. 3 and after telling my mother about it,  she wanted to be informed if it happened again, no matter the time.After she bounded out of bed, we both peered out of the 2nd story window and  watched this &quot;star&quot; move in circles and up and down, and it continued to do these acrobatics for a full half hour. Afterwords, it just seem to fade into the night sky.I haven&apos;t seen it since, but about a week ago I heard what sounded like a &quot;whirly-gig&quot; coming from the direction of the treetops (something a kid would put on their bike or you see in gardens - sounds like the plastic blades of a wind toy.)   It was too dark to confirm what the source was.  For a moment I thought it might be something caught in the trees or a weird wind weather system, but after careful analysis, I&apos;ve excluded those possibilities.Also, about a week after our sighting, the military have started to do training flights with low-level helicopters in the area and I watched one zoom over our farm about 50 feet from the ground.  This can&apos;t be a coincidence, can it?   If anyone in my area knows anything or has seen anything, please report on this site (I don&apos;t have email at this point!)

She was with two of her daughters on a long stretch of road off a main highway in a wooded area near forest trees.  I believe she said it was in the Molalla, Oregon area.  While driving, a UFO/Disk chased their car down and literally skidded on top of the roof of the car. My Aunt told me she was driving erratic as she was scared at that point just to stay on the road as it was so bright and her daughters went hysterical and began screaming and yelling.  The object then disappeared.  She continued on till she saw a House with a light on.  She pulled off and got out of the vehicle.  There was some type of powder or substance on the vehicle all over the top.  I think she said it was Whitish/Yellow.  They rang the doorbell and the man came out of the house.  She explained that she got ran off a road by a UFO/Disk and that the car had evidence of the stuff it put on the roof of the car.  The man then said he BELIEVED HER because the samething on the same road had happened to him in the same area. She also told me that when my Uncle and her owned their Boysenberry Farm not too long ago in Bandon-By-The-Sea Oregon some odd things happened at their home.  Uncle Lonnie died of heart failure.  She would be in the Living Room watching TV and they had a Solar Window over the Roof of the house.  Each night the Helicopters would fly over her house and she would look up and could see them.  It got to the point that she would wave to them as the lights were so bright that they would then Rev up the the motor to let her know they were leaving.  I don&apos;t know if they were just guys out watching the ships, boats out in bandon.  Who knows.   All I know is shortly after that she started to hear something out in her yard and the dog refused to go outside.  She use to keep the bedroom window open and fall asleep as it was hot sometimes in summer.  She said as she slept she could feel something around her ears and it was like a RADIO and broken up Language.  She could feel something touch her ears.  This happened several times and then she would see the helicopters again out there at night and sometimes strange BRIGHT LIGHTS like UFOS out there.  She decided she better keep the windows closed as she noticed several strange marks on her body that she never had before she could not account for.  She got so scared she told her sons and they went up the road one night as there was strange lights in the sky near her neighbors across the road at his Berry Farm.  The kids were worried at that point that maybe a burgular was scaring the local farmers homes at night.  The older man across the road said he had been seeing strange lights off and on as well.  She decided shortly after my Uncle died to sell the farm and move to another part of Oregon.  There was talk in the town that there was a school teacher one day found on the local beach with perfect incision marks on a cut off hand and to this day no body really knew how someone could have a PERFECT cut off incision like her hands looked when they found her.  Some local kid got blamed for it.  But to this day locals said something did not make sence the way she was found out there.((NUFORC Note:  One of many reports from same source.

I had just completed a 3-11 shift in Chatham and headed due west on the backroads back to my home in Dennis. As I left work at 11;15, I spotted an unusual object upon turning westward and kept my eye on it all the way back to Dennis and never lost sight of it.I stopped to pick up my son at his girlfriends house at about 11:30 and drove to a nearby parking lot with him to show him the oddity in the sky. It was the new moon and the sky was very clear with bright stars everywhere. I pointed to the object I had been witnessing for about twenty minutes. My son looked up and his mouth feel open! He said &quot;Holy **** mom, what IS that?&quot; I told him his guess was as good as mine.We decided to drive to a local historic tourist attraction located on one of the geographically highest topographies in the area.As luck would have it, the vantage point at this tower is due west and many locals and tourists alike enjoy watching the sunset from there.There, right in front of us, was the object we had seen. Within minutes we saw two similar objects were present as well. They formed a triangle. The one closest to us,which I estimated to be between ten and twelve miles away but may have been closer, was also in the closest proximity to the Earths surface. The one to the right, about twice that distance away as it was also further from the Earths surface, seemed to be more &apos;orb&apos; shaped and frequently glowed in a fiery white to gold to orange. The furthest away was located at the apex of the triangle and appeared to be lit brightly on the top, but there were no clouds in the sky to reflect this off of, this object appeared to be about two to four miles in the air, but that was difficult for me to gage. All three of them just hovered although sometimes the lower two seemed to move up and down slightly and all three of them maintained their basic vicinity, they also did small concentric circles perpendicular to the surface of the Earth.All three of the objects flashed lights along their perimeters. Sometimes they flashed synchronicitously, sometimes seperately, with colors flashing white, yellow, red and green. At this point, I called a friend of mine in Arizona to deatil tthe phenomena I was witnessing and we spoke through approximately forty five minutes of it.At one point my son and I noted the closest object with its changing colored lights move closer to us and we held our breath not knowing what would occur next! My son called a friend of his who showed up with some friends. They also witnessed what we were watching. I called my ex spouse to see if he would come up with his video camera but he couldn&apos;t. He attempted to see it from his house but could not. He said the stars were very bright but that his vision was hampered by a wooded area to the west.Small flashes seemed to emit from the lower two sporadically. The flashes shot from the bottoms of the objects, but not directly from the center. They were lit trails that disappeared from view after a second or two.After about two hours, the objects departed, one by one. The first to leave was the closest to us. it headed westward silently with its lights changing colors and all remaining lit. It moved quickly and i watched it disappear over the horizon. The object to the right glowed and moved westward also. The object at the apex seemed to drop a long way then move staight up and then westward as well.I drove home and emailed seeral friends about the incident.", "Fireball over Bogota ColombiaIn 1973 I was living in Bogota Colombia, on the 30th floor of a 32 storey apartment building facing the city of Bogota which is surrounded by the Andes mountains.  One evening we were entertaining several people and happened to look out over the city and saw a huge fireball coming directly toward the city from the mountains across the valley.  It was travelling slowly, in a straight line and appeared to hang over Bogota for quite a while.  We noticed on either side of the city, coming up just over the lip of the mountains, a craft which would travel vertically up and down as if checking on the ball.  The ball travelled backwards towards the far end of the valley, began to descend and changed from red to white while descending.  For a two week period after that, at the same time every evening, we would see three craft come up over the lip of the mountains and one would come in and hang over the city.  It would be there one minute, then blink out as if you had turned off a light switch, then come on again. It would do all kinds of crazy loops and turns.   It would always travel back to the mountains in a straight line, and when it would descend behind the mountain ridge, would start to change color.  I watched this for 2 weeks and never forgot it.  The fireball was so big is seemed to be right over the city and you could see the heat emanating from it.  We checked the papers the next day but there was no story.  We think we saw this because we happened to be living in a tall apartment building.  I have never forgotten it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I certainly saw something, raced up to tell my brother, and he saw it as well. I was peeking my head out our window to see if Sirius had set yet and to see Saturn, when I noticed what looked like two stars of equal magnitude that I didn&apos;t recognize (not that I&apos;m knowledgeable enough to notice something out of place...it just looked odd). They were moving though, so I thought plane...which would be nothing out of the ordinary, they are always overhead, blinking away. These really weren&apos;t blinking...and the lights were too far apart to be from the same plane. it passed overhead slowly, couldn&apos;t have been extremely high in the sky, on account of the wingspan covering a wide field of the sky. There was a noise similar to the kind of noise you get as a large plane many thousands of feet in the sky passes overhead (you know, you see it and the sound is slower, so it appears that the sound of it is trailing behind)(it was very low in pitch, could be easily heard from indoors, and spooked a few of the local animals, including a cow...which I didn&apos;t know lived so close to us:). I could not make out a shape of the object, just its lights...three of them two on the outside being a very light orange with the third being grayish but not centered in between the two on the outside. They weren&apos;t crisply flickering, I&apos;m not even sure you could say they flickered at all. I wasn&apos;t sure who to contact, I looked in the phone book under Evansville Regional Airport, but the numbers were for parking employees, Security office...none of them seemed like the right contact for this type of question. Anyways, I just wondered if anyone else had seen it and reported of it, or if there was some kind of way you might forward this to anybody who would be interested or aware of what was flying overhead during that time. I am an amateur stargazer, have seen planes, planets, meteors all the like; but this was quite unusual and worth my trouble to email you, and hopefully I wasn&apos;t to much trouble for you to hear out.

As I arrived home, the light seemed to have moved from the far West to what seemed to be almost directly over Old 31.Woke up my father to witness this.  He is a private pilot who is familiar with the skies.  I did not have to point this light out to him, as it was very apparent.  After staring at the light for about 10 min., he told me that he had no idea what it was either.The color was white, and reminded me of xenon light, there were no beams at all.  (very light cloud cover was present). There was absolutely no apparent source, and we were even unable to tell if it was coming from or towards the geosphere. After observing this phenomena for about 15 min. we went inside, puzzled.((NUFORC Note:  In most cases like this one, we would ask whether the light might have been an advertising light.  However, in our experience, most modern advertising lights have multiple beams, irrespective of whether they are based on multiple incandescent lights, or on a laser system.

My best guess would be that it was at least 80,000 feet high, and I could not hazard a guess on its size.  I had never seen any star and/or planet at that location at that time, so, that is why it seemed a little strange to me.The color was originally a flickering bright electric blue, but then started to fade into a white dull glow. The ten minute episode had the light bright royal blue color turn into a fading dull white color before it just disappeared.There were other stars in the sky that night, but with the thin layer of high cirrus cloud over our area, the stars all seemed to be not as bright as usual, and that is why I found the brightness of the &ldquo;object&rdquo; strange and a little odd.

Didn&apos;t really ever want to tell anyone.After leaving my friends house and proceeding down the driveway, I heard the crows in the tops of the tall pines raising heck. I turned to look because the noise was like that of/or if 1 of their own was wounded. While watching them in the tops of the trees fling around squalking wildly, with a clear blue sky in the farthest background, I noticed a round blue circular object coming into view underneath the high cirrus clouds. Immediately I was overwhelmed as it came closer and to my dismay, began to project the clouds over top of the craft on the bottom.It was easy to follow while moving down the peninsula with the constant movement of the clouds in the path of the craft being seemingly plucked from the sky and projected on the underside of the craft.The craft only stopped two times while traveling down the peninsula, once over apparently Ft.Eustis, the second being apparently over ths James River bridge area, before uplifting at an incredible pace and dissapearing above the high cirrus clouds.The two times the craft stopped it was extremely hard to see. 1 point that I called frantically for my friend or his 2star Admiral father to come see what i was looking at, i looked away for a second while it was stationary, only to have a hard time seeing it again when i looked back.While still stationary, the craft seemed to have a sheen of a very thin line of colors of the surroundings given at it&apos;s outermost edges. But when it started to move again, it resumed picking up what was above the craft and projecting it below on it&apos;s hull.There was no noise from it the whole time, however the crows stopped squalkin when the craft was stopped almost overhead. Weird hugh? The approximate time for this whole ordeal was about 5 mins. The approximate path viewed was form the Colonial Williamsburg - Camp Peary area down to the first stop over the Warwickriver - Ft.Eustis area then down to the James River bridge - Newport News shipyard area. When leaving upwards and outwards the craft seemed to go towards Chesapeake - Soffolk direction.I have wondered over the years if they had the techonology to project what was above to below, what a perfect camoflauge if the could project below to the above so as not to be spotted if overflown.We&apos;ll to sum it up whatever or whoever they were they made me wonder how small we really are.

I stopped the car and began to change the tire when suddenly my car radio started changing channels rapidly and the car lights began to flicker and dim.  All of a sudden everything just stopped, even my cell phone was off.  I could barley see anything as my eyes didn&apos;t have time to adjust to the darkness.

I live in Port Coquitlam, British Columbia Canada approximately 20 miles east of Vancouver, B.C. on March 31, 1997 in the back yard of my home in a small residential neighbourhood of Port Coquitlam, maybe a few minutes after 9:00 pm on a Monday evening, I too saw this very large &quot;boomerang&quot; shaped craft. Shortly before 9:00 pm my father had called me and said that this night was supposed to be the last night that the Hale-Bopp comet would be visible, so that if I haven&rsquo;t already seen it I&rsquo;d better get my last look!  Being 5 months pregnant at the time and a little bored I went outside to observe the comet, I was looking up at the sky when from the direction of the Southeast I saw this very large what I could only describe as a boomerang shaped object float over above me.  The craft itself was dark with absolutely no lights on and completely silent.  It looked to be very large, it&rsquo;s a little difficult to judge its distance but I would say it was only a couple hundred feet above me and it was moving slow but steady.   I remember walking slowly backwards trying not to take my eyes off this thing, watching it for as long as I could keep it in sight walking to the farthest corner of my yard practically climbing up on the fence just so I could get that last look until it disappeared from sight. The whole encounter only lasted maybe 2 to 3 minutes. It was unlike anything I have ever seen before or since.Listening to the radio program on Coast to Coast on the evening of March 13th 2007 got me excited because until now I thought that maybe I was only one of a few who had witnessed this encounter, when I was describing this craft to friends and family 10 years ago I was describing it then as a boomerang shaped craft.  It was surprising and comforting at the same time to hear stories from people that were so similar to mine.Although I did not see this craft on the evening of  (March 13, 1997) where many others did in Phoenix Arizona, I can undoubtedly say that this &quot;boomerang&quot; shaped craft was seen March 31, 1997 in Port Coquitlam, British Columbia Canada!", "It would disappear in one part of the sky for a second then would reappear in a spot a very long distance from where it had disappearedThe fireball craft would shoot another fireball craft out of it and then the original disappeared.

The orange craft would keep appearing and disappearing in different places in the sky fairly low to the ground.

I went out in the backyard around 10:30 PM to take the dogs out, a normal routine prior to going to bed. I usually have a great view of the sky and love to star gaze.

At first glance it looked like a plane but as it got closer overhead I began to watch and follow its unusual movements and shape. The object was moving from west to east at a speed that was faster than an airplane, its shape was unrecognizable even though there was a full moon. The object moved in an erratic nearly snakelike formation. Many lights could be seen flashing across its middle girth in a very random, flickering red and white pattern. I couldn&rsquo;t judge its distance from earth nor its size but I believe it was larger than a plane. Once the object disappeared in to the eastern horizon, I heard the tremendous trailing noise of a jet-liner back to the east where the object first appeared. I noticed a flash of dull white light, similar to a lightning flash, illuminating a cloud in the sky, as the rumbling of the aircraft tried to catch up to the object.

The sky was 2 octas covered with cumulus clouds. The object flew from the open sky and passed under the clouds and disappeared and appeared again, and finally disappeared into the clouds. Even though the end of the clouds were in sight, the object did no more appear. The size of the object was around 30 feets in diameter. (cumulus, altitude approx. 2500 feets) The speed of the object was approx. 500km/h, much more fast then the clouds. That&rsquo;s why I cannot think of a weatherballoon.

As it got closer, I noticed that this object was low.  The surrounding hills are about 500 -1000 feet high.  The craft kept moving to my right and at this point I saw 3 colors. The right side was the yellow light.  The middle was red and the left side was white.  The shape of the craft was like a cylinder, in that all of the lights seemed uniform in size and shape.What was strange was that the craft, which I thought was a plane or helicopter, its lights would dim and brighten up at the same time.  It was not like the usual &quot;blip&quot; of a plane, but the lights would fade in and out, all at the same time.  Imagine opening and closing your hand.  That was the effect.The moon is almost full, so I could see the silhouette of the hills to my right.  The object crossed over the first set of hills, and then disappeared behind the 2nd.  The hills at this point are no higher than 500 feet.  So, I expected whatever this was to bank over them and then go to the local airport only 3 or 4 miles away.The object never reappeared. I was not in a very noisy area, but not perfectly quiet, so I cannot tell you if it was making any sounds.One very interesting thing is that at about 7:00 to 7:15 PM a large helicopter flew over our town.  Although the moon was out, the helicopter was at about 2 o&rsquo;clock and I could not make out its shape against the night sky.I heard the helicopter first, and then saw that it had a yellow or orange light. It made the usual &quot;blip.&quot;  A very small white light preceded these lights.  It was very hard to see because of the streetlights, but based on its location, this helicopter was very long.  It could have been one of the dual propeller ones. Anyway, it banked over the town and headed northwest.  As it left, there were 2 lights in the back, blipping at different quick intervals, then a minute later, back to only one.We have had helicopters fly over before.  However, they usually land at the airport.  This one banked away from the airport, and disappeared.Anyway, I actually expected to see a flash of light because of how low the craft was.  I thought it was going to crash.  However, there was no flash.  All I know is that this tri-colored cylindrical object was visible for about 1 to 2 minutes, and then disappeared behind some hills.  Perhaps it was a plane, but I have never seen one that low that did not land at the airport.", "A boomerang shape that disappeared in the night skyI was sitting with my sister on the back porch of her apartment about 8 in the evening.  She pointed to the sky and said look at those birds.  But as we looked we realized that those were not birds because the formation was wrong and there was a light coming from them.  They clustered together in a boomerang shape but we could tell there were about 50 individual lights to the cluster.   As it headed towards us from the North West area it started to gracefully arch towards the North and broke into a triple arch shape and disappeared.  It was something we have never seen before!

It rose straight up (higher than the tree line) and stopped.Too close for comfort, we got into our car and drove rapidly from the lake taking Hwy 72 through Scottsboro to Huntsville (a trip lasting approximately 35 minutes).  The object followed us just above the tree line rapidly moving from one side of the road to the other.  The object was bright enough to be seen through the street lights once we reached Huntsville and followed us on a twisting path through town.We stopped at my house near Redstone Arsenal and gathered up a pair of binoculars and a rifle scope to look more closely at the object that was now hovering over the neighbor&rsquo;s house.  We were joined by my father (a restaurant manager) and a neighbor (profession unknown), and we all watched the object for approximately ten minutes.  It was bell or thimble shaped with varying colored lights around the outside of the object in a diagonal line from the bottom to the top.  It rotated counter clockwise and was light in color.  After ten minutes or so, the object rose rapidly and sped off to the southeast.I saw several strange luminous objects in the skies over Redstone Arsenal in the spring and summer that followed- often the same objects in the same general area several nights in a row--but none came close enough for me to distinguish their shapes.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The light had about the same intensity as the other actual stars.In the early morning light,I could faintly make out what looked like some sort of craft behind and to the right of it.( The light actually looked like an aircraft headlight but the light was emitting from it&apos;s side rather than the front.)Therewas also no sound or flashing lights as are typical on most aircraft.The &quot;craft&quot; continued on a perfectly straight course to the East and off into the horizon.", "My father is now 89 my brother 52 the girl with us now 51 myself 49 and the other fellow which worked with my father if he&apos;s still living would be ~79.

At the above time and date, in the night sky - the sunset had taken place an hour earlier - I saw a very bright object, stationary.  The color was bright golden and the shape of the object like a cigar with a protruding thinner extension, vertically protruding from the upper part of the main body.  The main body was a little longer than the extension.  The extension was pointing towards the sea, almost vertically (but not totally).  It looked like a mosquito. It remained immobile at the same spot on the horizon both times it appeared. The angle to the horizon from my position was about 40 degrees.  Its size, because of the distance involved (many miles in clear skies), was three times bigger than the size of the evening star observed at the same time. I was standing at the balcony of my flat, located in the town of Messolonghi, and the object appeared towards the west; in my opinion it was hovering over the Ionian Sea and before the island of Kephalonia (Copholonia).

Around 9 pm I looked to the left (south) and saw a V-shaped craft hovering about 1000 feet in the air. It was quite close to the highway, close enough to see a series of red and white light along the wings. It looked like an airplane without the body. It did not move or emit any sound. It appeared to be shiny metal with some reflected light off the surface. I did not stop as I was on my way home from a local hospital where I work as a physician. I have never seen a UFO and have always been skeptical that any aliens have visited earth as we have no physical proof. This did not strike me as an &quot;alien&quot; or extraterrestrial craft, it just looked like a man-made craft that somehow was able to hover silently.

I stared up at it and saw one person sitting in the front through what looked like a window area.  I saw a large steering wheel like that of what we have in a car or truck.  The person had both hands of the steering wheel of the circular craft.  It was travelling slowly above but towards my direction.  It had lights all around the bottom of it.  At first I thought it was a round, man made, blimp with lights around it, but was not sure.  I kept looking up at it as I drove forward down the Wampanoag Trail.  As it continued to head towards my direction, I began to get scared and my heart started beating very fast and I was about to make a decision as to whether I should turn my car around and head in the opposite direction away from it.  I stopped my car for a moment and looked around and I was the only one on both sides of the highway.  As I was about to turn my car around, I looked up again and the person operating the blimp or whatever it was, looked over the steering wheel and down at me and I think he realized I was afraid, so I saw him look over the steering wheel down at me and he then turned the steering wheel in front of him and the round floating objection turned around and headed slowly in the opposite direction towards Seekonk, MA.  I thought this was probably a blimp or a manmade craft with lights around the bottom of it. If this flew at night, someone might just see the lights around the bottom of it and think it was a UFO.  It might have been, but I thought it was a man made blimp like round object with lights around the bottom of it.  I did not report it to the police because it turned around and headed out of site over Seekonk, MA and I thought it might have been a round blimp with lights around the bottom of it. I know the difference because my cousin and I saw a real UFO around 1968 while driving on the highway in Portmouth, RI which I have already reported at this site.  That one was nothing of this world, it was a bright luminous tilted circulor object hovering over the water.  It moved sideways over the water and was to the right over our car.  I looked up at it from my car window. It was tilted, luminous, sauser shaped and had a haze like ring around it and it was just moved sideways over the water and stopped up in the air to the right above our car.  I looked to the right through the car windwo up at it and saw it in close proxsimity and it was disc shaped, tilted luminous with a hazy ring around it like the planet Saturn.  It did not look like it was made of anything of this world.  It then suddenly shot in an instant across the hemosphere to the other side of the sky over the water.

A fireball streaking high overhead from south to north, it was a DAYTIME SIGHTING, the persistent long tail was bright color of electric- arc blue mixed with violet- the color and brightness appearing like lightning from this witness&apos; perspective, the head of the object grew larger as it moved from my right to left high in the sky, directly over the U.S. Capitol and behind the speaker&apos;s stage- I was located in the Mall between the Capitol and the Washington Monument, facing east, standing almost directly in front of the speakers stage about 100 feet back when I saw this object streak overhead  about half- way through the scheduled speakers presentations. I was awed and blown away for quite a while, and I wondered whether anybody else in the crowd witnessed this !  I was initially frightened by the streak or dart of light I saw in the sky over Capitol Hill- I thought at first a big firework, then I saw how high up it was- thousands of feet, or several miles- and then I thought missile, and the fireball got somewhat larger as it traveled, -and I actually expected an explosion with sound- but only silence happened, and the tail faded without leaving any smoke or cloud whatsoever. The tail of a normal meteor would have left a thin remnant smoke or cloud trail like a contrail- but I repeatedly sought for a wisp of smoke to try to understand what I was seeing- and saw only CLEAR BLUE SKY AND SUN- BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER ! AND my early impression is this was LIKE AN ARROW ! Why ? Because the tail was very long and persisted way too long to be a normal meteor. You see, a normal meteor is colored incandescent white or bright sun- yellow, with a short tail because the tail tracks closely to the head of the meteor ( look at videos of the unfortunate shuttle reentry loss ). But THIS object- the tail continued for at least 20 degrees of sky, the entire display faded all at once, and the color of the tail was electric- arc blue- like an arc welder, but deeper blue- fringed with violet- FULL LENGTH- and I think the head of the object, as it progressed and grew bigger, was more violet than blue.

My back door faces east towards the I57 highway which is approximately 400 hundred feet to the east of my home.  I always check the sky and get an idea of the weather.  This was approximately 8:00 AM.  I looked up at the eastern sky which was mostly cloudy and immediately observed a giant circle of a hole - exposing a clear blue sky- in the clouds.  My first thought was that it was not normal.  I looked at it for several minutes, but the clouds never moved or closed over the hole. I returned indoors, completed my preparations for work and departed the house at approximately 8:45AM.  I could still see that the huge hole in the clouds had not moved or grown any smaller.  I took the north entrance ramp to I57 at Burr Oak Avenue that kept the unusual sky to my immediate right at all times.  Traffic was moderately heavy for a Tuesday morning rush hour, but not slow.  I was able to observe the sky constantly northeast or east of me for the twenty minutes it takes for me to drive from my home to my job on the southeast side of Chicago in the South Shore community.  The formation remained unchanged for the forty-five to sixty minutes that I observed it.  I recall that it was mentioned on the evening news during the weather report because people had called or e-mailed about it.  It was explained away as a cloud occurrence that may have been caused by jet fuel or engine fuel exhaust from a plane.

My search rapidly digressed and I found myself reading UFO reports for Indiana filed over the last year.I found the reports for Kokomo, March 2006 most interesting.As some of them describe what I&apos;ve seen near there previously this time of year, but with a few more twists.Funny thing is....if I hadn&apos;t seen what I&apos;ve seen for the past two years and this sighting tonight I&apos;d probably remark.&apos;What a bunch of Looney Toons.&apos;  Based on the past. I expect the Plymouth,IN to Grissom AFB sightings to occur now through April when we have...Clear Air with Visibility Unlimited and little to no moon illumination.Flight appears to be less than 2000 AGL and within 5 miles of US 31 out to the west.Most of my own sightings have occured between Argos and Mexico after sunset and prior to 22:00 local.The UFO reference in this case does not imply craft from another world, dimension or whatever. More likely our own military on night training maneuvers in the MOA.Do I think these are Top Secret craft capable of flight previously not realized? Hmm......It&apos;s highly unlikely they would adhere to a schedule so predictable over a populated area such as this. I am a 30+ year licensed pilot, so I have some familarity with aircraft....... I have witnessed some pretty remarkable moving light arrays out there that I find myself wondering what the hell I just saw. Know what I mean?  The thing is many have seen exactly what I have seen, it&apos;s been briefly covered in the local media. It occurs with regularity, so why does not somebody associated with this occurance come forth and set the public mind of these communities at ease?", "Intense bright, spherical white light over Auburn University campus ~9:30pm 2/25/07I had just finished the main leg of my run and was walking back to my apartment when I ran into a buddy of mine.  We were chatting for about 5 minutes right in front of my apartment when an incredibly bright, white ball of light suddenly appeared about 100 feet (rough approximation) in the air, seemingly out of nowhere. It looked like a perfectly round sphere, of a pure white light (a white like none I have ever seen before), and had a white tail of light that tapered of at the end.  It was traveling in a north-western direction, was totally silent, and quickly disappeared.  It only lasted about 5 seconds but I saw it clearly as I was facing its direction.  My friend only saw it out of the corner of his eye. We went walking in the direction that it was headed, since it looked like it was going to crash into the ground, to see if we could find anything.  However we didn&rsquo;t see much nor did we run into anyone else who we could ask if they had also seen it.  We only walked about a block though.  My first impression was a missile (due to the fact that we have frequent military aircraft flybys) or a firework.  But it couldn&rsquo;t have been either because of the nature of its appearance.  I don&rsquo;t know what it was but I am thoroughly excited by the sighting.Since it was requested, I am a skeptical individual but have a desire to believe. I can&rsquo;t claim that it was a UFO since I know very little about the nature of sightings and what-not.  As a kid, though, I was obsessed with them.  My friend didn&rsquo;t seem too interested and also seemed a bit entertained by my speculations over what it could have been.", "Blue-green ball of light emitting sparks streaking across sky in Rome, GeorgiaMy wife and I were coming home from church, and we were driving up the street/hill to our house, when we noticed a blue-green light in the sky that was very bright and large and moved very quickly from left to right above the tree line.

The perimeter of the craft had little white lights around the object. It was traveling east to west very fast, NO SOUND. If the perimeter was not lit up you would not have seen it.

PD))", "High velocity craft flying parallel to freeway.While travelling South on US-101 at 5:50 AM, several miles north of Ukiah, CA, a small cluster of lights came swooping in at a shallow angle in the opposite direction in front of me, on the east side of the road.  It was moving faster than I would expect a plane to move, and at first I thought it must be a meteor.  As it sped by me, I could see that it was in fact some sort of craft.While on the approach, I could only see a few smallish cluster of bright lights, looking at it from behind, I could see a rectangular grid area strongly lit, most likely the propulsion system.As I continued to look at it in my rear view mirror, I saw that it quickly slowed down, and the rear grid greatly increased in brightness.  Soon after that it disappeard from view, probably around the side of the bank of the road.The craft couldn&apos;t have been more than 100 feet above the ground, more likely 50 feet.  After realizing that it wasn&apos;t a meteor, the next logical conclusion would be that it was a low flying aircraft, but it was moving quite fast, much faster than 100 miles an hour.  I was only able to see it for about three seconds, even though it was running parallel to the road.  Even though at its closest it couldn&apos;t have been more than 300 feet away, it never made even a glimmer of a sound.  However, my windows were up at the time.The lit rectangular grid region on the back of the craft was unusual, however, and I can&apos;t quite think of anything I&apos;ve previously seen that would describe it.  Its flaring up as the craft quickly decelerated was also odd.It was moving so fast, and traveling so close to the ground, that the pilot must have been using night vision, or else have been extremely fool-hardy.", "Double sightingHi, was just reading a report about someone seeing something strange in Coatbridge on the 12/12/06 at 6pm. I was standing at my back door having a bit of fresh air five hours later and saw something similar five hours later.It was bright white, round with a long green tail and shot from north to south, it wasn&apos;t a meteor as they don&apos;t have a slight wobble as they move.  I have since saw it again two weeks back on th 20th of January. It&apos;s not the first time I&apos;ve saw something strange as in 2005 me and a friend saw a cigar shaped cloud with what looked like flashing lights inside drift past us in the same spot.I have always been interested in this subject and think if more people were a bit more observant they also might see these craft.

On the 29th of December at approximately 1400 hrs. local, I was leaving the FBO and walking to my plane.  The day was severe clear and crisp.  There were a few contrails crossing  and nothing else.  I saw one of the linemen, looking up at the sky.  I asked what he was looking at and he directed my eyes to an object so high up it seemed to be against the blue of the sky.  The object looked like the ball at the end of a pushpin held at arm&apos;s length.  It was the color of quicksilver and looked perfectly spherical.  It was moving from south to north and we saw it pass behind a number of contrails; some of which had to be in the FL400 range.  One more lineman came out to see the object and we observed it move north for about 15 minutes all told.  In the end, it simply vanished and we could not locate it anymore.  I think whatever it was had to be huge to appear that size to me.  The object didn&apos;t shimmer, shine or give off any sort of light.

It moved quickly in a perfectly straight line without any wobble or side-side movement at about 100-200 mph (this was also hard to estimate). The interesting feature was that the entire bottom was lighter than the darker sky and there was small red light that hung down slightly at the &quot;back&quot; of the object that hung down and was glowing steadily (not blinking).

But I was not ready for what happened next.I was at the second floor in my house talking with my girlfriend, when I decide to look out the window, I notice that there was an object just floating vertically from north to south.

De certa forma era como se alguma coisa me bloqueasse.Todas as vezes em que lembro do acontecido, v&ecirc;em-me uns calafrios e uma sensa&ccedil;&atilde;o de ang&uacute;stia. Neste ponto passo a narrar mais essa experi&ecirc;ncia que vivi em 1988. No ano de 1988, estava eu em companhia de Margareth (Dra. Margareth Leite Figueira - importante advogada capixaba), minha namorada na altura. Volt&aacute;vamos de uma viagem a Anchieta pela Rodovia do Sol. Estava uma tarde ensolarada e com pouco movimento na estrada. O sol come&ccedil;ava a se p&ocirc;r mas havia ainda muita claridade naquela tarde de ver&atilde;o. Quando nos aproxim&aacute;vamos de Santa M&oacute;nica, praia pr&oacute;xima a Guarapar&iacute;, do lado esquerdo da rodovia, por tr&aacute;s de um pequena montanha de, mais ou menos uns 15m de altura, estava um objeto de cor grafite, parado na vertical!  Parei o carro, apontei para o objeto e perguntei a Margareth: &quot;Voc&ecirc; est&aacute; vendo aquilo?&quot; Ela, com os olhos muito arregalados, disse. &quot;Sim. &Eacute; um disco voador.&quot;  Este morro tinha uma caracter&iacute;stica interessante: era quase sem vegeta&ccedil;&atilde;o dos lados, mas tinha algumas &aacute;rvores de pequena estatura no cume. A estrada fazia uma volta e continuava por detr&aacute;s dele. Desci do carro e aproximei-me do aparelho. Ele continuava l&aacute;, parado na vertical por tr&aacute;s do morro. Tinha por volta de uns 4 metros de di&acirc;metro e quase n&atilde;o tinha espessura. Pelo menos, n&atilde;o conseguia dimensionar a sua espessura. Entrei novamente no carro e disparei em frente para ter uma melhor vis&atilde;o quando estivesse do outro lado da montanha mas, ao chegar l&aacute;, n&atilde;o havia mais nenhum sinal do objeto circular e achatado de cor de chumbo. Era como se ele nunca estivesse estado ali. Lembro que quando aproximei-me da coisa, mais ou menos uns 30 metros de dist&acirc;ncia, tive uma sensa&ccedil;&atilde;o de muito medo e, durante todo este tempo, nunca consegui reportar este evento, embora tenha contado para algumas pessoas. O tempo total em que avistamos o objeto girou por volta de uns 5 a 10 minutos, entre o parar do carro e o deslocamento at&eacute; o outro lado do morro. A Dra. Margareth ainda est&aacute; muito ativa em sua profiss&atilde;o e &eacute; titular de um importante Cart&oacute;rio no centro de Vit&oacute;ria. Com certeza ela poder&aacute; confirmar esta hist&oacute;ria verdadeira. A minha inten&ccedil;&atilde;o ao relatar esta hist&oacute;ria verdadeira &eacute; libertar-me de uma sensa&ccedil;&atilde;o de estranheza. Sentia-me como uma pessoa escolhida e, ao mesmo tempo, com uma grande responsabilidade por ter que reportar tal coisa. Devo dizer que me sinto um pouco mais leve entretanto. Sinceramente,  Daniel Amaral  ---   Curiously, passed so many years of this seeing and, having lived one another much more strong experience than this one in a phase of the life when I supposedly was much more conscientious and more knowledge of the phenomenon, just because after what happened before , I started to read a lot about flying saucers, etc. I never reported  what happened after the first seeing what I start to do now. I felt like some thing was blocking me.All the times when I remembered that vision I felt a sensation of anguish. At this point start to tell the ocurred in 1988: In the year of 1988, I was I in company of Margareth (Dra. Margareth Leite Figueira -an  important lawyer of the Vit&oacute;ria, capital city of the Espirito Santo state), my girl friend that time. We was returning from of a trip to Anchieta through  the so called  &quot;Rodovia do Sol&quot;-  Highway of the Sun. Was one sunny  afternoon  and with little movement in the road. The sun set was started .When we was near to Santa M&oacute;nica beach from the Guarapar&iacute; city, in the left side of the highway, in the  backwards of a small mountain , was an object of the graphite color , stopped in the vertical line! I stopped the car and pointed  to the object and I asked the Margareth: &quot;You are seeing to that&quot; She said. &quot;Yes. there is a flying saucer.&quot;  That mount had an interesting characteristic: it was almost without vegetation in the sides, but it had some trees of small stature in the top.There is a curve in the road that continued behind the mount.I went down of the car and I came close myself to the device. It continued, motionless there in the vertical line for backwards of the mount.I was about 4 meters of diameter and almost did not have thickness. At least, I did not obtain the dimension of its thickness.I entered again in the car and I went off in front to have one better vision when it was of the other side of the mountain but, when arriving there, I did not have signal of the circular and flattened object of graphite color.It seems like was never had been there. I remember that when I came close to the object around 30 meters of distance, I had a bad sensation of fear  during all this time.I&apos;d never thought to report this event, even I have told for some people. The total time of the sight was around 5 to 10 minutes, between stopping of the car and the displacement until the other side of the mount.Margareth still very active in his profession as a titular of an important Notary&apos;s office in the center of Vit&oacute;ria City.She certainty will be able to confirm this true history. My intention when telling this true history is to free me of a strange sensation.Sometimes I feel like i am a chosen person and, at the same time, with a great responsibility for having to report such kind of thing.

My mother and two brothers were in the living room watching MASH, and I was in the family room watching another TV show. I could see and hear through our kitchen into our living room, where the rest of my family was watching television. I began to hear some excitement coming from the living room and went in to see what was going on. My whole family was staring out the window when suddenly my brother (17) darted to his room to get a camera and out the front door he went. I took his place at the window and was amazed at what I saw. Above the houses across the street and hovering, was a cigar-shaped disc, about 100-200 feet long, bright, with what I can remember as alternating white and red lights. Things began to happen very fast and the excitement was none like I&rsquo;ve experienced before. We all were outside within seconds of me entering the living room to see what was going on. Once outside, my brother (17) easily scaled onto our roof via our front porch. My other brother (12) ran out into the front yard. I can remember my mother being very concerned, she kept me by her side as we continued to watch from our front porch. My brother&rsquo;s camera was a cheap Kodak with a flash, but in the dark, he was unlucky at getting any kind of exposure. Anyway, we watched the craft through the tall trees, hover back and forth, over the houses, for about two minutes. The trees were not in bloom as of yet (my estimated date of 4/1 very easily could have been late February or March) and I could see the object through the trees. Another aspect that I am certain of is that I could see through the craft, I mean, it was a clear starry night, facing Mt. Rose and Slide Mountain, part of the Sierra Nevada Mountains which are easily visible on a clear ! day. At night, however, all one could see were the stars, and I can remember seeing the stars through the outline of the craft, which was bright orange-yellow. The lights I mentioned earlier went from one end to the other, through the center of the cigar shape. The strangest thing about our sighting is that is seemed very dark and quiet on our street for that time of night. Not one of our neighbors, who we all knew very well, were outside at that time, and not a single vehicle drove by. The episode, as I said, lasted about two minutes. The last thing I remember is that it all of the sudden disappeared, either from speeding away, or vanishing into thin air, I can&rsquo;t say which. I am confident the year was 1975 for a number of reasons which I won&rsquo;t get into here for this could get very long. I will say that this sighting has never left my consciousness. I rarely tell anyone and very rarely discuss it with my family. I can also say that the experience immediately (within one year) turned me and my mother into UFO buffs, of a sort. I can remember reading my first UFO book (Project Blue Book) I checked out at my school library (Vaughn Middle School). Ever since we&rsquo;ve shared information and still do to this day, but we rarely venture into a conversation about that night. The experience has changed my life, and at the ripe age of almost forty-three, my interest has peaked so much that I have finally taken the time to write it down. That night we called the radio station and they thought we were joking. I told my friends at school and they didn&rsquo;t believe my either. I do remember my mother telling us one of here friends from the hospital where she worked, spotted the craft. This person, according to my mom lived across Plumb Lane, so it made sense that she could have seen the same thing we did.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

No alcohol was involved at the birthday party.  So we decided to go way up into the mountain to play because we thought it would be more fun, But boy were we wrong!  First a blinding light flashed down upon us, amost paralyzing us of all movement for a couple of seconds.  Then two figures came out of the blinding light and spoke in an unknown language.  At this time we were about 50 yards away behind a large rock.  They stood and studied the surrounding for a couple of seconds and then proceded to take some samples.  After samples were taken they began to slowly move back toward the origin of the light before disappearing into it.  the aliens were somewhere around 6 1/2 feet tall to 7 feet. They wore no close but their bodies looked to be armoured from head to toe, almost like they were engineered for war.  They were rather skinny, but had extremely large limbs.  They had a small head with the eyes taking up the majority of the face.  the eyes were completely white and it seemed as though the light was shining through them.  They had a very small mouth and did not appear to possess any ears, but looked as though they had small holes in the sides of their heads.  Now for the craft.  It was very hard to get a clear look at the craft because of the light but it appeared to be a small ball shaped pod with no windows.  It did not have any of the typical flashing lights like you would think but it did have a very bright pulsating glow.  The pod moved very quickly and was very agile, almost as if it teleported from place to place.

I noticed a large multi-engioned turbo proped aircraft (possibly a C-130 transport), as that is the most frequent type seen around here.  The aircraft came in from the Northeast of town, circled around the north of town to the west of town and then went to the South-South West.  I followed the aircraft until it got approximately 5 miles to the South-West, when something caught my eye, above and to the south.  There was a dim flash of light, followed by what appeared to be a disk type of craft suddenly appearing.  All the edges of the craft appeared as though they were imbedded in clouds, although the night was cloudless.  I could briefly see lines and a circle around the center of the of the bottom of the craft.  It exhibted a color of burnt orange, which I later discovered was the reflection of the lights of the city.  It was about the size of a nickle held at arms length.  It suddenly started to move, and started to fade out of sight and moved toward and followed the aircraft to the South. It is interesting to note that on the day before (Sunday) an AWACS E-3 airbourn radar aircraft orbited around this city for approx. 4 hours.  This is VERY unusual because Military aircraft don&apos;t fly around here on the weekends!  It was as if they were looking for something!!!

I turned off my car and went to open the door when I noticed a bright light in the driver side mirror.  I didn&rsquo;t think anything of it I just had  thought it was a very bright plane. I gathered my belongings and got out of my vehicle and looked back up to notice that the object I noticed was extremely bright and was not moving.  I did not want to lose sight of the object so I used my cell phone to call inside the house to my husband.  He came out side and by the time he had come out there were two right next to each other.  They were very bright and the color was red and white. We watched for a few minutes and a third one came from behind the middle one and they were in a row.  As we were watching we were looking toward the south.  The one on the right moved out toward the south west and sat above the mountains.  After the one on the right moved out to this direction another one came from behind the middle on and took the place of the one that had gone.  We could still see the light from the one out in the distance just sitting there and then it disappeared.  After this was gone the one to the right of the middle one moved into the middle one and there was just two.  The two stayed in the same spot for a few more minutes and then they started to go out farther to the south.   And then they were gone. A few minutes later they appeared in the same spot that we first saw them (two) and they stayed for just a few seconds and then they slowly disappeared towards the south.((NUFORC Note:  We observe that the description is not inconsistent with witnessing of landing lights on distant aircraft.  There are several civilian and military airports in the Everett area.  Just a guess.  PD))", "Cylindrical object hovering past my car at close rangeLocation: Heading southbound on Highway 599, on the ramp just before it merges with I-5. I am a male, and was 37 years of age at the time of this sighting. I work in the printing industry and have a background in fine art. I feel these two facts enhance my testimony and illustration provided. I noticed two stationary extremely bright white lights, side-by-side horizontally in a fixed position at about 400 feet above the ground, in the sky directly in front of me. At first it appeared to be an aircraft coming in for a landing, the bright lights being standard landing lights. After several seconds I noticed two odd things about these lights. Firstly, they were a bit too far apart for an ordinary plane configuration and secondly, they were barely moving  closer to me despite my driving towards them. This clearly indicated to me that the object was in fact stationary and not moving forward as an airplane would do. I slowed my car down considerably since nobody was driving behind me, and started carefully observing the craft. The two lights remained in their fixed positions for a moment and then began banking slowly and steadily to the left, all the while not getting any closer to me. After tilting to about 45 degrees the lights began approaching me smoothly and steadily. As the lights came nearer, the object started to pass me to my left at  an altitude of roughly 40 feet, and travelling approximately 20-30 miles per hour. It looked to be about 30 feet in length, and 10 feet in width. It remained tilted at a 45 degree angle the remaining duration of the sighting. The two extremely bright lights had now dimmed, or perhaps were no longer pointed directly at me and only seemed dimmer because of this. As it drifted past to my left, I got a very good look at it since I had slowed my car down considerably to about 25 miles per hour. At the closest point it was only about 50 feet from my car. The object was sillouetting the lights of the valley and the distant hills and dark gray sky behind it, revealing a distinct long cylindrical shape. There were roughly six white lights on the visible side of the object, with no particular order to their distribution and they were all rather small. The lights were in two slightly differing sizes, with the upper and lowest lights being the larger. There weren&apos;t any strobes on this object, or any small colored marker lights which to my knowledge is not the case with conventional aircraft. There were no rotors, wings, cockpit or audible sound. A helicopter would definately have some audible noise at such a close distance, and the rotors would have been visible. There was one large red light on the side and just about dead center, which blinked with a slow on-and-off pattern at one second length intervals. This red light appeared at least a foot in diameter and didn&apos;t flash, but steadily faded off and on. This red light was a perfect circle which appeared raised like a dome similar to a lighting fixture one might have on the ceiling of their home. There was a very narrow and bright beam of light emanating from the center of the object and aimed directly in front of it. The beam of light was aimed just slightly lower than horizontally. The searchlight was steady and appeared fixed to the object because it never changed position in any way. The object continued off toward my left rear and floated over the ground at the same altitude, it&apos;s searchlight still shining out and onto the ground below and continued at a south-easterly direction. Since this time I have observed multiple helicopters at night in order to make a comparison and there are no similarities between any helicopters and this UFO. Please see my emailed illustration and map for more details.", "No joke, a giant Teddy Bear shaped UFO.Okay, this is a strange story but rather funny and I just have to share it. I&apos;m not positive about the exact date or year. But it was the summer of 97 or 98. I was driving northbound to my office in Columbus, Ohio and stopped at my usual fast food place for breakfast. I pulled around the back of the building to the service window. As I stopped at the window I looked up and noticed straight in front of me but maybe a block or two away, a giant (30-40 feet tall)Teddy Bear floating in the sky right above the trees. I thought I was seeing things for a second then realized it must be a hot air balloon although where the basket would be was below the tree tops. It floated past the corner of the building I was next to so I couldn&apos;t see it any longer. I laughed and told the cashier what I saw when he waited on me. He stuck his head out the window but it was already out of sight. A few moments later he gave me my order and I drove forward. As I turned around the corner of the building I looked to where the object should be based on it&apos;s speed and direction. There was nothing there. Before I pulled back onto the main street I looked all around and up. It had disappeared. Because of the flatness of the area and lack of large trees or tall buildings the only way I could explain it disappearing was if it had crashed behind a home and lost it&apos;s air in the short time between when I saw it float past the building and when I pulled up. I listened to the local news that evening to hear if there had been a balloon crash or even a balloon show. Nothing was mentioned.

I couldn&apos;t tell how far away they were but they must have been very far because they did not illuminate anything close to the groud.  They didn&apos;t reflect off of any of the clouds and it was quite cloudy and as seen through my binoculars, they did not appear to block any earthshine on the moon.  They appeared to travel vey fast since the whole incident, that is time from when first object moved form left to right and then up over the top of the moon to when the second one followed the same path and was no longer visible.  The whole incident took less than one minute.  Because of the poor &quot;sseing&quot; conditions (clouds, intermitent rain followed by visible stars and then clouds again), distance was quite hard to gauge as was the size of the objects.

It probably took at least 4 minutes to get my camera. I took pictures over a 12 minute period as you can tell by putting your mouse over the pictures. I leaned against a tree to try to keep the pictures from blurring. I would say it seemed to be in the same area for long time, at least 20 minutes and probably  longer.

To us, lights in the sky are quite common. However, on this night (tonight) we were driving home from the gym and as we turned down and adjacent street from the main road on our way home I saw two objects racing *fast* on a SE to NW direction.  No biggie, right, except these things were traveling really quickly across the sky in tandem.  I stopped the vehicle and pointed the objects out to my uncle.  We continued to drive around the corner (and had to to keep it in our sights).Here is the kicker... The object forward most was a cobalt bright blue glow. We thought is was an afterburner of a jet. But wait...following behind was another craft which had identifying FAA blinking lights. The light was red so we figured it was the starboard light that was flashing. The craft were equidistant from each other and by that I mean that the craft following or *chasing* the blue sphere didn&apos;t gain any ground nor lose any ground.As the craft flew out of sight, the blue cobalt sphere faded. We think this is because is was moving out of range of vision. The other continued to fade, too, meaning that the flashing red FAA light got dimmer and dimmer as it moved away from us.We had second thoughts on the afterburner glow as the craft following was keeping pace and did not show afterburner glow as one might expect. Also, the sphere did not have any identifying FAA flashing lights. It was a constant color and did not flicker.It is our belief that the former object was one of our (USA) jets. Neither took off from the airport as their trajectory was not that of a departing plane.We heard no sound of any kind and felt both objects were low enough to have been heard as they passed.They were about a 30 to 35 degree angle from our juxtaposition to the horizon.It was a crystal clear night and, NO, these weren&apos;t stars as stars do not fly across the sky at these speeds. There were no tree&apos;s obstructing our view and in fact we had to drive forward several times in order to avoid any objects such as houses and trees.

However the engines were too loud for a smaller search and rescue type helicopter. So my attention was drawn to see what was evidently on a path that would bring it very close to my house.As I looked to see what kind of helicopter it was, suddenly I noticed two bright lights traveling together in a straight path approximately a hundred feet apart. They were moving at least three hundred to four hundred miles an hour approximately a hundred and fifty feet in front of the helicopter. All three aircraft were traveling at only around three hundred feet in altitude.Directly in pursuit of the two lights was a very large, single rotor, obviously military helicopter with all of its flashing lights.The two lights made no noise, and had no other flashing or strobe lights- (proximity lights), just two &quot;star-like&quot; lights.I did not realize what I was watching until after the event.

This morning I saw a small plane flying low in the sky toward the North. About 2 fingers distance to the West I saw a bright light that was moving  upward and curving slightly at a rapid speed a leaving a trail.

I am a US citizen living in Manzanillo Mexico.  I am a retired 56 year old business professional. My hobby is photography.  Approximately September 2, 2006 I was photographing a beautiful rapidly changing sky.  Two days later I was reviewing my photos on the computer to eliminate the undesirable ones when I noticed some rather interesting forms on the photos.  Honestly, through the view finder on the camera, I never noticed anything as I was focused on the colors. None of the other photos have anything strange on them, eliminating the possibility that something was on the lens. I use a 10.0 excellent digital camera.On one photo there are two distinct images. One looks cylindrical with a bump in the middle. It actually looks like smoke is propelling it. In the same photo, directly to the left is another object, quite a bit smaller, obviously at a further distance.Another photo has a round bright dot which is amongst some dark clouds. To the far right you will see a drain pipe that comes from my building.In the third photo there is an elongated &quot;something&quot; that is directly above the house in the photo. Proportionately, it is huge.These were all taken within minutes of each other along with other photos of the area.I will be emailing the photos to you.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  We see nothing in the three photographs sent to our Center that is suggestive of a genuine UFO.  Two photos are suggestive of birds caught in mid-flight, and under low light conditions.  The third photo suggests part of an overhang on a nearby house, we believe.

I then thought I was seeing an evacuation helicopter moving toward Ashe Memorial Hospital, some 7 miles to the west and he had his spot light on for some reason. I did not see any movement laterally, but it seemed to be growing, indicating that it was moving toward me. As I watched the light, it turned off.

It is an embarrassment to file one this evening, but I feel an obligation to do so. Arriving at the H.S. parking lot around 19:15 I rolled down the windows and opened the sunroof.  Many stars in the sky, just like last night.   Two small planes flew by. Around 19:45 I saw and heard two jets fly over the H.S., I was amused. The jets flew over the H.S. this evening around the same time the lights were seen last night.  The jets came from the north and flew towards the south.  I could see two red lights overhead.  I felt good, was ready to home, enough of this stuff. As soon as the jet noise dissipated, I saw a light.  Didn&rsquo;t believe it would ever happen again.  They were further away, just above the treetops.  Two of the lights were southeast and one was southwest of the H.S.  The lights went on and immediately off.   Two to three seconds duration each time.    They had a yellowish tint, the same as last night.   This went on for several minutes.  Each light went on twice that I noticed.    No trailing lights of any kind.  The lights were bright, almost firework like in color temperature.    Each light illuminated in the same way, they seemed identical.It was weird!  Maybe military exercises were being performed.   I hope this is the case.  The jets &quot;play&quot; in the airspace around Salem quite often, but the lights were much lower than the jets.

The formation was approximately 300 feet off the ground and was passing over a local business that had bright lights illuminating the business.  This formation appeared to be in the form of about 6 to 8 individual lights, however after looking more carefully at it, it seemed to be individual reflections coming from the lights of the business reflecting off the object(s).  As it moved in a southeasterly direction and away from the business lights, the individual reflections diminished in their intensity and the lights (reflections) took the shape of a triangle with two lights centered in the rear.

It also had a red light on bottom that would flicker! It seemed to be about 1,000ft  high and moved extremely slow. A minute or two later, two military jets flew overhead. Provoking us in thought that it was a UFO. I have never seen anything like this in my life!", "It was the night of March 10th 2007 at around 2:10 in the morning. Me and my best friend Steve were sitting in his car waiting to go on a school-organized trip to Quebec. The bus left at 5:00 am so Steve and I decided to stay up and wait to drive to the bus and sleep the whole drive up. We decided to wait on a new road that connected two different subdivisions (Voyager Run and Kingswood). The road was off of a lake and had no streetlights because it was just built. We parked the car near the only source of light, which I believe was a little watershed or hut with one light bulb at the top. While sitting in the car my friend pointed out a bright white light in what we assumed was a far distance in comparison the trees on the lake. At first my friend thought it was a planet because of the random blinking of the light. After looking at this light for 5 minutes the passenger window become streaky and slightly fogged. After the streaks were formed we both realized this light was moving by keeping our heads completely still and by comparing the close streaks on the window to the light in the distance. Once we made this realization after about 10 minutes of the movement of the light we noticed a drastic increase in the speed it was moving and could notice that it wasn&rsquo;t moving sideways anymore but towards us and was getting bigger. After watching this light move closer for 2 minutes, 3 more lights other than the original white flashing light were becoming visible. The other lights were, a very light blue on the left side, a bright red on the opposite side, and an even brighter white/yellow light on the top which would make it a triangle if it weren&rsquo;t for the other original flashing white light which was flashing slower and in different places making the shape unrecognizable. At this point the shape was still to far to recognize a flying pattern which was the last thing leaving my friend and I to believe it still might be an airplane or something explainable. After only another minute or so trying to interpret what this was the distance this thing seemed to travel in a short period of time seemed unbelievable. Once the object seemed to be close enough to be able to hear an engine I rolled my window down. As soon as my window went down I can&rsquo;t explain the feeling I got instantly; it was a feeling of panic. My friend panicked as well because the object was hovering with a very slight humming sound over the lake infront of us. As the object was getting close it moved in a very slight up and down movement but continued to move in a forward direction. The object wasn&rsquo;t very high in the sky, maybe about a 10-story building. The way it moved made it hard to tell a shape. I only got about a 5 - 10 second detailed look at it. I am positive that I saw a curve to the shape on one side. The curve seemed to progressively light up with three different colors one at a time then fade them backwards in the same manor. It was identical to the way the equalizers show the bass hits in a song but only horizontal and on one side of the object. The colors that lit up along the side were red, green, and yellow. My friend instantly started the car in fear when the object was flying in a direction that would pass behind the car. As my friend started the car and put the car in gear the object had just passed behind the car and it instantly changed directions towards the car. The feeling of fear and curiosity that this thing had spotted us was a feeling I could not describe. My heart was beating incredibly fast; I have never felt anything like this. At first the feeling was fear and the feeling of a much greater power or energy in the sky that was capable of anything. As my friend and I drove out towards the other end of the road that connected the two subdivisions the object would appear out my window one second and then my friends window as we went around every slight turn. Eventually when we reached the main road the object was no longer in sight anywhere. I know what I saw was something of the unexplainable because of the feeling I got. I described the whole 20-minute encounter as best as I could with as much detail. If anyone has a similar story around the same area or different PLEASEEE let me know. I will never forget this experience that I witnessed just the other week. I am only 18, but my friend and I know that whatever we saw was not explainable. I decided to keep the story to myself the whole time in Quebec because when I tell it its impossible to share the feeling of the experience. Contact me at ((e-address deleted)) with any similar or explainable info.", "At approximately 21:30 on March 3, 2007, my partner and I were enjoying the clear sky from the balcony of our hotel in Cancun, Mexico. We had an ocean front room with an unobscured view of the sky. The moon was approximately 80 degrees in the east, the big dipper approximately 40 degrees in the north.We observed a faint orange-red light coming from the north, below the Big Dipper. It was dim, but not as dim as a satellite.It traveled across the sky at a steady speed, but its trajectory was erratic. It would travel a straight line for some distance, and then make strange course corrections. At one point, it completed 3 sides of a square maneuver, just before passing in front of the moon.Just as we lost visual contact with the object in the southern sky, we saw a streak of light, originating from the point where we lost visual contact. The streak was at a 45 degree angle to the west. We were both in shock that we had witnessed such an event. It was truly amazing. My partner and I are both 36 years old.

Immediately a large flash of light from the sky and when it was off (about 2 seconds), the power came back.  10 minutes later noticed dozens emergency personel vehicles across field.  Called the cops and they said that there was an accident and I probably saw a transformer blow up (over a mile away).  Noticed two craft hovering around site emitting an amber color.  One started bobbing up and down and made a smooth pass about a half mile by my property.  Did not get a good look at it but could not hear a sound when I poked my head outside.  I then noticed the second one start making the same path and went out on the deck to get a look.  It had 3 spotlights on the side pointing to me and several red blinking lights on top and bottom.  It was closer than the last one and the wind was coming from its direction and still heard NO sound.  I have seen helicopters at night and this was not one.  It had no sound and I have never seen three horizontally aligned spotlights on the side of any aircraft before.   Will be a long night getting to sleep now.", "it was not a police helicopter and it was close and hovering about telephone pole height.Approx 2 years ago, I was driving home in Decatur, GA. I saw what I thought was a helicopter hovering about 25-35 feet above the road. I slowed down as it had a bright light shining. I thought it was a police helicopter searching for a suspect and given the proximity to the ground, I thought they had him cornered.  It was so close it looked as if it were going to land, so I slowed more. Not hearing any noise, I opened my window and noted that there was still no helicopter sound nor the strong gust of wind from the blades and there were no police cars around or sirens.  Realizing that it was not a helicopter, I quickly sped up as I passed underneath while looking back (sideview and rearview mirrors) I traveled about 40 yards, and it was gone. I then drove down and made a u-turn and looked back, nothing. I sped home, about 1/4 mile away and scanned the area, and nothing was there. I got my son&apos;s telescope from inside (about 30 seconds to get) and came out and surveyed the area especially in the direction of the police station where the copter is kept. No helicopter, no lights, nothing. ITS APPEARANCE: Since I was looking for it to be a helicopter, my description will not be that good.  I noted it was large but cannot give dimensions but I could appreciate that it was blocking out more sky than it was supposed to be.  It easily spanned 2 lanes and had height.  I recall a bright light and seem to recall three, but at the time, I thought it was the police with a searchlight so I focused on 1 light and where it was shining.  I only became suspicious after noting that neither it nor my surroundings were behaving consistent with a closely hovering helicopter and it was too big.  No trees were blowing either. visibility was clear.  No clouds.  It was behaving as if someone was steering it.  Were that not the case, it would have struck the tall trees or poles near it. Unusual movement:  Its movements were smooth and it moved side to side slightly. BTW I drive that way daily and looked for anything else that c! ould explain it.  I stand by my conclusion.  That&apos;s it.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was extremely bright with red, blue tones, and bright white lighted center. NOT AN AIRPLANE!", "cars in the sky?I am an avid watcher of the sky. Always listening and looking for aircraft, of the military kind. Living 65 miles East of Whiteman Air force base, I am fortunate to see a lot of aircraft day and night. On this particular night, it was clear with no wind, and warm enough to be out with a light jacket. I was standing on the upstairs porch when I noticed two stealth bombers flying slowly to my South heading East toward Whiteman. I glanced around and noticed what I thought to be a satellite making it&rsquo;s way across the night sky. That is when I realized it was heading directly toward me. It appeared to be a car with it&rsquo;s head lights on bright, heading North to South as it approached I could tell it was some sort of aircraft. While it was directly over me I noticed three greenish white lights in the shape of a triangle underneath the craft, rather close in formation, not at each wing. There were no other lights on the craft to help identify its shape. Once it pasted over me I could no longer see it, however there was a noise, like when the stealth is in silent mode and you hear the air moving across the wings, however unlike stealth, there was no initial rumble as it approached. Just as this craft made it&rsquo;s way on, I could feel a vibration, almost as if it were in my chest, not an external vibration. I looked up to see to aircraft one apparently winging for the other. They appeared to be large, larger than stealth the only light visible on these two craft very two small bluish lights on the underneath. These two craft were heading East to West. Not more than two seconds behind them were two stealth&rsquo;s&rsquo; (I feel I pretty good at identifying them with their two stationary lights on the back to wings.)  The two craft I could not identify seemed to vanish as I watched the stealth&rsquo;s tail them. Shortly after this sighting I noticed four aircraft to my North that appeared to be dog fighting and two more Stealth&rsquo;s heading in a Southeasterly direction. Nothing about these craft made me uneasy, no more than people felt when the Stealth was first made public. But I just wonder has anyone else seen the &lsquo;flying cars&rsquo; as I like to call them.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

About 20 degrees south of the full moon, I noticed a pulsating white light.  About one pulse every ten seconds.  It appeared to be in a vertical rotation, which is why I initially thought it was the beacon from nearby French Valley Airport.

Today, I finally realized that what I have always wanted to beleive is actually true.  My experience is plain and simple.  I was visiting my sister in Modesto, California.  My neices kept bugging me to take them out to the back yard where they have a swing set.  As I walked out, I saw to jets going by to the Northwest skies above the city.  I normally dont stop and stare at passing planes or jets, but this time I did.  As I saw these to jets criss cross each other at different altitudes of course, I stared at the contrails they left behind, when suddenly, to my amazement and out of nowhere, in the vicinity of approximately where these jets were going by, I focused my vision as best i could to this area of the sky because I noticed something strange.  At first, I thought it may have been some high flying birds but to my incredible amazement, I stared and focused my eyes as much as I could and clearly what my eyes saw was without mistake 5 spherical objects doing some kind of what I will call a dance in the sky.  These objects seemed grey in color and at times seemed to have a metalic shine to them.  They moved in a strange pattern, one in which I don have the words to explain. As I stared at the objects, without removing my eyes off of them, I yelled at my neice to call my sister, at the time, my sister had a call and was not able to get to where I was on time.  By the time she did step out to see what I was yelling about, just as suddenly as these spheres(for lack of better terms) appeared, they dissappeared from the sky.  I dont know what else to say or to write, but now, finally, I can relate to the thousands of people who see strange things in the sky, yet feel so alone with their experience, that they rather just keep it to themselves and go on with life as if nothing happened.  I stand before my God, who is my only witness of what I experience! d today, that what i have written here is the truth.  I dont know whats going on, or why, but something is going on in the skies above us.  We need to pay more attention to the sky, thats a lesson I learned today.

I had been pointing them out to my mother throughout the day.  My mother was with me, visiting from out of town.

It was around the size of a helicopter but had no tail or rotors, etc. I kept looking at it because it didn&rsquo;t move and was a shadowy disk shape with white lights around the edge.

The UFO was shining a large white light down from the center of the underside of the disk onto one of the box cars, as though it were inspecting it. The light was very wide, taking up the middle part of the underside of the UFO&mdash;maybe it was at least a 7-10ft. wide searchlight. It was illuminating an entire box car and part of another. I then noticed a third identical-looking UFO to my left in a grassy area right before the bridge. It was almost touching the ground, and it shown a bright white searchlight on the ground, too. (My truck was noisy, but I could not hear any noise from the UFOs). I passed under the railroad bridge, directly under the one UFO above it. I became excited and exited at Broad St. instead of Main St., which is where I was originally headed. As I was about to make a U-turn to get back onto 270, I saw yet a fourth identical UFO directly in front of me, but higher in the sky and further away, possibly 500 feet away. I made the U-turn and got back onto 270 and continued to Main St. I didn&apos;t try and go back the other way on 270 to take another look, because I would be late to an appointment. There were many cars on the freeway, so there had to be others who saw the UFOs.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

When it got closer, I noticed I couldn&apos;t hear it, it wasn&apos;t loud like a helicopter, and I couldn&apos;t make out it&apos;s shape. When it moved closer I saw three lights in a triangular pattern, 2 red and 1 white blinking randomly. I couldn&apos;t tell what side of the aircraft I was looking at because it was very dark, but the lights seemed to be in the center of whatever side I saw.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

We were talking and just looking at the stars when I noticed this odd formation of lights moving across the sky. There were three clusters moving together- the main cluster was a V shape and the two other clusters were slanted lines coming from the sides of the V&rsquo;s. They seemed to kind of float like a sting-ray would underwater. I pointed the lights out to my two friends. I pointed out that it was coming from where &ldquo;Area 51&rdquo; is supposed to be and one friend also pointed out that it was moving towards Nellis Air Force Base. Soon after, an airplane left McCarran airport and we compared the two. The UFO was completely silent and seemed to float and flutter while the airplane made a lot of noise and the body was completely visible. Both objects seemed to fly at the same pace and altitude. About a minute after the airplane went by, I noticed another UFO flying a very similar route as the first, except this UFO had no lights and was seemingly transparent. At times it was a dark brown/green color, but mostly the same shade as the night sky. When it flew over stars, it was more visible and the stars seemed to change a little bit. This UFO was going a bit faster than the first and was also completely silent. Unfortunately, only one friend noticed it when I pointed it out. Friend A, who saw both crafts, believed the first UFO was one object. I, however, believe the two smaller clusters (both made up of about 3 to 4 lights) were just flying extremely close to the main cluster- as if protecting. The cluster to the right seemed to be a little behind when I first noticed, then sped up a little- as if to catch up with the other two crafts. He hadn&apos;t seen it before that moment, but has researched UFOs for some time. Note: At my location, the routes of the crafts and of the airplane that left McCarran airport would intersect, making an X. Hence, they flew from and towards different directions.", "Do Satellites Stop then Change Directions?Saturday March 17th 2007 around 9:30pm give or take, I and two other people witnessed what we thought was a satellite tracking slowing across the nights sky. We watched this object (that looked like a small star) as it made its way across the sky, after about a minute, it came to a complete (or looked like a complete from our distance) stop in the sky, sat there for approx. 2 minutes then went in a 90degree different direction as we watched the object move in this new direction the light became dimmer and dimmer as if it was heading away from earth until it disappeared from our site. Is this possibly a type of satellite? Any explanation would be very appreciated, I have seen satellites before but never have seen one stop then switch directions. I am very interested in knowing what it is. Thanks.", "Large thin orange crescent with outline lights low in sky; changed size; possible mirage.Driving west after dark we saw a large, thin orange crescent low in the sky ahead of us.  At first we thought it might be the moon, but it was too large.  (Had watched the new moon and Venus, just after sunset, the previous night - the crescent we are reporting was much larger, appearing to be the outline of the bottom a very large circle. It grew larger, then smaller, then vanished.  There appeared to be indistinct small lights along  it, and a bright orange light near the tip of the crescent (on the right).We wonder about the possibility of a mirage, as the conditions were rather humid from melting snow, and there is a highway intersection several miles west of this location which is lighted by an orange light on a pole, on the right.  If this was a mirage, it seems to have been displaced to the south of the actual location of the intersection.", "This was taken in my back garden with a 30 shot in 5 seconds burst. 2 pictures out of 30 had this object in.I have an xda executive mobile phone with photo burst that takes 30 pictures in approximately 5 seconds.

As I looked at it I noticed it went from bright to dim, then it would go completely black and return to full brightness.I found this to be odd and alerted my two sons, my mother, and my husband.  I showed them this object in the sky to the west of our home.  We watched it for some time and noticed there were a couple of more objects, yet they were smaller in size and and were orange in color.

I was maybe 15 and 16 years old. A different friend saw it each year as well. Myself and a friend were hired to guard/watch the art festival tents for approx. 1 week, nights. We laid on the ground as this was the best position to look for possible intruders feet. Though there was some ambiant light, in the shadow of the tents we could still see the black night sky and stars well. An object that looked exactly the same, same size and glow of an Earth based satellite came into view at a slow rate of speed. There was no sound. It stopped, sped up, zig zagg&apos;d, loop de loop&apos;d, went strait, at varying  rates of speed, stopped short. Sometimes it covered from one side of the whole sky and beyond to the other in a split second. Most of the time it moved at an unearthly speed, I&apos;m guessingat least 20 times what a modern fighter jet would do. When it left for good, it accelerated in a strait line with building speed, compounding, at a rate that is indescribable and definitely not of our capibilities, strait out into space(as opposed to over the trees) It got noticeably smaller and was gone in parts of a second. I can&apos;t remember for sure if it left a trail or not as I have seen many Meteorites leave glowing Green etc. trails. My feeling is it did leave a trail but just on its final exit...it was long ago.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

However, my wife pointed out that the object was rapidly cycling through at least three colors: white, red, and green. The color cycle was not like that of an airplane or helicopter as it did not blink;  it was a fast swirling cycle that appeared to rotate clockwise over and over again.  Also, the object did not move at all in any direction, so it could not be an airplane. The chances of it being a hovering helicopter seemed slim since it did not move up or down or side to side for over an hour of observing it. The object was too high in the sky and too far away to be a light tower of any kind.I went inside and grabbed a pair of binoculars to get a better look, but the quality of the pair I was using was poor and all the best I could really make out was a bit of a closer look at the cycling of colors. They were moving very fast as I said, and I believe I could see some blue in addition to the red, green and white. I know nothing of UFOs &ndash; only what I&apos;ve seen on the Discovery channel, but this is certainly the first time I&rsquo;ve ever seen anything in the sky that I did not immediately recognize.

Knowing it was dark out I stepped out on deck just to see what I could (often seeing lights of other ships in the distance in these conditions.)  I presume the sky was hazy or partly cloudy as I could see only a few brighter stars.  The moon was not visible from my vantage point (I do not know its phase or position on the date.)  The horizon was very faintly visible as a just marginally brighter line above the sea. I don&rsquo;t know the heading of the ship but according to the passenger update log it would probably be somewhere between 110 Degrees and 70 Degrees.  No land lights were visible. Three stars/lights did slightly stand out as they formed a triangle with two of the lights in a roughly horizontal line with the third lower and to the right.  The separation of the top two lights was roughly 1 degree.  The third light was roughly 2 degrees to the lower right.  I am estimating these distances by mental reference to the size of a full moon &ndash; one half subtended degree.  The center of this triangle was about 10-15 degrees above the horizon and about 45 degrees to the rear of the direction of travel of the ship. As I looked at these three lights for about 10 seconds, I perceived that the upper left and lower right lights were faintly orange in color while the upper right one was white.  The white one was a clear point, as would be expected when viewing a star, and as other stars visible at the time appeared.  The two orange lights appeared slightly fuzzy.  Focusing my attention to these orange lights I noticed that they actually appeared brighter in the center with areas to the sides that appeared to &ldquo;flutter&rdquo; and very rapidly change intensity from dim to almost as bright as the center.  This total width of light was no more than one quarter degree.  This same &ldquo;fluttering&rdquo;  effect was not visible above or below the center of the light. My first notion was that they appeared to be helicopters, in that you can see a center mass and perceive the rotor as a &ldquo;fluttering&rdquo; change in intensity to the sides.  This is a description of the appearance only; there was no sound and there were no navigation or marker lights, and helicopters probably wouldn&rsquo;t be glowing orange. After seeing the three lights in position for no more than 10 seconds total, the two orange lights began moving to the left, relative to the white point star which did not move.  The few other white point stars visible did not move either (i.e., the ship was not turning.)  Over a total period of around 30 seconds that these orange lights moved, the top one moved roughly horizontally to a position roughly 45 degrees to the front of the ship.  During that movement it did dip slightly in apparent altitude when it was about 90 degrees off the side of the ship.  The other light also moved at the same time as the first but its movement was independent of the first.  It first moved slightly down and to the left, then rose slightly and then continued horizontally to the left.  When it was almost 90 degrees to the side of the ship it dipped slightly and then rose to the same height as the first light.  It &ldquo;followed&rdquo; the first light for a second of two and then dropped slightly, all the while moving to the left. When these lights both reached the position approximately 45 degrees to the front of the ship they both faded out and I lost further sight of them. To reiterate, I could not tell the exact atmospheric conditions during this sighting but there were maybe 25 visible stars in my field of vision.  These were white points of light that did not move relative to the ship or to each other during the time I saw the orange lights, which did move both relative to the visible stars and to each other.  Although they did move together and at the same time, the movement of the orange lights varied in speed and in altitude relative to each other, the other visible stars and to the horizon. They were stationary for about 10 seconds and moved for about 30 seconds before disappearing.  The lower of the two lights moved a greater distance than the top one and therefore moved faster as they both started moving at the same time and disappeared from view at the same time with about the same distance separation.", "accident happend at arabian country, Jordan  all we remember that the time stop.  we lookin around .we find something not clear ..but after this ,the i.q for me increase without reason. we are arabian and muslim too,we was shock from this..my friends who was with me ,his hair convert to white . because we are doctors ,we make blood check ,we find that hb% reach more than 17.5 above normal by 1 point.iron deposition in the skin make to us scar on the skin. we are 3 three person ,remember that we was inside hole ,and this hole was greenish. this what i remember at this accident. we hidden this story because if we was talking the people about that ,they will think that we are crazy people. anyway ,this condition make us ,reach high i.q ..we are happy from this. above we answer that we seen two craft,believe me ,no airplane on the earth has the same shap from what we seen it. please we dont need contact from anybody ,please accept my apologize from this. we are physician at now ,we would not make any body know this story because this make us like stupiod people between my community in the past. anyway ,in my religion book,the god said that there people before us was on the earth. not at space ,and those people came from the sea.this what we believe here.but not all the people here. thanks to hear my story.((NUFORC Note:  We cannot confirm that the report was submitted from Jordan.

There was likely less than 1,000 feet of distance between them at the nearest point. At the &quot;cross-over point&quot; the #1 craft (ufo?) was seen to only have RED lights...whereas the #2 craft was a normally appearing/sounding plane. At this point the plane veered swiftly left as if to &quot;chase&quot; the #1 object. The #1 (ufo?) proceeded into a left (West) turn and was closely followed by the #2 craft (plane). The plane was never able to &quot;catch&quot; the #1 object but seemed to stay in trail by perhaps a distance of 1,000 feet. They continued in a West-Northwest direction till out of sight. I observed the objects with a small pair of binoculars and could readily ID the #2 craft as a light plane, but could NOT do so with the #1 object. All I saw on the #1 craft was RED lights EXCEPT for one instant when I observed a WHITE light at the rear as it was moving West away from me. I just had a &quot;feeling&quot; that the #2 aircraft had just taken off from Orlando Executive Airport and saw the &quot;unknown&quot; &amp; recognized it as such and decided suddenly to try and get closer to get a better look. Hope I&apos;m not being out of line for &quot;reporting&quot; this incident...but it just had that sense of &quot;unusual&quot; that made me wonder.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Pilchuck and then the old Ski Slope lights in the background. This disk shaped craft displaying bright yellowish / white portals (rectangular shape) windows. These windows were quite visable of the 180 degree  facia of the upper portion of the craft. What made this craft unusual was extending from each side of the  diameter of the craft were circurlar tubes. At the end of these tubes or conduits were as it appeared  round balls.  Much like a vertical lolly pop stick infused into the candy ball.This craft appeared to my brother and I as if it were a transport or research craft.from these round balls extended from the craft one could quite clearly see colored red,green,white colored objects flowing to the ground. These objects were round in dimension. From the bottom of the craft flowing to the ground were streams of gaseoues like colors, green.red,blue.  This activity lasted for about one hour.During this time of activity this craft made vertical and horizontal movements from slow to very raid speeds.  After the  decending colored objects from the balls stopped, the lighting from the portals became much brighter for about 15 minutes from what I belive was the cabin lights of this craft. Shortly after the powering up of the light intensity This craft went from a very staionary position a rapid speed I have nver seen in my life out over Mt. Pilchuck beyond the cascade Mountian range in about two seconds or less acending into the Stars.Much to my amazement, the following day at High School I gave a report of this incident to my Home Class.

As I came to the end od the trial about 300 yards to where it meets the San Francisco bay, I saw 2 figures and a large object out of the corner of my eye to my right about 200 yards away. Occasionally I am looking down at the gravel road as I am riding and as I began to look up I saw the figures. This startled me, causing me to veer into thick gravel and look away from the figures as I tried to regain control. I quickly came to a stop and looked to my right just as the figures which appeared to be looking at me turned away and began walking away as they suddenly became translucent and faded away. Immediately afterwards the large object that was about 50 feet in length which I had not focused on also became translucent and faded away.  All of this occurred in 5 seconds or less. I do wear prescription glasses, I am near sighted, I did not have them on and I am not required to wear them while driving. I tried to focus to see if I could still see them again but I did not. I then began to look around me as I sensed a presence near me. This spooked me and I quickly got back on my bike and began to peddle away towards the bay. I stopped about half way and began looking around again, but saw and sensed nothing. I then went to the end of the trail and waited there probably 15 minutes and was spooked again by what sounded like foots steps on the gravel.

I believe I had seen 3 UFOs in my life, 1 of which occurred on the Menlo Park side of the Dumbarton Bridge around the time and before the lights sighted by many in Phoenix Arizona in 1997.

I was headed to feed my horse (which is approximately a 20 minute drive).  It was a nice drive, the skies were clear with possibly a few higher clouds in the sky, but you could still see the stars.  I can&rsquo;t recall if it was a full moon or not, but I know the moon was bright.The barn is in the back of a subdivision, at the end of a dirt road about a mile off the main road of the subdivision, backing up against a pipeline. The road is barely wide enough for 2 cars to pass one another in certain places. We had received a lot of rain in the past 2 weeks, so the road was well worn with large holes from the rain, as well as from the 18 wheelers that traveled the road headed for the M.U.D. maintenance facility near the barn.  Traveling the road in its condition, along with the deer that cross the road at all hours, at a pace of 10 miles per hour was the fastest, safest speed you could travel on this night.About halfway down the road (headed toward the barn), I started getting a strange feeling I was being watched. (I have had these feelings before, but just played it off in the past as though it was the horses or deer watching me.) Being how is was dark, I was alone (with my 6 year old son), and the barn is in an isolated area, I hurried to get the horse fed. It couldn&rsquo;t have taken more than 10 minutes to fill his water bucket and give him his grain and hay. I locked the gate and headed back down the road towards the main street.As soon as I came around a curve, I noticed 2 red dots about 5 &frac12; or 6 feet from the ground in the trees. My first though was it was an opossom sitting on a limb of a tree. I kept my eye on them because I couldn&rsquo;t fiqure out why its eyes were so red. They were bright, bright red and had a glow to them. As I got closer I realized they were teardrop shaped and way too big to be an oppossom. The closer I got, I could see a silhouette of a being. Thinking it was a person standing there, I tried to see if I could recognize the person wondering why he was in the area so late. The body was very skinny, very dark grey or black in color with a very small pot-belly. It wore no clothing. Its hands didn&rsquo;t seem to have any fingers, although it had a thumb-like appendage. The harder I stared at its face trying to make out any facial features, the less I could see. The face, although I could see the body perfectly, was very cloudy and continued to blur the harder I tried to see anything. The only movement I observed was the movement of the face/head as I passed it. It made no sound.As I rounded the next corner I stopped my car and put it in reverse, intending on backing up to take another look at what I had seen. I looked at the display clock on my dash and it read 12:30 am. It should have been reading no later than 10:35 or 10:40 pm. I put my car back in drive and left.The next day I was joking with my 14 year old son about what I had seen, never really thinking twice about it. Later that evening when I went to feed my horse he wouldn&rsquo;t have anything to do with me. He went to the very back of his stall and would not come near me even when I put out his feed.

There was not a cloud to be seen at that time. They were a little large than our largest planet. I thought it was strange they were so close together. All at once, one sped away at a very fast speed horizontally from the other. The other one just stayed there in it&apos;s place, not moving at all. As I drove from the bank I watched the one object that was there until the trees, of course, hid it and I could no longer see it.", "A moving array of tiny lights past the sky centre line south to north, sighted four times with 2-3 minutes interval.Event Description: During Casual gazing at the stars on 13th May 2007 night (Time  around 9:40pm) (while lying on the flat terrace (third floor) and looking at the sky upwards), i suddenly noticed a set of faint light moving uniformly in one direction, from south direction to north direction. The view was pretty faint, and had i observed it alone, i would have definitely ignored it as my illusion. However, i immediately asked my wife to look at by pointing the direction, and she too spotted it. We both agreed it cannot be a illusion, but however slightly differed in its description: I felt it was two lights moving side-by-side in that direction and with the gaps between narrowing down while my wife&apos;s described it rather as an v-shaped line (of lights!). We were wondering about it for some time, and then ignored it and were talking on some other topic. After maybe 2-3 minutes, we once again noticed a similar movement of lights, in the same direction. This time, we noticed at the fag end of its transition across the sky, and atleast i could not remember clearly its features, felt it to be haphazard collection of moving lights. Again, we had a disagreement on its features: i noted it be a haphazard set of may be 10 white tiny lights (like a star constellation) while my wife once again described it as an V-line formation. Actually, its movement was steady, going straight from south direction passing very nearly to the sky centre line and towards north direction. The entire crossing, i guess would have happened in 3-4 seconds. The object, or the thing could be sighted only over the center portion of the sky, and seems to be fading in the background over the horizon, as the sky was brighter (probably due to city lights) at (about less than 30 degree) horizon compared to the centre. I was casually mentioning what we are seeing could be similar to the many mysterious UFO&apos;s reported but not proven kind of stuff discussed in the science/science fiction TV programmes and other media. Once again, we! spotted for third time after maybe about 2-3 minutes, a similar moving object (by now, it become befitting to be called an object!), again moving in the same direction and in a similar way. After the 3rd sighting, we become alert and probed for the sky for any more such sighting. i was wondering whether it is the same object passing through the sky again and again, or if these were separate objects travelling one after the other. i told myself that i would be alert enough to focus on the movement and get a good glimpse of its features, if i see it next time. And yes, we witnessed the flying object for the fourth time, again may be after 2-3 minutes, a similar moving set of steady lights. This time, i agreed with my wife on its features. It was a V-formation of lights. My rough estimate for the angle between lines of the V would be 140 degrees!. The V-pattern was moving with its centre pivot at the front and V arrow itself pointing towards the direction of its movement. The angular distance of the object, i would put it to be around 3 degrees. We were thrilled at these sightings and hoped would to see fee more. I stargazed for another 30 minutes before giving up and we left to go to sleep. I was conviced that it was indeed an unusual event and said to myself to mark this day as memorable day of my life, lest i ignore and forget it just like those fading movement of light objects. I decided to check websites on UFO&apos;s and report my sightings, for a general benefit. As a responsible person, i thought i should inform and record this event, so that if any/more persons sighted this like us, it would become befitting enough to do investigation and get some meaningful explanation. But, onething is for sure: If somebody else observed it and tells me what he/she saw, i would not have taken it seriously and most definitely ignored it, thinking that person has made somehow misjudged a simple plane as an UFO; And that people have enough personal problems to worry about, than these bizarre movements in the sky. That&apos;s why i d! id not w ant to make a big fuss about what i saw to all the people i meet, and getting branded as an paranoid/cracknut. Instead, i have just put down all my (sincere) observations on the event in this UFO observation site, due to my own curiosity to know what i saw, and probably aid the concerned person/investigator/other UFO viewers, to make sense of these UFO&apos;s. I sincerely hope that myself and my wife were not the only one who witnessed this, and somehow a good number of people have also watched this particular event, so that it is not discounted as an not-strong enough, isolated, ignorable event. I am not a big advocator of UFO sightings or theories on it. I am not a person who collects information about UFO&apos;s reproted by people, but rather know it as only among one of the many interesting news/documentary reported in the TV channel like discovery. Infact, i never got curious enough to know about it by searching/browing the websites. I do not know if what i saw is qualified to be called as an UFO. But all the same, i am listing down, what is so unusual about what i saw that makes it un-ignorable (atleast to me) and curious:  * The object could not be a Plane: I have never seen a plane to be shaped like array of lights lined a arrow shape. But, for my fourth sighting, i would not even consider as and line of lights, but rather a haphazard collection of of lights, in which case would definitely not fit as the lights from the some human-plane. There was no sound heard, but still flew past pretty swiftly. Thus, it could not be just an conventional plane travelling too on ground making it seem to be flying fast(as in which case some sound should have been definitely heard for such low heights). I believe that it could not be a high flying plane (whose sound could not be heard), as i intuitively feel the plane would have to travel at indeed a unbelievably high speed for it transcend the sky in 3-4 seconds. * It could not be a meteorite: My first observation as two tiny lights moving together could have probably taken as just a meteorite or shooting stars. Okay, even my second view as a collection of lights like a star constellation, again could have discounted simply as travelling of multiple number of meteorite rocks. But, i cannot definitelty take my final sighting of an well arranged V-array of lights simply as falling meteorites. And also, will meteorites travel in such a periodic manner (every 2-3 minutes) and also in exactly same direction and followint the same path int he sky!!? And also, the lights were not accelerating, were tending to move straight with a steady speed, and no brightening or burning out kind of movement. And the lights were uniformly light (can it be parallel set of uniformlly lit shooting stars??, very unlikely.). * Array Movement: Based on the pattern of lights alone, the closest thing that i can associate it is an beautiful V-shaped arrangement formed by a  flock of migratory birds. But again, what is disturbing with this description is: The pattern was too geometrically spaced and uniformly moving for it be considered as an natural phenomena; and how come these birds are flying so fast, and why are they carrying tiny lights with them?  My only logical deduction of what i observed based on my own personal experience (ignoring all about UFO reported by others), would be, that it is either a specially designed human made flying object, possibly a secretive (military or otherwise) vehicle, concealed from the purview of general public. Or, it is an mysterious flying object unproved and unknown to humans. Or it could be just chance of a chance of a chance occurence of simultaneous hallucination of myself and my wife, and that too for concurrently 4 times, and sharing more or less the similar hallucination of moving lights in the same path!!!  And now thinking about it, may be it possible to give a even simpler explanation. It is simply an low flying kids plane toy or similar such stuff, moving with no sound, with its faint tiny lights. Or, could it by flying light emitting insect, but then again flying so uniformly arranged, hmmmm hard to believe. So, this is an sighting whose origin is not known to me now, and possibly i may never be able to know for sure.", "Very large, and very intense light in clear dark night sky moving erratically and appeared to have landed.For Web Posting address name and names removed  UFO Visual Siting  Date:  June 5, 2007 Time:  Approximately 11:30 PM first visual.Location:  River Road and Hwy 170 4 miles west of Colfax, WI 54730 Weather Conditions:  Clear with wisps of clouds to west, Temp. about 50 deg. F, no wind or breeze, and no moon; very dark.My state of physiological/psychological condition:  Tired from working but attentive nevertheless, no drugs or alcohol or medications.What I saw:  Very intense white light (sometimes red flickers) with a large orb ranging from about 2 &ndash; 7 millimeters across at line of site.Commentary:  At about 11:30 PM Tuesday night June 5, 2007 I went outside to start my vehicle. I use the vehicle headlights to illuminate the front door while locking the office on particular dark nights. Looking immediately west I noticed what appeared to be the landing lights of an aircraft approaching the Eau Claire airport.  Note, the office is right under a normal flight path for Northwest Airline flights coming from the Twin Cities and it is very common to see the landing lights used on their approaches to Eau Claire.  In any case I attributed the exceptionally bright light to that of an aircraft on approach.  The light was due west at an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 feet in altitude and coming slowly east on a trajectory that would have put it right over the office on River Road in less than a minute.  I watched it for a few seconds and did not see anything out of the ordinary but I did notice there was no sound coming from the area of the light.  With approaching aircraft it is normal to hear them a minute before one is able to make a visual.  But it was late, I was tired, and I thought nothing more of it until I started my drive home it seemed to alter its course rapidly.  Leaving east out of the driveway the object essentially stopped for a brief second or two and changed course to north-northwest course and began lowering in altitude.  I turned north on a cut-off road to Highway 170 and watched as the craft moved slowly northwest and dropped in altitude on slightly as it was still much higher than the surrounding hills.  I turned west on Hwy 170 and watched the craft moving in the direction towards the Wheeler radio tower.  Total drive of about 2 miles and a time of about 4 minutes.  As I turned into my house driveway I lost site of the object behind a row of tall pine trees and a hill.  I entered my house, scrambled for a few minutes tying to find a pair of binoculars &ndash; to no avail.  So I got my girlfriend to come with out in the field to see if we could locate the object.  As we rounded the blocking hill we easily made visual contact with the craft again.  At this time the light was farther away but still very bright and more red flickering taking place.  The location appeared to be slightly sou! th of th e radio tower and about 1,000 to 2,000 feet higher than the top of the tower (the tower is about 1,000 ft.).  I must qualify that the craft appeared to be near the tower, it could have been farther west of the tower but it more likely was nearby.  As we watched for several minutes it appeared as if it was not moving.  Then it decided to start slowly lowering sometimes straight down and sometimes with erratic zigzag patterns.  Eventually it was at the same height reference of the Wheeler tower and stayed there for a few minutes.  Then it started to lower again and this time it moved slightly more north in what appeared to be very close proximity to the tower itself. Eventually it dropped to a point where we could only see it at random through trees and hills.  In the last few minutes of visual it seemed as though the object was on the ground moving around between trees.  The motions as it was on, or near, the ground were slightly erratic and we had to shift positions frequently to keep it in sight.  Finally about midnight or slightly after we lost all visual sight. Her and I watched the light for about 15 to 20 minutes.  Short of the time I lost sight in my driveway and was looking for the binoculars I was able to watch the craft for about 25 to 30 minutes total time. Shortly after midnight we  took a drive to the radio tower location.  There were several households with lights on in the immediate vicinity of the radio tower.  We do not know if these people were awake, or saw something, or whatever but we did not stop to ask for fear of being ridiculed. Neither my girlfriend nor myself can explain what it was but we do know for an absolute fact we watched something very strange.", "30/05/07 sedona AZ 1200 hrs, clinder red and white, seen for seconds, 2 pictures takento whom it may concern  on may 30/07 at approx 1200 hours in sedona AZ at the site seeing &apos;&apos;church&apos;&apos; along with my witness i took two pictures only feet apart as well as only seconds apart. in the one picture there is a red and white cylinder shaped object in one picture and not in the other picture. it was red at each end and white in the middle. i don&apos;t recall hearing any sound at this time.the town of sedona is in the background", "flying object in sacramentoI saw a rectangular, relatively flat object less than three sq meters Hovering above me.  Initially I saw it about 1500 feet. It was constantly alternating between flat to a three dimenisional x shape. (the shape changing appeared to give it lift).  As it flew away from me it gained in altitude, never going over 2500 ft.  As it got further away, it was impossible to see when it was in the 3-d x configuration.  The object was grey/black. There was no sound to the object. I have worked in the aviation field for years, definitely not a kite, weather balloon, or any other mis. item.  This gave me an ingenious idea to create lift, I will try to reproduce.", "Multi colored object(s) and one object emitting white light only in the Far West Mesa areaA full moon on this particular night, it was in the SE to my location.  I live on the very western edge of the city and further off to the west is where I observed the object(s).  If I had to give a point of reference, I&rsquo;d say it/they were over the Rio Puerco (so 7-10 miles west of my location?) area and heading west, but very slowly. About 9:45 I was in my side yard which faces west.  I looked up to see an object with several flashing colors of light (red, blue, yellow, green).  It wasn&rsquo;t moving.  I ran into the house to get a pair of binoculaurs.  Through them I could see the colors better and a faint outline of the object (disk/circular).  It wasn&rsquo;t a helicopter, no noise, either.  The sunlight was very very faint on the western horizon, and the full moon light on the opposite side of the sky almost &lsquo;helped&rsquo; it stay undetected, if it were not for the flashing colors.  I stayed there watching it for about twenty minutes as it just stayed in place.  Then my partnere came home and I walked inside to tell him what I had seen.  He came outside with me and looked into the sky.  Now there were two of those objects, a bit farther away now, but in close proximity to each other.  It looked like one was going towards the other.  Now, I looked NW and close to the horizon and saw a white light in the sky, not moving.  It could have been a weather balloon, but they usually are seen because the sunlight is reflected off them.  About 5 minutes later, there appeared another of these multi-colored lights N/NW of the white light (the other two are due S of these, still hovering, though they appeared to have moved further west).  This was looked like it was farther/smaller but moving towards the white light.  At one point it looked like it was going to meet up with the white light, but then we saw what could have been an aircraft with identifiable red blinking light trying to &apos;catch up&apos; to it (jet fighter?) but then this multi-colored object began to retrace it&rsquo;s path (no wide turning as would an airplan! e), stra ight line towards the white light object, straight line back. The (jet?) aircraft moved away from both. By this time I realized that there were no commercial airplanes coming in from the west, like we usually see.  The white light object went over the horizon and disappeared.  The 3rd multi colored object kept going N/NE until we couldn&apos;t see it anymore.  The original two objects moved slowly west, but I couldn&rsquo;t determine if they were moving up in altitude or just further away.  After about 40 minutes, we saw several planes begin to emerge from the north (not their usual flight path, especially, not directly over our part of the city).  Through the binoculaurs we could see that they were commercial aircraft.", "Round object with colored lights disappears instantlyMy Dad, my sister, our dog and I went out to the mailbox, probably early evening.  I specifically remember the three of us looking up and seeing a round object with all different colored lights that went round and round on the bottom of it.  It seemed very high up in the sky.  I have no idea how long it was there.  I think only a minute or two, probably.  Anyway, it was there and then it just disappeared in an instant.  Not even a helicopter could have disappeared that fast.  I remember us all wondering what it was and how it could disappear so fast.I asked my older sister about this a couple years ago to see if she remembered that happening.  She told me that she did remember, that it had happened, and that Dad had been pretty freaked out by it.  She told me that he had watched the news for a couple weeks after that wondering what it was.  There must not have been any reports though that she remembers.Anyway, I can only guess the year to be between 1967-1970.  I must have only been 7 or 8 at the time.  I estimate this because my Dad died of Muscular Dystrophy in &rsquo;72, and at the time this happened, he was still healthy enough to be walking.  I was hoping to find other reports on your site, but didn&rsquo;t.  Therefore, the exact year is unknown.  I&rsquo;d be interested to see if anyone else saw and maybe what year, if they remember.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I am a trained weather spotter of 20 years and was atop on of the higher hills in the area watching a front moving through to the south and east of my location. At the moment of this incident there was about 50% cloud cover and a significant storm in progress to the south and east. While looking to the west and south I noticed a bright light which I assumed to be collision lights. After about 2 minutes the light had gained speed and lowered its altitude. Assuming I correctly identified landmarks it flew past it was possibly 4 miles out. The object moved to an alitude of tree level no more than 60 feet off the ground following the contours of the pasture directly west of my position. At this point I gauged the approximate diameter of this object at 50 yards. The object had a fixed but irregular shape, resembling in my mind a fried egg. There was a semblance of a dome atop the object. This object was luminescent; best described as mother of pearl. The object made no noise, neitther in motion or stationary. The object stopped about 100 or so yards short of SW 100th Street. There appeared to be a small unlit object in the creekbed below the object. There was movement, but I could only see movement with the occasional lighting from the southeast. If I had to guess it appeared to be something that looked like a jack in the box toy. A square object with a long curving appendage and what looked like a ice cream scoop atop the appendage. Although the lighting was poor I could discern it  moving about the area, but it was difficult to see if the object was on the ground, on wheels, or otherwise. This event happened in about 5 minutes time. The object then rose up to approx. 200 feet (?) There was a shrill sound from the pasture (sounded like nails on chalkboard) and was an uncomfortble sensation. The object moved away slowly at first and seemed to gain speed as it moved off to the north and then back west again. I was ! admitedl y frightened and left the area immediately.

My daughter joked that perhaps we would see a UFO since I had spotted some unknown object(s) in the sky at the same place, roughly two years ago, when we&apos;d been flying kites. It, unfortunately, has become a family joke.  As we sat under the trees, she joked about some flying insects being UFOs and pointed to a passing jet or two. After a minute or so, she pointed and said, &quot;What is that white ball following that jet?&quot; I looked at the commercial jet that was flying overhead, and there was what appeared to be a ball of white vapor alongside the jet&apos;s vapor trail.  This ball of what appeared to be white smoke or vapor was about the same width as the jet itself, or perhaps a little wider.  The odd thing was that this ball appeared to be following the jet. It did not stay stationary in the sky as if it were just part of the vapor trail. Instead, it followed alongside the vapor trail behind the jet, traveling at what appeared to be the same speed as the jet, maintaining a constant distance. We both stood up and walked out from under the trees to watch this object follow the jet until they both disappeared into the distance and out of view in the western sky. We were facing east when the jet and object were approaching, heading west.

I continued driving and notice on my right a very bright star. I pulled my car over and took my cell phone and opened and closed it as though to send a signal. In return the star expanded like a big ball of white light and I got excited and phoned a relative as I was talking on the phone it had moved to the left traveling and can see a red light at the side of it. I then parked my car in the garage and walk out of the garage and facing me was that bright star as I was walking towards my apartment the star expanded as though it was getting closer and I was talking to my sister about the situation, then I panicked and it went back to normal and it started to travel south. I decided to look out my door and saw the bright star again and said that is enough for tonight.", "9 witnesses to several disk shaped aircraft in the night sky.The persons who first noticed the ufo&apos;s were looking at the western sky trying to watch the meteor showers.  When they looked up they noticed what appeared to be stars, yet these were not on any map that we had ever seen.  These &quot;stars&quot; had intense flashes of yellow green red and blue, and seemed to be stationary at the time.  Three of us saw blue lights shooting from one &quot;star&quot; to the other.  Upon further monitoring with binoculars we discovered that the stars were infact moving at rapid speeds, faster then any plane that any of the nine people had ever seen.  Also these &quot;stars&quot; looked like round disks through the binoculars. Once looking through the binoculars an older member of our group estimated the disks to be around 15 miles away. The disks themselves were a gray or silver color.  After about 30 minutes of looking to the western sky we noticed that there were more of these disks above us and to the east, in all totaling around 8 disks.  About an hour later the disks then began to move to the east.  What was also strange was that even though these objects were moving we heard no sound.  Also through the entire event we did not see any planes. I mention this because we usually see planes headed to Lambert International Airport in Saint Louis.  One of us called a relative who lives in Saint Louis and asked if they could see the disks and he confirmed seeing the same thing.  All in all we are a family who loves nature and star gazes often.  Some of us are extremly well educated and some of us know alot about the planets and stars.  By far this was the strangest thing anyone of us had ever seen.  But one thing is certain we all saw the same thing.", "UFO sighting in Bellingham, WATonight I was looking up at the stars in my backyard and saw a very bright star.When I looked more closely at it I noticed several green beams coming out of the bottom of this &quot;star.&quot; I stared at it for about 5 minutes and relized this wasnt a star. I then woke up my husband to look at it with me.The UFO was far away but was moving a bit back and forth. At one time it started to move forwards towards us and we got scared and went into the house.I could still see it from my window and the green beams were moving and blinking from the UFO. I watched it until it started to almost blink off and on and moved farther away. Then after a few more blinks it just disappeared.I looked for it again all over the sky, but didn&apos;t see it, so it was just gone.I&apos;m a &quot;normal&quot; person 37 years old with a husband and 2 children and never thought twice about UFOs.

Thank you", "big, glowing, slow , red comet-like fireball  with a  tail that slowly stretched accross the sky, and took forever to slowly fade awayIt was already dark outside. It was the year 1998 in San Angelo, Texas. I went outside  because there was nothing to do inside. When I looked in the sky I saw a very big glowing red glowing fireball moving accross the sky with no sound. The moon was out too, it looked about a little smaller than the moon, it was big. The fire ball had a really long tail connected trailing behing it. As the ball continued to move accross at a really slow pace,  about the same speed  and height as a plane moves accross the sky, this was no plane though it looked like a big comet or meteor.  I have never seen any thing like that before, and I&apos;ve seen a few comets and meteors. AS the ball moved accross the sky, the tail stayed glowing red and stretched accross the sky as far as I could see.  I wanted to call my mom who was asleep at the time inside.  But I didnt want to wake her.It lasted about an hour, the tail stayed lit a little longer after the ball kept going out of sight.  The tail just faded away real slowly afterwards.  I could tell it looked like it wasn&apos;t falling down to Earth, it just kind of looked like it kept going around the world.  I looked for some pictures on the net of what it looked like but found nothing.  IT looked like a comet but alot bigger and closer.  Pluse it was red and glowing, not blue.  I thought it might have been a spaceshuttle taking off but now I have seen how they take off, strait up in the air not accross the sky.  To this day I dont know what it was.  I have never seen it again I dont think it was an alien thing or nothing like that, just a UFO.  This is the truth, if anyone else has seen anything the same please say something.  I&apos;m just trying to figure out what it was. This was in south side San Angelo around 1997 and 1998.  I was in an urban area so someone else had to have seen it.", "7 craft appeared in the SE bright sunny day lit sky over Oregon, looked like white planets, moved slowly and gradually disappeared.Monday, Memorial Day - May 28, 2007, Portland, OR, USA At about/between 18:30 to 19:00 PST, I looked up into the bright clear sunny sky, above the waxing daylit moon (full on 5/31/07) and saw what appeared to be stars or planets in the S/SE, but I knew they couldn&apos;t be stars or planets - invisible in daylit sky.  The sun was still at least an hour or so from setting. I thought they might be satellites, but they were not moving in the fast, straight orbit pattern of satellites.  They were fairly bright (white light, like metal reflecting sun), and I realized they must be craft of some sort in the high earth atmosphere realm, either going out to space or returning.  Definitely not airplanes, they appeared to be flying above aircraft altitude and were not blinking or moving in the straight pattern as airplanes.  They were circular in shape and exactly the size of stars/planets to my relative view.  They were about 20 degrees up from the horizon in the S/SE section of sky over SE Portland. There were six to seven of them covering about a 10 - 15 degree area across the sky in roughly the same plane/area across the sky just above and to the right of the moon, but they were not moving in formation nor were they evenly spaced.  The three on the left side were in a triangular/Cassiopeia-like space and formation, and the others to the right were in more horizontal formation, but not exactly a straight line.  They all moved as if they were flying, but slow, not like a plane.  It was regular/straight-ish movement, as human/craft (plane, car, ship, people) would move.  It didn&apos;t in any way seem alien or weird.  They simply looked like six human craft. They remained in roughly the same area in the sky, although they were moving a little bit in relation to each other, like if you&apos;re watching 7 people or animals in a group walking or hanging out. When I first had looked up, I saw three bright ones and then the few fainter ones to the right became brighter.  A seventh moved in from faint to bright into the same realm and then back faint again.  They were visible in the sky for about 10 or 20 or more minutes, and then gradually they all became fainter and fainter and disappeared into the sky as they came, like craft flying out to space from the earth atmosphere.

My father and I saw it as it traveled over our house (and shook it quite violently).  It had a very low-pitched roar, rather dissimalar than a helicopter&apos;s - it was more like the noise you would hear from a quake, and for its size it was moving at an alarmingly low velocity and altitude.I have no idea what this was, but I can vouch for its existence.

Of course, by the time I got the camera set up they had disappeared, but I did get a look at them through the binoculars. According to one of my friends there was originally 6 objects in the northern sky which slowly moved and faded away. I did not see these six. Not long after they returned in the south western sky, this time there was only three. They were distinctly orange in colour, about magnitude 0 in brightness. First of all they were in a line but then they slowly moved into a sort of L formation and then disappeared one at a time. Through the binoculars all that could be seen were three orange lights. Akin to the colour of a flame. The three lights covered an area of sky of about the width of the W of Cassiopeia. I&apos;ve never seen anything like it in my life, truly strange.

When we were approaching the Tobaggan Rd./Towerline Rd. intersection, we both seen a light in the sky that must have been quite a few miles away, it resembled a star because of the distance, but something tells me it was an airplane or some type of object. We seen this object fall very quickly, it didn&rsquo;t fall in the blink of an eye, however; it fell gradually but quick.  This object was south east of Towerline Rd.The strangest part of this is that after we seen the object falling all of sudden it disappeared without any big light (sign of explosion) or trace- it didn&rsquo;t fade away whatsoever, it just completely disappeared.

My little brother and sister also saw what I was seeing, even the shooting particles from one light to the other, and the fast, jerky movement of both lights. The lights also started making these really short acting white lights around it.

This thing dropped down (rapidly) from above (my left-hand side, approx 20 degrees to west of north) and stopped completely still about 1km up (judging from the angle with the ground, I&apos;m still not entirely sure about its distance away from me) . It sat there stopped for about 30 seconds ( it was not getting any closer or moving directly towards or away from me, it just sat there with constant size) then started to move very slowly towards the east (my right hand side) it moved far too slowly to be any aircraft. I stopped the car and turned the lights/radio and everything off, I just did not want to get any closer to it. It was directly in front of me. I thought of reversing but didn&apos;t want to make a sound or any movement to attract attention. It blotted out the stars behind it as it moved (approx 10-20 degrees of my field of vision). It moved in a snake trail path for about a minute and appeared to alter altitude slightly upwards then back down again. It had external red and blue lights and it turned away (swiveled/rotated anticlockwise) to face away from me before moving away.  I am still not sure of its shape as it had red and blue lights/glowing on the bottom and some light around the edge/upper section, the lights on the bottom trailing edge partially disappeared as the upper ones appeared, but the top part blotted out the stars behind as though it had a very large and tall bulge on top, so I am assuming it had a far greater profile width wise than height (ratio wise) as it turned/leaned/sloped slightly in the movement  . When it finally left it flew off very rapidly towards the northeast/north-north east, and appeared to drop down closer to the ground in a hurry.  It made absolutely no sound at all at any time. There were no clouds, the air was still and cold, town is 30-35 km away, down hill and more to the right of this thing so its not a reflection on warm/cold air as the angles are all wrong.

I looked out the window and saw a bright &apos;star&apos;. &quot;I&apos;d wish on you but you&apos;re probably just a satalite or an airplane&quot; I thought to myself, since there is an airport between Kimbeley and Cranbrook. The light was very bright and so I watched it for a moment. Before long I noticed some faint spark-like spray coming from the bottom of the light, like the way a boat cuts through water in a triange behind a boat. Slightly alarmed, I thought I might be witnessing a plane in trouble. The light didn&apos;t behave like a plane, it just hovered, then moved in a slight circular formation. I almost felt like it was looking back at me! My heart pounding, I moved behind the window frame out of view. When I looked back I estimated the distance between the light and the top of my neighbour&apos;s house to confirm that it was really moving strangely. It had moved from the origional place I had seen it, but was still emitting the faint spark flare underneath. I watched for some time, barely blinking continuing to estimate it&apos;s distance from unmoving objects, a telephone pole, another house, to confirm again that I wasn&apos;t just moving myself, the light&apos;s movement was so small. Finally my heart calmed, and I thought &quot;I hope that you&apos;re not like us, at least not the worst of us,&quot; thinking about war etc. Then, and I know that this is the craziest part, I thought &quot;thank you. thank you for showing yourself to me.&quot; And just after that it faded or turned away, and was gone. Just then, I saw bright light down infront of my house, and that was a car arriving for the neighbours. Glad it wasn&apos;t the light coming to pick me up!", "Very Bright Light  moving in bouncing like movements in Knappa,OregonI went outside on the porch to have a cigarette, &amp; noticed a very bright light in the sky.  It was a very clear night &amp; the light appeared to be making bouncing like movements.  I watched it for a minute or two &amp; then went inside &amp; got my boyfriend.  He came outside &amp; watched it with me.

The power came back on just as we were approaching an intersection, and a transformer on a power pole blew out, sending sparks all over the road.  At the same time, my brother shouted &quot;Wow, Look!&quot;, pointing his attention to a series of extremely bright green flashes that filled the entire sky.  We couldn&apos;t see exactly where it was coming from, but it seemed like it was somewhere off the coast of the island.", "Oval/cigar shaped bight object seen and captured in 2 images...I live in a three storey house. My room is on the third floor with a window to the street. As it is the summers, so I usually sit in the open window different times of the day to relax. It was around 9pm that i sat in the window with my DSLR just to get some night shots.Looking around, I just pointed the camera towards the street with a 50mm lens on the hood and clicked. Previewing the pic, i see the bright object, which seemed like a saucer, tilted, with its right end higher than the left one, as if going up to the right. As I have a digicam, so I took another shot just to confirm that it might be or might not be a sensor fault. Previewing this image I found that the object has moved. This time I found the object on the right upper corner of the frame. I took a third shot, but couldn&apos;t get anything this time. Comparing the two images, it seemed as the flying bright object, coloured green(might look different due to white balance, but as colour balance was normal, so I suppose it&apos;s green), was flying up towards the right. The direction of the object in both the images was aligned to my approximation as the images are slightly from different points. Zooming in on the object, its green and bright in the middle.", "WHITE BALL OF LIGHT SLOWLY MOVING IN THE SAME AREA FREQUENTLY  ITS LOOKS LIKE A BALL OF WHITE LIGHT.

The craft had 3 lights, one on each corner of the triangle and very dim white in color.  The craft made no sound and there was a stillness in the air.  The craft was very large approx. 500 feet across and approx. 500 feet from front to back.  It was about 600 to 800 feed in the sky.  The color was a dark gray color.  That night the sky was clear with stars very visible in the sky as the craft moved across the sky it darkened out the stars in the background.  The Orlando Int. Airport had planes coming in and going out, but this thing was too low in their flight path.  Living in Fl. you get to know those strange planes, the sounds they make, the way they move, etc.  But this thing made no sounds and was moving too slow to be any plane that I am aware of.", "3rd night of Orb sighting in Larkspur area of  Virginia BeachThis was the third night in a row that I had witnessed an &ldquo;orb,&rdquo; passing over my house, following roughly Edwin Drive at an altitude of about 1,000 ft. The first night we witnessed the same object approximately at 7:00pm while trick or treating with my wife, my neighbor&rsquo;s wife and our children. All three of us witnessed the object traveling in the same direction height etc. I witnessed the object again on 11/1/05 around same time and on the third evening I was outside and it appeared again. I ran to my truck and got my Nikon D70 digital camera and quickly tried to focus it on the object, while resting the camera on the hood of my truck to steady the camera. The camera had trouble auto-focusing and I switched the auto mode to sports, and was able to get three pictures, 2 of the object and the third of nothing many seconds later. I have the RAW &ndash; NEFF pictures for anyone who wants to analyze them, however you will need Nikon Capture 4 software to view the images. My neighbor wants nothing to do with this, nor does my wife. An unknown man near to us during the Halloween sighting on 10/31/05, exclaimed, &ldquo;It is a UFO!,&rdquo; but we don&rsquo;t know who he was, he was not from our neighborhood. After I did a radio interview on Coast to Coast, a Suffolk man contacted me and described seeing the objects again three nights in a row. This is not the first time I have seen orbs traveling in this direction (roughly South to North) a friend and I practically chased one in the daytime in the fall of 2000. I have since learned how to set the parameters on my camera and will be ready the next time to hopefully get better pictures. I have been told that digital pictures are not as reliable as film photos, but still a pretty good amount of detail and authenticity should be able to be gleaned from these two photos by those who know what they are doing, since I have no background or experience in this type of research. Photos can be seen and downloaded at www.thenorfolkincident.com/orbs.htm", "The outside rim of the objects seemed to wave all around like a fish&apos;s tail would, its very hard to describe.One evening Myself, my brother and my grandmother stepped out onto our back porch and noticed some odd black shapes in the sky about two or three miles behind our back yard above a tree line.  Using binoculars we were able to get a better view, I noticed they were all black, yet the outer rims seemed to wave all around the circular shape of the object.  IT was odd and it&rsquo;s a bit hard to describe what it actually looked like, though if you look at the tail fin on a fish, and how it waves through the water, from top to bottom, that might help to get an idea of how it looked.  That&rsquo;s the only thing I was able to imagine that looked like it.  Once we saw the few that had appeared first a few more just appeared out of no where, then they slowly started moving up into the sky towards the few clouds that were there and also left and right, then down a bit, then stopped in mid air and floated and a few more came, then moved up into the clouds and we didn&rsquo;t see any others after that.  Not one of us can explain what they were, they were not planes, they were not balloons, they were not birds, we could see them with the binoculars and how they moved, it was...odd and unexplainable , for us at least.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

At around an 80 degree angle over head I saw what I first though was a jetliner flying over like they do regularly here. Instead of a jetliner though I spotted an white/silver orb like object in the sky at around 30,000 feet and probably the size of a 747 (I say that size due to my having seen 747&rsquo;s at that altitude in the past flying over). The object was hovering in place and not moving in any direction. It was spinning or moving in some way in place however as the refection of sunlight off of it continued to change. It remained there in that same spot not moving for a full 15 minutes. It wasn&rsquo;t a star or planet (there&rsquo;s nothing there today), couldn&rsquo;t have been a plane because it wasn&rsquo;t moving and clouds in the sky were moving relative to it. I took a shot of it with my camera phone but the resolution is no good enough to see the object. I also checked FlightAware.com when I came back in and there were no commercial aircraft showing in the area at the time.", "A streak of light grew brighter, then disappeared leaving a faint trail of smoke into the near horizon.While driving home on Wednesday 05/09/07 at approximately 9:15 PM a white streak of light caught my eye. At first, I thought it was a shooting star, but as it fell, the image grew larger and brighter, and changed to orange on one side and yellow on the other. My next thought was a small craft like a Cessna was diving downward. I thought it was descending too fast to be a small aircraft. Suddenly the glowing colors disappeared, leaving what I thought was a faint trail of smoke. I then thought it must have been a meteor, so close its point of contact would be somewhere on the foothills above, near my home. As I drove 4 miles up my hill, I was looking for smoke or any evidence of impact. I saw none, but was positive what I had seen was too vivid to have been a shooting star or a reflection from my car windows.Upon arriving home my first question to my family was if they had felt anything like an earthquake or sensation of an impact. They had not. Convinced what I had seen was something of unusual significance I went out to my deck to look for a glow in the sky or smoke rising from the horizon. Through a few trees across part of our homes lakefront, I saw a burning pile of embers on the ground. Rationalizing it as burning pile of timber, a coincidence, I was unable to dismiss the possibility that I was observing the site of a meteor landing.I looked up your phone number and called to ask if you had received other reports of this sighting. The contact informed that there was one other dramatic report from West Seattle. I called a neighbor who agreed to search the area, and they excitedly told me that a Canadian radio station they were listening to reported a call from Vancouver of a Green glowing mass seen shooting across the sky. To my embarrassment, our search resulted in the discovery of the smoldering embers of a neighbors timber burn pile.It was a disappointing coincidence, but did not change the impression that what I saw was of greater significance that for now would remain unexplained.I am a homeowner and Father of two sons. I have mid level college education, a Manager with 20 years of experience in my field, no history of  mental illness or indications of instability, respected by family, friends, neighbors, co-workers, and have never experienced nor reported any event of this type.I could not have been the only person in this area to have seen this, and expect to learn of other witnesses in time. This was not a UFO, but I believe I what I saw was probably a meteor, and possibly further away from my proximity than it appeared to me.I hope others will confirm my experience with reports of their own.", "It was a clear sky evening, when I was walking outside.

The moon was behind me so the light was reflecting off of the object.  I initially thought it was a paraglider, but it was not moving across the sky and there was no sound.  I called my wife out to the yard and she brought binoculars.  I used the binoculars to view the object, it looked like a a group of about 10-20 large white balloons (shaped like a parachute) with a cable pointing towards the ground.  It seemed to be pretty high in the sky, but as it was night I can not say exactly how high it was.  I watched the object for about twenty minutes, it moved slowly back and forth across the sky.  I then went into my front yard and walked up the street about 200 feet, the object was above me and off to the side.  I thought that maybe it was some kids playing a prank, flying an odd shaped kite in the sky at night, so I got in my car and drove to the park up the street.  I didn&apos;t see anyone at the park, but I did see some odd flashing lights on or beneath the playground equipment.  I didn&apos;t get out of my car so I don&apos;t know if there were people on the playground, but I definitely saw some flashing lights on the ground.  I then drove home, viewed the object from the front yard and then the back yard, and then went inside to quickly search the internet for images of weather balloons.  I went outside approximately 5 minutes later and the object was gone. I awoke the next morning to my alarm clock, it wakes me up to KTAR 92.3 FM, a local talk radio station.  The very memory I have of that morning is listening to a quick story about some large balloons that got loose from a car dealership and a plane almost hit them, and then the announcer quickly moved on to the next story.  I felt like I was awake, but I can&apos;t say with 100% accuracy that I did not dream the story.  However, I do have a very clear memory of waking up to that news story.  I searched KTAR&apos;s homepage for the balloon story and also searched azcentral.com, but did not find any stories.  The nearest car dealership is about 8 miles away to the southwest. I have thought of three explanations for what I saw.  The first is that it was someone playing a prank and flying an odd shaped kite or balloon high up in the sky on the night of the full moon.  The second explanation would be some large balloons that got loose from a car dealership.  The third explanation is that it was a UFO.  I doubt the second explanation just because the object was &quot;floating&quot; above my neighborhood for so long.", "i know all the kid of airplanes light and even satllites and what i saw came the next day about the time or after 30 minuts.It started with a strong moving light in the east side  then it was getting stronger and moving faster than the traveling air planes  ..in straight line then it started the move in a half circular and suddenly it flashed like a comet but more faster the the north ( it crossed a very long distance in 1 second and it countinued to move in the south and then the light started to go stronger and weaker at last in was fading untill it disapeared. i turned to my friend and i did not tell him what did i saw ..to hear from him what did he saw(he was with me ) so he said the same things that i saw...((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

As I was approaching the park, the road does a very slight left turn and has a slight decline which allows you to see the tree line, I saw a black object which looked triangle shaped at first but as I got closer I could see that it was more diamond shaped.  IT was a very sunny day out and I was wearing my prescription sunglasses and I was driving a work car back to the office.  I saw this object litterally staring at me or so it seemed.  It was looking right at me and I just stared at it the entire time.  I think it noticed that I was able to see it and it started to slowly drift towards its left (my right).  It was hovering above the tree line and just turned into the trees where I lost sight of it because i was then underneath it and lost sight because of the roof of the vehicle.  The very split second I lost sight of that, something told me to make a quick scan at the park to see if anyone saw this.  Not a single person saw this object, they were all playing soccer and tennis.  I was just in total shock when I saw this.  I should have stopped and got out of the car but you never know how one would react in a certain situation.  I saw this object very close and upfront.  It was a solid black metallic object.  Whatever this thing was, it simply defied any law of gravity.  It hovered about the tree line and didnt rustle a single leaf.  It made no noise whatsoever.  There was no exhaust coming out of it like you see with any vehicle and was apparently invisible to everyone except me.After this happened, I was in total shock.  I didnt even tell anyone until the next day and of course nobody believed me.  I tried to examine and research for any possible explanation and came up with nothing.  I was scared to death to really even talk about this to anyone aside from my closest friends and then once i told them, I never mentioned it again until many years later.  I KNOW WHAT I SAW IS REAL.  I came up with only one logical solution and its far fetched at that.  The only reason i saw this object on that sunny day in june is because I wear prescription sunglasses and I believe that these sunglasses were able to bend the rays of light and allow me to see this object.  I know this is far fetched but my sunglasses have this reddish tint in them that makes certain colors look different.

I would say they looked like lights one would see on a call phone tower; only there was no tower.  They looked as if they were about 100ft apart from each other in a box formation.  It seemed like a rectangle, but more like a square.  The lights lasted for about 30 seconds.  Then after about 30 seconds, they vanished.  I had no idea what I saw, but there were four red lights suspended in the air over a patch of trees.  I was very frightened, needless to say.

Again, the sky was extremely clear blue that day and it was sunny so I&rsquo;m guessing that&rsquo;s how it hid itself so good.  Because of its distance (approx. 1 km away and fairly high in the sky) all I can say is that it was in the shape of a disk and it appeared to be silver due to the colour of the sky (no clouds) and the brightness of the sun that day.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I went, my two daughter&apos;s and my sister.  We had our three dog&apos;s as well with us.  We all entered our Suburban and left.  This was around eight p.m.We like to go out into the desert, so we drove out to the Gunnison Gorge, because it is peaceful, very desolate, secluded, and quiet.  We took our time, and finally reached our destination.  We like to stop and watch the sky for unusual things, so we did this for almost an hour.  Nothing was seen by anyone, so all five us climbed back into our vehicle, my husband driving, and started heading towards town.As we were driving, I looked out of my window.  I shouted to everyone to look out and we saw an amazing sight.What was out the window was some kind of bell shaped craft landing.  It was glowing, and on the bottom were all kinds of colored lights.  I yelled at my husband to stop the Suburban, and we all scrambled out to see this awesome sight.It was very large, and took about 10 minutes to land.  My daughter screamed out, &quot;look over there!&quot;, and to our surprise, a second craft was taking off from the same area the first one was landing.  My heart was pounding.  I had waited my whole life to witness this phenomena, my lifelong dream coming true.  I was elated.After it was all over, we went on home.  The conversation in the truck was one of excitement all the way home, not stopping until we all went to bed.The next day, my husband wanted to go for another drive to the same place.

I believe my sister was a little scared to go again, so she opted to stay at home.We arrived in the same area, and could not believe our eyes.  This time I brought a camera.  On the ground was a large, circular, UFO.  This craft was big and white, and very large.My husband was the first to spot it.

It was completely different from the two of the previous night, but got my attention just the same.My husband pulled over, we all jumped out, and I took several pictures of this &quot;UFO&quot;.My camera was digital, so I went and had pictures made as soon as we got back home.  The next day, we decided to go again, and the UFO was still there, but had changed places.The drive on the next day also revealed something disturbing.  We had discovered three dead cows.  One in the desert, and two in a field.  These cows had been cut open with precision, all organs missing.  No blood could be found around them, either.  The birds and all other scavengers steered clear of these animals.  I also discovered a skunk in the same condition.I photographed all of these animals, but had my film camera that day, and still need to develop the film.

It was closer than a star and it seemed to be spinning with lights all around it- like a Frisbee with lights I guess.  It stayed there for ten seconds or so, maybe slightly longer and then took off again at an incredible speed.

It&apos;s DARK here.  &apos;Somethin&apos; catches my eye that&apos;s &apos;not there&apos; normally. I&apos;m facing due West and I see 5 &apos;yellowish lights&apos; in a line over the Silverbell Mountains about 340 degrees relative @ 30 deg azimuth.*   * *   *   *              Kind&apos;a like this, but in more of an arc. . They all just &apos;appeared&apos; and hovered.  They weren&apos;t aircraft markers &apos;cause they blink even viewed dead on... I&apos;m used to seein&apos; those.  They weren&apos;t flares either... My long distance eyesight is really good (after the operation) While I&apos;m lookin&apos; at this... a meteor makes a trail left to right &apos;n vaporized like a flare. &apos;Seen that before too. So... all of these lights decend in unison beyond the mountain and in the same formation.I keep lookin&apos;.  All of a sudden... now I have 3 lights of the same intensity about 350 degrees relative... 20 deg azimuth. * * *  Not quite as high (altitude) as the 1st set,  but these disappear in about 3 seconds.  They were moving south very slowly. (Wind here is from the south... so they were against the wind.) There&apos;s a 3/4 moon w/no clouds.  Today I stood exactly where I&apos;d been last night &apos;n gauged where I saw &apos;em relative to this rather tall leaning saguero in the distance.  &apos;Can always see the shadow of that.  The Silverbells are about 30 miles away... maybe a bit more.  All of the &apos;lights&apos; disappeared beyond the Silverbells judging from the mountain contour.  They weren&apos; pop flares or parachute flares.  Luminosity was steady, altho not &apos;starlike&apos;.  There&apos;s nothing&apos; on the west side of the Silverbells for a good long distance. Gauging from the leaning cactus as a vertical marker... they were above and beyond the Silverbells.  I see the helo&apos;s from D-M AFB on nite-ops frequently... so it&apos;s not them. These lights weren&apos;t as bright as anti-collision lights &apos;n did not move other than up &apos;n down... altho I never saw them go up.  That was prob&apos;ly due to the mountain contour.My wife was outside (same time) but putterin&apos; with the garden hose waterin&apos; the trees.  She swears she&apos;s not hard of hearing... but she is... &apos;Cause I&apos;m yellin&apos; &quot;LOOK, LOOK WEST...&quot; &apos;n she&apos;s oblivious.Somethin&apos; else happened while I was starin&apos; west.  An airliner flew directly overhead.  They never do that.  Altitude about 2K&apos;.  &apos;Flew directly between &apos;me&apos; &apos;n the moon so I could determine it was a 737 type by the shape &apos;n engine locations.  &apos;Wonder if the crew didn&apos;t vector the aircraft for a look at what I was lookin&apos; at as well?  He was comin&apos; from Tucson airport flyin&apos; West by NW.  &apos;Lowest I&apos;ve seen &apos;em fly &apos;cause usually I never hear &apos;em.  &apos;Heard this one tho. Picked up his outline when he crossed the moon clearly.  They usually transit way south of here in that direction.I know that when ya look at a light in the dark long enuff... it&apos;ll appear to move... which is why I took that bent cactus as a reference point. In relation to the bent cactus... they moved.  I&apos;m lookin&apos; West by Southwest.  Phoenix is 180+ miles N/NW.  All the roads here are laid out true N/S/E/W so it&apos;s easy to orient direction.  I&apos;m lookin&apos; at these lights at approx 25-30 deg azimuth to the horizon.  Dunno how tall the mountains over there are, but at least 800&apos;-1,000&apos; above this plateau.  Yuma&apos;s too far NW &apos;n in this direction.  It&apos;d be south of Ajo &apos;n even that would be NW of where I was lookin&apos;.  Only thing inna straight line would be the Organ Pipe Cactus Nat&apos;l monument north of Soronito Mex.   I&apos;m facing Mexico &apos;cause of the angle the Pima county border runs.  Whatever they were... they would be too high to be flares I think... &apos;n not bright enuff.  Those mag flares burn rather &apos;blue&apos;.  &apos;Saw no other activity in that direction... &apos;No aircraft lights or anything.  These were yellow(ish) &apos;n not as bright as the stars (which were visible) but ruffly the same diameter as a small star. &apos;Bout the size ya see in Orions belt. I considered all that when I eyeballed these things.  There ain&apos;t s&apos;posed to be NUTHIN&apos; in that direction. There&apos;s no habitation in that direction &apos;cept for a few Rez shacks scattered about. No real &apos;roads&apos; either other than Rt. 85.Rough measurements using Microsoft Streets and Trips, straight line distance, statute miles:  Roughly this location to rough location of Luke AFB: 110 miles.Roughly this location to areas south of Gila Bend: 80 miles. I think there are targets there.Roughly this location to middle of restricted area east of Yuma: 150 miles   Direction of the lights would be over the Papago Rez toward Organ Pipe Nat&apos;l Monument. That&apos;s south of Yuma.  I&apos;m on the western edge (and middle of) the Saguaro National Park West.  &apos;Bout 1/8 mile east from the AWP canal... (due west) &apos;n the Rez is on the other side of that. &apos;Canal runs N/S and angles to the S/E &apos;bout a half mile or so south of my pos.Gila Bend is NW from my pos.   As I mentioned... from my LOS... these things were south of Ajo, in-line with the Organ Pipe NM.  There&apos;s nuthin&apos; else out there &apos;cept RT. 85 between the mountains.  No clouds... This wasn&apos;t a reflection... these lights were distinct.Other witness:  My sister-in-law spotted &apos;em when she was leaving last nite before I did.  &apos;Sez she sat in her car (in the road) &apos;n watched 3 of &apos;em for several minutes..  One thing... she said she saw one of &apos;em rise and cross over the top of another , then settle in formation alongside. Then they all disappeared together.Military ranges:  All that kind&apos;a ran thru my head while I&apos;m lookin&apos; at these lights. Too far south... unknown distance bu my sis-in-law said they appeared larger and were a bit further north (about due west) than when I spotted &apos;em... which indicates they moved SW.  Only other lights are the Silverbell mine road... &apos;n they&apos;re orange &apos;n sort&apos;a &apos;wink&apos; in the distance &apos;cause of the atmosphere.  These didn&apos;t and were steady.  They didn&apos;t behave like flares or helos.  Way too fast for either when they did move.  Neither did they describe an arc.  They were rather up-down or straight lines. Weird!      I&apos;m not given to makin&apos; stuff like this up... &apos;n bein&apos; a sailor I&apos;ve seen lots&apos;a stuff at sea &apos;n while airborne at a great distance... aircraft, birds, clouds... reflections, explosions, flares, weather balloons, sea critters &apos;n even waterspouts.  &apos;Livin&apos; where I do... I&apos;m always concious of &apos;what&apos;s out there&apos;... especially at night. Anything &apos;new&apos; will catch my attention. I know there&apos;s normally nuthin&apos; in that direction, so this got my attention &apos;n I eyeballed it for as long as the &apos;lights&apos; were visible... Taking bearings and approximate azimuth in my head... which most &apos;lubbers&apos; dunno how to do. Flares don&apos;t behave like that... &apos;n neither do helo&apos;s.  I see enuff H-60&apos;s &apos;n UH-1&apos;s out here... as well as the stuff Border Patrol flies at night to know what they look like at a distance. These &apos;lights&apos; fit none of those parameters. The lights never wavered in formation and were distinct.  None of that &apos;winking&apos; or fuzzy effect.  I mite add... nobody&apos;d been drinkin&apos; anything prior. Well... that&apos;s IT.... I&apos;m convinced I&apos;ve finally seen UFO&apos;s... &apos;cause there&apos;s no other way to explain it.

I was looking up at the sky trying to catch a  shooting star when I noticed a faint light coming from the northwest making a turn going south. Then all of a sudden the light turned off and re-appeared moments later in the same position where it originally disappeared and started to move again. That&apos;s when another light appeared even brighter heading towards the faint object,We thought they were going to collide with each other, when both stopped and flickered off, and that was it.

He said that the plane should be blinking because the light it had was solid.  Looking at the aircraft, I noticed that it resembled one of those planes from star wars. A circular body with to rods parallel to each other on each side of the body. We joked about it and didn&apos;t pay attention to it as it could have been some unknown plane.  I felt that this was one of the three things I saw. The second sighting had me baffled.  In the very far distance we saw a light, very similar to that of a star and it was moving.  We all acknowledged it and after a few seconds the light started to go very very fast to the right, then down for a short distance, move right again, down a short distance and then right one more time.  It looked like 2 steps of stairs.  Anyways, the light stopped moving and just stood there.  I was very confused and scared because I was trying to find a legitimate explanation.  I was wondering if the military had a new and very quick airplane.  While my friends and I were talking excitedly, the light seemed to have vanished.  Or maybe it just flew behind some clouds. The third sighting was odd.  I am not too sure if it was UFO but considering the strange things that we saw that night I felt I should include it here as well. After a few minutes of the star, in the same vicinity but just lower, we noticed a bright light illuminating the sky.  At first we thought it were fire crackers because it lit that area of the sky quite well.  Then we saw a very very bright light starting to come up but then it froze in mid air.  We had a very poor position for this because my neighbor&apos;s tree was in the way but the light made it very easy to see.  We all saw this bright yellow (almost white) light through the trees branches and leaves. Then that bright light started to move up and the next thing we know, we see this aircraft to our right very low to the ground making a loud noise. It was like humming and it was very loud.  It was moving quite slow.  It first appeared from the left (where the bright light was) and then proceeded to go right.  Since it was low to the ground, we all saw it crystal clear.  Their were numerous lights on the bottom of it.  All yellowish white in color and very bight.  The outline of the aircraft was triangular and the lights were like this...Two small circles on top of each other and two cigar like lights parallel to each other and in between were those two circles.Again, it was low to the ground and the humming sound was very audible. I suppose the first sighting was nothing.  And I suppose the third sighting could have been a military aircraft.  But what about the second sighting? what kind of aircraft can move as fast as I described and come to a complete halt?  I thought of getting a camera but I was just mesmerized and stunned by what I witnessed.  I&apos;ll try to get some pictures next time, if there is a next time.", "Bright ball of light seen in evening sky in West TexasMy wife and I left her parent&rsquo;s home in the North Western portion of Kent county (Spur in Dickens county is the closest town to the family ranch). We were traveling North on FM 1081 and noticed a bright object in the North West portion of the sky (which seemed north of Lubbock). We then turned the vehicle West on FM 261 and proceeded West bound until we reached FM 651 to go home to Crosbyton (located in Crosby county). The object appeared to be stationary and did not change in intensity or color. We witnessed the object  become obscured by clouds and clouds pass behind it within our time of travel. When we returned home the object was still visible and we were able to determine that it was North-North West of the city of Lubbock. The weather condition was stormy to the south of Kent, Dickens, and Crosby counties. We concluded that this object might have been a weather balloon reflecting light from the setting sun.

Then I saw it again but it was a bright light again moving in the opposite direction. Then I really started looking at it and it was moving back and forth in the sky, when the object was moving fast it was blinking a reddish color, when it slowed down and was moving more in a straight line than curving upwards that&rsquo;s when the light would get extremely bright and more of a white light. There were also cats; I saw at least three to four different cats walk across during the experience. Another one of my employees came out and then we started taking pictures. When we zoomed in on the picture it was an oval shape. I didn&rsquo;t see the object disappear but it did go behind trees until I couldn&rsquo;t see it anymore. I talked to one of the witnesses the next morning and he said he saw it again on the way home that night, but that it was closer to him. As we watched the light outside of work we could tell that it was getting closer to us, and we could also tell when it was moving farther away.  It was definitely moving faster than a plane, or helicopter, and the way it slowed down, and how the lights were moving on it- there was at least three different lights on this object. Much larger than a plane, and the way it maneuvered in the sky was unlike any plane-much bigger than a plane.((ADDENDUM:  Witness called on May 11, 2007, to state that she was facing east, at the time of her sighting.

There were three miliary style but unmarked black or dark green helicoptors escorting (apparently)the object. I thought 1rst they were making a movie on ufos. Then I thought it was a military test flight of an antigravity ship due to the helicopters.This was about 1000-1500 ft off the ground, light from businesses below would slightly reflect off the dull black metallic surface. It was about size of 1-2 football fields in area. People (70) met soon afterwards at the Pyramid Bookstore, which is now closed.

Other vehicles on I-10 also pulled over and watched this most amazing sight.  In a split second the object stopped dead in its tracks and hovered there making a whomm whomm whomm sound.  Then it split into two balls of like fire and started moving in and out of each other.  It looked like the sign for atomic energy!  After I have no idea how long, it formed toghether as one and landed on the ground.

At about 11:06 P.M. there was an abrupt interruption to our sleepover, a noise that sounded like a large train above the house, we saw circular lights and it was flying extremely low.  It was not hovering, it was moving.  With the lights we could make out the rectangular shape of this huge object moving fast.  This event lasted for about a minute, and abruptly came to an end, with everything back to normal, as if nothing had happened.  But it must have felt like 5 minutes due to our fear.

My husband and I are both educators with Masters Degrees.   I am describing an object that my husband and myself both see in the sky that has very bright pulsating lights that appear to have a shape not unlike a cross.  Long thin irregular  beam-like tenical shapes radiate out in several directions with one of the beam-like shapes splitting on the end not unlike a strand of hair with a split end.  The beam-like shape with the split end appears on the left side of the aircraft as we are viewing it looking up into the sky.  It is fascinating to look at.  The craft has a muted haze around it and is moving very very slow in what seems to be a westward direction.  Red lights appear on the top side of the craft then disappear and then blue lights appear near to the red light area and disappear as well.  They appear to be attached to something my husband describes as tenicals hanging down.  The aircraft appears to be quite huge.  The bottom has dark shapes and helps to identify a middle shape that at certain times appears rounded.  It appears to have sides that slope upward from the bottom which at certain angles appear box-like in shape.   A red light appeared on the bottom that seemed to run in what looked like a section down the middle of its bottom.  The light appears to be 20 times brighter than our normal heavenly stars.  The craft appears visually to be large enough to hold at least 20 stars inside it.  It is huge. At times the aircraft seemed to be hovering and tilting a little.  It also appeared to move toward us smoothly and quickly for a short distance then it would appear to stop moving towards us and continue in a westward direction.It is interesting to note that our normal heavenly stars appeared to be dim in comparison to the intense bright light coming the aircraft.  It was almost as if the aircraft was using the light from the stars to make its own light bright and the normal star&rsquo;s lights to dim.In conclusion the strange aircraft was interesting and fascinating to look at and watch because it was so unusual in the light shapes and the various light activity as it hovered and slowly moved in the sky.  It moved so slowly at times that it appeared to be standing still in the sky.  My husband and nor I have ever seen anything like it.  It was incredible.  Even though no true detail could be seen like one would be able to see if it were daylight and the aircraft were to be close or whatever it was amazing to experience the indicated shapes through light and dark shapes.  I would like to know what it was.  It was a neat experience.My Husband watched it for about an hour after I came inside to report it.  He said that it was still there when he came in and seemed to still be moving slowly in a westward direction.  We are located east of the city of Morehead Kentucky in the country.  Morehead Kentucky is located in Southeastern Kentucky.((NUFORC Note:  Probably a sighting of a celestial body, we suspect.

It was probably 20,000 to 30,000 feet in the air.  It was just hovering in one area.  Suddenly, it moved very, very, quickly about 400 yards to our left.  After hovering there for about 2min it dropped to only a couple hundred feet above the ground.  It seemed to be observing somthing on the ground.

Thinking this was just a little odd to be just a plane, I then took a second look.  It was moving slow and I was waiting for a better view (a tree was blocking my view).  I immediately thought this was peculiar because first, the lights were not blinking, as you would expect to view on a plane, second, the lights appeared much larger than lights are seen on a plane.  The lights were white (the same color hue as headlights on a car (not bright white but more whitish-yellow but still very bright), they were in a completely straight horizontal row.  I assume the lights were on one object as I could not be sure due to the night sky.  In addition, I would like to note that there was no apparent noise from the object as you would expect to hear from a plane.Next, this is what startled me most.  As I left the parking lot, I was traveling south and noticed the lights were now traveling in the same direction at great speed.  I stopped my car to view and noticed the lights were now traveling vertically but still in the same southern direction as I first noticed and then suddenly out of view.  (out of view perhaps from the intense speed).  I never saw a plane travel that fast across the sky.I came home and immediately explained what I saw to my husband.

The lights got brighter and came closer as we thought that the plane would crash because it was flying so low. As it got near it was no plane. It looked like a HUGE black triangle one blinding light in the front and two in the back, they also seemed to change color, red to green to red. It was so huge it blocked out the moon for a few seconds. The most strange thing was it had a red blinking lights in the middle. They looked like landing lights on a plane. It made no sound and scared the hell out of us. We called the police to report it, they said they had received numerous calls about it, but had no explaination.The next day I called a friend who was an air force pilot and a old high school buddy of mine. He told me that most likely I had seen the TR-B3, a spy military craft that was about 400 to 600ft long ( the largest aircraft ever created )and something about a top secret propulsion system something like a nuclear reactor. He told me that they are 3 billion dollars each and that the govt. is finally testing them all over the world. He also told me its really not top secret anymore, since its common knowledge among the military and info about it is all over the internet.

The moonlight glow was coming from the bottom of the object where several lights appeared around the bottom outline of the object.  The lights were not round, but, rectangular with a space between each.  The lights began to rotate counterclockwise then a round center area lit up as well.  The center was a softer glow than the outer edge.  The object moved west over my house very slowly and with absolutely no sound.

The first witness discovered the first object by laying on the sub deck on the bow of the boat.  looking at the stars, one star in paticular, bright and over head.  He called nine year old son to lay on the bow with him and asked him to just look at the one star.  The boy said &quot; oh my god, it moved! &quot;  We had the radio on, myself witness #3 heard their talking abruptly and stearnly turn into,  it&apos;s a UFO! and several whooos and oh my gods and you got to see this from both of them. At first I blew them off for five minutes or so as I continued to make my leader lines for casting and made sarcastic comments with,  Witness #1&apos;s wife, who is witness #2&apos;s mom and herself witness #4.  Their voice and concern grew greater as he insisted for his wife to grab their low memory digital video recorder.  I soon realized that whatever they were seeing, they were seeing at the same time.

I believe in UFO&apos;s and government technologies, and I concider myself to be very sientific, very good with spacial reasoning. I&apos;m familuar with referencing to stars, earth, moon, and ground effect.  Let me add belated that we were at anchor with a good catch of something at 40 to 50 feet in gauge with my 100&apos; rope and depth finder.  I own the boat so I was very attentive to making sure we were not drifting, however, as you read on, drift, is not a factor in this equation.  There was ofcourse some light movment if positional swinging off our 50&apos; pivital point, but we were at a cove so the direction was within 15 - 25 degrees variance at the maximum.  NOw to continue with what happened.  I climb up on the sun deck of the bow with my friend and his son.  I laid my head flat with vigorous attention on this star.  My friend said &quot; do you see that,  it&apos;s slowly moving side! wats, no w watch.  It will change direction.  I did notice some unusual kind of movement but nothing conclusive at all.  As a scientist and engineer I imediatly use my fingers and hands to position other stars and hold as a referrence.  As my friend did as I did, I explained to him that the muscles in the human body can move so slowly that you never notice the difference making an unreliable frame of referrence, but for now well see if we notice.  He said  &quot; watch, I saw a light at the end of it and it moved much faster and the suddenly stop and suddenly make total direction changes.  As he is telling me this, I&apos;m recalling in my mind the video of the NASA Shuttle in orbit that filmed what I think they called debris floating along one direction and then a sudden small flash and it darted like 120 degrees if the direction it was heading.  He&apos;s got my interest but not yet his wifes or our friend the 5th witness.  As promised this object definetly made sudden fast burst of movment and then totally changed velocity.  I watched in amazment as we witnessed a few of the longer traveled burst that could not have, in any way, been any sort of misguided frame of reference, drift, pivot or spin of our boat, or ground effect or our eyes becoming lazy and moving.  Partly because we all saw they same movments at the same time.  At this point I am confident my friend&apos;s claim correct.  I start to report to his wife what I&apos;m seeing as he is begging her to start the vidoe recorder for him.  I then also grabbed my phone with short video and tried to record what we were seeing.  His wife at this time was still giggling and joking and really didnt take anyone seriously.  We both try to capture the object on film as it starts doing far more aerobatical phenominons.  I guessed that this object if it were the size of a commercial airliner, would have been approximatly 25,000 - 45,000 feet AGL and at one point I had to trace the object while holding my video phone pointed at around 50 degrees in the sky to 85 - 90 degrees in less than 1 ! 1/2 seco nds and then suddenly stop.  My friend has the very bright idea to then signal this UFO ( I am calling now a UFO because all 5 people on the boat are now convinced ) with a mag light.  I do not know if it was coinsidence or if his signaling actually provoked very rapid and major changes in velocity.  It started to look like a ping pong ball ( a little exsadurated but you get the point ) moving in what appeared to be erratic behavoir.  My friend says he suspects there is another below by 40 degrees and left by 60 degrees.  As we watched it as well, it appeared to have less abrupt and frequent similar movments.  We all concintrated on the first sighted UFO more do to the show it was putting on for us.  Because of the less amount of interest in the sighted UFO #2 we ended up noticing that it appeared to be getting closer and with my no-fear friend still flashing the light at it every so often,  the rest of us were starting to get pretty frightened so we all agreed to get out of there as fast as possible.  We fled to the North side of the Hwy 150 bridge.  It was still visable to us and maintained the erratic behavior until we stopped following it until around 5-6 AM.  It was by far the most unusual and appreciated experience of my life.  I almost forgot, could very well have been the shock and rush to catch this on video, but my PC phone by verizon, frooze up more than once and had to be restarted while trying to get to the video menus so I could record and the footage I did get was only two five second shots.  My friend appeared to have issues with their equipment too, however, they were new to their recorders functions.", "Large soundless glowing orange thing that looked like two halves hooked together with a metallic cylinder.One night my boyfriend and I were watching television.  My boyfriend looked out the window (facing northwest I think) and yelled to me that he was seeing something strange.  I looked out the window and saw a bright orange light which looked quite large.  It looked like nothing I had ever seen before.We went outside with a pair of binoculars and looked at this orange thing for about fifteen minutes or so.  With the naked eye, it just looked like a large, bright, strange, and orange light.  It was circular in shape.With the binoculars we could see it much better.  It looked like a yo-yo on its side.  Like two bright orange halves connected in the middle by something--like a metallic cylinder that wasn&rsquo;t visible without the aid of binoculars.Another thing is that it made absolutely no sound at all.  It was a quiet night and if it made noise we would have heard it.  It also seemed to move slowly, almost like it was just hovering for a little while.  When it left, it was slow as well.  We watched it get smaller and smaller as it went in a north or northwest direction.I know it has been quite a while since this happened, but I swear I will never forget it.

Like I said, this is something that deeply affected me and I will never forget what I saw.Also, my boyfriend and I were sober (not on drugs or alcohol) at the time and we were both about 21 or 22 years of age.

It was a bright white color - perhaps reflecting the sun, against a clear blue sky. We didn&apos;t see any lights on it.

I remember my mom was taking our dog outside to use the bathroom and I went out with her.  I remember there was a bright light and our dog became very afraid.  I remember looking up and seeing what seemed to be a diamond like object with the upper triangle shape being larger than the bottom.  I remember there being lights on the object which were very bright.  I also remember being chased by creatures, this is where I became the most frightened, it seemed like a nightmare!  I remember running in our front yard with my mom away from the creatures which had large heads with particularly big foreheads and they were wearing white dress/nightgown type outfits that fit them very loosely. After running I don&apos;t remember anything after that except for waking up in my bed. I&apos;ve yet to ask my mom about the experience because part of me would be horrified to find out that she remembered some of it too. I would love to believe it was a dream because of how fearful I feel when I think about it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I ws driving along at 8.30pm in down-town Brunswick/Melbourne/Victoria/Australia on my delivery run for the local pizza restaurant when I caught myself gazing at a very luminous, violet coloured, oval shaped ball in the night sky - about 45 degrees from the horizon and noticably travelling along at an odd sort of speed.I checked to see if my vision was being influenced by anything thru my windscreen by popping my head out of my driver&apos;s side window - and sure enough it looked just the same.The object was moving away from my field of vision at a steady rate, but it would have been close to about 30 seconds - (the same time it took for me to drive a distance of about 500 metres at 40 kilometres per hour) that after watching it gliding along in a generally static eastward direction, I then saw it ultimately disappear from my view on the eastern city horizon (Mt. Dandenong) - but only after seemingly seeing it split  into two parts - with a much smaller (similarly shaped) part splintering off and making a sharp downward trajectory which is where I ultimately lost vision of it as well as the original (larger) object.I initially thought that it was some sort of laser-type light show being staged at a nearby sporting ground.There weren&apos;t any reports in the media that night or the next day so I really am lost for words as to what the object really was.It definitely wasn&apos;t moving in a familiar aircraft-type manner - way too fast for something so high in the sky.The size of it was comparable to the biggest star that you can normally see -multiplied by about five; but it wasn&apos;t that far up in the heavens - it looked like it was hovering over our side of the world - amazing visuals!!", "I am sending this in order to correct some errors in my previous entry of 3/4/2004.Three lights in a triangular white light formation without red flashing lights moving slowly from the west to the east making no sound.It was in Jackson, Mississippi near the intersection of North State Street and Presto Lane.  It was a moonless sky before sunrise.  At least I do not remember seeing the moon. I saw three white or yellowish white lights moving slowly from the west to the east in a triangular formation at an undeterminable altitude and velocity.  I assumed that these lights were all part of one object because they did not move in relation to each other (their triangular pattern remained stable).  There was no red flashing red light that is typically seen with aircraft at night nor was there a sound of a jet or propeller engine nor was there the chopping sound of the rotary blades of a helicopter.  There was no apparent sound at all.  The light formation was close enough so that if I extended my hand that the two outer lights could just be seen on either side of my index finger.  The lack of red flashing lights is what captured my attention and inclined me to get a better look.  I was indoors when I first saw it but I went out doors within less than a minute of first seeing it and watched it move east disappearing into the eastern sky.  When I got out doors it was still close enough to still clearly make out three lights.  Several minuets later as the sun was coming up I saw an airplane moving in exactly the opposite direction with the typical red flashing light and propeller engine sound.I assume it could be some type of military air craft.", "Watching a star and something crossed the entire hemisphere in 4 flashes.Was looking at brightest star in sky and seen 4 (dots) flashes across the sky from North East to South West.

The object was low flying and presented itself as a bright blinking strobe.  It flew west to east and had an erratic flying pattern.  It was absolutely amazing.  It went from a single strobe then blacked out for a second then re-appeared as two blinking white lights.  The two lights seemed to circle each other for approximately 10 seconds then blacked out again only to re-appear as a single strobe.  At this point I pulled the car over just before mile marker 30.8.  My wife and I watched it black out and turn into two blinking white lights again.  At this point it started to disappear behind the eastbound tree line. This is Easter night so traffic was somewhat heavier than usual for a Sunday night on the expressway.  My point being that someone else may have seen this.

I worked in San Jose, Ca. and on weekends,  I would go upm to Murphuys, to my new house that I just bought.One night, I was going up HWY 4, aprox. 15 miles from home, when I saw reflections of blinking lights around the bend. I thought it was an accidentm or something, so I slowed down. when I got around the curve, I heard like a roaring sound and saw this THING sitting on or hovering on the side of the hill, The white light was VERY bright, but it also had red and green lights on the sides.  There was noone else on the highway! All of a sudden, I got scared, and turned my lights off and floored my truck to get away from this THING!  When I got around the bend, I pulled down my window and could not hear anything or see the flashing lighhts,behind me!  Believe me, I have been in NAM and scared, BUT, never this bad!  I got a very weired sensation and started driving again, IT FELT LIKE MY HEART WAS GOING TO COME OUT OF MY CHEST!  I was approx. 5 miles from home, and the next thing I knew, I was home!!!  It was like an instant!  I felt weired, and told my wife about it and we retired for the evening. The next morning, I drove back to where I saw this thing and to my supprise, there is NO WAY for anything to be wheree this thing was; it was to steep an incline, so this thing must have been hovering like a helicopter!

Just diamond shape moving across sky.Sky was extremely clear, no overcast.  I had just noticed the luminocity of a few stars towards the southern hemisphere.  I went inside to grab my telescope.  When I came back out I noticed an object flying at an altitude of a jet.  At first I thought jet, but it was moving way to fast and graceful.  After about 7 seconds the diamond shape object was slightly overhead.  The object was a faint white but as clear as day against the night sky.  The object moved at the same velocity from start to finish.  The object vanished when it was about 7/10 through my possible view.  It seemed as if it was moving straight but not realative to gravity.  Like it flew straight out of our atmosphere.  The bottom of the object may have been chrome, or mirror.  Due to the object vanishing before a well reasonable vanishing point of sight, I beleive the object could of been reflecting more of the ground than the sky.  The object had no lights.  I have seen many documenteries, and live near an airport.  When a jet moves you can see its left over trajection in the atmosphere.  It seems to be a ridgid but straight line.  Seeing this object move through the sky was a great gift.  Not because of the possibilities of alien life.  The way the object moved through the sky was so graceful.  It moved so straight, at such a constant.  It was as if the object had a desination straight ahead.  Like the object belonged in every spot it was in at every milisecond.  It appeared as if nothing was realitive to the object but it&apos;s self.  It was not effected by turbulance in anyway.

We observed the object for approximately 2 minutes as it slowly moved across the sky in the direction the jets were headed. While watching the object, a third jet appeared - again following the exact same eastern path. When the third jet appeared to come within a very close proximity to the object, the object then changed course, and began to head south, directly above us, toward Port Angeles, Washington. We were able to continue to follow the object for a few more moments, until it eventually disappeared from sight. At first we believed the object to be a balloon, or a cluster of balloons with something dragging beneath it, as it appeared to be drifting on an easternly wind current - however, when the object suddenly changed direction, and seemed to increase in altitude, we were less convinced that it was a balloon.", "I was on my roof last night in Kansas City&apos;s Westbottem&apos;s and I was out there for the purpose to catch a UFO on camera.  It was still early since I figured it would maybe happen, a sighting I mean, at about 3 am the witching hour.  Well to my surprise I was laying there playing guitar for about an hour straight, all alone laying on my back looking up at the almost full moon.  Well the moon was sort of in the west at this point but I sat up and put my guitar down and I saw three oval shaped craft with no light&apos;s flying in formation from south to north towards the old downtown airport.The ships looked maybe brown but really stood out, against the clear night sky about 300 or so feet above me.  They flew in such a way that it looked like one craft, and there was a jitter effect on one of the oval shaped craft like tracer but they were not moving that fast maybe 100 to 200 miles an hour.   The sighting lasted about 10 to 15 seconds enough time for me to blink a couple of times.I found it strange because to start the night of I looked at the sky and said in my head LIVE  TO LOVE AND LOVE TO LIVE LIFE which is my sort of meditation words, and as soon as I was done playing guitar they flow over, it scared the shit out of me I called my dad and he instructed me to get off the roof so I did but remained at my roof hatch for the rest of the night with camera in hand but I was to late.  I am going to make it a point to be up there every night till I get footage.Good luck on your quest I am both scared a bit excited to help you with your journey, I have always believed but now my life has changed because I know.  Thank you for doing this the world needs to wake up and see what has been hidden, I was thinking about my statistic&apos;s class in collage which I went to but It was art collage, any way the chances of me catching eye of a UFO on my first night and the fact that they flow over me very low to the ground lower then a normal helicopter even it seemed, are almost impossible.

I looked up and saw a round, very, very bright light moving in a northeasterly direction.  I watched for a few seconds observing the object.  There were no flashing lights, no strobing lights, no identifying lights as seen on the many planes that fly in our skies at night from the local airport.  There was no trail of any kind either.  It appeared to be a light - not something on fire or burning.  I quickly went to the porch, opened the door and called to my 14 yr old grandson to come look.  He came out and observed the object as well.  He said, &quot;Gram, get your camera!&quot;  I said, &quot;What is that?  It is so bright and moving so fast.&quot;  The light never changed in brightness or appearance as it approached me, passed over us, or moved away from us.  It appeared to be traveling at a low altitude and at a very high speed.  There was no sound to be heard as this object approached, flew over us and flew away from us.  Before we lost sight of it beyond the trees, my grandson was observing it with the binoculars:  I said, &quot;Look there is a plane headed in its direction (the plane was heading north and was in the eastern sky).  The plane had to have been at a much higher altitude as it appeared as a pin dot to us, but you could clearly make out the red flashing lights.  The unknown object was very large in size in comparison to the plane and to the stars that were out at the time. I have never seen anything like this before in my entire life.  One other note:  The object seemed to zig-zag a few times as it was moving away from us.  This was a very odd experience.", "strange neon color lights come together as one then blink many colrs.I was watching TV at my fathers cabin Near Hunter Lake and saw a blue light in the window, I then saw a red light and ran to the window to see them both come together into one light that was blinking many colors.

On that route, I noticed something in the sky heading north, moving I would estimate at about 40mph. I&rsquo;m also estimating the altitude of this craft was 1,000 ft. The craft was a triangular shape, coming to form a right angle for pretty much the entire length of the craft. I&rsquo;m estimating the length to be 200-300 yards, and the width to be around 100 yards. There were absolutely no lights on the craft, nor were there any discernable markings. It appeared to be black in color, but it was dark outside so it was hard to distinguish any color. There was no noise associated with it either. I stopped the car and got out, watching this craft as it continued north and out of sight range. Myself, being the founder of our local paranormal investigating team, I went through the proper channels to make sure this was a genuine sighting. I checked with dispatch to which there weren&rsquo;t any calls coming in to report it, and I also checked with NWS to see if it might have been a low level cloud, to which there were not any low clouds in the area.

I worked the 11pm to 7am shift. At 7 am approximately July 15, 1985 I got off work and headed home to Greenville VA.  It&rsquo;s about a 30 minute drive north on Rt11.  At about 10 miles from home - looking to the east I saw what looked like a small skinny cloud (cigar shaped) in the orange yellow sunrise.  There were 3 or 4 small clouds.  A few minutes later as I got closer to home, what I thought was a cloud grew in size and was moving east to west back to east. Upon arriving home the object was still moving east to west and back east. I immediately woke up my parents who were still sleeping in.  I called them out to the front porch of the home we were living.  As my parents were trying to figure out what I was talking about, the object continued to move east to west back to east.  The object seemed to concentrate its path over a small minimum security work release correctional facility that is 1/2 mile directly east of our house.  Our house is on a small hill west of the correctional facility, so we had an unobstructed view.  The prison does farming and some small level cattle work (1985).  The prison has open fields on the east and west side of the property. Almost at the moment my parents realized this was no joke and started observing this strange event themselves the object came nearly over the house and slowly rolled its belly side for us to see.  Basically went from horizontal movement to a banking position. I was so shocked I could hardly move or say anything.  To describe the object as unbelievable is an understatement.  First of all it was immense in size.  I would estimate the size somewhere between 1000 and 2000 ft in diameter.  Grey in color.  It had detail and ridges on the underside and it looked like it was intelligently built.  It was dead silent, no lights and at about 1000 ft in altitude.  The remarkable thing I did noticed from the belly view was it was trailing sparse clouds off the edges of its disk shape.  It looked much like the arms of clouds in a hurricane seen from space. The object then slowly flattened out and disappeared in the eastern horizon.  I witnessed the object for about 10 minutes in the car while driving, and about 10 minutes at home.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))", "Star like object on northerly course makes 120 degree turn, moves erratically and stops, vanishesI was on the balcony of my hotel in Cancun at approximately 11 PM, Saturday, April 21st, stretched out on my back, looking straight up at the stars. I had never been to Cancun and looking at the sky between sets of a card game; the stars were more clearly visible than in Seattle, where I live.After a few minutes of looking at the stars, I observed what appeared to be a medium-bright star moving in a nearly due north direction. The object moved at the same speed and at first I assumed it was a satellite or a plane, perhaps. Then, it abruptly changed course (without stopping) approximately 120 degrees to a southeast direction. It then began to make erratic, darting sort of movements, accelerating and slowing, moving in different directions within a relatively small area of the sky, before appearing to come to a complete stop. A couple of seconds later, it vanished. This entire episode lasted approximately 20-30 seconds. I did not lose sight of the object until it disappeared.There was one witness, a friend of mine on the deck with me. Two other friends on the deck did not see this phenomena in time before it disappeared. They could not pick out what I was pointing at. I alerted my friends to the phenomena when I saw the initial 120 degree turn, as it was an extraordinary movement of an object in the sky.It was easy to discern the motion of the object, as there were palm leaves just below my point of reference, so I had a clear definition of the object&apos;s path relative to my surroundings. It was perfectly easy to track the flight path of the object, there were no obstructions and I did not lose sight of it during the sighting. The sky was clear, with few if any clouds. Other stars were visible in the vicinity, none were moving. If it had been a mylar balloon, as was suggested, caught in the breeze, it would have likely changed the intensity of light reflection as it moved, but this was a solid unblinking light, exactly like a medium-intensity star. A balloon would not have moved in such a perfectly straight course for the 8-10 seconds I saw it before the initial course change. There were other stars of that intensity out that night; it was easy to compare its brightness to other objects in the sky. It was not as bright as Venus or as dim as a star you&apos;d have to squint to see. At first, my friend thought it was a satellite because of the brightness, until its movements were clearly not that of a satellite. It left no trail as a meteor would; I sometimes sit out and watch the Perseid Meteor Shower when it occurs in the summer and am familiar with what a &quot;shooting star&quot; looks like. I have seen satellites pass overhead and the luminosity was comparable to a satellite or a medium-bright star. Venus was visible that night to the west, nowhere near the flight of this object. Mars was also visible; it was neither of these planets. We watched the skies for about twenty more minutes, and did not see anything like this again. There were no apparent laser light shows in Cancun, as anything of a promotional nature would have likely been repeated in the time we watched the skies after the initial sighting. We were sober and alert when we witnessed this object. My eyesight is 20/20 corrected with glasses, which I was wearing at the time. I work in engineering for a large telecommunications company, and my friend who witnessed it is also a professional employed in project management. The two others who did not see it are a CEO of a financial institution and an automotive project manager. I do not consider myself a UFO buff, or a believer for that matter. But what I saw, a star or object that made an approximately 120 degree shift in course instantaneously without stopping, quite frankly, startled me. I feel a little embarrassed telling people what I saw, because I have received a bit of ridicule already by telling a story like this. I am not claiming to have seen a UFO, I did see something exhibit motion not possible by our understanding of physics. I don&apos;t know what it was, but it was not a plane, a meteor, a bird, a balloon, a star, a satellite or a reflection of anything. The sky was clear all around our area. I am also not known as a storyteller, someone who seeks attention. I wasn&apos;t looking for a story, I was enjoying the stars. Until I saw this phenomena. I don&rsquo;t know what it was.", "Two lights, in close proximity (approximately 3-4 degrees apart, very bright (brighter than venus) and without flicker, in the NNE. . .At approximately 9:00PM, went outside, and noticed two lights, in close proximity (approximately 3-4 degrees apart, very bright (brighter than venus) and without flicker, in the NNE sky, about 30-40 degrees above the horizon.  I would have initially dismissed them as stars, except their proximity, extreme brightness, and lack of flicker were notably out of place for what I am accustomed to see in that direction of the sky - which caught my attention enough to notice that they were slowly moving N / NNE.  Having seen the international space station traverse the night sky at an astronomy event once, I would suggest these were as bright and similar in style, except there were two of them and much slower moving.  I went inside to get my fiance to invite her to share in this unusual event, and was gone for about 10 seconds.  When I returned, they were gone.

I want to see them again.", "Black oval / disk shaped craft banks around low white puffy cloud.The craft was shaped like a football that was somewhat flattened with it&apos;s points cut off and black as the ace of spades.  You could even say it was capsule like shaped.  The crafts was approximately 3 to 3.5 miles to the north and about 1200 - 1500 ft in the sky.  The reason I know the distance is because it was fling directly over an area I bicycle frequently.  The point at which I sighted the craft was the enterance of our condominiums.  The reason I can approximate the height of the craft was because it approached a &apos;low&apos; white puffy cloud (east of the cloud) and banked around the puffy clound going from a southern direction (at me) to a west direction.  This cloud was only one of two clouds in the sky.  My back was to the south the craft was almost dead north to my vantage point which means the sun was hitting this craft  directly head on from my vantage point.  Their was a passanger jet aircraft further to the northwest of this craft. It was flying west.  I can even approximate it&apos;s distance because I know this area very well in miles.  The black oval / disk craft was traveling at a speed relevant to that of a piper cub would travel in the sky. Now, I was in a car with my fianc&eacute;e and she likes to (shall I say) talk it up, when I saw this craft in motion.  We were heading south out of the complex she had to slow down for the speed bumps as you exit and wait for traffic at the street.  It gave me enough time to observe the craft before we truned and drove east, the craft already banked around the cloud at that time and was heading west.  I dare not interrupt my fianc&eacute;e while she was talking besides she had to watch the road. Having a lifetime experience of observing aircraft at the same height and distance in the sky, as this was, I can say with certainty this craft was at the same length as a commercial / passanger jet.  Also, and this is very important, I saw this very same exact craft in a archived UFO photo with a Vietnam era fighter aircraft with it in the sky.Lastly, this is not my first sighting.  However, it &apos;is&apos; the most clear and closest sighting thus far. P.S. Mr. Davenport I heard you on the Jeff Rense program I hope these paragraphs are the way you wanted them.

If you are interested in learning more, you can contact me and I could also contact the pilot directly and see if he&apos;d be interested in talking to you.I was talking to a Vietnam veteran who flew F-4 Phantoms off of a carrier in the Vietnam war.  One evening he was assigned to a carrier defence flight to ensure no enemy aircraft got close to the carrier group.  When flying past the carrier, it was suddenly lit from below the water by a very bright light.  He was commanded to circle and observe the light.  The initial theory was that a Soviet sub was under the carrier and was somehow shining a light up at them; playing games with them.  After about a minute though, the light took off through the water still submerged.  They and another jet followed above for about 20 seconds when suddenly the light left the water (not sure if they saw the shape) and took off straight up into the air and vanished.  When back on board the carrier, all personnel were commanded to never mention the incident.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

At first they looked like small aircraft (twin engine sort), then noticed that they were in a formation over crest of a ridge near Downingtown PA.  Never seen small aircraft fly in formation and wondered why and tried to watch them as I drove.  The colors were normal yellowish golden in color like of an airplane heading in the direction of Philadelphia International Airport. As I approached the ridge, the lights disappeared over it as if flying backward with headlights in front.  There were no other blinking lights such as red and green as on regular air craft, just the yellowish gold light.As the golden lights went over the ridge, one craft continued on as if to land at an airport further West such as Lancaster or Harrisburg.  It continued traveling West as I headed West.  The appearance of the object had changed from small aircraft shape to orb-shape sometimes appearing to rotate end over end.   The color changed from yellow/gold to bright white with bright white beams of light protruding from the orb.  There were also bursts of red and green colors emitting from the circumferce of the orb (as seen through a lousy pair of binoculars).  Family member came outside to investigate the object as it continued to hover in the Western sky from my house.  A half hour later, object seemed further away than before, but still hovering and emitting the three colors of light.

They were in the sky in the night and I believe I filmed two different ones. The shapes were round like the moon but with a flat bottom and they were bouncing in the sky like a volleyball.  They also expanded very large and it looked something like the shape of the head of a jellyfish.  One of them was a neon blue color and the other was white.  They both had some darker areas or figurines around the center. Contact me for more information if you are interested at (323) ((number deleted)).

A friend of mine who is staying at the house was standing near our shop building, which is approximately 50 yards from the main house, looking into the sky.  When I approached him, he asked if I saw anything flying low and silent on my way there.  I had not seen anything out of the ordinary. He described a pair of non-flashing lights, red and blue, on opposing ends of the &lsquo;craft.&rsquo; It flew on an east-to-west bearing, and quickly altered direction to the north and dimmed to non-visible.  The total duration was 2-4 minutes and was approximately 1 mile away at its closest point to his position.  He also commented that animals in the neighborhood were acting peculiar in that the horses next door were in a state of unrest and that dogs all around the area were barking loudly, many at once. Within 5 minutes of my arrival, two bright lights appeared in polar-opposite positions to each other, one to the northwest, and the other to the southeast.  Each one brightened and dimmed at no certain interval and independently of one another.  Each one also seemed to &lsquo;flicker&rsquo; and several times changed from a reddish hue to a bluish or greenish tone.   Additionally, there were three short &lsquo;flashes&rsquo; from the northernmost &lsquo;object.&rsquo;  It may be important to note that two of the 4 observers of this event confirmed that there may have been two distinct lights on the northern object, or possibly two objects.  These two &lsquo;objects&rsquo; seemed to be on an approximate inclination (relative to our position) of 40&deg;.  The distance from my location could not be determined; therefore I cannot be certain about the approximate height of the object from the ground.The total duration of this event was around 25 minutes.

It emitted a dull yellow light once every 15 or so seconds and remained stationary for around 5 minutes.  It made no noise and was fairly high in the sky, I would estimate it was around 2000-2500ft above our garden.  I know of six witnesses, but there may be more as it was a nice day and many families were outside having a barbecue.

It was a clear night and we would see an occasional plane pass by.Then from the SE we saw a dim white light moving NW with another light rotating around it, on a horizontal plane.  The altitude appeared to be very high (I can&rsquo;t estimate an altitude, it was just a light about the brightness of a star) moving very fast.  No sound.  Once it crossed the sky (approx 10-15 seconds), suddenly the rotating light separated and a third light crossed their path on a northern trajectory.  The light which broke off, I can&rsquo;t remember it&rsquo;s final trajectory.I have since become a private pilot and have studied various aircraft at different altitudes.  I can say that it was definitely not an aircraft or any type of meteor.", "Metallic orb captured on film accidentallyI accidentally filmed a spherical object hovering and then rising on Camano Island on April 7th, 2007. I was just filming around the family farm sometime in the afternoon. I never saw anything out of the ordinary at the time. It wasnt until I was reviewing my footage that I noticed a spherical object floating and then rising. The object is very clearly round...it is definently a sphere of some kind. I can&apos;t see how it could possibly be a balloon being that it was hovering at first. The only possibility I can think of is that I was witnessing a launching of a weather balloon, however this seems highly unprobably being this happened over my neighbors farm. I&apos;m going to go talk to him and see if he saw anything that day. Using other colors, and objects in the background such as cows and light poles to judge the size of the object, it looks to me to be metallic and larger than a cow.", "we was playing out side and all of a sudden they we saw 2 light go across the sky and me and my friends and looked up and saw it((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

There was no sound.My girlfriend and I were hanging out in my car on Friday April 27 around 11:45pm. We are both 18, in honors classes, and have never seen something like this before. We don&rsquo;t believe in UFO&rsquo;s but like to keep an open mind. She was laying on the backseat when she told me to look at the sky. I didn&apos;t quite understand what she was talking about, but she repeated herself and when I looked up through the window, the sky flashed and the whole sky was illuminated, but there was no sound. It lasted for almost a second and it appeared that the eastern part of the sky was where the illumination&rsquo;s origin was from. The light wasn&apos;t as bright as daytime illumination, but was a little dimmer, most closely resembling the lighting conditions found not quite at dusk, but around 5pm when the sky begins to dim. It looked exactly like sheet lightening but there was no sound of thunder and it illuminated the entire night sky. After this last flash, emergency vehicles sirens seemed to appear all around us, gradually moving east. This period of constant sirens lasted for between 5-10 minutes.When I further asked her about the flash, she said that the first time she told me to look, there had been three flashes in quick succession, with the first two flashes having a shorter interval than the interval between the second and third. Three flashes again occurred after this, with a gap of around 15-30 seconds between the two sets. The flashes were again irregularly spaced according to her, but occurred very quickly. She said that I had seen the very last flash in the last sequence.The flashes illuminated the entire night sky and for this reason other people on the road must have seen them. I&apos;m curious as to if anyone has reported night sky flashes on April 27, 2007 to your establishment or if you know what could have caused these flashes. I would be very grateful if you could email me any information that you know or have on this subject as my girlfriend and I are very puzzled as to what could have caused this and why nothing about was reported in the media (we checked the following two days and found nothing).", "Bright white glowing object in the southern skyAt about 9:45pm last night my wife and I were out looking at stars particularly Venus.  At about that time I looked up to see Saturn.  All of a sudden to the south almost straight up, I saw an object light up as bright as Venus and about the same white color.  This was very bright and seemed very high in the sky.  I told my wife, what is that?   At that moment it reduced the bright white glow to almost nothing.  I could however still see it.  I didn&apos;t see any flashing lights nor did it change colors.  It was like a hot amber color that was very dim and slowly traveled south east.  I wondered if it was a satellite but I have never in all my years saw a satellite that lit up like that. Also it must be generating some large energy source to be that bright at that altitude.

At 20:00 hrs. we noticed a single spherical light, just on top of a hill just west of us by about 150 yds. At first we dismissed as being something or somebody wandering around. Then we noticed the object , about the size of a car, hovering above the hilltop about 6 feet off the ground. Immediately following this observation, we noticed two more of same lights duplicating the same pattern of movement, about 10 yards from each other. We then decided to not stick around, and headed the other way, when we noticed the first light we saw coming over the hill and proceeded to follow us. this light hovered above the ground and to my left not even above or on the dirt road. This object began to gain on us, until i was going 50 mph. then it just disappeared. At which time we saw another object hovering about 200 feet off the ground and about 200 yards away. Then it immediately disappeared. No aircraft noise , gradual or sudden increase in speed, and definately not any type of aircraft we were familiar with. At this point being pretty shook up, we headed home in rather hurried fashion, when we noticed the same type of lights hovering over the crest of the sandia mountains, and disappearing as well.", "Frozen by fear and a light so bright it enveloped the room yet eerily not blindingI awoke to what must have been an hour or so after midnight in a bedroom adjoining my grandfather&rsquo;s room.  I woke up suddenly and shot up straight up in my bed sweating and breathing hard.  I may have been afraid or sensed an impending encounter.  My bed faced a large window directly with a pull down screen covering it.  A amazing bright light flooded the room suddenly and much slower than a conventional light as eerie as that might seem.  I was gripped, frozen by fear and hardly able to breathe.  I wanted to call for my grandfather, but nothing came out.  I scanned the room vaguely and the light seemed to suck all the color out of everything leaving only a black outline and white where color should be.  I had a terrifying sense that I was the only one awake and that I was not supposed to be.  My ears were filled with what sounded like a thousand people whispering or what I imagine inhumanly large power lines buzzing with electricity would sound like.  My body was impaled upright by fear and my head frozen in the direction of the window.  In what seemed like an eternity to me, but I believe happened in mere moments the shadow of a figure crept across my window with only the impression of his body passing by.  But for one brief moment and for what will forever fill my heart with fear and make me cringe to this day, I had the most horrifying realization that it (and I say it full of disbelief in myself as well) knew I was awake and turned to me to contemplate my intrusion.  As swiftly as it came and just so it was gone.  The light seemed to creep right back out and left me sweating profusely and cringing in a mixture of disbelief, but mostly terror.  I cocooned myself in my covers and held myself for hours before I finally found release in forced slumber.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It appeared to be a cylinder but I thought it changed to have swept wings similar to a DC-9 for 5 or 10 seconds. However, it never gained any speed other than the 20 knots I mentioned. It was in the neighborhood of about 20 to 25,000 feet as it would be obscured by the cirrus deck directly above it for as much as 30 seconds at a time. I watched a eastbound airliner go nearly over the top of it (separated by the cirrus deck) so I doubt that crew would see it. The east bound flight (I used to fly that airway a lot) should have been at FL 330 to 370 and moving at a normal speed and cutting a contrail behind it. My wife verified what I was seeing though her eyes are not as good as mine. I had her retrieve our digital camera, but the craft disappeared into the cirrus and never reappeared where I could photograph it.

I was walking along Queens blvd.  and noticed a man walking towards me and staring directly upward toward the sky.  This seemed odd to me because the man was transfixed on what he was looking at.  Ofcourse this peeked my interest, so I looked at what he was staring at too.  At first I did not see what he was looking at, but then the object caught my eye.  There was not a cloud in the sky. Im not sure if it was supposed to be a full moon that night, but the moon , atleast 80% full was out at 2:30 in the afternoon.  I just so happened to be wearing sunglasses.  If I hadn&apos;t had them on I wouldn&apos;t have been able to see this oval shaped ufo.  It was a brilliant white &quot;orb&quot; about as high in the sky as a visible planet or north star. Both of which I thought this to be.  Just as I was about to continue my walk and right this off as a star, it moved.  It moved left to right a very short distance.  I couldn&apos;t have been a plane.  It couldn&apos;t have been a helicoper. It couldn&apos;t have been a balloon.  I stood there and tried to convince myself that this was something that I could explain easily.  And then from the Northwest came from nowhere, three more.  Directly north of the first object came two more.  In total there were six.  All the same size color, shape and brightness.  Now I was freaked.  What the hell was I looking at?  It was such a bright, sunny day that I could&apos;t get anyone else to stop and witness what I was looking at.   The man that originally was the reason I stopped in the first place had gone.  The objects that came from the northwest moved slowly towards the first object almost forming a triangle formation.  The two from the north were just slowly downward almost as if they were on strings.  Almost as quickly as they appeared, five of them vanished upward as if pulled straight up on strings.  The original orb never left the sky.  I stood there for about 45 mins and then headed home.  When all six orbs were in ! the sky at the same time, they reminded me of what skydivers falling together to make a formation might look like.  The only problem is that these objects never fell to earth as skydivers must eventually do.   So there you have it, my first ufo sighting.  Its official.  I am the most skeptical person I know.

It was quick but we both saw it and couldn&apos;t believe our eyes.((NUFORC Note:  Report from student.

It was heading from west to east and just as it was about to disappear out of my view over a disatant building the craft made rapid looping movements from north to south - then disappeared in to could.4mins later, eagerly watching the skies, in the same area of sky (far east of the city) the same style as the first one - two crafts appeared moving rapidly in loops this time one craft seemed to be chasing the other - then they disapeared in to the clouds.", "My wife, duaghter and I were enjoying a warm evening on our deck.  My attention was drawn to a bright light approximately southeast and 80 degrees above the horizon from our position. The altititue was unable to be determined but jet contrails appeared to be below the level of the light. The bright light decended irratically and then appeared to reach a steady flight path or level travel of flight.  No contrail or visual evidence of the flight path was apparent.  The light slowly dimmed and disappeared.  My wife and daughter also witnessed this event. Note:  This sighting appears similar to the Reno, NV sighting that occured at the same date and time.  I am hesitant to report this sighting due to my profession.  I have reported one other sighting when I lived in Tillamook, OR.  I am willing to talk to an investigator but I would respectfully request that my identity be kept confindential.  Thank you.", "Bright set of lights. Was of triangular shape. Was slow moving.", "Light not resembling star or aircraft hovers high above South Bay, CaliforniaAt approximately 11:30pm the following events occurred.  After walking my dog on the beach, I stopped for a stretch.  It was an extremely quiet night and we had seen maybe one other person walking the beach. An extremely odd girl shows up out of the blue and asks me if I saw the UFO. I said no and she proceeded to show me an object in the sky. Most would think a star, but this had no sparkle whatsoever and absolutely no flashing lights. Using my finger for a reference I could see the object was indeed in motion heading west at a decent speed. She told me to listen to 640 am, and I made my way home. I went back outside to look again when I saw this object with the same light consistency, but a much slower pace.  It seemed to be in constant motion vertically, but slightly changed back and forth left to right. This is a series of blown up shots over 5 minutes, with the actual size on the left.((NUFORC Note:  Venus or Jupiter??

I thought it was a star and as I watched it, it began to move very slowly. Looking out of my windshield it moved about a foot on my windshield during a 2 hour span. Not sure of the distance it traveled, I used the (Foot) on my windshield as a guide. Its 2155hrs.now and it&apos;s finally out of sight. There is a haze in the sky and the only lights are airplanes.

The light abrubtly ended and disappeared after 4 or 5 minutes.", "I was driving on Route 95 and there appeared a large light in the sky.  I was scared and terrified as I initially thought that the object was a plane about to crash on the highway.  I felt so scared as it seemed so near I got off the highway and it seemed so close I almost didn&apos;t think we would safely make it off the highway. I would tend to think many other drivers witnessed this as well as there was quite a few cars on the highway.", "cigar shaped object over richmondAround 8pm I saw a cigar shaped object about four to five feet long hovering above the trees.  It was very bright white, almost blue and moved extremely fast and was totally silent.  It scared the crap out of me.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Also a commercial air carrier was heading approx. 005 T degrees, some 25,000+ ft. altitude, 15 seconds before this sighting.The elevation of the object was difficult to estimate however it was higher than the refueler and appeared lower than the commercial jet aircraft. I could hear the engines of both identifiable aircraft however the UFO was completely silent traveling 4 to 5 times faster than the commercial jet. It had 4 round amber lights arranged in a semi-circular pattern with a slight flickers, similar to a star flicker. The lights appeared at a point of about 45 degrees azimuth eastward (facing southeast) and stayed lit to about 45 degrees azimuth southwestward.As a seasoned celestial sailor with many months of night sailing, I have never seen this type of light arrangement nor the speed and silence they displayed. I have observed the ISS pass eastward overhead about a month ago from this same spot and am familiar with it&rsquo;s light reflection and speed.I would think it reasonable to say a radar signal would be more apparent on a military aircraft than one on commercial aircraft radar of such a flying object.", "Bright Green Triangle in sky zooms ahead and disappears in an instant.I was driving in the car around 10:30pm last night with friends and two of us saw an airplane flying at a high altitude. Well below the plane, almost parralel at the time a bright green triangle shape appeared. It soard ahead roughly 10 times the speed at which the plane was traveling. It then stopped on a dime and just disappeared abruptly. The sky was clear and there were no hills, buildings or end of horizon which it could have went behind. Two of us saw it but reacted internally at first and then 5 seconds later, I asked if anyone saw what I just did and my one friend did. It was amazing and inexplicable. Unfortunately, we had no cameras with us.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report elects to remain anonymous; provides e-mail address only.

Looking to the north of where I was standing  what I had thought to be a bright star, flashed very brightly and then disappeared.  Less then a second or two later another very bright flash took place and disappeared. this time it was to the left of where I saw the original flash.  At first I thought it may have been very bright lights from a plane, but I could not follow the lights beings it only flashed 2 times.  The flashes of light seemed much brighter than typical airplane lights.", "Bright round red light followed by a sequence of bright orange rectangular lights at tree top level.On April 9th, at 9:20 pm. I saw a bright red light come on then go out. Then four bright orange lights lit up from left to right, then went out one by one from left to right. Then 5 orange lights lit up from left to right and went out one by one from left to right. These lights were really bright. The red one was round, but the orange ones were shaped like rectangles. They were right over the tops of the trees in my neighbors back yard directly behind us in the northeast, within 5-600 ft. from me. The orange ones had sort of a screen look to them. Like they were windows from a craft. They were lighting up as though they were going around something circular.The very next week they were back and my husband and I both saw them plus, we heard that two other people about 4-5 miles from us saw the same thing.On the 16th of April, the same thing happened. The red light showed up first. It was followed by bright orange lights (as bright as tail-lights on a new car). This sighting lasted about an hour. The orange lights looked different than the ones I saw by myself the week before, though. These looked more like flares, or fireballs, but they didn&apos;t go anywhere. Not up, not down, just around something like a disk shaped object that we couldn&apos;t see. They again came on left to right and went out left to right. It was like a sequence of a different amount of lights coming on each time. One set was three, one set was 9-12, one set was 2, etc.  Then, as though another craft was answering the first one, (this set of lights was straight east instead of northeast) Four bright yellow lights lit up. These lights were bigger than the orange ones, and that is the only time they lit up. Then the orange ones in the north east went RIGHT to LEFT, as though they were satisfied with the answer of the other craft. That was the end of the sequences.We got video of the bright yellow lights, and two of the last four orange lights as they were going out.The next week (April 23)I got a video of a craft going over with no sound, and a smaller light came out of the craft. These had no sound, even though it was directly over my head. There was no flashing lights to indicate that it was an airplane of some sort. The smaller light that came out of the bottom of the craft, came down and then went west as the larger object was flying north to south. Then there was another smaller light flying east to west over the larger object.My husband is a truck driver with a high school diploma, and I am a registered nurse/truck driver, with over three and a half years of college, plus more college credits from the internet.

At first, we believed the object to be a high flying plane, but we retrieved binoculars, and close up, it just appeared to be a metallic shape, but not a plane.  The object crawled slowly across the sky.  After approximately 5 minutes, we lost site of the object. There may have been a light on it, or simply the sun shine bouncing off it.

Sometimes it would stay in one spot, sometimes it would move quickly, more quickly than a helicopter or an airplane. Sometimes lights would flicker. We had to stop at a gas station to fill-up and we didn&apos;t even talk about this vehicle that we were following.When we got back on the road, my cousin&apos;s wife was driving. She spotted it and it was closer because it was brighter. This time it crossed over to the passenger side of the highway and stayed in one spot. When we approached it, I rolled down the window. My cousin and I stuck our heads out the window and we saw it about a stone&apos;s throw off the highway, about the height of a water tower. There were windows around it, with what appeared to be lights on top, although they weren&apos;t lit.
