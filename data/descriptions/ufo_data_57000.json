["MULTIPLE WHITE LIGHTS ORBITING FULL MOON12/02/09: WAS OUT ON DECK LETTING CAT OUT AND LOOKED AT THE FULL MOON ABOUT 06:35 THIS AM. I WAS SAYING THE LORDS PRAYER AND ALL OF A SUDDEN I SAW A SMALL WHITE ROUND LIGHT MAKING AN ORBIT AROUND THE LOWER RIGHT QUADRANT OF THE MOON. ONCE IT LEFT MY SIGHT ANOTHER ONE CAME, BUT GOING IN THE SAME DIRECTION, BUT APPEARED TO BE ORBITING A DIFFERENT PATH ALSO. THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EITHER THE SAME ONE OR A SECOND ONE. WHEN I SAY ORBIT- I MEAN IT CAME FROM BEHIND THE MOON 1/3 THE WAY IT DIAMETER AND LOOKED AS IF IT WENT ACROSS THE LOWER RIGHT QUADRANT THEN DISAPPEARED. THE SPEED WAS FASTER THAN CONCEIVABLE. I DO NOT HAVE EYE PROBLEMS.IT HAPPEN AS I WAS SAYING THE LORDS PRAYER. I ALSO GOT THE FEELING I WAS BEING SHOWN SOMETHING ABOUT HOW BIG GOD REALLY WAS. GETTING NEARER TO CHRIST&apos;S BIRTHDAY, I HAD A FEELING OF &quot;KNOWING THAT HE WAS REALLY SENT HERE FROM THE HEAVENS&quot;- IF YOU GET MY DRIFT. MAKES ME WONDER IF THE NORTHERN STAR WAS REALLY A UFO WATCHING A VIRGIN BIRTH OF THE LORD WHO WAS HERE TO SAVE US ALL.BY THE WAY, I AM A REGISTERED NURSE AND NOT REALLY ALL THAT RELIGIOUS.

I decided to take a couple of photos of the aircraft, despite having only a 24-70mm zoom.  Of the three photos I took, one includes an unknown yellow or gold object at an unknown distance.  I didn&apos;t see this object until I viewed my photographs one week later.  At the time of the photo, the aircraft did not interact with or chase the object.  Probably didn&apos;t see it.  I know I didn&apos;t see it at the time.  My first guess is an airborne hat, much close to me than the aircraft.

Not knowing what was in orbit of the moon and it is still there to this time of 11:45pm I will continue to watch it for as long as I can.

He was at Wadsworth &amp; 10th Ave, Lakewood Co 80215.  He was in his truck getting ready to leave the gas station when he noticed 5 objects lined up in the sky.  They were lit up on the bottom.  He and a friend watched for a few seconds, he reached to get his cell phone to take a picture.  Four of the five objects disappeared and one stayed.  He could see a dome top with vertical lines, the object was slowly rotating, and the bottom was lit up.  It stayed for a moment then took off towards Denver and disappeared.  He was able to get one picture of the last object (UFO) with his cell phone.", "3 LightsI noticed a row consisting of three orange balls of light in the sky approx. 2 miles from my home. The balls of light were spaced roughly 500 yards apart from one-another. After a little while the middle light began to fade. When this light had almost entirely &apos;switched-off&apos; it quickly gained altitude, regained its vivid light and hovered in the same place for a little while. Soon the surrounding two lights followed the central light upto the same altitude. For about 10 seconds the lights hovered there in a row before shooting south at an unmeasurable rate of speed. It was hard to focus on the light as it was too bright and blurry for most of the time.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was headed East on Decoto Road at around 6:45pm when I noticed a flying aircraft of some sort traveling South; parallel to Mission Blvd, right above the hills.  I noticed one red light, one teal looking light and one white light.  Naturally I thought it was a commercial airline until it made a very quick right turn going west.  That is what caught my attention right away.  I came to a red traffic light and continued to watch the aircraft fly west to the right of me.   As it got closer I noticed it switched angles and I could now see only three vertical, round red lights blinking in a sequence.  Then not a moment later the aircraft came to a complete stop in mid air and hovered in the same spot.  I honked my horn to get the driver next to me to look up and see what I was seeing, but they just drove off.  The traffic light had now turned green, so I pulled my car over to the side of the road and got! out.  I stood and watched this aircraft hover for about a minute or two. I noticed that I could not hear any sort of noise coming from this aircraft either.  I think it might have been about 2 or 3 football fields in the air.  It defiantly seemed noticeably close.  The aircraft then started to move again and it continued west until I could not see it anymore.", "bright lit-up orbs, 20-30 of them in the sky above Bloomingdale, IL.Recently, I was watching an episode of UFO Hunters titled, &quot;Dark Presence,&quot; which described orb-like lights in the sky.  I wasn&rsquo;t going to report my sighting, mainly because I was unsure of what I saw, but after viewing this television program, I instantly changed my mind because the orbs that were shown in the show were the same type of orbs that my boyfriend and I saw in the sky.My boyfriend was driving me home one evening, I&rsquo;m not too positive on the date, but I&rsquo;m sure it was between August 28th and September 10th, and I&rsquo;m almost positive that it was on a Saturday or Sunday.  The time was around 9:00pm central, when we came to an intersection and saw these orbs in the sky.  There had to have been at least 15 of them, but no more than 30.  Due to the fact that we were on the road, we were unable to stop, but I was able to turn my head to keep my eye on these objects. I pointed them out to my boyfriend who saw these orbs as well.  The orbs didn&rsquo;t appear to move, but just sit there in the sky.  Some were a bright, bright bluish color, others were white with a reddish-orange tint to it, the rest were simply white.  All of these orbs were illuminated. The area of the sky where the orbs were seen was lit up with almost a reddish-pink glow.  I could tell for a matter of fact that it could not have been aircraft from one of the neighboring airports due to the la! ck of mobility in the orbs and the simple matter that there were far too many in the sky to be aircraft.We continued driving down the road, and I had these objects in sight for at least 7 minutes until we turned down my street and went down a hill.  As we neared the bottom of the hill, I got a clear view of these orbs again, trying to get my boyfriend to pull over so I could take a picture, the only problem being I had to be home at a particular time, and time was running terribly short, so short that he couldn&rsquo;t stop.I returned to my house and went inside due to my curfew, fearing that I would be grounded if I was late.  My boyfriend and I never went back outside to look for these orbs, frankly, because we were both too scared of what we saw.I am a 17 year old female and a senior in high school.  I have no occupation of any sort, nor do I participate in any extra curricular activities.  My boyfriend is a 20 year old male who dropped out of high school and is searching for a job.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

(It was a fire ball) and 5 minutes later we saw a spaceship 100 meters up above us.  The speed of the spaceship was about 200 km/h, it&rsquo;s a guess.  On the spaceships edge&rsquo;s was it round orange red glowing light but it wasn&rsquo;t so strong.  Then 10 minutes later I saw a half circled formation of lights and then it flow above me and disappeared in the horizont.((NUFORC Note:  We are unconvinced that this is a serious report, or that it was submitted from Sweden.

My wife to the left of me pointed up to the sky.Amazed at what I was seeing I slowed my bike down to almost a crawl.  My father and step-mom were behind my wife and I, and my father in-law behind them.  What i saw was a black triangular object blocking out the stars and sky. It was moving incredibly slow.there were white lights at each corner,then in marvel another soon floated behind the first just as slow.(same lights) no flashing,just solid.  I actually passed under them going 5 miles per hour.I would guess 5,000 ft. up and the size bigger than a football field. I&apos;m reporting this now because I didn&apos;t that night.

After a second i realized that light that i saw in the sky was flashing and slowing down getting brighter as it descended.

It was May of 1973 in Texas City, Texas.  I was 11 or 12. It started getting dark.  Everyone dispersed after an hour or so.  I stayed outside and set quietly on the grass in front of our new house.  Directly across the street lived a family, I will call Cark. I could see in their front window.  The family was all sitting around the TV. Their family room was brightly lit. Envy welled up in me. I so wanted a normal family life.  My step-father was a drunk.  There was a lot of dysfunction in my house.  I diverted my attention to the sky. It was an unusually cool spring evening with little or no humidity.  The sky was bright with what looked like a trillion stars.  The pollution was non-existent from the refineries that were close by and the air was light and crisp.  I closed my eyes and listened to the sounds of the bugs and distant cars.  All of a sudden there was an abrupt silence that fell over the area where I sat. Wh! en I opened my eyes, I noticed something hovering over the Cark&rsquo;s house. I couldn&rsquo;t make out a shape, because it was so bright.  Later I remember thinking that it had a half oval shape.  I remember feeling like I was getting a tan on my face.  I couldn&rsquo;t move and I didn&rsquo;t even feel like I could blink.  I tried to open my mouth to holler at someone in my house, but I couldn&rsquo;t utter a sound.  My mind kept saying that I was not seeing what I thought I saw.  The last thing I remember was a feeling of terror.It seemed like a minute or two had passed and I found myself standing about three feet from where I was originally sitting.  The bright object was gone and the Cark&rsquo;s were back to watching their family show together. The sounds of the late spring night had returned and I felt a chill go across my body. I turned and ran into the house.  I went straight to the bathroom to wash my hands. I felt dirty and kind of sticky. When I looked up in to the mirror, I saw my face. It looked like I had been at the beach all day long. It didn&rsquo;t hurt, but I put aloe vera gel on it anyway.  I went in to the kitchen to get a glass of water and noticed that the clock showed the time to be 10:30 p.m. I immediately went in to my room to confirm the time on my alarm clock.  My alarm clock said the same thing.  &quot;There is no way 2 &frac12; hours could have past,&quot; I thought. It seemed to me to have been no more than five minutes. I walked around the house to tell anybody, but my step-father was passed out, m! y brother and sister were asleep and mom was at work.Fear overwhelmed me and I ran in to my room, jumped in my bed and put the covers over my head.  I thought about it for a couple of days afterwards. I even asked the Cark boy that was my age, if he heard or saw anything.  He said that he didn&rsquo;t.  I didn&rsquo;t think about it again until 1988 when I had an out of body experience hovering over my self and my new baby while we slept in bed.  A bright light came in to the room. It was pitch black outside, but it looked like broad daylight in my room.  The fans stopped and it there was no sound at all.  The next thing I knew,  I was back in bed and it was pitch black dark in my room.  The fans were blowing and I closed my eyes and went back to sleep.In 1990 I had a child and needed a C-section.  After my surgery and recovery the doctor asked me when I had my fallopian tube and ovary cut out.  I told her that I never had that kind of a surgery.  She documented the information and had nurses verify.  When I told my family, they said that the doctor had probably accidently cut them out during the C-section.  I bought the idea.  Since then, I have spoken to friends of mine who are doctors and they said that it was highly unlikely that one fallopian tube and ovary would have been cut out on accident by the doctor.  I have recently been writing in a journal I started in 2006 and as I came up to the 1970&rsquo;s, my recollection of the May 1973 event became refreshed in my mind.  I did not feel the need to report this until, my 22 year old daughter who I have told the story, told me about a case called Dortery (sp) that occurred in a near by city of Alta Loma, Texas, in the same year of 1973.  I don&rsquo;t know if there is a correlation, but ! I wanted to give all of my truthful recollection and let the professionals make that determination.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))", "Lights changing shape, triangle, long duration.I was driving west over Alligator Alley, just before the Broward County border, when I looked to my left and saw a light that appeared almost like a plane light, maybe a little more orange. I continued driving and then I looked back and saw another light. I thought it rather odd that these two planes were so close together, but then as if out of no where I saw a 3rd light appear. The lights were almost in the form of part of a octagon. Then one of the lights when out and a second light when out. Next time I looked I saw a light reappear and finally the third light reappear. This time they were almost in a perfect triangle formation. There was still some light out at the time, even though the sun had set, so I could tell that they weren&apos;t all a part of the same vessel. Also, there were no flashes lights coming from the orbs that would have lead me to recognize that they were planes. After that, I then lost track of the lights as the trees along the highway we! re blocking my line of light, but about 20 to 30 minutes later I looked in my rear view mirror and still saw those lights in the sky.

It also flew at very low altitude also at very low speed.  The object has bright blue light and also has a white flashing light running in one direction on the body of the craft.  Comparing to the side of the normal aircraft, it was much much bigger. The craft has a disc shape and only one object was seen in the sky.  I was on the street and the yellow light shined on me.  The background of the craft was dark as the object was witness flying over the area of Palisade Park to Sycaucus area in New Jersey.", "Two mutli colored lights appearing to be outside atmosphere moving very slow then fading awayOn Saturday morning at 0145 Dec. 19, 2009 I saw two bright multi colored lights (red, green and blue) in the sky.  They moved very slowly from south to southwest.  I know they were not planes or helicopters, they moved too slowly.  I do know a little about astronomy, the ISS and space shuttles.  I make it a habit to know when the shuttle is orbiting with the ISS and watch for it.  Point being I could tell these two objects were very high in the sky and did not seem to be within our atmosphere.This lasted about ten minutes.  When I noticed them they were almost in line with each other.  One was on the left, the other to the right but a little below.  The one on the right moved very slowly from the right towards the bottom of the other while it was motionless.  Once in line straight up and down, they both traveled from south to southwest very slow then slowly faded away as you would see the shuttle do when it leaves the reflection of the sun.What I thought was interesting was that they faded away while moving to the west towards the suns light.  It also may be that they only appeared to move to the west.  It may be possible that they were going deeper into space.This occurred in the town of Campbell, Ca.  I am hoping someone else saw the same thing from a long distance away.  This would prove that these objects were in space.", "Driving southbound on Jellison Rd, just north of Duncan. Sky was very clear, no clouds of any kind. Looking at a distance past the upcoming stoplight, I saw a round object in the sky.

The speed increased and I noticed one was following the other clean across the sky toward the moon.  Then the trajectory changed to moving up toward the upper atmosphere and I could see them beginning to fade in brightness and size.  I could actually see the layers of atmosphere that the light was lighting up around them as they moved up out of the atmosphere until they vanished.  Was incredible.

Weird thing is I dreamed of this last week in a very vivid dream.", "In early Nov.2004 while on a hunting outing I was pulling into a pasture near Piedmont KS. It was dark but the eastern horizon was starting to light up. As I was opening the gate I noticed a very bright light aprox. 10 degrees on the southern horizon. I recall thinking to myself that &quot;Venus sure was bright this morning&quot;. As I drove south through the pasture (aprox 1/4 mile) to the spot I park my truck the light got even brighter and appeared to change colors so rapidly that I couldn&apos;t distinguish what color it was. I stopped the truck just before I reached my destination because even though the light didn&rsquo;t appear to be moving there was a 200 ft high ridgeline 1/4 of a mile to the south of me and the light was getting very low on that horizon. I grabbed my 12x50 binoculars off the seat of the truck and opened up the door and braced myself between the open door and the cab to steady my position while I viewed the light. There was one small tree on that open h! illside and the light was slightly above and to the left of the tree. It was stationary and didn&apos;t move in relationship from the tree. It did however during the next ten or 15 minutes get very bright then dim. Several times it totally disappeared only to reappear in the same location a few minutes latter.  Every time the light dimmed it would blink very rapidly. Through the glasses the light appeared to get larger and sort of pixilated as it got brighter. It also appeared to change colors but it did it so fast that I could not distinguish which color. I watched this for quite some time and was so fascinated by the event that I didn&apos;t remember that I had a video recorder in my hunting back pack. By this time the sky had brightened considerably and the light had disappeared. I got the camera out and was getting it ready when suddenly the light reappeared. I got a few seconds of video and managed to catch it getting brighter than dimming and the rapid blinking. I also zoomed i! n on the light for a few frames. It dimmed once again blinked ! and disa ppeared for good. It was bright enough by this time to see an object in the sky but nothing was there. I waited several minutes but saw nothing more of it so I decided to go hunting as planned. When I returned home and reviewed the video in slow motion I was quite surprised. It appears to me that instead of disappearing the light leaves upward at a 45 degree angle at a fast rate of speed. I&apos;ve never seen anything like this and though I don&apos;t know what it was I do know that it wasn&apos;t a star, satellite, airplane, helicopter or balloon. I might add that I wasn&rsquo;t planning to report this to anyone until several close friends who saw the video encouraged me to do so.

A red light first caught my attention.  As I looked on, I saw a saucer shaped object.  At first I assumed it was a plane or helicopter and it&apos;s altitude seemed close to the altitude where I have seen helicopters hovering in the past.  The UFO was descending and approaching.  Within 30 seconds the UFO was close enough to see very clearly but didn&apos;t appear to get closer than around a mile or two.  From my line of site the UFO began around 30 degrees above one of our trees in the backyard and eventually moved to low to see.  I walked to the other side of the yard in an attempt to see around this large tree but after 3 or 4 minutes couldn&apos;t locate the UFO so I went inside.  The UFO was in my view for around 3-4 minutes. My view of the object was clear and the UFO was absolutely not a helicopter nor airplane.  The craft appeared to move or &quot;float&quot; in all directions although it never made any radical maneuvers or cha! nges in acceleration.About this report: written 3 minutes after the sighting occurred.  Since I am not in some remote, isolated, location, it seems odd to view something so strange - whether it be a UFO or some air-force experiment. I cannot say what it was. All I can report as certain, is that what I saw was not any type of normal aircraft. I can&apos;t say whether it is due to the distance of the craft or not, but if the object was making any sound, I couldn&apos;t hear it.About the whiteness: 39 year old male who has never seen nor reported a sighting before.  I have also never experienced nor reported any form of anomalous or paranormal experience. My eyesight is currently 21x20 and I have never required or used glasses.  My house where this sighting occurred is located in a normal, non-remote, neighborhood and there are no buildings, high rises or stadiums near enough to view.", "Craft watches meteor shower in the nothern skiesI walked out on my porch that evening/morning to take a leak as I live i rural area and was facing north.

I had a very tall tree as my point of reference to note its movement.  Every so often it would make a sharp drop down, coming nearer and as it dropped down I saw also a small red light (white light would get dimmer when the red appeared).  And this part Im unsure of as far as shape bc it was dark out and the overcast was moderate but when I saw the sharp drops I saw shadows that were consistent with 2 tentacle like shapes, one on each side and when it made its drop it appeared to have a swimming motion when going back up. (this however is how it appeared, and hard to say for certain).  I watched it for about an hour total.  Ruled out a shooting star.  Maybe a sattelite?  Never have seen it in the area before.  My parents saw this as well.

I attend a local college and left class around 9:30pm. On my way home (headed north on Highway 27), I saw a bright orange light ahead of me. The full moon was abnormally large, so I assumed Earth may have been extra close to a particular star or planet. The light was too big to be a plane or helicopter, and at first, it appeared to be too high up to be either of those. As I continued driving, I realized it wasn&rsquo;t a planet or star, because I seemed to be getting closer to it. At this point, I was trying to figure out what in the heck I was looking at. It was too high to be a light at the top of a tower, but it wasn&rsquo;t moving or blinking either. As I got closer, the object got bigger, almost as if it were floating above the new soccer field on the south end of town. I turned right on Hunt Brothers Road, and at t! his point, I had a car right on my bumper. I kept looking at the light, which appeared to be almost directly above me. When I looked up, I saw three orange lights that formed a tight triangle. I kept trying to get a better look at it, but because I was in a vehicle, it was hard to see something that close (yet still so high in the air). I nearly had my whole head of the window when the lights quickly moved east (much too fast to be a plane, jet or helicopter). When this happened, I noticed that car behind me basically stopped in the middle of the road. They must have been watching too, and when the lights moved so quickly, they slammed on their brakes. When I looked back up, the lights were gone. This is where it gets even weirder&hellip; I immediately called my husband (who is even more of a skeptic than I am!). When I started telling him what I saw, he didn&rsquo;t laugh or make jokes, he was actually listening and being serious about it. After I told him what I saw, he said, &ldquo;That is! so weird. I am not kidding you, I saw the same thing on my wa! y home f rom work.&rdquo; He works in a city north of Lake Wales and had seen this same thing two hours before I had seen it. As he headed south on Highway 27, he saw the bright orange light. It disappeared before he made it into Lake Wales. As he traveled east on Highway 60, the light reappeared about five miles east of the Lake Wales. This time, there were three lights in the shape of a triangle. He said he kept starting until it disappeared. The distance between where I saw the triangle and where he witnessed it is about 10 miles. For two skeptics to see the same thing, at different times, in slightly different locations, and NOT be able to explain them&hellip; that is strange in itself.

The location was over the ocean, some distance offshore of what would be considered as the Diamondhead or Waikiki/Honolulu area of Oahu. The green light flashed once, then streaked several miles to the left in a split second, flashed brightly once more, then went dark momentarily and flashed dimly once more before disappearing.I watched the area for 5 more minutes but didn&apos;t see another occurrence.Commercial aircraft are always passing through the same airspace as this sighting, and as I watched the area after this sighting there were a number of commercial flights moving slowly across the sky with their characteristic small flashing white lights.

This ballpark is near Poinsettia Ln and Ambrosia Rd in Carlsbad. My concern, if this is the case, is that the lights are extremely bright and too close to Palomar Airport. They are not the normal red and green navigation lights, which could confuse other pilots landing and taking off from the nearby airport. Even if this is a normal plane, which I doubt due to it&apos;s behavior in the sky, these lights were much brighter th! an a small plane would be from that same distance.

I found myself so entranced by the lights that I drifted lanes on the highway.  There is no chance that it was a satellite, or any airplane (not even the fastest conceivable), or a falling star, or an electrical storm, to high in the sky to be anything man made.  I am not the sort of person that really thinks that the earth gets visitors for outer-space, but I cannot logically explain what caused the lights in the sky that I witnessed.  Yes I was by myself and no I was not on any mood or mind altering substance.  I would like an explanation. Thank you for your time.", "Bright light fly over, as bright as Jupiter, no sound.I was exiting my car at the shopping center parking lot where I work, and I look up at the sky as usual to look at the stars and such. I was facing south when the star like object appeared out of the clouds about south south west, it then flew over me, no sound, I grabbed my binoculars to get a closer look, but it was just a bright single light, no blinking aircraft lights, no shape. As it passed over me, the light stayed the same, didn&rsquo;t dim, or face away if it would have been a forward facing lap of an aircraft, then I lost it NNW. It went into clouds.", "A orange color light stationary, then another blinking on almost like car headlights but in the sky and big.  The second light was the first to blink off then a short 5 sec. later the first one went off never reappearing and no sound, both never moving.  They just disappeared.", "UFO with changing shape and erraticly fluid movements appears in view and leaves, shortly followed by an unmarked black helicopter.This is a very brief sighting although I have one more to make with a similar unexplainable incidence. Me and my brother have both recently moved to Bainbridge Island, WA , are students, and as far as I am aware he has never encountered a UFO. I only have the prior encounter I will enter after this one which may not even classify as a UFO. My recent experiences and curiosity sparked my interest into learning of reports in my area of the same object. My memory is not the greatest, and in my report I have included only details I clearly remember. Anything else has been left out and I would not want to add on information that is false, even if by mistake.The incidence occurred at approximately 10:20 PM as I was watching television with my brother. At this time I noticed a low volume sound coming from outside. Curious as to what the noise was I stopped what I was doing, and changed my position. The room we were both in contains large glass windows that cover almost the entirety of the wall. As I changed positions I could see clearly an object that appeared very close to the ground for a plane, yet was not loud enough to be a helicopter. It was of saucer shape and had oval shaped lights which appeared to be of different colors. They seemed to create a haze for the object that was a grey/metallic color. The object swooped into my view for a moment, and then proceeded to shift up and to the side out of my view. The movements were very fluid as if the object was hovering.In a curious yet alarmed state I dashed to the window to see if I could catch another view, this time urging my brother who was before preoccupied, to look with me. The saucer made a swoop back into our direction and view, allowing him to confirm to me that he saw what was making the noise as well. As the object was in my line of sight again it had appeared to have changed shape slightly, becoming more of an oval, until it passed overhead and out of sight. Approximately five minutes later an unmarked black helicopter flew overhead with lights on. I believe my location plays a large role in what we witnessed due to certain companies located around here, and multiple naval bases.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

Just east of the World Drive exchange I could see what almost looked like aircraft lights.  I would have totally brushed it off as an aircraft, as we genearlly have lots of those in the Orlando Area but they didnt seem to move.  The lights were also very close to the ground, and usually landing lights on a jet liner will hit part of the fuselage, and nothing like that was visable.  Ususally large aircraft are not close to the ground at this point, as they are also close to Disney World.. and I think the FAA doesn&apos;t allow large comercial traffic to be low flying above a theme park.  I&apos;m not sure what I was seeing.  There are not any radio towers here, I didnt see anything that looked like a blimp (bowl games.. etc) and there were way too many lights, and too far apart for it to be a helicopter.  Lights were at all three po! ints of the triangle, with one large light in the center pointing down. About 1/2 way between each point was another smaller light.  Nothing flashed, all lights were white. Someone else had to hvae seen this.

It was flying much lower than an airplane. I&apos;m not good with measurements, so I can&apos;t tell you how high it was flying, but it was close. It was disc-shaped and white or silver in color. There was no smoke trail or noise. It appeared to glide very smoothly at a medium pace. I viewed it for approximately 15 seconds, then looked away at the road. When I looked back up, I could no longer locate it. It was fairly cloudy that morning. I don&apos;t know if it disappeared behind the clouds or what, but it was gone.

Across the street from my house. My dog broke out of our back yard and I went out of the house to retrieve him. I was able to get him and at the same time from about 120 feet away I saw three bright white lights and a dime one in the center hovering over my neighbors house approx. 20 feet over his house near a tree.The night was cold and misty the sky very cloudy so it was resting in the cloudy mist that hung some where about 25 to 30 feet above ground, my neighbors house is on a little hill so it is higher than ours. This object was floating like it was observing my dog and I from the distance, and when I notice it, it started to move. It moved very slowly my guest would be about 5 miles per hour and it made no sound and moved as if gravity had no force on it at all. The other strange thing is the very bright white lights on it did not illuminate the trees around it as it glowed.When I first noticed it I thought it was an airplane because I live 15 miles from Birmingham&apos;s AirPort, but the object was quiet and it did not have the normal light features that an airplane would have like the small red and green lights.After, it had pass over and disappeared in the cloudy mist a real airplane flow over my head with the red and green lights that I mentioned and it was very loud.

As we traveled down YY hwy towards hwy 68, I caught sight of the object it quickly disappeared.   Oddly enough when I saw it I thought it was a huge helicopeter landing at the animal adventure ranch.  I made a note of the time which was 6:40 cst.  We traveled on and made it to FF hwy and went westerly.  It was in the western sky when i saw it again, but this time it was a huge fireball.  I kept losing sight of it as it was traveling and I was traveling around curves and trees were blocking me.  The last time I saw the object it was 7:03 I saw it a total of four different times.  Two times it looked to be on fire and thrusting towards salem.   When I saw them for the third time, it was like a big object in the sky on fire.  At one point the fire ball seemed to be half the size of the moon.  It was huge.  I lost sight of the object when we turned right on Hwy 72 towards Rolla, and the Fireball was presumed to go the other direction.  It appeared to be flying at the altitude of  low flying helicopters.  In fact this looked almost exactly like something I saw in 2002 that was reported here, except that object was lime green, and this fireball was orange.", "the object we saw changed multiple colors, hovered/moved like nothing i&apos;ve ever seen. It also seemed to respond to a led light i hadmyself and a friend were on our way back to my house around 2 in the morning when the car we were in got a flat tire. From the spot of the car to the sighting is around 4 miles and we were walking. We have been walking for a little over a hour or so and decided to stop for a little bit to have a cigarette and look over a bridge. After standing for a while about 5-10 minutes looking over the right side of the bridge we decided to start walking home again, when we turned to keep going I looked over the tree line to our left and there was a strange looking light, almost like a star but slightly bigger and not one solid color. As we stood and observed this object it seemed to change colors, from red to purple to blue, and so on. It seemed to be getting closer and then started moving side to side and up and down. I took a chance and grabed a white led light i have on my keychain and flashed it at the object. When i did so it seemed to move more and the lights wer! e still changing. It moved up higher to the left, back down and then went right at the speed it was moving at then like a flash dissapeared to the right. We stood in the road and decided to get out of there and as we came off the bridge i got an erie feeling and before i could say anything my friend said he saw something in the road. I thought i saw something too but it was so dark i coulden&apos;t tell. We had stopped in our tracks from the first time we decided to stop for about a half an hour now and not one car or truck had gone passed us. We couldent turn around or go any other direction so we started to run towards what we thought we saw in the road. Either we scarred it or there was nothing in the road so we continued on our way home. The next day on our way to my house in my car this time there seemed to be the same light changing object over the lake now. When we got to my house it was still visible but by the time we got outside with a camera it was gone. At the north ! end of the lake there is an airforce base, and there is a nava! l statio n on the lake. Anything that has come from the airforce base is very loud, not as fast,and could never hover or move like the object we saw that night.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the source does not indicate that fact.  PD))", "This UFO displayed a bright blue light when flying to the left and a bright red light when flying to the right, moved fast and circled.At approximately 2:50am, while looking Southwest from a business just South of Palomar Airport in Carlsbad, California, a bright blue light in the sky caught my attention while I had been outside walking in a parking lot. The light was at the horizon and seemed far away, like it might be near Interstate 5 or the coastline. However, the light was brighter than it should have been if it was a regular aircraft flying from that far away. It was also quiet, so I assumed it was too far away for me to hear.  The blue light was flying to the left.  That&apos;s what really made me stop to look at it. I thought something was strange about what I was looking at. I work by an airport so I&apos;m used to seeing lights in the sky all the time, but something seemed strange about this one. If an aircraft is flying from the right to my left in front of me, shouldn&apos;t I be seeing a red navigation light? The light slowed and changed colors.  It went from blue to red and flew back to my right.  It appeared to be circling something off in the distance, like a police helicopter. My initial thought was that it WAS a police helicopter, but I was still confused by the lights and the direction of travel. I have this saying to remember which side of an aircraft the lights are on: &quot;Go right ahead.&quot; I think of green meaning &apos;go&apos; and &apos;right&apos; reminds me that green should be on the right side of the plane. As I stood there and watched, I expected to see a white search light come on. It never did. It circled a few times, even seemed to hover. It would moved off quickly again, dipped, and sometimes dipped so low that I couldn&apos;t see it anymore because it dropped below the horizon. It seemed to always be on the move and wouldn&apos;t sit still for long. I was looking over the top of a nearby warehouse, but at such an angle that I was almost level with the roof of the building so I could see the shape of A/C units silhouetted against at the night sky. I kept walking when I lost site! of it and tried to walk to a better vantage point nearby wher! e the bu ildings were not in the way and so that I might have been able to see more sky, but the light never reappeared. I stood watching it for at least a solid minute, maybe two, long enough to see it move back and forth a few times, and for me to think about what I was seeing. Stranger still, even if the navigation lights were somehow switched, I am certain the light was BLUE and not green when flying to the left. I walked by a traffic light soon there after and compared that color to a blue business sign off the side of the road. The light was definitely blue and not green. Thinking back on it, at the moment that it turned, I do believe that I saw a white center light and possibly two very small and dim red/green navigation lights very close together, which seemed right for the distance I thought I was seeing the aircraft at, however once its side faced me, it turned a very bright red flying to the the right, and a very bright blue flying to the left. There were no other aircraft! coming or going from Palomar Airport at the time. Things were pretty quiet with hardly any cars on the road. There were no sirens I could hear, no police cars or ambulances were flying down the road heading towards it. The weather was partially cloudy with a low ceiling. The aircraft was definitely below the clouds. If I had to guess what it was, I would still go with something like a police helicopter, but I&apos;ve never seen them use a light set up light this. It behaved like a helicopter with its movements, circled, dipped, hovered, and moved off very fast, but everything just felt odd. I thought the lights were brighter and different. Back home, I even have a medical helipad nearby in which medical helicopters often land at in the middle of the night. Even close by, the medical helicopter lights were pale by comparison and they would often turn on a search light when landing. I checked my watch when I finally lost sight of the UFO and the time was 2:52am. I didn&apos;t suffer a! ny missing time, didn&apos;t feel any different, other than a bit c! onfused by what I saw now. I&apos;m ex-military and a trained observer. I wish the lights were closer so I could provide more detail. I believe what I was witnessing was maybe 2 to 3 miles away. My best guess would be somewhere along I-5 or the coast between Palomar Airport Road and Poinsettia Lane, closer to Poinsettia.", "Bright Lights in SW suburbs of ChicagoSaw a bright large light up in the sky, then it appeared to be 2 other lights (looked like normal airline flashing lights) near it at first.  After watching it for a little while there appeared to be 5 or 6 of the &quot;airplanes&quot; around it.  All with flashing red &amp; white lights.  Bright large light disappeared and reappeared about 2 miles away towards Mokena/New Lenox area.When I stopped to look into the sky again I saw the flashing what looked like airplanes all over the sky. When one appeared to be close to the ground, I stopped to see if I could hear anything and it passed overhead without any noise.", "Morphing UFO with two smaller orbs seen in broad daylight - Orbs w/fantastic speed /maneuversHad taken my indoors cat outside with me for some fresh air and a bit of sunshine.  I was on the telephone at the time also, so this sighting did not get my fullest attention sorry to say because this was extraordinary!  I&apos;m always looking up and on that day, I happened to see the most unusual and hard to describe object!  It was white with a few appendages - at first.  I thought it was very strange and told my friend about it and then had to check to see that the cat wasn&apos;t escaping over the fence.  I was trying to convince who I was speaking to of what I was seeing, and after seeing the cat was ok I looked back up at the object.  It had been and was hovering in the same NE position.  What I saw next was that the things shape had changed and was changing. I then noticed that two other smaller orbs were either coming out of this thing or were coming from behind it because I had not noticed them before.  I focused in on the biggest of the 2 smaller orbs once ! they came into view.  This orb seemed to kind of change energy fields(?) because of its appearance like a forcefield around it, then rotated clockwise 3 times and in an instant darted downward angling to the left at a remarkable speed and then stopped (between but lower below the other two objects) and they all stayed in their relative positions.  It was almost as if it KNEW it had my undivided attention! Two more times this happened- the smaller objects darted in different directions/angles.  I was excitedly on the phone giving this account to my friend but couldn&apos;t convince them of my NOT having a rational explanation of this event.  At that time I decided to get my son from inside the house so he could witness this.  I put my head in the door to yell to him then turned around but they were gone!  I did some research on this and the closest thing resembling this sighting is the &quot;Strange Morphing UFO&quot; in Mexico that is on YouTube with the exception that my object was CLOUD ! -white color, and the orbs in my sighting were making some inc! redible maneuvers.  Please feel free to contact me if any questions.  PS I also saw a fast moving orb near a commercial airliner an hour or two before this.Time and date are approx.

Have u ever heard of a door being marked with red, green, blue lights? Why didn&rsquo;t I notice it when I was driving the other way?  I think the blue light was on top and the red and green was on the bottom, this is 2 years ago so I don&rsquo;t exactly remember how the order of the colors was.I was on my way from Notodden in Norway to Porsgrun.Could it be that this was some beings not humans that chased me, and those lights where coming from  landed craft?

I noticed what I thought was a big bird in the sky traveling from south to north. I thought to myself that was a really large bird. I stood up and noticed that there were two of them. Then I realized that each object had six lights, 3 on each side and the objects were triangular in shape and had rounded tips. They were very slow moving and made absolutely no sound at all. One of the objects was positioned slightly in front of the other. Then I notice that these objects where completely blocking my view of the stars in that particular area. The sky and stars in that area were distorted and then they suddenly disappeared.

I live on the top of Queen Anne in Seattle and see passenger planes flying over hourly on any given day.

This campsite is appoximately 8k feet in elevation with no cell phone reception nor many lights. It was around 23:00 hours and we were looking up at the sky and how clear it was. I saw a white star like object pass slowly across the sky and pointed it out to him, saying it was a satellite, as I have observed satellites in the past.We sat for approximately 10 more minutes looking up at the sky, as we observed 2 more satellites pass by during this time. Each one moved across the sky at a steady rate of speed in a continuous, uninterrupted direction.About a minute or so later, we observed another star like object. This object moved as the other satellites previously had, at a steady speed and direction. Yet about 2/3 of the way across the sky, the object made a 45 degree sharp turn, continuing at the same rate of speed it had been moving at, but now headed in a southern direction. We both witnessed this and both of us turned to each other in astonishment.", "Rectangular craft observed in Hemet CaliforniaI walked out of my home to have a smoke. I walked around to my living room window because I could see the TV through it and Dextor was on.  I looked up and noticed that the stars were very clear.  Out of the corner of my eye I saw something moving, when I focused my eyes on the object I noticed a rectangular shaped craft moving silently with the long side being the leading edge.  It appeared to be two squares connected together with a faint dark green glow outlining the two squares. The light of the half-moon helped me make it out.  It didn&apos;t seem to have any bright running lights, it was very stealth like. It appeared to be very large, at least the size of a tennis court, but it&apos;s hard to judge size when it&apos;s in the sky, especially at night.  Being very surprised at what I was observing, I tried to track it, but after the object was obstructed from my view by the tree in my front yard, it was gone.

At first I thought it was a plane, or other known craft, but something about it was not quite right. It was descending towards an area where there was certainly no place to land, and it was too low.  I watched it for about 10 seconds or less, and then it simply vanished. Its vanishing point was above the tree line.  That is when I thought it was almost certainly something odd.I drove about 500 more yards forward, and parked in the parking lot of the Stinson Mt. Grill, and scanned the skies. I saw nothing else. Other cars passing by at that point didn&apos;t seem to be alert or disturbed by anything.

I am not published as I do not have that aspiration, nor do I seek notoriety for my point of knowledge.Briefly, we have been and are continually &ldquo;visited&rdquo; by those who intend no harm, but are seeking to communicate to us, the insanity of our ways.  Those &ldquo;visiting&rdquo;, have been in contact with the world governing class and have articulated their concern as nuclear aggression and the probability of detonation of those weapons on a large scale does effect the &ldquo;space&rdquo; where they are resident.As many of you who are well versed in quantum science and have knowledge of the &ldquo;visitors&rdquo;, there are certain understandings that must be embraced.  An important item of knowledge and professional trust we must embrace, as we, the inhabitants of our planet, share a common space with various forms of energy, mass and conductivity.  Within the energy, mass and conductivity are media and presence that is (1) unseen, (2) unheard) and (3) un-quantified.In its simplest description of fact, we are constantly, consistently and collectively aware there is a determined perception, postulated by the governing classes of the world; Un-identified Flying Objects do not exist. However, also within fact, they do exist.  The state of technology being used and that that has been given to us for many years allows &ldquo;them&rdquo; to come and go effortlessly, hidden beyond our visual color spectrum and below and above our frequency aspect.  In the same manner we have been given &ldquo;stealth technology&rdquo; and have used it successfully, &ldquo;they&rdquo; surpass the level of technology currently available to us.Their being and lack of presence is purposeful.  However, from time to time, with purpose, they make their presence known through frequency modulation into our &ldquo;band width&rdquo; of frequency perception and within our &ldquo;spectrum&rdquo; of visual color range.  Occasionally, the &ldquo;sightings&rdquo; are seen because of technological components that malfunction, causing the frequency and color range to fall within our ranges of sight, hearing and quantification.  It is clear; there is an ever present presence by the &ldquo;visitors&rdquo;.  There are an infinite number of parallel &ldquo;space&rdquo; that is occupied and is bound by frequency aspect and color spectrum that is different than ours.There is much to know and understand.  But, knowing and understanding the &ldquo;visitors&rdquo; are here is not adequate.  We must challenge our governments worldwide to clearly state the truths as they know them.  There is an alliance between the &ldquo;visitors&rdquo; and those in the world governing class.  The &ldquo;visitors&rdquo; have been asked to cooperate with the world governing class and have shown great reserve as they believe the world is on a course that threatens the existence of the world population and at the same time threatens the &ldquo;space&rdquo; occupied by the &ldquo;visitors&rdquo;.  We need be clear in our understanding, nuclear holocaust or open physical contact with the &ldquo;visitors&rdquo; will occur in the very near future.

Looked up in the night sky to the North and saw a series of strobe lights stationary in the sky (looked like 5 or six lights in a series) fairly low in the horizon.

As i passed the object out of my site, i took the next available exit to backtrack and investigate. I turned off into this vacant parking lot, parked and got out of my car. There at cloud level, above and out in front of me a ways, was this hovering object, silent, with 3 white lights. I looked through my binoculars and could hardly see what the object was. It was a very very dark object, I grabbed my digital camera and took a couple of pictures. After about 20 mintutes of dealing with object, i got in my car asnd proceeded home, which was about 30 miles away. When i got home and parked on the street in front of my home, I opened my car, only to look up and see this triangular object in the sky about cloud level near my home. This gets more bizzarre, during the Monday Ni! ght Football game on the 14th of Dec, between the 49ers and Cardinals, i decided gto go to the 7/11 store down the street from me. Before i made a right turn down the street, i noticed a vehicle in the sky, at a distance in front of me, it had a white light and a red strobbing light, as i made the right turn, i noticed the object began to move in the direction i was moving. As I sped up, so would the object, when i slowed down, so would the object. The street I was on comes to a T, where you have to make a right or make a left, I made a illegal U turn to see what the object would do, and to my amazement, the object was again going the same direction i was going, I hurried home and didnt even go to the 7/11 store because i was totally frightened. Since then every night when i go out , after about 15-20 minutes, these objects appear at a distance and track my every move, go in the same direction that i go. So to keep my sanity,  I asked my sister in law and nephew to take a r! ide with me and witness what i have been witnessing, and sure ! enough, they did see what i been seeing for the past week, they are one hundred percent sure as i am that i&apos;m being tracked. Why? I have no clue, how long will it continue? I have no clue. But i do know it&apos;s happening, i have witnesses.

I saw it moved then suddenly this circle turn into a triangle model, then slowly started moving ...i still couldn&apos;t move my hand or body but as i look it gone far away from me i started moving then i took the camera and take few short but it was gone. since then i got headache, having really weird dream in which i see strange shapes(circles, triangle,then something like visualisation abt strange waves of shapes changing) numbers(i hates maths to be honest) this numbers form some of the weird equations(or something like that form) then a place where place were big clouds and explosions happening (guess its in space) and finally strange circles connected to each others(like in a watch the mechanical wheel) moving clockwise.

I met people and few times i cried becoz i felt their pain..it all weird just want all this to stop and i want my normal life.other time i get happy other time i get sad its all related to person i meet..so right now i have no idea what im feeling. i take few days off and sitting inside my room and not seeing anyone. had medicine taken but still i dunno its there its been  only three days and i already feeling like i will loose my mind", "6 orange lights over walsall/bloxwich England.I was looking out of the back window of the house and could initially see 3 orange lights.

They traversed the entire sky in about two minutes.There was no sound and their brightness was comparable to that of the North star or the planets. They were larger in appearance than the point of light that you get from a satellite.I do not think that they were in our atmosphere because they were illuminated by the sun almost like the satellites I&apos;ve seen.

It was 4:30am and I figured I&apos;d try to get some sleep; upon going to the bedroom I went to the bathroom first.  Something told me to look out that window.  My eyes looked directly under the tree across the street, which I might add, I live in a development.  There I saw hovering about 3-4 feet above the ground which looked to me like sparkly bright orange atoms trying to cling together, shaped in a circular formation.Well, I thought &quot;hmm&quot; must me a UFO. I hurried to my window behind my bed to see if I could see it from a different prospective.  After running around like a crazy woman, I decided to go to the front door. This was the morning before the storm and it was quite windy, but some how I missed it getting daylight.  Seems I had missing time; anyway, I looked around and didn&apos;t see it, then my eyes were drawn upward, above my neighbors house across the street only this time it was white, and it seemed to be dancing in mid air.It definately knew that I was watching it and I knew it was watching me.  It moved left to right and right to left, upward and inward, then came to a dead stop.  It was about 2-3 houses high and hovered just by the brim of the tree tops.  Then, suddenly, it started to back upward slowly real high like a dot in the sky. At that point I thought &quot;Oh, is a plane coming?&quot; yet there was no sound.  Then I heard a plane, and it passed over in front of it.  After it passed, guess what?  The ufo came slowly back down, right in the same exact spot in front of my house!   By this time it was a few minutes after 6am or 1800, as I ran to try to find my camera, I don&apos;t own a camcorder. Franticly, and unfortunately, I couldn&apos;t locate it.

Back down the stairs I go. It was glowing from behind it a bluish and amber color and there was a red dot to the right of it.  The neighbors were leaving for work and yet didn&apos;t see this!  Then I had the idea to see if I could play with it, because that&rsquo;s how close it was and I felt a connection with it.  I started bending my body in different directions at the waist, and each time the ufo would move in that direction.The feeling that overwhelmed me was a feeling of love, understanding and peace and just an abundant amount of love to the point tears started rolling down my cheeks.Then I thought, &quot;Stop playing with my head and show me your craft.&quot;  I heard a hummmmm and then it stopped, and the white ufo came even down closer below the tree line and between the roofs of my neighbors two houses and poooff, out of the white came a boomerang craft &quot;straight forward&quot; and &quot;flipped&quot; on its side (as if you were making a peace sign with your fingers).  Let me tell you, I remember it happened so quickly, that I gasped!  Then I said &quot;Thank you, you have a very nice craft now don&apos;t hurt yourself.&quot; (lol). I know it sounds crazy, but it&rsquo;s the gods honest truth. I used &apos;rule of thumb, to measure&apos; at arms width.Then after standing on its side and me eyeballing it for a good minute or so, like it was showing me its metallic etched craft it flipped back down and went backwards and into a white light again.

My girlfriend said that the red light I saw on the craft must have been some sort of laser, and that they gave me a lasor treatment; for the next week after that I was seeing &quot;Colors&quot; HUGE blots of burgandy and black while sitting on my patio, everywhere I looked. So, I went to the eye doctor, told him of the incident.

At the time of the sighting, my husband and I were outside just gazing at the sky and talking.  He asked me, &quot;Did you just see those three lights.&quot;  I said, &quot;Yes, I am watching them right now.&quot;  We continued to watch.  Afterwards we notified several family members who were reluctant to believe our experience.  Here is our description of the event:  These objects were flying southwest to northeast and took approximately 5-7 seconds to fly from one side of the sky to the next.  The speed they flew appeared to be much faster than that of an airplane or other type of air craft.  The objects were all circular, bright lights, but were dimmer than stars.  They looked approximately 4 or 5 times the size that your average star appears to look in the sky.  We did not hear a sound when we saw them flying in the sky, like you would from any type of aircraft. They first flew in a formation.

(130kms North of Ottawa)Around 0030 hours on Thursday, November 19th 2009, I went outside to smoke a cigarette and a bright white light caught my attention; it was distinctly brighter than everything else in the sky. As I paid closer attention to it I noticed a sort of red light emanating from one of its sides and a bluish hue that seemed to be on the underside of the object. It appeared to be hovering but was not completely stationary, it kept repeating a kind of circular, or wave pattern, at regular interval, about every two or three minutes. I was puzzled by it and ended up staying outside for 45 minutes-or-so, observing it circle around in a similar fashion to a mosquito, or a fly, or something. It was getting cold, so I decided to go back inside to get binoculars or something but I don&rsquo;t have very powerful ones so figured they would not be of much use. I went back outside less than an hour later (around 01:45) and, to my surprise, the object was still there hovering around. The white light was still bright but the red and blue ones had become intermittent, only visible for short periods of time over several minutes; the predominant light (white one) appeared to have acquired a yellowish-orange color. (The first time I was outside it remained a very bright, clear, white; aside from the red and blue lights/reflections or whatever they were)  The object appeared to be so far, and high up, I can&rsquo;t even estimate the distance or the altitude other than it was a good couple kilometers up in the sky and at least 15kms away from my position. I don&rsquo;t really know what to say about the shape because it didn&rsquo;t always look the same: sometimes the bright white light was shaped kind of like the letter &ldquo;C&rdquo;, sometimes it looked more triangular in form and the rest of the time like a cylinder standing on its end. There did seem to be two distinct parts to the object, though, like there was something obstructing the light in the middle?? At some point when it was closer the first time I saw it, I thought I saw like a kind of pompon on the top but I wasn&rsquo;t able to see that again so it could have been some effect with the light. Also, the main light was throbbing, it would get a little dimmer and become bright again; this cycle lasted about 1 or 2 seconds, like a kid flipping a light switch continuously (this was observable the who! le time).

It was mid to late winter or early spring of 2009.My location: Intersection of 108th AVE NE and NE 12th Place at the north edge of McCormick Park on the west side of 108th AVE NE in Bellevue, WA. NE 12th Place is a small dead end side street and not to be confused with NE 12th Street, which is immediately to the south. NE 12th Street is the boundary between urban downtown Bellevue to the south and the suburban/residential area to the north. McCormick Park is a very narrow park that runs on the north side of NE 12th Street between 106th Place NE and 112th Street NE.Weather: Very overcast. No wind. Dark, except for street lighting.Duration of observation: 40 to 45 seconds?  Circumstances/description:  I was walking my dog at about 1:30 in the morning. I had just crossed NE 12th Street on the west side of 108th AVE NE and had reached the north boundary of McCormick Park which abuts NE 12th Place.  I was about to turn west into the park when I looked north up 108th AVE NE and saw two steady (not flashing or strobing) bright white lights about 50 to 60 feet off the ground. These lights were about street width apart (I will say 20 feet -- 108th AVE NE is one lane in each direction there). They were apparently rigidly connected and moving right down the street in my direction. I will put their speed at 20 to 30 miles per hour, 35 tops.I sort of partially hid myself behind a tree next to the street and watched the lights come right down the street toward me (again about 50 to 60 feet up). There was absolutely no visible structure there of any kind, even though I was really squinting and trying to make something out. The lights were all I could see.  Furthermore, there was no sound of any kind. When the lights got to about 200 feet up the street, they started to turn to their left (my right). I figure they got within about 150 feet distance of me or less at closest approach &ndash; and I still could see nothing but the lights (although they did get dimmer as they started to turn and especially as they started to move away to the northeast). Only at the very closest approach did I hear any kind of sound at all, but I am not sure the sound was coming from what I was looking at. The location I was at is about a half a mile from I-405 and the traffic noise from that distance can be much louder than what I was hearing! at that point. It sounded possibly something like the engine of an ultralight, but exceedingly quiet.As the lights turned they briefly moved to the east perpendicular to 108th AVE NE and finally headed away to the northeast. At some point during this slow-speed maneuver, I did for a fraction of a second get the impression of a dim red light such as you might see in a dark room illuminating part of some possible structure, but it was much to fleeting to make out what I was seeing.Unusual features of object:  1)  Silent or virtually silent.2)  Invisible, except for two bright white steady lights.3)  Moved so slowly a conventional aircraft would have stalled. It could have been a helicopter except for the first two items. I considered, an ultralight, but even an ultralight should have been much louder at closest approach, and even an ultralight would have stalled at that speed &ndash; and an invisible ultralight with bright lights 20 feet apart &ndash; not a chance. I even had a novel theory that I was seeing something tethered beneath a helicopter flying at a much higher altitude, which I did not see because I was preoccupied with what I was seeing in front of me. My guess: my guess is that I was seeing (er &ndash; not seeing) some type of unmanned surveillance aircraft. I am thinking that if a craft did not have to take the weight of a pilot that it would be possible to construct something that would not stall at that speed. Also, there might not be much of a profile to see. There is still the issue that it was VERY quiet, whatever it was, and I still don&rsquo;t understand why I couldn&rsquo;t see any type of structure at all. Note: there was one other person in the immediate vicinity who MIGHT also have seen this. Without going into details, he may have had even a much better view than I did, but I do not know who he is, and have no way of contacting him.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

This night was different however, because I immediately noticed bright lights in the sky in an arrangement similar to the big dipper. My window faces east, so I was looking that direction. This link video footage of exactly what I saw, with a few minor differences: http://www.disclose.tv/action/viewvideo/7790/UFO_RUSSIA__SUMMER_2008_NEWS_BIG_DIPPER_FORMATION/  Like the formation in the video, the formation I saw had only two objects forming the handle, except the formation I saw had the handle tilted diagonally upward. Also, the formation I saw was staying pretty much stationary, with the exception of one of the objects (the lower object in the dipper handle which was sort of swaying back and forth, not in a dramatic way but ever so slightly, and it was this that caught my eye) and the only other difference is that the formation in the video seems to be more tightly packed in, and the formation I saw was a bit more spread out. All the objects I saw were dimming in and out, and the object that was swaying would occasionally flash a dark red.A lot of things I witnessed are similar to the video like the altitude, the brightness and coloration, size, and of course, the formation itself. Off to the right of the dipper formation, were four objects in no particular order or formation that slowly moved together to form a crescent shape or half circle. During this time, the dipper formation stayed in place, dimming in and out. Eventually, the object at the bottom of the crescent began to flash wildly, first in it&rsquo;s &ldquo;natural&rdquo; color, then in dark red and blue. It struck me as sort of like a morse code, or signal of some kind, and I assume it was &ldquo;communicating&rdquo; to the dipper formation, at which point I got spooked and went downstairs to make coffee as this was all a bit too much for me to handle. I&rsquo;ve always been a skeptic about UFOs and this has pretty much shaken up my whole world view. I can no longer deny that UFOs exist. In the video link I provided, it appears that formation is regrouping into separate formations, ! and I can only assume that is the activity that I was witnessing, but I didn&rsquo;t stay to witness the whole incident because I was pretty shaken, so I can&rsquo;t say what eventually happened. When I worked up the courage to come back up to my bedroom and have a look out the window about a half hour later, both the dipper formation and half circle formation had gone, nowhere to be found.", "Saw an orange object flying low silently from the west going north.

I got my binoculars and observed the ducks.  After looking at the ducks, the fluffy clouds caught my attention and I pointed the binoculars aloft.  As I was looking at the clouds, I caught a glimpse of an aircraft.   I observed the object at about 40 degrees above the horizon.  The cloud cover was around 70%.  Initially, (observing for ~ 5 seconds) I thought it was a jet, however; I observed no wings.  It was traveling about as fast a slow jet.  Then I lost it in the clouds.  It briefly came out of the clouds (for another 5 seconds) &ndash; same observation.  Back in the clouds, and back out for about another 5 seconds, same observation &ndash; then gone. My binoculars are Nikon Monarchs 10x42 6 degree.  I probably would not have seen the object with the necked eye, which means it was probably &frac14; to &frac12; mile away (guess).  What really caught my eye was the color &ndash; bright red.  The color of the rest of the object appeared to be non-shiny silver.  The object was flying south west into the sun.  Later my wife said that the red was a reflection of the sun.  No way &ndash; it was like it was painted with red paint. The object was cylindrical with the front part about twice as big as the rear.

The shape was pure, perfect and unbroken. The object was also a pure brilliant white.  There was absolutely no sound at all.  The weather was a clear still evening. The width of the object was approximately twice that of the moon.  I lost sight of the object as it was obscured by trees to my left.  The object travelled in a perfectly straight trajectory.

While standing on the back deck of the house I noticed what first appeared to be a bright star in the north western part of the sky, maybe fifteen degrees from the horizon.  This places it over Lake Ontario. The light was a white-yellow, slightly larger than the visible stars at the time.  It moved at a constant, blazing speed, from northwest to south.  It appeared too far out in space to be a satellite and traveled too fast.  The object did not burn up or gravitate towards earth, but continued in a straight line through space.  In about forty-five seconds it had covered the entire horizon and faded away.

I could hear it was that big, because some strange sounds came from as it was on the &quot;floor&quot; and the sounds where like when spit is released in the mouth!! I have heard those electronic sounds once before, and it was on a radio program that clamed it was the way the stomach sound when it has got food and work with the food.!!  The sounds where extremely loud, but also extremely clear, with an amazing sound quality.. I can tell because I have been working with music and sound studios.The sounds came from everywhere and not the best surround system in the world could make a surround like that. And the stereo in the living room could NEVER have made such a sound. Beside it had grounding problems so I would have heard the humming.BUT: Somewhere higher up in this huge room we then heard a voice. (male I guess) It sounded very demanding, and it spoke very slowly. But who can tell how many bits it came from the sinking and rising voice pr. Second?! The voice were very deep, and I can not explain, BUT the voice could never come from a human being!!  If I would guess it was a large entity , more than 7 foot tall !!  I would have kept it for my self, if I had been alone.I would have sayd that it was something in my brain, and nothing real. But two persons heard the same, and two persons can`t have the same hallucination!!  These ten seconds is for me my second  &quot;meeting&quot; with UFOs and ETs.  In my childhood my mother and father and five children saw five UFOs. It became headlines in local news, because other people had seen them as well, and UFO Norway took reports.  When they disappeared the speed was outstanding, and that&rsquo;s an understatement! This was around the mid 60s.  I now know that they were hanging over a certain mountain, because they were scrutinizing the NATO northern flanks radar facility in North Cape.

There never was a time when we were watching that the light wave simply blinked out (as if a ground light had been turned off).

It was almost directly above us and it was no longer a bright white light but an oval shaped craft with a square compartment on the bottom that was spinning clockwise.

After a few minutes, we happened to look into the sky and saw a large dish shaped object, dark grey in color, against a green mountain background so we could really see it clearly.  It was about three quarters of a mile away and looked very large to us.  As we looked at it in awe,two smaller objects came out of the rear or side of the large object.

At approx.2139 hrs on 24 Nov 2009, I was watching departing air traffic from MEM pass overhead looking North.  Something caught my eye to the East.  I turned, and saw a Triangle-shaped object that had large dull white lights at all corners.  It was either in a right-hand bank turning North, or it was flying due West at a tilt because I could see the bottom of the object while it was apparently miles to the North of me. It traveled at approx. Mach 1-1.5.  It was completetly silent.  That impacted me quite a bit because being a glider pilot as well, I know that even a glider at higher speeds causes a lot of noise through aerodynamic means as air is &quot;split&quot; around the aircraft. The object passed below a departing CRJ-200 from MEM.  I would love to know if anything was picked up on the aircraft&apos;s TCAS, or by MEM Center.

As we approached the object appeared to be hovering.  I pointed it out to my friend who was driving and said, &quot;What the hell is that!&quot;   At that time we were approaching a stop light on the corner of 3rd and Capital Mall and it was clear the object was moving but very slow.  At that point with all the lights from the freeway and building etc, all we could make out were the lights on the object which I think were red and white.  As we turned left heading South on 3rd Street, the object passed overhead slightly to the rear of the truck and we both clearly saw the triangle shape.  It headed West across the Sacramento River tow! ard the Port of Sacramento which is located in West Sacramento.  We both saw the triangle shape clearly as it passed overhead and we could see a white light in the center of the triangle.  Once it went over the river it tilted to the right and headed in a Northerly direction.  There were no news reports of any kind the next day.

I am a former, licensed aviation maintenance technician, and understand what it takes to make an airplane or helicopter fly. There were no w! ings, no propellers, no form of propulsion, no sound and no additional lights, there was nothing I could see to show cause for this object to be flying. We had barely gotten over the shock of seeing this bright orange object, and sat down in our chairs again, when we looked and here came another one from the exact same direction traveling what appeared to be the exact same path. Once again we jumped from our chairs and ran to the front yard to see the same type of object silhouetted against the  western sky. After it disappeared out of sight, another one appeared within 5-7 minutes.  By now it was too dark to see the shape, only the bright light.

His sighting occurred that day at 8:37 am and lasted approximately 4 to 5 seconds.  His sighting took place while he was driving southbound on Adams Dairy Parkway just before crossing the bridge which leads to Duncan Road.  He had turned onto the Parkway at Jellison Road from his home on Pink Hill Road in Independence.Marge and I were contacted to investigate the sighting as we lived close to the witness.  We arranged to interview the witness on Sunday, November 18, 2007 at 1:00 pm.  I arrived first at the witness&rsquo;s house and met him, his wife, and younger daughter who were watching a football game on television.  John led me to the kitchen to talk.  Before beginning the interview I waited for Marge to arrive which she did within minutes.We proceeded to ask questions of John concerning his sighting while his wife and daughter listened in.  John reported that the object he saw caught his eye because of a metallic-like reflection from the west-facing side of the object.  He thought this was odd as the sun was in the east and the sky was clear and blue.  He later described the object as looking like a derby hat with a flat bottom topped with a dome.  The object did not move, wobble or oscillate, but remained stock still in its position which John estimated to be at about 30 degrees elevation in the southern sky.  The sighting was of short duration so I asked how it finally moved out of view.  John said that it simply disappeared.  One moment there was an object and the next moment it was gone without any apparent movement.Marge asked whether he had a previous sighting of a UFO and John reported that he had only one near Colby, Kansas 17 years prior.   She asked if he had experienced any changes in himself after either sighting, but he said he did not notice any except for difficulty sleeping through the night since this last sighting.We then asked to go to the location of the sighting so we could see the features of the area.  We parked on a side road just before the bridge crossing and all of us (John, his wife, his daughter, Marge, and myself) stood on the corner while John pointed to the location in the southern sky where he had seen the object.  He pointed out the series of lamp posts on the left side of the bridge and said he had gauged the object to be about the apparent size of these lamps but a distance beyond the 4th lamppost so that his impression was that the object was large. We snapped a photo of the sighting area and proceeded to wrap up the investigation at this point.Though John asked us what the object was, I could not give him an answer nor tell him why he was seeing a reflection from the object on a side away from the sun.Report received by MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP - http://ufomig.bravehost.com((NUFORC Note:  We express our sincere gratitude to the MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP, and to its Director, BARBARA BECKER, for their having shared this report with our Center.

We see commercial aircraft everyday and also military aircraft but on specific coerces.  I would approximate the size of the vehicle at the given altitude to be approx length and wing span of a 737 but definitely! a polygon shape.None of the Characteristics listed on your website were applicable", "flashing blue/green light over Monroe, GA.My brother called me outside to look at something in the sky.  We decided it wasn&apos;t a star when it started pulsing and flashing blue and green.  It was fairly far away but it was a perfectly clear night.  It moved fast in a zig zag pattern and then moved up fast, and stayed there for a while, not moving.  This morning we got up again to look before the sun came up and it was in a different place again, but it was still there.", "bright lights above us that lit up the night sky with no noise from the objectWhile driving home from shopping we were on the Hallowell Litchfield Road about 1/2 mile from the intersection of Northern Avenue and Hallowell Litchfield Road we encountered an object approx 200 to 300 feet above us that illuminated lights that lit up the whole area like it was day time.  We slowed down to get a look at what it was but was unable to make out the object because of the bright lights but their was no noise from what ever the object was above us and then the lights went off and we broke sight from the object.", "its was 10:52 pm three brownish-orange circles with a dark center appeared in a triangular formation for around ten seconds.Three of my friends and I were laying down on a trampoline at one of the friend&apos;s house at 10:52 PM. It was a pretty moonlit night. We were all looking at the stars and then one person declares, &quot;Oh my God!&quot; In the sky, we see three circles, a brownish orange in color, flying from the north-west. The were in a triangular formation, flying equidistant from each other. In between the circles was black and whenever it passed a star, you were not able to see the stars. It was also noiseless.It lasted for around ten seconds before it disappeared in the south-east direction.", "Cool blue fast flying cross shaped machine doing unbelievable gymnastics in the low sky at sunset.This craft was the same color as the last one I reported to you.  It was the color of the blue part of the flame in your cigarette lighter.  The outside of the flame is orange red, but the inside of the flame is beautiful blue.  Just like this.This craft came closer to my house this time.  I am not sure it was the same type of craft I saw last time since this one had a head and a tail and seemed to be in the shape of a diamond, or cross.  It also had running lights on the outstretched wings and tail.I am reporting this sighting to you because no conventional aircraft could maneuver the skies the way this guy did.  Like my last report, the craft went around the mountain just north east of the Reagan presidential library in Simi Valley, CA.This time the craft was doing some very beautiful and tricky flying.  All of us saw it.  I called my roommate Alex so he saw it too.  It feels good that so many of us saw it in the back yard.  Alex and I were the only adults.  The rest were children ranging from 4 years to 12 years.It occurs to me that my grandson&rsquo;s father works for a company that manufactures government drones not too far from this site and this may be a test run of one of their machines.  I only know that this thing moved very fast and circled the area of over 3 miles in seconds doing acrobatics whilst in flight.  It was cool.

Then disappeared and reappeared at the bottom left side of the moon. As we watched, it slowly started moving downward.  At a closer look you could see flashing red lights moving in a circular motion horizontally.  After a few minutes the object started to fade and eventually disappeared.When it was first noticed, it looked as if the light from the moon was being reflected off of the object.  It&apos;s shape was not very distinct, but appeared flat and round.  We have recently been interested by this subject and are not sure if this has played a role in our sighting.  Whether it was actually seen or just a hallucination is not determined between us but we both witnessed and described matching details to each other.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The sky was dark and clear with stars and a nearly full moon brightly shining in the high eastern sky.  I have a deck that faces SW and I have a nice piece of sky to view down to approx 20 degrees off the horizon to that direction.  I was watching some high commercial aircraft traffic on the Victor Airway above my house flying as usual from SW to NE, when I noticed directly above my deck a much brighter than usual star-like object moving slowly to the SW and then I noticed it had no strobes or navigation lights.  So I discerned this was a satellite and watched it for approx 10 seconds until it stopped for approx 3 seconds with no change in luminescence,  then quickly it did a 90 degree turn to the left or easterly from its original course lasting approx 2 seconds. It then turn 90 degrees again to the right and proceeded on a SW direction, then it seemed to speed up and disappea! red as to gain altitude and I lost visual reference.  So as a private pilot for over thirty years I can tell you that judging altitudes at night is nearly impossible but had to be somewhere above 40,000 ft.  No particular shape, sounds or other distinctions were observed because of the altitude.  The one distinction that I can make is this was no known aircraft in my inventory of my knowledge that can maneuver as this did.", "sightind and abduction on country road.We were going out to photograph, at night, blindly shooting down into gulleys  and streams, hollows and deep inside walled areas of trees.  Our hope was too catch animals off guard and maybe get interesting pictures. I was using a flash, on each and shot over a hundred pictures that night.We left at 8,30   Throughout  the entire evening,  we felt only that a calming ride in the country had occurred with possibly some good pictures . Pictures we&apos;d view in the morning  on the computer. The next morning when I looked through them enlarging them on  photo gallery, I saw the two pictures and a few others.  I&apos;m sending. 4 that night that I had no memory,, of taking.We had no memory at all of anything seen in the images, the craft, or the thing in front of the car.    No memory of being stopped.    We returned on the next night thinking something cool had happened seeing a UFO and  thought since we were unharmed it would be safe to return. The next night we went we had similar results, a few more pictures that were strange even more frightening because of the activity in front of our car that could not be made out clearly.We were  slightly worried but more curious about the ship we had seen twice in the pictures. and after a few more days thought again it might be safe, so we returned with tape recorders in the car.And the things on the tapes were muffled but a few areas crystal clear,  one of these was our talking on the tape, and then the car stopping suddenly, the doors came open and my wife was drug out with a whimper, and the sound of me struggling in my seat unable to speak went on for some time, possibly 10 seconds, there was a humming sound in two short bursts, and I was heard struggling no longer, in fact neither of us  were heard.There is a point where a voice makes a sexual reference, one sentence,,  and then that yea their dumb.  Afterward, some time later( yea there almost ready. )  the sounds of  arranging equipment? Like picking up stuff , closing a container, etc. Within the next minute we start the car, pull away driving again, and resume the conversation we had been having before the incident.We returned home, ready for sleep, having no idea anything had occurred.  We had by mid-night the beginning of severe abdominal pain and rectal pain as well, identical. These conditions lasted for the better part of three days.  This and the things found on the tape made it clear what  had possibly  taken place .Again photos were in the large set ,of only a odd shaped vehicle outside the car stirring up dust.  Its strange sound on the tape.  There were other things said so disturbing to us, I destroyed the tapes.  The photos I&apos;m sending are the clearest free of dust flakes that made the others unidentifiable.  We experienced a time loss of roughly an hour two times at least.During a recent  hospital trip a small round polished bead the size of a BB, the airgun ammo, was seen in my sinus cavity in a  x-ray.  Also, I have a hole on the back of my neck, near my hairline, that a  sewing needle could be inserted almost its whole length, eye first with no pain.  No blood or discharge of any kind.  It can still be seen.", "Two objects over West Palm Beach Florida. One changed shape and both disappearedApproximately 9am 11/2/2009 I received a call from two of my workers on a job site claiming they saw two UFO&apos;s. They asked if I could see them from where I was. Not able to locate the UFO&apos;s I drove about 10 minutes to their location where I saw my two workers and about a dozen residents of the location on the 2nd floor of a high rise condo looking up. They described two objects, one bright red the other white, neither one blinking. One sitting still white the other circling. I always carry binoculars with me and was able to locate the two objects they described.The two objects were directly overhead, very high in the sky but their exact height was difficult to determine as there were no clouds, blue sky and no other aircraft in the area to allow proportion.My first thought was that the objects were lost helium balloons but it was unusual that one was motionless and and stationary while the red object seemed to drift away from the white object. After several minutes the red object drifted back toward the white object, follow a semi circle around the white object, drift away then disappear.Convinced these were balloons I left the jobsite, residents still looking skyward, drove about a mile, stopped my truck, called my wife who was about 5 miles from my location to see if she could see the remaining object. Not having a clue as to how large an object this was or how high I figured if she could see it that far away then a) we weren&apos;t imagining anything or b) the object obviously had some size to it. After telling her where to look she spotted it also.We both watched for about 15 seconds, her naked eyes and me though my binoculars when the object started getting very bright, change from a spherical shape to a more elongated cigar type shape, get very fuzzy or almost mirage-like then disappear.My wife described exactly what I was viewing through the binoculars. My workers radioed the same exact description. The object,which appeared to be white then silverish blinked, got very bright, dimmed, became elongated then fuzzy then disappeared.I tried to use my camera phone to record it but the objects were too high to get any type of accurate recorded visual. Also tried to place the lens of the camera phone up to the binocular eyepiece, which sometimes works but the objects were too difficult to locate.The entire sighting was about 20 minutes.", "Driving south on Rt.1 through Chadds Ford, Pa. on black Friday (day after Thanksgiving).  Before passing Longwood Gardens on the way to Oxford, Pa, I witnessed a large, bright shape in sky to my southwest.  It was blue, white, yellow &amp; green. It had a white tail, like a shooting star.  It was almost like the Girl Scout symbol in shape.  I know, since the road was crowded, others saw the same thing.  It didn&apos;t seem to be documented on the news or in print.", "Rectangular shaped object with two rows of light formations traveling erratically, using 90 degree turns and hovering in the sky.I am a mother of two young children; I don&rsquo;t drink or do drugs, am not taking any medication or have any problems with my eyesight.  At approximately 2100 hours on the night of December 5th 2009, I went out on my back porch to smoke a cigarette. It was a clear night, the moon was low over the horizon and it was approximately 25 degrees. After about a minute, I looked across my backyard to the sky above a single story duplex that is almost directly across from my back porch. When I looked up I saw a dark rectangular shaped mass, but it had a slight point to the front center.  Along the underside there were two perfectly aligned rows of 5 or 6 star-like lights. They traveled in perfect formation so I know that they were a part of the larger object. There was no noise, and because of the temperature and the hour I do not think it was a glider/parachute, etc.I watched this object for approximately one minute and thirty seconds. At first it glided closer to me in a very tight S pattern, making very sharp 90 degree turns. It was traveling South Southwest at a moderate speed, at one point it stopped completely and hovered above another duplex for a few seconds. I could tell because the lights were still and it looked to have one end lower down than the other, and that&rsquo;s when I saw the rows of dim lights. After it hovered a few seconds it rose straight up in the sky, I could still see the light formations on the bottom. It slowly started traveling southwest again, and then it disappeared completely. It moved like nothing I have ever seen. The sharp angles of its turns and the speed at which it rose straight up into the sky were completely foreign, not to mention how it disappeared right in front of me. Shortly after, maybe 5 minutes later, I saw a plane traveling in the opposite direction that the object was traveling. The plane had! flashing blue, red, and white lights and left a trail.", "Odd light in sky over North Brooklyn, New York.Bright light in night sky.  Cannot tell how far away it was.

After a second I looked in the sky and saw it.First, a red light popped up, out of nowhere, then another, until there was four red lights, in a horizontal line; which kind of looked like a bar. Then in the same order, the lights went out and it disappeared. That is what I saw. The whole thing lasted about 45 seconds.My mom and I started talking and she said that she saw the same thing, but white lights. I don&rsquo;t know what that means. The entire ride home, we were looking for it, to see if maybe it was an airplane or something like that. It was definitely nowhere to be found.I was a little scared, excited and in disbelief.

It was just unexpected.", "flaming ball moves slow and turns on a dimeAbout 6:20 PM, Saturday Nov. 15, 2008 I walked out onto my porch to have a cigarette. While I was lighting it I looked up and saw a dark area with an immensely large orange light towards its rear. I thought &quot;wow, that plane has HUGE lights&quot; and continued my smoking. While I watched it slowly move eastward (my porch faces south) something didn&apos;t seem quite right as the orange glow was Way too large and a plane would have not taken that long to travel such a short distance as it had.If I had to guess general location, I would say coming from the west, south of Bremerton but north of Tacoma in a straight path eastward.So I went inside, told my husband that something just isn&apos;t right with this thing I&apos;ve been watching, it looks like its on fire, and pulled out the binoculars. As I focused in for a closer look, my husband came out to see what i was talking about. The plane/dark object indeed seemed to have the entire tail end of it encased in an orange flaming mass (round mass, mind you.. there were no tendrils or trails.. more like liquid fire contained in a glass ball). I handed the binoculars to my husband who took a long look as well. I thought maybe I should call the airport, then thought that they would probably have a dead-on view of it anyway. We sat and watched it continue eastward .. it seemed to slow and then just &apos;hang&apos; in the sky for about 10 seconds before heading straight south.  It did not turn south, it ended its eastward movement and began its southward movement (the phrase &apos;turn on a dime&apos; comes to mind).If I held my arms out in front of me with one finger at the point where I first notice this object and the other where the eastward movement terminated.. it measures a measly 15-16 inches between. Thus far it has been a good 20 minutes.The southward movement was faster than the eastward. It seemed it would pass directly over Tacoma, the bright ball getting somewhat smaller as it went. When it looked as though it was flying over the Centralia/Chehalis area, the fire went out but I could barely make out a dark grey/black dot which seemed to descend rapidly for a second before I couldn&apos;t see it anymore. I don&apos;t know if anyone else saw this... but I&apos;m sure someone had to have seen it. I contacted King 5 news via their tip line.. but never heard anything.", "Lights north of tucson/maranaI was waiting for a ride at about 7:00pm.

Last night was the 2nd or 3rd time my 13 year old has seen these lights in the night sky, but my first full experience.We were driving home and the lights just appeared (there were other planes flying in the area and these were not the same kind of lights).  They had a sort of yellowish glow and there were 3 at first in a triangular shape all the same brightness and then they just faded out, next they lit up one at a time but in 3 different spots and then just faded away.After that, the lights took the shape of a half moon and lit up one right after the other in rapid succession from top to bottom then bottom to top (sort of like a tail of a huge firework, there were none in the area).  After the half moon shape, they lit up straight up and down lighting up in rapid succession again and then fading out, followed by the lights lighting up in 3 different spots again shaped sort of like a triangle and then fading out.We weren&rsquo;t close enough to see anything other than the lights, but my 13  year old has seen this same thing before above the field in the back of our home???", "dark human-like figure that was glowing orange around it and floatingI was sitting on the living room couch talking with my husband and my 8 year old son was in the front yard. I saw flickers of an orange glow reflecting off of a box on the porch, though the living room window.I opened the door to see what it was when I saw my son standing past the end of the east side of the house, staring at the porch. I asked him what he was doing and what was going on. He walked quickly over to me and proceeded to tell me what he saw. He was crying and shaking and very scared. He said he saw a dark figure with really big, dark eyes, with an orange glow all around it. He said it looked like it was floating just a little off of the ground, came from behind my car and went next to the house and turned and looked at him. He said it then floated higher, and was about the height of the Christmas lights hanging on the porch. He said it looked at him. He slightly turned his head and closed his eyes briefly because he was scared. When he looked back it was gone.He said whatever he saw was about as tall as he is (about 4 feet). He said he couldn&rsquo;t see its legs and its arms appeared to be straight down beside its body. He said its face was very dark and its eyes were really big and a slightly different color than the face. He said it glowed all around it. I estimate he was 40 to 50 feet from the entity, given where he was and where he said he saw it. I was during the daytime, at approximately 4:00 p.m. I saw the flickering orange glow for about 3 seconds and my son saw it for about 10 seconds.We live in a wooded area, have dogs in the back, and they did not bark at all. However, when I called my husband out to tell him what happened and to look for it, my small house dog came out and immediately started smelling the ground where my son said the entity had been floating.I am of sound mind, I have never seen or heard of anything like this before, and I am very curious and somewhat confused about what happened.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she seemed sincere, and sober-minded, in our opinion.

Several sightings afterward.Kim, Terri, and I were driving to Nikki&apos;s house, Kim&apos;s cousin (about 6:30pm). We were all about 17-18 years old and it was Valentine&apos;s day.  Nikki and Kim were living about a 1/2 mile from each other in a remote farming area.  It was dark and the roads were icy.Kim&apos;s mother had reported numerous times to her family that there was a UFO that followed her to work daily.  Each morning the lit object would wait for her above the mail box and one day, she claims the object beamed down a light and flew over the hood of her car.  On one hand, I believed her because she is an honest &quot;no nonsense&quot; person, but on the other hand, it&apos;s definately something you need to see to believe!  Kim began seeing the object after her mother woke her up and pointed it out to her one morning.TO NOTE:  Kim has an uncle that is very paranoid of aliens being able to see him at night, to the point of shooting out the overhead farm lights.  He lived about 6-7 miles away.  My mother bought a telescope to watch the skies after seeing UFO&apos;s over Lake Miltona in the 80&apos;s.  My uncle has seen UFO&apos;s in Park Rapids, MN while jogging along wooded trails.  I have several friends and aquaintances who claim to have seen UFO&apos;s (about 10).  My husband says he used to watch UFO&apos;s while having field parties in Miltona in the early 90&apos;s.On Feb. 14th at about 6:30pm, my friends and I picked up Nikki.  Terri was driving and Kim was in the passenger seat.  I was sitting in the back seat of a 4-door car.  When we pulled into the driveway, Kim yelled, &quot;See, there it is!  That&apos;s what I&apos;ve been seeing!&quot;  We all observed a UFO hovering above the silo.  Nikki had also seen it and immediately jumped into the back seat.  The object was round and white in appearance.  Although it was bright, the light appeared to be self-contained, meaning that it didn&apos;t emit light like a flashlight or lightbulb.When we drove away, the object came straight down from the sky and then followed along-side the vehicle.  It was about the size of our car.  It followed along the ditches, move up over trees and power lines, then would dip back down along side us.  It was icy and we took back roads (gravel) for 8 miles to my mother&apos;s house in Miltona, MN.  All of us were hysterical and crying, yelling at Terri to drive faster.  There was no other traffic on the gravel roads and but Terri had to drive slowly.Once we hit Highway 14, the object moved higher up into the sky and moved behind us.  A large beam of light came down like a helicopter spotlight. I felt like something snapped in my brain. I&apos;m not sure how to explain it, but it seemed nearly audible.This is the point at which I&apos;m not sure exactly what happened.  I&apos;m not sure if I imagined what COULD have happened,or if it actually DID happen.  The car was stopped. No one was screaming or crying and everyone else was staring straight ahead, motionless.  There wasn&apos;t any lights on the dash, no clock, etc., and the car wasn&apos;t running. I think there was a small man (being) next to my car door.  We had locked all the doors upon seeing the UFO.  The man telepathically told me to open the door and I refused.  It said, &quot;We&apos;re going to get in anyway.  Make it easier on yourself and unlock the door.&quot;  I reached over and unlocked it and don&apos;t remember anything else. BUT, it was as if we DIDN&apos;T stop the car. The light had come out and chased us, closing in on us slowly, and just when it was almost on top of us, a car came from the other direction and it was gone in a flash, going in the other direction.I had regression hypnosis to help me remember this incident, and as it turns out, I&apos;m just one of those people who can&apos;t be hypnotised. What luck! But, I was able to recall details just from simply telling the story to the hypnotist over and over again. It seemed that each time I could remember another small little detail. But, when it comes to the spot where I&apos;m not sure if we stopped or not, I was confused each time. I simply came up with, &quot;and then it was gone and we went to my house.&quot; My friend also had hypnosis and swears that she and her cousin were taken up into a spaceship. I was not present at her hypnosis session, but she said it was pretty intense.Over the next two months or so, I saw the UFO several times at my house (daily, sometimes). It would come after dark and it seemed immediately after I fell asleep. I would wake up feeling as though something was staring intently at me and would open my eyes to see it outside my window. It would change shapes to the shape of the moon (half moon, crescent, full moon, etc.) and would also change colors (white, yellow, orange). It did not have flashing colors, but would be one full color at a time. Once, it turned blood red as I reached for the phone to report it to the police as a sighting. I was scared to go to sleep and felt like no one could possibly identify with me what I was going through.I eventually saw it less and less, but did start seeing it again about 3 years ago, spurring me to pursue the hypnosis. Before the hypnosis session, I swear that I woke to a female alien standing next to my bed reaching over my abdomin area. A few hours later I woke up laying crosswise on my bed without the covers on. I also had an incident where I woke up sleep walking, chasing a very short man out of my room. I dismissed it as a dream, but after going to the bathroom to take a drink of water, I noticed that the UFO was, once again, sitting outside the window! CRAZY! A few days later, I saw the UFO in daylight gliding across the sky. It did this for a few minutes, then quickly made a right angle and dashed away. That time I could see it was cigar-shaped, not round. I was curious as to whether or not other cars driving on the highway also saw it, but I guess I&apos;ll never know. I haven&apos;t seen it for quite some time now.", "Saw a chevron of lights moving from north to south while watching for the Leonid meteor shower.Early on the morning of Tuesday, November 17th, 2009 I woke up early in order to go outside and catch a glimpse of the Leonid meteor shower.

I had swept the sky a couple of times in order to avoid missing any.  When I turned from the east and was facing almost due west, I looked straight up and something caught my eye. I saw one meteor and then something else.  When I focused on it I saw a total of five dim dots, perhaps lights, arranged in a V, or chevron.  I could not tell their altitude so determining speed is nearly impossible.  They were moving from the north to the south in a very smooth and straight line.

It looked like separate lights  (you could see dark between the lights making it look like segmented lighting) lined up in a row slightly curved to the east.  The object  brightened in intensity then faded quickly and was not visible (this sighting lasted 7-10 seconds).  We both watched the area and then the same type of object started to appear again approx. 6 miles south of where this last object had disappeared from. It was not as bright and faded quickly and was not visible (this second sighting lasted maybe 4-6 seconds).The object was located over the Armargosa Mountain Range in Death Valley (the ridge line of the mountain was still quite visible).  I did a compass bearing after the sighting which was 29 degrees (declination set to 15 east) from Stovepipe Wells Village. The line of sight runs from Stovepipe to Corkscrew Peak to Armargosa Mountain Range to North of Beatty, Nv.We watch the International Space Station and Space Shuttle quite often from here. Neither of these were visible tonight in the Death Valley area (11/17/2009) in checking the ISS Human Space Flight Site.The size of the object is what amazed us!   The Space Station and Space Shuttle (even when docked together ) are just large moving (non-blinking) lights in the sky.  And regular aircraft in the area are just small to moderate blinking lights in the sky.

It took off so fast and we were left confused as to what the hell what we had just saw. It seemed to leave a quick trail of light as it blasted off.

Clear skies, daytime.This sighting occurred in June 1983 in Borger, Texas.  I had not reported this earlier because at the time it occurred I had no corroborating witnesses, no photographs, essentially nothing to substantiate the claim.  I doubted that anyone would have believed what I saw at the time.  However, this sighting stays in the back of my mind, so I am reporting it, if for no other reason, than to have closure.The sighting occurred about 17:30 (Local Time, Central Time Zone) in June 1983.  I was in my residence and heard what I thought was a really, really, loud jet.  It was so loud that I stepped out on my front porch to see what it was.  I looked up and the object was probably one-half mile away at an altitude of probably two thousand feet.  (These are only estimations.)   It was huge.I had a pair of 10 X 35 binoculars in the living room, so I quickly stepped back inside and grabbed the binoculars.  By that time the object was receding, so I might have been better off not using the binoculars.  I remember the object filled the binocular&rsquo;s field of view, which at the time made me wonder just how big this thing actually was.What I saw was a large black boomerang-shaped object, moving from east to west.  It was travelling at a modest speed, maybe 200 miles per hour (again, it&rsquo;s hard to estimate something in the sky without reference points.)  I remember as I looked at the object, there were three specific things that struck me.  The first was the size&hellip;I can only guess that it was 300-400 feet side-to-side and maybe 75-125 feet front-to-back.  The second was the tremendous noise the object made.  It was LOUD.  And, third, the fact that the object was lopsided; that is to say it was asymmetrical.  I wondered how it stayed in the air&hellip;it didn&rsquo;t look aerodynamic.I think another reason I never reported this is the fact that it sounded like a really large jet.  Maybe it was&hellip;if so, it was like nothing I had seen before and have not seen since.  The jet sound made me think it was a conventional aircraft, but the shape and the size made me think it was something beyond classification. I did not notice any exhaust or smoke behind the craft.Since then I have seen video of the A1 bomber and other stealth aircraft.  On one occasion I saw an A1 pass directly overhead.  Believe me, the thing I saw in 1983 makes the A1 look like a toy.By definition, what I saw was a UFO, because it was not identified, it was flying and it was an object.  Whether it was of terrestrial origin or somewhere else, I don&rsquo;t know  I wish I did.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

When I looked with my binoculars I could tell the object was no star and no aircraft.  It was a glowing light that changed colors and moved in spurts and when it moved it moved rapidly and not a slow gradual decline.  Eventually it moved past the hills on the horizon and I lost sight of it.  I have no idea what this object was.  They best way I could describe the object was it looked like a oval/diamond shaped object with smooth edges that glowed light a light bulb.

My job in the Marines was TMO 3112. After the attacks on our nation I was detached from my unit and attached to PMO security forces.  I worked the graveyard shift from 1700-0600.  I was stationed at Marine Corps Air Station, Miramar, San Diego, CA.   The evening of my sighting I was placed on duty, alone, to guard a gate on the flight-line.  I can&rsquo;t remember the exact gate number, I believe it was 15, but I do know that it was at the north end where the c-130s were parked.  I had been on Security forces for awhile and I had a routine way of keeping myself alert and awake.  It is a severely punishable offence to fall asleep on post. I would take caffeine pills throughout the night and practice drill movements if I felt myself getting tired.On this particular evening I was very alert.  It was particularly cold that night, and being alone on post made me very aware of my surroundings.  The small shack that was my post was not heated, so I would frequently leave the shack and walk the small perimeter of the flight-line that was my post.   On the last of these walks I left my shack and began walking the flight-line.  Something above caught my eye.  As I reverted my gaze upward, I was astonished to see small, bright, circular, orb hovering about 200 yards above the flight-deck.  The object was no bigger than the circumference of my body. I am a female and I stand at about 65 inches.  In a flash, it shot down and hovered inches above the flight deck. It hovered there for a few moments, and then just as quickly as it came down, it shot back up into the night sky, and was gone.I was unsure of how to go about reporting it.  I logged the sighting in my log book and radioed it in to my command post.  I was almost immediately relieved of my duty at that post, by a Staff NCO.  I was told that I was tired and needed to go home and get some rest, and to report back for duty the following evening.  Now that I have fully performed my contract with the Marine Corps I feel that it is time to tell people other than close friends and family.I did not see little green men, or a flying saucer.  I saw what I believe was an unmanned recording device.  I have no reason to lie about what I saw and know that what I saw was real, and I hope that with this report maybe another Marine who was guarding another post on the flight-line that night will come forward.((NUFORC Note:  Date is 2002 is approximate.

These lights were not stationary at any point nor were they ever pretending to be stars. They flew PAST us. They made no noise. They came from seemingly nowhere both times, one light at a time. Perhaps the same light visited us both times.On this night my friend and I were at some weird place we came across called X-9 Ranch... it&apos;s privately owned land within the Saguaro National Park right by the Rincon Mountains. That night we had two very-low flying bright lights visit us -once to say hello and once as we were leaving. The light was completely silent, the object itself was indistinguishable but I believe it was just pure light. One solid bright light like a candle, with smaller flashing colors in or around it. It flew a bit quirky and nervously, as though it was drawn to us against its will. I think the attention we were giving it made it feel uncomfortable.The first light came from the south in the direction of the city. Though we were both looking in that direction when it appeared, neither of us saw where the light originated from nor did we see it approaching from a very far distance - it just became &quot;there&quot;. When this first light came I flashed a high-beam flashlight into the sky (the type that beams through the air and can be seen for miles) at it which caused it to start fly/floating a bit drunkardly. It tried to veer itself away from the B-line on which it was coming towards us. Then it just tried to act cool and fly smoothly, attempting to maintain a more android flashing sequence, floating away like it had not notice us.... but in a &quot;looking out of the corner of it&apos;s eyes&quot; at us sort of way. But it was too late for his ruse! He/it had already been busted out and discovered as some sort of an intelligent life form as it responded to our stimuli (both physical, i.e. flashlight; and mental/verbal, i.e. thought and verbal! command/request).The second light appeared later coming from the north. My friend and I had both agreed it was time to get going. I turned around from my view of the city to look back at the mountain right behind us and coming up from behind the mountain over the top came an identical light to the one from earlier. I said &quot;Look, they came to say goodbye!&quot; My friend turned around and said &quot;Whoa, where the hell did that come from?&quot; I was pleased and we both watched it as it floated/flew awkwardly towards us and jumped a bit in its flight path with the small quickness of a firefly. It was an entity.Oct 20 12:00 am - 6:00 am Oct 21/2009  They perch over the mountains and I drive up to them. Get close to the basin of the mountain and they&apos;ll give you a private show.The night before the previous incident the same friend and I were again late-night hiking, this time around the Catalina mountain area. It was a man-made hiking trail and an easy one at that, however it surrounds it&apos;s hikers on either side with fencing lined with dense bushes on the left to separate the businesses/housing area and on the right... nothing but desert and barbed-wire fencing beginning where the width of the hiking trail ends and no-mans-land begins. This desert shrubbery was particularly unnerving in an exciting sort of way because there are very dense desert trees, bushes, shrubs and so forth mixed with cacti and all sorts of hiding spots that some sort of stalking predatory animal could come out of.... You could just feel it... I sensed we were in &quot;Cat Country&quot;. I told my friend the vibe I was getting and he agreed it could very well be. Never the less we journeyed on.We found a little hidden rock area to chill and watch the stars. I had noticed while we were on the trail two aliens positioned over the mountain. (I just call them aliens, a.k.a UFOs). I had my eye on them and went back to the trail to go see them while my friend stayed on the rocks. I watched them and they were the typical &quot;posers&quot; in the sky; trying to look like stars but completely having trouble staying still and they were VERY responsive to thought. I confirmed that those were my aliens for the night and went back to chill with my friend on the rocks. Before long we heard the screams of some sort of animal - probably a bob cat or a mountain kitty - and we reckoned it was time to go.Before we left I stopped my friend on the trail and said &quot;Look. See those two aliens?&quot; pointing towards them right above the mountain&apos;s top horizon. He said &quot;Yeah I do...&quot; I said &quot;Watch, does it look like they are moving?&quot; The aliens began to wiggle out of their stationary positions in the sky. I moved my arms, like a conductor of an orchestra, and directed them which way to go in the sky. I would lift up my arm and motion to the right, they would fly that way in the sky in tandem. To the left, and the same. Figure 8 too. I said &quot;Are you seeing this?&quot;. He said he did. He was astonished and quiet and humble. He took on the same calm awe that I had seen in my other friend who experienced the same phenomenon with me the first time over the same mountains about a month earlier. They just watched in quiet and seemed accepting of it and me, the crazy girl who thinks she is an alien who brings them to the mountains to play with UFOs.

It was a deep orange color, no wing tip lights or other normal blinking marker lights. I watched for more than 5 minutes as it approached my location growing bigger, before I called to my son. My 19yo son commented that this was very definitely not our normal passenger air traffic, and that is very unsettling. A few moments later the light made a turn to our left and headed do west out over the Pacific Ocean and gained altitude. Just at this moment it seemed to break apart or drip debris. Looked very much like burning embers falling from the object and fading as the fell. Both my son and I felt that this must have been a burning aircraft up until it turned and gained altitude as it headed out to sea. We see a tremendous amount of air traffic (civilian and military) here as well as occasional launches from Vandenberg AFB. This was very definitely not either! Too big to be aircraft and missile launches generally produce a very white light. Waited to report until today as we assumed we would hear about it in the news today.

Our estimated speed prior to the appearance of the object was 60 mph, which increased to 80 mph in our panic of the object.  It stayed right next to the van for 30-45 seconds but it seemed like longer. We went back to where the object had been next to us, to try to locate the object.

At first I thought that the lights were just a really clear constellation, but despite their brightness in comparison to other objects, they were also hazy as if each had a fog around them.Each time that I would look back at the cloud ( I was driving in the same general direction each time) I noticed that something about the formation of the lights would change.  For instance, there would be three lights in stead of five or one light instead of five.  Eventually, there were no lights left in the circular pattern around the cloud, and then the cloud seemed to become brighter than before.  By this time, I had pulled over at an overlook point which provided a decent view of a portion of Medina Lake and turned off the ignition, and I could see that the cloud that I had been watching was over the lake.  I watched as a bright, small line of white light stretched out in the center of the largest point of the cloud (the cloud was comparable in shape to a large turkey baster, with the activity taking place at the &ldquo;bulb&rdquo; of this cloud &ldquo;turkey baster&rdquo;).

After wards and upon checking my compass, I saw that the moon was lying West of me, and the asteroid came roughly from the south heading to the north. I observed this asteroid for approximately 25-30 seconds! Much to my amazement, I could see this asteroid quite clearly, and it was clear enough to see additional features on it. The only thing I am really not sure about is the size of this asteroid when it was going pass the moon and when comparing it with the space station that I once saw in my telescope. If I had to estimate the asteroid size, I would not hesitate to guess its size to be at least 4-5 times the size of space station in length but 1-2 times its size in width. This is clearly an endangerment to the world, and personally, a serious enough threat in my opinion to po! ssibly cause an worldwide extinction if it was to collide with earth. I will now explain and go through the sequence of events of what happened that night.I had just come down the road from my mums, and I was going to my own home. It was almost 9.00 pm when I arrived to my house. As I was arriving, I was thinking about getting the telescope prepared for a night&apos;s viewing. So I went into my back room on the second floor where the telescope was being stored. The room has a large window that faces towards my back yard of where I live which has very little light pollution in that direction. Anyways, the window is always fully opened ventilating the house and keeping the telescope cooled. I have a Sky watcher 4 inch telescope (a run of the mill) with two eyepieces: a 25mm and a 10mm. Well, the 25mm is the one I used for viewing the moon and the sky, and I centered the telescope on the moon. I took a quick glance at the moon, then exited the room to make a cup of tea to drink,  then I went back to the telescope and casually peeked into the eyepiece.The moon had moved and the telescope was out of alignment for viewing the moon. So I carefully moved the telescope back into position as I was looking through the eyepiece. Then I saw this huge shadows of light,and dark like fingers beginning to appear in the telescope. I was saying to myself, &quot;Oh! What&apos;s that as I raised the telescope higher?&quot; I quickly centered right onto this asteroid. &quot;Wow!&quot; That was my first and immediate reaction this asteroid was tumbling slowly. I don&apos;t know how fast this asteroid was going, but it was moving slow enough to allow me to zoom in even more closer to it for viewing. It was Grey in color,and almost like pumice stone in composition, with various pot holes about it while it was tumbling around in a anticlockwise direction. I was mesmerized and captivated by it, I was concentrated on seeing more of  features that was on it.If you allow me to explain in inches hypothetically speaking  could be miles, it was quite oblong in length  if i say inches it could be miles it was 6-7 inches long by 2-3 inches wide, and it was also  quite well rounded as it appeared in the telescope. Then this piece that kept catching my eye was probably about 2 inches down. It would sort of step down, (say half a inch), then along 2 inches (maybe 3 inches), then this piece step back up. in this step down piece. It was almost dusty, and it had some mounds, could be hills!   with a few look-like potholes placed about it. I am able to remember every details of it, so I drew a picture of it afterwards while it was still fresh in my memory.Oh, there is so much to say about this asteroid. Really. Anyways, I was so exited looking at this asteroid tumbling that I accidentally bumped the telescope into the side of my window frame with very much to my dismay. I pulled the telescope towards me to try get another sighting,  and I tried to align the asteroid back into my telescope view, but there was nothing. It was nowhere to be seen. &quot;Wow&quot;, I said to myself. &quot;This asteroid was in my sight for about 25-30 seconds and I still cant believe I saw it&quot;.I went through my kitchen to check on the time. The clock is a bit slow, or it could be a bit fast. Anyways, the clock said 25 minutes past 9 pm (gmt time) on the February 12, 2008. I swear this, it is a true event of that night, and I have no reason to lie. I told all the family, my brother&apos;s friend, I have told everyone i know  I didn&apos;t have a computer with internet access, but now I do.so i can research it , The asteroid is certainly a threat to our well being, and I believe its a cause for concern. &quot;It was anything else than an asteroid. And no way was it space junk or a satellite&quot;,as my local observatory told me. I said it was definately a rock, and they said it could not have been an asteroid. I&apos;m a stone mason by trade, and this was no boulder you might see in the back garden. No one seems to believe me.I&apos;m telling you it was huge. Please help me. These astronomers  in chile pinged some asteroid on the 12th Feb. I don&apos;t know, but this one could have been it. Probably not, but what a coincidence...eh... the 12th here 13th there.maybe they pinged it farther on than the moon i don,t know  Anyways, please help me. I hope this info is of use to you. It was most certainly between our atmosphere and the moon and near earth&apos;s atmosphere. I would say it was traveling southerly to northerly on the time that I stated above. Oh, I live in Dalkieth, Scotland. I must have been in the right place at the right time to get it. These pictures I drew of it are going away because if the asteroid ever gets filmed and i have  drawings,  and if ever gets into the news, they may ask, &quot;How come you drew pictures of it?&quot; well i will say i warned everyone of it  That&apos;s my theory anyways. Although I have little in the way of proof, I know what I saw 100%. Also, I would like to say that I have now emailed a few people about it, and no one seems interested. These big telescopes look deep into space, and the observatory probably missed what is on there own back door. I trust you will give me some addresses, or at least point me in the right direction. I know it happened. There is no dou! bt about that. Are some people trying not to say anything about it because what is the use of putting the public in fear for a near miss? I trust this is not the case, because someone  somewhere must have saw it too. Some  web cam or some video of the night sky somewhere must have filmed it.if its been taped someone somewhere must have it on tape . If they have a tape of that night then it will be on it, if it isnt then it isnt a tape of that night because it should show up 100%.i fell so strongly against people telling me that i could not have saw it because how do they know  stranger thing have been believed  im unsure about the time because my clock is slow i never noticed it till one night when i took a pic of the clock and saw it was prob at least 11 mins slow  against camera time thanks for reading this and watch out if anyone can help you can request my email from the ufo centre.", "Witnessed multi-colored light hanging very low in the sky to the east.

My first thought was that I was seeing lights on top of a tower in the distance because the two lights were blinking one then the other at a slow pace and were brighter than I have ever viewed on an aircraft. As I got closer, within one quarter of mile I realized that there was nothing underneath the lights. The lights were intensely bright still slowly flashing in the same pattern. I eventually drove directly under the lights and was unable to make out the shape of the object in the darkness but did notice smaller flashing lights underneath the two bright lights. The lights under the object were flashing much faster and appeared to be different colors, red, green and white.

I&apos;ve only discussed it with the people involved and a few trusted people in my life.When I was about aged 13 this event occurred. I had been in my house one night while my parents and other family members were out, it was about 8:30 to 9 pm during the summer in the early 1990&apos;s I remember watching television and the power suddenly went out.  I was feeling very uneasy about being alone in the house in the darkness so I decided to go up the block to my friends house as I figured they were not doing anything since the power was out.  My friends came outside with me in their front yard and we were sitting on the block wall talking for about 15 minutes when suddenly the street lights on our block had started to blink on and off.  We thought it to be strange as all the lights were blinking in unison with each other yet the lights within the house were not blinking.  Usually the lamps warm up before they reach full brightness after sunset or when recovering from a power failure.  I had climbed up on the block wall to look over into the other neighborhoods to see if the! streetlights on other streets were blinking as well which they were not.  It was only the ones on our cul de sac. Suddenly coming out of the east very high up in the sky we all observed a red sphere or ball that suddenly stopped and hovered above where we were standing yet it was very very high up and hard to judge exactly how high it was or its size.  The street lamps were still blinking on and off in a Morse code fashion.  After about 2 minutes of this object hovering above us it suddenly took off toward the west which was towards the direction on Red Rock/Spring mountains.  We were baffled, yet we slowly realized between the street lights blinking and this object that we had just witnessed a UFO.  My friends parents were also not home that night.  No other neighbors came out to where we were.  It was the strangest incident in my life. My friends siblings who had staid inside the house had reported that when they were trying to contact their parents on the phone that the phone ! suddenly had when static and they had heard a strange whirring noise d uring the same time we had witnessed this event.  Now these children were strict a Mormon family that were quite average and good people that usually would not believe in such a thing, but were convinced and still convinced they had seen a UFO to this day.

The very first thing we saw looked like a plane, but we realised it was moving much too fast. It looked almost like a V shape with red and green lights with a white glow between each light. The lights on the craft were a vertical rectangle shape.  It whizzed above us in a straight line until we no longer saw it. But after that we saw these tiny lights, they almost looked like stars, but there were some of all different colours, blue, yellow, red, orange. They were silent, non-flashing and moving at top speed. They were very small but they were quite low down. This continued for 5-7 minutes, we could not see where they were coming from. Although we could see the general direction which they came, they seemed to just appear. The last light we saw, however, was quite different from the others. It was bright red, almost glowing. But it didn&rsquo;t move smoothly though the sky like the others, it was almost like a pulsating action that propelled it through the sky rather erratically, although it was moving in the same directions as all the others, it was not moving in a line, rather, hopping from left to right. I was probably the most sceptical person about this sort of thing before last night. But I do like to keep an open mind to other possibilities. At the time I was convinced we were witnessing something quite unusual. What convinces me that it was more than reflection of light or meteorites, is the very first thing we saw that looked too much like a spacecraft, but not enough that I am convinced it was deffinately not a plane. Afterwards we noticed at Brisbane airport (I live on a hill and can see planes taking off and landing) that the airplanes were circling the airport instead of landing like they normally do. After 5 minutes they all landed one by one.", "Cigar shape, bright lights, very fast, low.Cigar shaped. Bright white lights near front and rear. No trail behind. NO SOUND!

After this event there were no other similar happenings along the storm&apos;s track.", "fier like object  moving swiftly in the sky.There was just one it was very bright and silent it was it looked like it was on fire.It was flying very low and swiftly.The sky was very clear.It stopped in mid air for about 2 mins the lights shut off then it light back up and flew up when it was originally flying parallel to us.", "Light far away in sky racing away from a location &amp; back twice to again race away and not returnThis sighting corresponds quite closely to a sighting reported in Salina, Kansas, on 09/20/73.I have estimated a date/year in which this occured.  I am unsure if it was indeed 1976. It could have been 1975.First off, I am a realist.  I don&apos;t fall easily into the ghost/UFO sighting scene, but I know what I saw and it was very unexplainable.I was in my bedroom at approx. 2245 hrs. and just laying in my bed looking out the window when up in the sky in a west southwest direction I observed what at first I thought was a possible satellite.  I was in Boy Scouts at the time and we would always point out a certain satellite that would bounce up and down and change colors.  This object did not change colors but was moving up,down, and back &amp; forth.  Then it raced away towards the North completely out of sight and at an unimaginable rate of speed, but within seconds came back to the approx. area in which it first was.  It then raced off again at an incredible speed and returned again, but this time it came back from a different angle.  Again, it raced off which looked to be a diagonal direction upwards but again to the North.  It never returned. I remained at the window for at least an hour just hoping it would return.My next door neighbors were out of town visiting family in Topeka, Kansas. When they returned, I informed my friend what I had seen and overhearing me was her mother. She informed me that while they were in Topeka that some neighbors of their relatives also saw the exact same thing in the sky.I am now 43 years old and a Deputy Sheriff.  At the time, I was approx. 9-10 years old.  This sighting has always bothered me since that time.  I read all these fantastic reports and they sound really silly.  But what I saw was totally genuine and I would really like to know of similar reports of this sighting.  I can&apos;t be the only one that saw this.  If in Kansas it was also seen, then I would think many people also saw it.  I am very determined to investigate this occurance just to possibly get some answers.", "2 perfectly aligned orbs silently cruise across Navajo Nation skies.On Nov. 25, 2009, at around 1755hrs I had witnessed two perfectly aligned lights gently cross the evening sky near my parents home in Chinle, Az(rural area). I immediately had my parents and kids come join in the viewing of these two lights. Oddly enough they were silently cruising with the leading light ahead of the tailing light with a distance of 100-200ft in between both. Being of past military experience I noticed no FAA required strobes blinking, no sounds were emitted and it kept in perfect alignment throughout the duration. The lead light was 5 times brighter than the tail which suggested  one craft and not two crafts. As stated, no noise of engine propulsion was heard(propellers or jet rumble), no contrails were visible and no flashing light beacons on or near the lights. The estimation of its altitude would be about 2500 to 3000 ft. This viewing lasted about 7 minutes until it lingered out of sight. Keep in mind that the overall light radiance was ! as it appeared, whole orbs. They approached from the northwest direction and departed in a southeastern direction. Seeing how it was dark in the eastern skies, I couldn&rsquo;t make a definite shape of this sighting but as I stress, the front and rear light alignment was perfectly straight.", "Didnt move like a plane or helicopter, too close to be a star.A bright light that dimmed in and out as well as bounced around within a circle with a smaller light flashing around the main light.

I was driving my youngest son&rsquo;s girlfriend home in Northeast Oshawa.  I turned off Ritson north of Rossland-east into the neighborhood. As we drove through the street eastward- I could see a bright intense neon green sphere with outlines of bright white light moving within.  It moved over the roof tops of homes some 20 ft above, or lower.  It moved like a bubble in water and was very slow and bright.  The size look small, but maybe bigger than a basketball to guess.  As I drove watching it and screaming out loud to the kids to look.  My son confirms instantly he sees it !  He was NOT even wearing his glasses, as it was about hundred yards away quite bright.  Witnessed for maybe about 4-5 seconds, as we drove by, we then lost sight of it.-- It was that low over the homes . Needless to say, his girlfriend missed seeing this incredible display.  My son&rsquo;s reaction after dropping his girlfriend off was upsetting !  He said I should not freak out about some burning light, as I was being embarrassing to him.  I just thought it was quite a sight to witness, as it was that intense of light and very close to the roof tops of the homes.  Its movements were strange.  Like a rushing bubble before hitting the surface.  I thought to add a composite to better illustrate.

Not paying too much attention to what was going on, the witness suddenly realized a larger &ldquo;V&rdquo; shaped object in the sky to the immediate west.  The object was otherwise undefined except for the formation of orange lights that surrounded two sides of the object as if it were an illuminated flock of geese.  Besides being illuminated, this formation seemed to be hovering above and not in particular motion in the night sky (mostly clear skies at the time).  After watching the object for a few minutes, the witness ran to his front door and called for his wife to quickly come outside.  When the two returned to the area of visibility, the object was no longer visible.  A few planes entered the area shortly afterwards.  Given the perspective of these known aircraft, it appeared that the unknown object must have been considerably lar! ger and much higher in altitude than the ascending local air traffic.

There were three lights in a &ldquo;V&rdquo; formation which were pale blue in color, and the outer two lights kept changing in their intensity - &ldquo;twinkling&rdquo; in unison, while the center light at the tip of the &ldquo;v&rdquo; remained stable.  Because Denver International Airport is nearby, we thought at first the lights might belong to commercial or private aircraft -- but on closer observation we noticed there were no regulation aviation strobes.  Also, the lights hovered in the same location for the entire 15 minutes we watched.  We went indoors when the cold finally got to us and tried to find a window from which they were visible, but trees blocked our view.", "Very bright flickering lights hovering over mountain ridge in Russian River/Healdsburg, CAThis was our third night in Russian River and I had not seen anything like this the prior two evenings. These lights were far brighter and much larger than any star, airplane, satellite or tower I had ever seen.  It was a straight line of approximately 7-9 lights, flickering rapidly and hovering over the ridge of the mountain.  It appeared to be a disk shaped object. It was much higher than any tree or structure on the side or top of the ridge.  They were the most brilliant lights I have ever seen, and no one in my party of four could come up with a reasonable explanation for them.  Even though the photograph I took is far from doing it justice, it still shows how much brighter this object was compared to everything else in the sky.  It was still hovering when I went to bed at 12:30am, but gone when I awoke at 7:30am.", "New Years Eve Unkown object in the sky above Downtown Austin TexasRight before Midnight on New Years ever, we were standing on 6th street downtown Austin, Texas in front of the Silver New Years eve ball with a big crowd of people. We waiting for the countdown to New Years Eve, there was music playing, people dancing, balloons etc. It was very cold and there fast moving clouds in the sky. The Moon was very Bright that night allowing you to see past the clouds and the stars beyond.I was standing there and looking at the Bright Moon along with a huge search/event light from some event somewhere circling back and forth against the clouds and the sky. As I was watching and starring at the moon, my eyes caught a dark, round dot looking thing moving inside the fast moving clouds. It was hard to see but you can at times clearly see it was round as if watching a perfect dot (circle) in the sky and dark, it was jerking back and forth in different patterns. Moving very fast, back and forth in different patterns and directions. Then it stopped and lit up very bright and it was gone. As soon as I noticed it the first time I pointed it out to my son and my wife. He could not see what I was looking at , at first, then he noticed it right before it lit up and he said after it lit up it took off at a hi rate of speed. My wife was also trying to see it and she got a glimpse of it at the last moment. I was pointing up at it trying to get the crowd to see it, but did! n&rsquo;t notice anyone else looking at it, besides the search/event light would have made them look at that first and distract from the object. Balloons were being released and I compared the object to a balloon but balloons never made it that hi up and would not have been as big at that height.  I work as a computer engineer; my son is active duty army. The object was directly above us when noticed. If it was a balloon it would have been much smaller and harder to see at that height, along with why did it light up then disappear?", "Green spherical object  travels downward from north to southI was driving on the Francestown Turnpike, a two lane road without much traffic, in a westerly direction at the eastern edge of Francestown, NH at around 6:05 PM on Dec. 12th 09. It was dark outside with high cloud cover. However, visibility to the cloud cover was very good. At the top right hand side of my front window I noticed a green, nearly perfectly sphere shaped object cross to my left going downward. It moved faster than an airplane would, in close to a straight line at around a 30 degree angle with respect to the ground. The sighting lasted between 3-5 seconds and then it was behind trees some 100 ft. in the distance. The rate and angle of descent was unlike any aircraft I have ever seen. There is no airport in the direction of the sighting. It is unclear how far away the object was or what its actual size was since I had no point of reference. The object was between the size of a green pea and a chick pea held at arms length. It was uniformly a lum! inous green in color, not bright or directional, as an aircraft light might be. The center area of the object appeared to have a slightly less greenish color, but the object did appear otherwise to be perfectly spherical. In general, the object appeared to be traveling from north to south, but exact directions were impossible to determine. There was no sound (windows rolled up) and no hint of any crash. Nothing was reported on local news about this incident or any type of airplane crash. I was returning from shopping and had nothing to drink that would impair my judgement. I observe commercial jetliners overflying this road at night on a regular basis heading towards Manchester, NH airport. Manchester airport is situated to the east behind my direction of travel. This object was unlike anything I have observed in many decades of watching the night sky. The object was definitely not a meteor. A meteor often has a streaky appearance, sometimes a tail and in my experience they! are never uniform spheres with defined edges. This object was! clearly in the unidentified category based upon my experience. It is the only object I&apos;ve ever observed that I could not readily explain.", "Vertical pinkish light shaft pulsing brighter and duller in night sky for almost 2 hoursU(F)O sighting Friday Dec. 4, 2009  At 17:50 while walking my dog in our neighborhood in McMurray, PA I noticed a stream or stick of light very high in the sky.  It seemed to be thin and cylindrical (perhaps cigar, but did not appear to taper at the ends) and was positioned vertically and slightly tilted at the top so that the whole was at an angle.   It was very diffuse light (cloud cover?) that seemed peach or pale pink.  When studied I noted that areas of the &lsquo;stick&rsquo; had pulsing or throbbing light coming from it, again very diffuse so could not be identified as a particular light source.  The shaft was alone in the sky without any other light shaft attached (to the ground or elsewhere).It was in the southeast region of the area and quite high.  A small plane flew overhead while I was looking at the &lsquo;stick&rsquo; and it was well below the &lsquo;stick&rsquo;.  The object did not move and remained in position.  If divided into quarters, the top second quarter was usually hard to see as if blocked by cloud.  The light got brighter and duller.  I stopped at a neighbor&rsquo;s house and she and her husband came out and also looked at it and commented on the size, shape, and areas of brighter and duller light.  The object was very long and certainly if side by side with the moon would have been at least as tall as the moon.  Because it was such a narrow shaft of light it seemed about as thick as a plane jet stream that you can see during the day although perhaps even slimmer than that.When I checked the sky at about 19:00 hours it was still present, but I could not get a photo with my digital camera.  At 19:40 a different neighbor called from her cell phone to chat while walking her dog.  I asked her to look in the sky and tell me if she saw the light object.  She described a long shaft of light &ldquo;kind of pink&rdquo; that&rsquo;s going &ldquo;on and off&rdquo;.When I went outside to try again to take a photo at 20:10, it was no longer present.", "The UFO was black, with red lights and strange markings on it.My Dad his brothers sister and his Dad were driving back from thier friends place and there was a small swamp/lagoon with long reeds around it and in it that they used to go to.that night they saw lights, thier car lights went off and the engine stopped. there were lights (red) and strange markings on it the dogs were barking and horses were neighing they recorded it all, i saw it but they lost the recording soon after.the next day all the reeds were flat in a triangular shape.", "Cuban cigar shape- bright lightI don&apos;t know why but i was just thinking of what i have seen two years ago and i can&apos;t get it out of my had so i decided to write this to somebody maybe it will help someone, it was about ten a clock at the evening when i got out of the restaurant to take a small break from work and as i was watching the sky i soo extream brihth white lite that was shaped as cuban cigar very long amd wide it was about two km from me i would gess it was about 100-400m long, but the strangest thing off all it came out of the water at the angle non plan can fly almost 90 degrees and it flue at the sky in few seconds ..and thats it i finaly told someone else but my parents... sorry for my bad english and gramatic errors.

I guess I should off but I was so nervous at what I was looking at that I froze.  I&apos;m sure someone else must of seen it.  My neighbors assume that perhaps they were making a movie and this was a movie event in the sky.  People are afraid to talk about this event.  Movie makers inform  in advance that a movie will be shot at what time and ask to move all cars. There was no such request,and movies would not make such noise at that time of night.

I decided to go out for a smoke before bed. It was about 4:45 am or so. I live in a suburban area about 20 minutes drive from an active airport.  My house is directly under a flight path and many planes fly overhead on a daily basis. I am very familiar with the appearance of planes flying at night. I can recognize them at varying distances, in all weather conditions including foggy nights, (I live in a very foggy place.)  If it is visible I can usually say if it is a plane, because of the light colour and flashing patterns that are common to them. Anyway, around 4:45 some time in late October of 2009. I was outside having a smoke. It was a clear night and I was admiring the stars I could see from my porch and the drone of the nearby airport, contemplating the shape of the Universe, after watching some videos of lectures regarding the subject. Suddenly there was a thick arc of white light which bent from the sky toward the ground as if it were and arc fitting nicely into a 90 degree angle. I could not see if it stopped beyond the horizon as the treeline was obstructing my view. I have observed both meteors and satellites with the naked eye. They do not resemble what I saw. This was a thick white streak at least several meters wide, and quite distant. Though what was most impressive was the speed at which it traveled. I saw the &apos;object&apos; for no more than a second. And it initially appeared quite high in the sky, a little lower than the moon.  It appeared as a white arcing flash of light which left a trail that subsided  pretty well instantaneously. I was awestruck and my first thoughts were: &ldquo;What?-So fast!&rdquo; The other thing that struck me was the odd blur on the periphery of the arc. Perhaps it was a natural phenomenon, like none I had prior seen. But my guess it was some sort of gravity manipulating craft. This is partly based upon my understanding of theoretical propulsion systems, and some of the more credible reports I have read regarding US and Canadian government activities involving UFOs.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

At approximately 4:30 in the afternoon I looked to my left (north) and noticed an object that looked like a box that was turned on its corner and was rotating at a fast speed on that corner. It changed colors as the sun glistened off of its surface. I estimate that the object was half a mile away. It looked to be about one hundred feet in the air. I thought the object might be a balloon or a kite but the prevailing winds were from the west and the object was moving west. As the object moved to the west it remained level in flight and it neither rose or lowered in elevation.  I watched the object for about three minutes and decided to go inside to get my binoculars.

As I saw the third one the first one disappeared, and by the time I saw the fourth one, the first two already disappeared.  It happened so quickly within 7 seconds or so.  I felt that they are peaceful and playful.  After they all disappeared inside the bright area.  I still saw the illuminated sky for a while.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We stopped to observe it by the south end of town.  We obsevred the craft and seen that it was tear-drop shaped and that at the round bottom there were for lights one in front, one in back, and two on each side.  we had only seen the shape of the craft because of the lights on the craft.  The bottom of the craft where the lights were situated spun making the lights flicker.  This craft wasn&apos;t anything that we had both seen before.  We observed the lights in the same for about 20 minutes.  It then moved a little to the west and stayed in that place for about 5. In the last remaining minutes we seen the craft disappear.", "Triangle Crafts over Kearney, NebraskaI was sitting on the deck of our house in Kearney Nebraska and my husband was walking towards me from the garage to the south west of the deck when I noticed 3 black triangle shaped crafts flying towards the house. I screamed for my husband to look, and pointed at the sky. We watched these three crafts, silently fly from south to north over our house and then head east. They were very low; I could see them against the orange glow from the city lights. There were no lights of any kind on the crafts.", "3 starlike objects in triangular formation change direction of vector across the sky.During the night of August 1st from 1:30 am until 2:30 am  I was standing in the driveway of my sisters house.  I observed approximately 15 shooting stars during that time. when the rate of observations slowed to nearly none I when into the house for the night. The next night I wanted to see if there would be more shooting stars.  I went outside at 2:00 am and stood in the same driveway and was watching the sky for shooting stars.  Although there weren&apos;t nearly as many shooting stars on this night , there were a few to see. every shooting star would zip by in an instant, if I wasnt looking in the right direction at the right time I would not have seen them.  In the country you can see the entire sky is filled with stars when there are no clouds in the area and there weren&apos;t any those two nights.  I was looking in the eastern direction when almost directly above me I noticed three &quot;starlike&quot; objects (lights) in a triangular formation, two objects following behind o! ne lead object moving across the sky.  At the first instant it was hard to notice their movement but it was soon evident.  They were moving slowly, unlike any shooting star. after approx. 15 seconds I watched then change their vector. originally they were moving toward the north then they turned toward the northeast. I watched them until they went past the horizon. the total time I was able to see them was 45 seconds.  I took note of the time and date and will never forget it.  Satellites dont travel in 3&apos;s nor do they change direction.  I have no Idea what they could have been.", "Strange light in sky flared up, then split into four objects, then faded.While riding in car with my boyfriend, I noticed a very bright object in the western sky.  This object seemed to &quot;flare&quot; - the light became fire-like. I pointed it out to my boyfriend, and we saw, immediately after this, the object quickly became three objects, then four.  Each object seemed to float slowly downward, and each light faded, and then re-illuminated - each one repeated this numerous times.  At first we thought this was an airplane which potentially caught fire, however, we ruled this out because there was no smoke, and the new objects were lights, not fireballs. Plus, each object faded, and then re-illuminated several times.", "UFO orbs appear during intense MCV thunderstormI&apos;m senior in college at Missouri State University.  I was sleeping in because it was dead day, Friday May 8, which is always study day the Friday before finals.  I was woken up by tornado sirens and a really terrible thunderstorm at 9am.  The power was also out.  We get really bad thunderstorms but this one took the cake.  From www.weather.com/newscenter/stormwatch/:  &quot;MCV becomes - Inland Hurricane:  May 8, 2009 brought a derecho, a widespread windstorm associated with a bow echo thunderstorm complex, along a 600-mile-long, 60-mile wide swath across southeast KS, south MO, and south IL. Many of the damaging winds were not with the leading line of severe thunderstorm, but rather behind it and beneath a mid-level rotation center called an MCV - mesoscale convective vortex. Winds gusted to 106 mph. At least 220,000 customers lost power in MO and IL. The system spawned more than 30 tornadoes, at 20 of them in southwest MO. EF3 tornadoes hit Howell County MO and Garrard County KY.&quot;  This storm was crazy.  It was pounding my off campus apartment.  I could hear pieces of metal siding being ripped off the building.  It was the weirdest thing...the winds were blowing straight at the building, driving the rain around the edges of the sliding glass door and spraying my living room with water.  I was freaking out.  It was very intense, and I was frantically trying to figure out how to keep the water out.  The winds began to calm down a bit, and I was running around my apartment trying to find the memory card to my camera.  I&apos;m a sort of an amateur meteorologist and love taking storm photos.  I&apos;m a photography and graphic design major, and I have a Canon 40d with a number of lenses, including a solid zoom 100-400mm L.  However, I couldn&apos;t find my 16gb memory card and nearly ripped my apartment apart trying to find it.  I couldn&apos;t even find my backup 4gb card, which was odd, because its always in my bag. After several minutes of frantic searching, I stopped for some reason, in my living room, turned to my right, and out the back sliding glass door window was the weirdest sight.  It was like an orb shaped thing, combined with a fireball, perhaps a few miles in the distance hovering beyond the middle school behind my apartment.  It was really weird because it seemed to be wiggly...like it had waves coming off of it that were vibrating.  It was bright white, and the edges seemed to be yellowish orange.  The first thing I thought was that something exploded in mid air, and this is where my memory is a little fuzzy because I&apos;m reporting this many months later (which I&apos;ll explain soon).  I&apos;m pretty sure that another one appeared on the sides of it, which made me think it was an aircraft.  Sometimes aircraft fly under thunderstorms to avoid the dangerous updrafts.  But the way the lights radiated was just too weird.  Then they each disappeared, one by one, quickly.  What ticked me ! off the most was that even though I had my camera around my neck, I couldn&apos;t take a photo!  Gaaahh!  Ridiculous.  So I grab my iPhone, text my fiance and roommate to tell them what happened, and then looked up Springfield&apos;s airport website to find arrival / departure times.  There were no planes landing near the time that I saw the lights, and Springfield, being a small town of 150k, it doesn&apos;t get many large aircraft landing during the day.  Also the lights didn&apos;t seem to be moving in any direction, and if they were coming head on, that wouldn&apos;t make any sense either, because the airport is on the NE fringe of town and I was right in the middle of town, and even though its a small town, its spread out over 88 square miles because they don&apos;t know how to build up in these small towns.  The other explanation would be ball lightning, which hasn&apos;t been scientifically proven to exist, but has been observed by many people in the past. So here is some background info on why I&apos;m posting this so far after the fact: tonight I was watching UFO Hunters on the History channel and they showed these orbs on there that have been occuring in the Ozarks around Springfield this year and some of the video and artist&apos;s renditions looked a lot like what I saw and it freaked me out.  I didn&apos;t get the same feeling of dread when I saw it that other people have reported, but I did feel like I was frozen and couldn&apos;t move.  It was pretty wild.  They also reported about a light on the north side of town, and I also believe I have seen this light before when driving back in forth to Bolivar, MO to see my friends at SBU.  It just seems too bright and out of place for that area of the sky and I only notice it sometimes.  I feel like I have a fairly solid grasp of astronomy, having taken a college course where we had to learn about heavenly objects and went out to Baker Observatory (which ironically is near Marshfield, where on UF! O hunters a highway patrolman reported an orb following him) on several occasions to observe the night sky.  My dad was also an amateur astronomer when I was younger and we would go outside and look at the stars frequently. I&apos;m also not a crazy UFO person, but a fairly rational college student.  However, I feel like I have some sort of odd connection with UFOs.  When I was in elementary school I would have horrible horrible night terrors of being abducted by aliens and when I was in 10th grade, I had another encounter I&apos;d like to share.  Feel free to remove this for the reporting post but I want to submit it along with this for completeness:  My best friend and I were driving home late on a Thursday night from the movies near midnight, which was my curfew in 10th grade.  My best friend is very smart, an Eagle Scout and a member of the Stretch program at school for highly intelligent students.  We were both in advanced placement programs for math and literature.   Since it was so long ago (2001-2002?) I can&apos;t remember the date at all. We were waiting at a red light at 7hwy and 40hwy in Blue Springs, MO, a suburb of Kansas City.  We saw three orb lights, in a triangle formation, float over the HyVee grocery store, turn while crossing 40hwy, and then float over the WalMart.  Then they suddenly zoomed off at incredibly high speed in the direction of my house.  The way they moved made us feel like they were attached.  Both of us saw the lights and were a bit freaked out.  That&apos;s when things started to get really crazy.  As we continued down 40 hwy and the other two roads [road names REDACTED, since it&apos;s near my parent! s house], nearly every single street light we passed by suddenly went out.  It was making us very scared, especially since we were in a convertible.  My friend pulled into the circle drive I lived on, and dropped me off at the bottom of the driveway.  Before getting out, I noted that it was 11:55pm, before curfew, since I was worried about getting back in time.  When I got inside, my dad half-joked that I was late (it wasn&apos;t a serious violation) and I said &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;  I looked at the time and it was 12:05am.  I was so confused.  How did it take me 10 minutes to walk inside?  I went straight inside.  So I talked to my friend the next day and he told me something pretty interesting (and scary).  Apparently when he was at the stop sign to leave my circle drive, he saw a bright flash in his rear view mirror.  He turns around, and he said he couldn&apos;t see me anywhere.  He then drove away quickly, which at the time ticked me off that he just left me like that.  ! That about freaked the hell out of me. I&apos;ve only told these stories to a few people, but figured that I might as well come forward now.  I bet there are a lot of normal people out there, like me, who would never google UFO reports and actually type up something like this and send it in because they would think that they must be crazy.  But I am starting to think that there is something to this whole UFO thing and that if I didn&apos;t share this, then I wouldn&apos;t be helping anyone figure out what&apos;s going on.  I also got my accurate times for the first report from the messaging app on my iPhone.  I sent the text to my fiance right after the event (and I also sent her one right after I awoke to tornado sirens, she lived in the Kansas City area at the time) and it was logged in the app.  Honestly, I have no idea what&apos;s going on, but its starting to freak me out a bit that stuff that I&apos;ve seen is showing up on TV in the town I live in when I thought that there must be a rational explanation.  I just can&apos;t get my mind aroun! d the idea that there are aliens flying around the earth.  It just doesn&apos;t seem possible.  I just thought that was something to be scared of as a child, like monsters or the boogie man.  If it&apos;s proven that aliens are real, then it&apos;s going to be really hard for me to deal with that.  It just doesn&apos;t make sense!  Why would they even appear like this or take people?  What is the motive?  Are they bored?  Why not just come down and show themselves?  Are they just having fun with us?  It is so weird that other people have seen something similar to what I saw.  It is even more weird that there have been enough people seeing things that a UFO tv show came to this town to interview people.  I wish they would go away because now I&apos;m fearful of their presence and my possible connection to them.  Also my mom told me a couple years ago that my grandpa used to see ufos, strage lights, and would awake in the middle of the night, at the window, sleepwalking, talking to them outside the w! indow.  My mom saw a ufo with them when she was younger, hover! ing over a car in a parking lot late one night.  That was probably sometime in the late 70s early 80s.  Is there something about my family that attracts them?  Or is it a coincidence?  Sorry for the rambling, I&apos;ve got a huge project due in the morning and it&apos;s getting late!  Time to get back to work...feel free to edit this to make it more cohesive for online consumption.

My friend has a house with a hilltop behind it.  Almost every night for a week we would go to the hill top to star watch.  On one of our first nights my friend, whom I traveled with and I witnessed two fast moving steady lights that seemed very very far up..much higher then any plane.  There was a local airport and planes went in and out of the area - but you could hear the engines and see their blinking lights - this was nothing like that - they were gliding silent and moving at a very fast rate very high up in the night sky.On a succession of nights we had a camera with us and started out just taking pictures of us and then up at the night sky to capture the stars.  The first few nights we took pictures with the flash and got some strange objects.  Orb like orange and blue oval shapes and some other glowing objects - which at first seemed like we had maybe caught some &apos;alien objects&apos; and we were excited .. but then being the skeptic I dismissed as dust, beetles or dragon flies caught in the flash. Some if you zoom in clearly appear like they could be bugs..others ?? Not sure what they are.Any way, one of those nights when we where showing the pictures we had just taken to our friend who owns the home - we had gone back inside - and had our back to the window that faced the hill - but he was facing the window - He yelled and jumped up because he saw a bright beam of light come down behind the hill.  He&apos;s lived there for years and has seen plenty of shooting stars and meteor showers..this he said was nothing like that.  we were too scared to go out and look - though he wanted to.  We did searched around the next morning around the hill but saw nothing.On the final night of our visit it  - was a clear night with lots of visible stars,  my friend and I had gone up to the hill and I said &apos;ok let me prove my bugs in flash theory - look I&apos;m going to take pictures with out the flash and show you that there really isn&apos;t anything out there..&apos;  So I took a series of pictures pointing up into the sky with out the flash.  Then I decided to run some video clips from camera again with out flash. I held the camera to the sky and let it run. Even though my eyes could see the stars the camera&apos;s screen really wasn&apos;t strong enough to pick up the light of the distant stars except for one very faintly. As the first clip was about to end and I was getting ready to leave the hill a very bright light zigged zagged up from the far bottom corner of my view - seemingly from nowhere. (I almost felt like the object knew I was leaving and wanted to &apos;show itself&apos;.) The clip ended so I started a second clip and held my camera on the bright object that ! was now very visible on my camera screen and seemed to just hang in the sky - it was a pulsating light.  I panned a little to the right because my eye caught other movement and a much brighter second light moving towards the first light and a third less bright and smaller light also came come into view. My friend had gone down the hill and was calling me to come down.  I was now up there alone and a little freaked - so when the clipped ended - I left the hill.Aside from lots of orb like shots and the video clips we also captured on camera a strange white triangle object in the sky when we were taking a sunset picture.  We didn&apos;t see it with our eyes.  But it appears on the shot.

I called to my wife, she came out and witnessed them also.  The lead light was much brighter than the one trailing.  It was hard to judge the altitude and the distance between the two objects, and too dark to see if anything was connecting them.  The sighting lasted about two minutes.  I took a video of them but after reviewing it decided the quality was too poor to upload to any web pages. The lights never wavered from moving in a straight line.

I spent my childhood in West Texas, up around Lubbock, Littlefield, Levelland...places like that.  My dad was a school administrator at two small towns, Pep and Bula, which were situated some 50 miles from Lubbock, 20 miles from Littlefield.  I think at least one of them is still on the map.As a young lad I often accompanied older farm boys, and my older brother, on jackrabbit spotlighting hunting trips.  I usually rode in the back of a pickup truck whilst older boys with 22cal rifles shot at, and sometimes hit, jackrabbits that we caught in the beam of a good spotlight.  Just drive slowly along any country road with that spotlight sweeping the pastures and you&apos;ll catch the eyes of many night creatures there on the high plains of the Texas Panhandle.If you&apos;ve ever seen a Texas jackrabbit run you&apos;ll appreciate that this is a most sporting form of hunting, taking a great deal of skill and marksmanship.  There is a quote attributed to Chuck Yeager about country boy&apos;s marksmanship...&quot;give a hillbilly a rifle and he&apos;ll hit the bullseye every time&quot;...or something like that.  Those farm boys were good shots.  I got pretty good myself as I got older.On two occasions I witnessed &quot;green fireballs&quot; flashing across the night sky.  One I recall distinctly was traveling roughly southwest to northeast.  Being a young lad who read science texts avidly, I just thought to myself &quot;well, that meteor must have had a lot of copper in it&quot;.  I thought this, of course, because I knew copper oxide is greenish in color.Years later, while reading a paperback coauthored by Kevin Randle, I read an account of many sightings of green fireballs in the US.  Some, it was reported, had their likely trajectories calculated to predict impact sites--but no debris was found.So they say.I saw at least two of these about 50 years ago, while riding in the back of a pickup truck underneath the brilliant clear night skies of the Texas Panhandle.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

First I thought it was a far off plane coming in for a landing.         (Lebanon Airport is on a hill right behind my job site) then this light faded as another came on.  This was in a straight line, so I thought the plane was banking and I was seeing the other wing.  Then another light came on at the same rate as the second one faded, still in this straight line, at about a 35 degree angle to horizon from right to left.   still no sound.  I realized this was not a plane.  They were not flares being dropped.  Flares don&apos;t remain stationary.Since it was dark, and the lights of the parking lot were on, I couldn&apos;t see a craft.   The lights repeated this pattern at least 6 times.  I am not sure how far away these lights were from my position, but they were low in the sky.I stopped a coworker to show him just before the display ended.   He was as baffled as I was.  We could hear a plane take off from the airport.  It flew over us at this time.  There was still no sound coming from the direction of the lights.I got into my car and drove out of the parking lot and onto the highway as fast as I legally could.  I wanted to get away from the parking lot lights.  Looking in the direction the lights were, I saw nothing unusual,  just stars, the sky was clear.", "Telepathic Message?This is not a UFO report but more of an unknown. One evening  after getting out of the shower I was standing in the bedroom looking for my PJ&apos;s when I felt a &quot;pressure&quot; in the room. Immediately after the pressure started I heard a foreign language in my head! As the pressure subsided the language ceased.

The lights were very bright and illuminating. I could see swirling fog or mist to the right and left of them but not between them.At first I thought that a vehicle was traveling down the hillside. But, the lights were much too large and they were quite high above the horizon, and I believe my mind was trying to be &ldquo;logical&rdquo; about what my eyes were seeing.I watched these two lights moving at the same distance apart and slowly down until they were below the ridge and out of my eyesight. I believe that I watched them for a couple of minutes.I went to the internet that night to see if anyone else had reported seeing what I saw.I have never seen anything even close to what I would call a &ldquo;UFO Sighting&rdquo; until October 28, 2009.

We had no alcohol consumption or narcotics.  It was approximately 12:20 am of the New Year.  We came upon and intersection and a family of 6 in the car in front of us exited their vehicle and looked north from their position. We thought they were looking at fireworks.  We looked towards the north to see what they were examining.  We pulled to the side of the road exited the vehicle and looked towards the direction the other family was. We thought at first the activity was fireworks but until all commotion stop 2 orangey-red lights were continuing to hover above the town. We followed the lights as they did acrobatic movements unlike any United States military aircraft. We continued to a back road heading south toward my house when in the rear view mirror we spotted another to objects behind us. We again exited the vehicle to observe the lights.  They slowly headed our direction from the northwest to the s! outh. The seemed to be circling each other, again doing acrobatic moves a normal aircraft is unable to perform. We continued to observe when one of the objects we lost behind a cloud in the northwest.  The other aircraft shot straight into the shy were we could no longer see it.  From there we continued home, I contacted my parents to see if they could see anything on the other side of town but they didn&rsquo;t see anything. When I arrived home I made phone call to the police department were they had one reported sighting.

I pulled over to get a better look and realized that there was more like 9-12 of them.  The lowest was at about 700 ft and the highest I would say was about 2500 ft.  At one point the craft had stopped and then they started to move again.  When they reached the highest elevation (2500 ft) they disappeared one by one til they were all gone. I believe I saw these in the eastern sky.  When I saw them I knew right away, that these lights were special.   I never saw anything like it and there was no sound what so ever.  When you looked at the lights they appeared to have 3 or four colors. It was absolutely awesome to see.", "A stationary oval-shaped white light in the sky above the oceanAt 7:53pm on March 15th 2009, a group of friends and I went out on the front porch of my house to smoke cigarettes when we noticed a stationary, bright, whitish-blue light in the sky above the ocean. The sun had recently finished setting and the object stood out very clearly in the night sky. The small amounts of sunlight that remained cast a red outline on one of the nearby clouds, but this was clearly distinguishable from the bright object. The object remained in the sky for about five minutes before abruptly disappearing. I managed to take two photos on my cell phone before the object vanished.", "Red/green lights seen over Buffalo New York from Fort Erie, Canada.I was driving home from work in Fort Erie,Ontario, Canada, which is on the border of Buffalo, New York.  I stopped at a red light and noticed above the tree&apos;s 2 pinkish red blinking lights.  I noticed this because of the colour and the fact that the lights were on top of each other, not beside each other like an airplane.  I watched for a few seconds when the lights suddenly changed to a bright green colour, then immediately afterwards, they changed direction on a dime and started going in the other direction.I thought this was wierd so I decided to follow them.  I drove down to a rest area beside the water about a kilometer away, and could see that the lights were directly over Buffalo, New York.  The lights floated around, changing directions quickly, going left, right, up and down and backwards and forwards.  Then the lights started going up and to the left, slowly slowing down until they came to a stop.  At this time they changed colours again back to the pinkish red colour.  All of a sudden directly below the lights another set of lights appeared out of nowhere.  These lights were an orangish yellow.  It slowly went up towards the first set of lights and then passed it.  The red lights then started moving again, following the orange lights.  Then as quickly as the orange lights appeared, they disappeared.  Then the red lights started moving closer to the water, then turned left and went deeper into Buffalo, getting smaller.  I watched this for about 2 minutes and then left.", "Super Bright explosion after object hits the desert groundDriving north tonight 17 Nov 2009 on CA Highway 395.  I was driving from Lancaster to Ridgecrest and had just gotten off of Garlock road onto the 395.  The time was about 11:05 pm.  I saw a very bright ball trailing light, flying level for a few moments.  Then suddenly it looked as if it impacted the desert off in the distance towards Ridgecrest.  The impact looked like nothing I&rsquo;ve ever seen before.  No sparks or secondary fire explosions.  It just lit up the entire sky in a Blue/White color. All I could say to myself was &ldquo;what in the hell was that?&rdquo; I sped up to try and get to Ridgecrest as soon as I could, I was concerned for my families safety. There&rsquo;s a military base in the town and my imagination is running wild while I&rsquo;m driving.  I thought maybe it could have been an aircraft crashing into the town..  When I reached Ridgecrest everything looked normal and no emergency equipment out driving around.  I am assuming what I may have seen was a meteor that! actually made contact with the ground.  It&rsquo;s the only thing that would make sense to me.", "November 15th 2009, I stepped out of my mother&rsquo;s small home in Litchfield Maine to smoke a cigarette.  I usually stand on the porch itself but for some reason I decided to trek down the four steps onto the dirt drive way below.  I lit my smoke and looked to the sky like I sometimes do and noticed a small blue star to the east. Venus was clear tonight. As I stood there taking in the beauty of the stars something caught my vision.I looked almost precisely north to see a fairly odd ball of light moving in extremely bizarre and unrecognizable motions. I stood in awe for at least twenty minutes watching the very graceful light dance around the sky, I am surely no pilot but I can most definitely recognize a passing plane or helicopter with ease. This I assure was neither. It changed colors from a light florescent white to a light blue and once in a while almost the color of the glow from a fire.It maneuvered in and out of clouds at top notch speeds making turns I have never seen even jets make. Hair point turns around in circles and zig zags&hellip; As fast as I could hold my finger up to it and point swiveling my finger around, it moved.I realized I was the only witness, so I ran inside to get my sister. She was skeptic of my claims at first until she stepped outside and witnessed it herself. She could not believe her eyes either! We both made sporadic phones calls; one of witch was to the local News Paper the Kennebec Journal whom witch had nothing to say but plenty to laugh about. My brother suggested I call the state police to document the incident, I obliged.  All the while this light continued to move extremely fast around the evening sky.My sister went in and out of the house as my eyes stayed affixed on the orb. It seemed to travel further then closer, so on and so forth.  One of the last times my sister went back inside I saw something very piculure, the one orb had split into two, both making similar sweeping patterns over a widespread area of the northern and eastern sky.  By this time I had made my report with the police and they said someone would call me back.I went back inside to get another cigarette and my sister to see the now two lights above. When we got back outside we looked up to see at least 4 other lights circling the sky. We watched this event for at least 30 more minutes. My sister returned inside and I followed. I got a drink and received a call back from the police officer on duty saying he was busy but he would be there ASAP. I went back outside alone.This time it was back to just two lights twisting around. One of them seemed very close. I could make out a disk shape siluette in the clouds with the lights illuminating from it. I pulled my phone out and use it as a video recorder, unfortunately it was the only piece of equipment I had. I managed to capture the original disk of light but obviously on my phone it was a tiny ball of light. It moved around my screen as I held my phone as still as possible. I went back inside.About 10 minutes later one officer pulled in the driveway across the street from us. I went out and yelled for him to get his attention. As he turned around I looked to the sky again to see nothing but fog.  He pulled in our driveway and got out and we discussed what my sister and I had seen and I showed him the video. He seemed like he wanted to believe, but he also seemed like he had to see it to believe it.  And then it faintly returned, he watched the strange techniques of the light rome around the sky.  He admitted it was not any form of aviation he had seen, not a helicopter or plane nor a satellite because it was below the clouds.  We watched it together with my sister until it got so far away and faint we could no longer see it. We talked about it a little, he made a small report and left. That was the last time I saw the lights in the sky about 3 hours after it began it was over just as easy.Thank you for letting me post my report here.  Keep your eyes to the sky in Maine and maybe (hopefully) you will be able to verify my reports.", "several lights, one yellow, the others red, traveling at extreme speeds over Kentucky military baseWhile watching a military skeet shooting contest at Ft. Campbell, a bright yellow light streaked overhead, disappearing to the south.  A light rain was falling and, assuming it was near the base of these low clouds, it would have been going several thousand miles an hour.  About 10 seconds later, two red lights, coupled side by side, followed the same path, but were going at about half the speed.  These lights, which also disappeared to the south, were much larger than the yellow light but were not as bright.  I was wearing ear protectors because of the deafening gun noise, so I was unable to detect any sounds these lights may have made.", "Bright golden spherical object that seemed to be burning with pieces falling from it.My son noticed this (object?) through his bedroom window and screamed for me to come and look.

It gradually moved out of sight getting smaller until it disappeared.", "3 Red objects hovering over El Cajon CA  Exiting the house, we saw three red objects pulsating in a triangular formation.

As we got closer we noticed it looked like it was flying pretty low, sort of hovering over a section of trees for a few seconds.  We drove past it with it on the passenger side of the car and it started to fly away towards the downtown area, almost like it noticed that we saw it.  It looked like a solid triangle with three steady white lights on the bottom, one on each corner positioned to shine down. It also had red and white lights on the top that were blinking at different times and creating a glow around the top.  It didn&rsquo;t seem like it was very big, maybe twenty feet wide at the most.  We tried to turn around and follow it but it was gone pretty quickly.", "fireball SSW of San Miguel, Californiathe time wa between 2116 and 2122 PST on 27 October 2009.  I was driving on 10th street heading south right at the camp roberts boarder.  I saw a redish orange firey ball standing in the sky about 40 degrees westwardly off the road (SSW), and an elevation about 25d.  It seemed to hover there for the duration of the time, not moving closer or backward and not adjusting in intensity.  It was twice as bright as Venus and a little larger.  I could trace a straight line between venus and the brightest star in the sky pointing to it with equa-distant intervles (probably no help).  I took a few quick snap shots with my camera, brief video, and test a friend in the town south of me to try and get a tringulation of the thing; while I smoked my ciggorette.  My friend didn&apos;t get out to see it fast enough.  After I jumped back in my car it was gone.  I have watched a bunch of rocket launches from Vandenburg AFB (this was brighter, and didn&apos;t move).   And I am in the sate! llite communications field (not a satellite).

We drove around Big Lake, Elk River, and the Princeton areas and ended up coming back home through Orrock through the wildlife refuge on County 9 hooking up with Cty 5 to Big Lake.  When we turned south on Cty 5 a bright light caught my attention to the W moving very fast to the SE at about 40&ordm; up from the horizon.The thing peaked my interest in what I thought was a low flying jet was that there were no blinking lights on the outside of the wings or tail. There were also no steady lights on the wings, tail or body of the object, just one VERY bright light. This was also was moving at what I would estimate to be 2x the speed of a normal jet. As it reached true south of our vehicle it seemed to take a slight arching movement towards the ENE. Just as this started, I noticed the light growing dimmer. What was happening was that it was moving higher in the sky.  In about 3 seconds it went from 3-4x as bright as a jet to finally vanishing. Right before it finally vanished there was a bright flash and it was gone.I kept watching the sky for  a few more minutes when there was another flash and the object came back. At this point it was only the brightness of a normal satellite. When the object flew through a grouping of stars I had been watching for reference that were shaped in a triangle, one of the &ldquo;stars&rdquo; broke from this constant formation and started following it.During this time I had been trying to get my wife to pull over so we could watch it and possibly turn around and follow it. She had pretty much freaked out and had kept her eyes on the road the whole time and expressed she did not want to see it and was not going to be following it.I have had 2 other sightings before this and have not reported them. I heard Mr. Davenport on Binnall of America today and finally decided that this is the one I remember the most and made the most impact on me.", "Miami, FL 33179, 11/24/09, 8:20 pm EST.

No sound.", "We saw a large football shaped object hovering above an apartment complex .I had picked my 5 yr.old son up at daycare.  Driving home we had to sit at a red light crossing the frwy at a bit of a downhill grade. My son sits low in the front seat.  He pointed up and slightly to the right and said, &quot;Mommy, what&rsquo;s that?&quot;   I lifted my sun visor and bent forward to see what he was pointing at.   We saw a large football shaped object hovering above an apartment complex.  We use to live in that complex years before so, I know how big the area is there.  This object hovered above the complex and was almost the same size as a football field including bleachers space!  It had a soft glow of white and no defined edges, no windows, no sound. I froze for a moment then shoved it in park, threw open my van door, and stood out on the step of the van.  I looked at the truck behind us, waved at them and pointed back up at it.  They too leaned down a bit to look under their visors, saw it, and they both raised their arms up to push up their visors at the same time their mouths wide open.  I looked back and it was still there and all of a sudden, I got scared and sat back in the van closing my door, looking up from inside with my son again the object sped quietly upward at an angle to the right, getting smaller.  Now the size of a baseball it stopped and changed course speeding upward in the opposite direction so fast and kept going till it disappeared.  Its flight path was in the shape of the letter V= (&gt;) like this. At that moment the light turned green we drove through and on the other side of the freeway was a field, parked along it was a man&rsquo;s truck.  He was in the field staring at a deer that was frozen scared staring back at him.  As he inched closer, I pulled over, jumped out and yelled, &quot;Did you see it!?&quot;  He said, &quot;See what?&quot;  I said the ufo, it was over there above that apartment complex&quot;  He said, &quot;In broad daylight, no?!&quot;  He looked at me like I was nuts and I ran back to my van and drove away...I remember one thing really struck me as odd.  Just before my son said, &quot;Mommy, what&rsquo;s that?&quot; !  I had be en repeating over and over in my mind-- Turn green, turn green, turn green.  When my son spoke to me it was as if he broke a trance I was in.  I had felt like I had been possessed to keep my attention on the red light in the intersection, the man and the deer too. It was as if he was made to stare only at the deer.  The deer was unusually frozen in its tracks.  HOW COULD HE NOT SEE IT!!! unless he was in some sort of trance too.  Why was my son unafected by this trance?  I don&rsquo;t know, maybe they didn&rsquo;t think he needed to be.  You know how you get a strange feeling someone is staring at you!  Well that&rsquo;s the feeling that frightened me into getting back in the van.  I felt like many eyes were watching me!  They saw me!  It has taking me years to be able to say this.  Aliens from another world looked at me and only at me for that moment in time that I stood on the step of my van. I&apos;ve read many stories over the years, but none described the massive ship I saw.  Please tell me if you heard of any ships as big as this one.

The dim one went out of view and again, I thought it was just an airplane, until the brighter orange ball seemed like it was getting closer. I then figured it was a helicopter (even though I have never seen a helicopter with that didnt have flashign lights and was a halogen orange), but I couldn&rsquo;t hear it and it eventually landed on either a road or in woods, and then got brighter. I thought it might be a fire since it flickered, but then it got extremely bright (still orange) and came back up and then grew very dim.

It appeared in luminosity similar to a star or satellite.  In addition, it appeared to be of very high altitude, again similar to a satellite.  This was apparent as the jet plane was passing from East to West at a high altitude at the same time I noted the unknown light.  The plane was crossing the sky at an approximate 50 degree relative elevation from my vantage point, and the unknown light was at an approximate 70 degree relative elevation when first sighted.My initial thought was this was a satellite, as I have seen these many times at night and on occasion during the day.  However, this light did not behave as other satellites I have observed.  The light moved relatively slow in comparison.  The light took approximately 30 seconds to move directly overhead.  It then stopped for approximately 3 to 5 seconds.   The light very slightly grew in size and brightness during this period of first sight to the stop over head.  I also had called my wife out to see it during this period.   She also observed the light.  I asked to bring the camcorder to see if we could get the light on video.The light then moved in westerly direction.  Again, slower than a plane or satellite.  We tried to film the light with two camcorders but are unsure if we captured it (we have not reviewed the tapes as of this reporting).  The light continued on its westerly course for approximately 3 minutes before I noted it was moving slightly to the west/south/west (say 15 degrees from true west).  The light was approximately at 75 to 80 degrees relative elevation.  Please note I can assure the light was very distant as it was obscured for a second or two by part of high cloud.I continued to intermittently observe the light for another minute.  The light was dimming and becoming increasingly harder to spot.  It appeared to traveling directly away (i.e. out rather than in a particular direction).", "round reflective objectrounded shape. reflected the sun. saw it, then it went behind a cloud. then it came out when we were closer to it then it disappeared.", "Three green Obs observed over Vancouver Friday 13th 2009Last night Nov 13th was the only clear night I&apos;ve been able to use my telescope in over 3 weeks. At approx 11:15 pm last night I saw three low flying silent green orbs fly over at low altitude traveling from east to west directly along the normal flight path that commercial aircraft take to land in Vancouver when approach is from land. However, I am very familiar with commercial aircraft and I was not able to identify these aircraft or objects in anyway. The last of the three appeared to be a glowing disc flying through the night sky.Now I am going to speculate and offer my own logical as to an explanation. I would like someone to hopefully respond with an objective opinion. Stealth aircraft have their afterburners turned up so that they are not heard easily from the ground at low altitude.  They also might have a green light on the top of the aircraft. As the afterburn of fuel from their engines is directed upwards it might have caused condensation to form thus appearing as a glowing green object from the ground in the cool temperature. I guesstimates the speed at approximately 700-1000 miles per hour yet no sonic boom which is curious indeed. However we know this technology has been worked on for years to what level of success I don&rsquo;t know. We also know that a condensation halo can be formed around an aircraft at speed depending on atmospheric conditions. I am an amateur astronomist and have been for years and I&apos;ve never ever seen anything like this before either prior or post military or otherwise. I ! don&rsquo;t really want to say that they were extraterrestrials but I really don&rsquo;t have any explanation for this at all. I always like to error on the side of caution. However the site of these objects was really something! One more thought due to Olympics we know they&rsquo;ve been flying aircraft over Vancouver city often. But not like these ones I think! Any thoughts?", "Three UFO&apos;s appear out of thin air for 15 minutes then vanish.My wife and I were driving home from visiting her parents.

Hard to describe.  It must have been hundreds of miles away.  I watched it for about 5 minutes then I looked over at my wife and said &quot;Honey... what is that?&quot;She looked and said she didn&apos;t know but that there was another one &quot;over there&quot; and pointed about 45 degrees to the right.  After a few more minutes of watching them hover and slowly moving across the sky a third craft appeared.   Approximately 15 minutes had passed when they seemed to vanish into thin air.

I slammed on my breaks and just stared at them trying to figure out exactly what it was that I was looking at.  I had never seen anything like it before in my entire life.  It was hard to tell if the lights were one or eight different objects.The lights were white with a yellow tint to them and were in a perfect line with one another.  There were no distortions or imperfections to the spheres at all, only a small halo of light surrounding each one.  They were spaced out evenly and had the appearance of having a curvature formation to them like a saucer or the such.  They also were approximately 17 to 20 times greater in size than the largest star that was near the lights (in the night sky).  The lights were approximately 45 degrees to the horizon in the southeast direction from my position where I was stopped in the road.  I would say that the lights were about half a mile away from where I was.  The lights were near my family&apos;s property and were a ways up in the sky too.Then, just as suddenly as I had seen them, the lights started to go out one by one.  There was a bit of rotation to them as they went out.  I tried to see where they had gone, but there was nothing in the sky.  The only visible objects were a couple of far-off airplanes, the moon, the stars, and clouds.  There were no smoke trails as from a bottle-rocket or other firework product. There was absolutely nothing left after the lights disappeared.I drove around on the back roads for about ten minutes looking for firework trails or an aircraft or anything to explain the situation.  I also kept looking in the same spot where I had seen the lights, but nothing appeared there again.  I finally went home and stood outside for around twenty minutes looking for anything that may be an answer to this phenomenon.

As he stood up and started to exit the room, an intense bright light flashed to fill the entire room. The light came from directly in front of me and appeared to me to have come from somewhere within the landscaped area. The flash was described by both me and my father as similar to a camera flash, and that is what he thought it was at first. I suggested lightening but we both concluded it wasn&rsquo;t that due to the lack of thunder and way it shined. It had shined into the room as if it was a flashlight, and by the time we had decided what it wasn&rsquo;t, the TV switched from the game to a test emergency broadcast. It stumbled between that and static till it settled on an address being given by President Obama.

I remember the experience vividly, though.I was walking across an agricultural experiment field at the University of Alaska/Fairbanks, sometime in the evening (could have been anywhere between 18:00 and midnight).  It was overcast, with a cloud deck of somewhere between 300 and 600 meters.  When I reached the middle of the snow-covered field, which was roughly 1 km by 1 km, I could see a formation of lights to my SE headed in my direction.  Because Fort Wainwright and Eielson AFB are to the SE, I assumed it was a formation of fighters, bombers or helicopters.  The lights were in a delta formation, with one in the middle and 3 on each side, for a total of 7, and were a brilliant amber-orange.  They were moving at a low rate of speed, 100 km/h at most, and were flying underneath the cloud deck.  I watched as they passed directly over me.  I could make out no wings, tails or propellers.  The lights were brilliant as a welding torch would be, but they did not flicker.  The objects were completely silent; not even a whisper; whereas I could hear a raven&rsquo;s wings flap out in that field.  As these 7 lights in formation continued off to the NW, an 8th one brought up the tail at the same speed about 1 km behind.  All of the lights were moving as if fixed, but the clouds were clearly visible between them.

Their lights catch my attention but are usually no brighter than passing headlights on the highway. From my eastern facing position they cruise across my view from north to south.However Last night at exactly 3:24 a.m. the sky lit up from an object streaking across the sky from west to east. It was moving at a considerable pace and was quite different than the objects I am used to seeing out this window. If you can say that the sun in the sky is about the size of a quarter were you to hold one up in the air, this object was about the size of a lentil bean in that perspective. Unlike the lights of the planes which have a cool value to their hue this object was warm and bright like an arc weld almost too bright to look at. This brightness caused a halo effect around the object which tapered off into a streaking tail which dithered behind it.When I say this object was bright I mean that it lit up the sky and the buildings in first hill. It was bright enough to illuminate the facing walls of the taller buildings, the roofs as it passed over head and to silhouette the buildings as it passed to their opposite sides.The brightness was enough to catch my attention away from my computer screen and I had just enough time to stand up in disbelief and watch it cruise past the buildings as stated heading east. The angle of entry was more level with the horizon than steep otherwise I am convinced it would have hit the tallest building in my view. Of course that is dependent on my relative position and perspective to the event, I actually do not know how high or how big this object actually was though I relate here to you my best account of what I viewed.It was enough though to scare my cat out of the window and into hiding.The event lasted 5 to 10 seconds I estimate and I did not have time to photograph the event.

I was traveling west on U.S. Highway 40 to Salt Lake City with a friend.  It was around 10 o&apos;clock in the evening.  It is VERY dark in this remote area of the world with no street lights. We saw a very bright green light that was descending from the night sky at a very slow pace.  As I drove I was watching it for several minutes in disbelief as it silently approached the ground.  It was probably 2 to 3 miles away.  Remember, this is the American West where views can be 50 to 100 miles.  And we had unobstructed views of the valley.  What was most memorable about this sighting was the slow rate of descent.  Amazing.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

We were the only ones on the lake.On a Thursday morning in October, 1981, we decided to go home two days early on our week vacation.  We were camped at a location across from the boat ramp.  When we left our camp, we noticed how calm the lake was and that we were the only ones there.On the boat ramp, we saw something moving through the water and thought it was a beaver, however, when we pulled alongside it, it was a mule deer doe swimming across the lake towards where we were camping.  We thought that this was unusual as they run in herds and not singly as white tail deer.((TC)) and ((MC)) wanted to drown the deer and take it home and butcher it for meat and I refused to let them do it because I was the boss at the time.  It would have been easier for the mule deer to walk around the lake by the ramp rather than to swim across the lake.After we loaded the boat, we drove south from the lake to the first hairpin corner.  As we turned, ((TC)) slammed on his brakes and jack knifed the boat to where we could not leave.  Hovering above the small box canyon on the sunny side, was a large shaped object as big as a football field from end zone to end zone.It was shiny like crumpled up aluminum foil and as it changed colors from the sparkling of the sun, we noticed it was vibrating and making no sound.  At this time we knew it was somehow mechanically operating.((TC)) asked me to get out and walk up to it but I refused because I was in fear of my life and told him to do it.  He pulled out a 12 inch barrel 357 magnum and wanted to shoot at it, ((MC)) and I told him to put it away.  We were frightened and felt that we were being watched by the UFO.We rolled up the windows and locked the doors and watched it in astonishment to afraid to do anything.  We watched it for about 10 minutes like it was a Mexican standoff.  Trying to figure out how to leave without driving under it.  Just as we decided to back up and break the hitch on the boat, it took off faster than the eye could see.  It went straight up and you could see the curvature of the earth as it went straight up because it left a shiny image behind.  It actually left so fast you could see the shining image behind it.We made a pact together not to say a word to anyone because they would just say we were drunk and we had not drank anything that morning except coffee.    As a police officer I faced many conflicts were I could have been shot or stabbed and still was not as afraid as I was of the flying object seen at Apache Lake.  As a police office, you learn fight or flight, however, I was scared to the point that I could not hardly move, talk and felt like vomiting.  I am willing to take any type of lie detection test to verify the truth of our sighting.  As a police officer, I have taken many lie detector tests and have never failed.I wanted to report this to someone before my disease takes my life because, of all the nay sayers and scientists saying people who see unknown flying objects are crazy.  It&rsquo;s hard to deny when you see one in broad day light.I know what machines are because I served in the Navy as an engineman and was a driller on one of the largest drilling rigs in the world.  I also have been a avid bow hunter and fisherman since I was about 10 years old.

I drove south on 11st Street and headed out on East Post Rd to turn east on 30th St.  That&rsquo;s when I saw two very bright white lights in the northwest sky; one positioned not far above the other.  At first glance I thought they were stars or perhaps a plane and a star, but then I realized they were both positioned unusually low in the sky. The top light appeared to &lsquo;dart&rsquo; in its movement.  As I drove into more darkness I could see what looked like a faint beam pointing down to the lower, more southern light.  Then it appeared the top light began moving up and away from the bottom light, and at the same time it&rsquo;s bright white light changed to numerous red lights (like the underneath of plane.) Within seconds these lights were totally gone from sight!!  Only the bottom bright light remained and it was moving very slowly as if it was floating alon! g.  As I continued to drive eastward this light grew dimmer and dimmer and within about 5 minutes it appeared to be in one place now, with no movement.  About 10 minutes past as I pulled into my driveway (I live on a hill) I took a last look into the northwest sky and could see the dim light appearing to remain static.

East-Northeast(emphasis on East).It left behind a massive white trail similar to what planes can leave behind but huge.My husband wants me to add that it was not like an exhaust trail, but more like displacement? No other way to explain how it looked or felt but displacement.Also as it was moving it passed in front of a plane that was much higher up and the object totally blocked the light out of the plane.I always carry a strong flash light when we walk at night and it did not even reflect off of this object.Either it was much higher up, which means it was even larger than we think, or it was non-reflective.We watched it from tonight 7:07 pm until 7:09 when it moved out of our field of vision.It became a straight line like this but massively thick ______.It seemed as though one of the diamond&apos;s points flattened to make the triangle and then the the front point of the triangle flattened to make a wide line.If you have ever seen ticker tape or confetti that was how the tile thing looked when they were moving.Birds do not have exhaust and that trail was not there until the object went by.No air craft we know of is that quiet, I am a Military Brat and have grown up around planes so I know their sounds.It can&apos;t have been a Stealth because we would have felt that and it would have to have been really low to block the sky in the way it did.No way we could not have felt it were a low flying Stealth! Also we realized after we saw the trail that in fact there were two other trails spaced evenly and parallel to the one this craft made.", "Black, triangular UFO over a small central Illinois town.Three of my friends and I were sitting outside on the trampoline in my backyard. We live downtown in Petersburg, IL. It&apos;s a very small town, but there are enough nearby shops and streetlights that light pollution can be fairly bad. Nevertheless, we are usually able to see stars and such, which makes stargazing on clear days (like this) one of our favorite pastimes.It was just past 10:50 p.m. when my friend started pointing northwest in the sky and yelling &quot;What is that?!&quot; We all looked up and noticed three brownish objects gliding through the sky, forming a perfect triangle. For a second, I thought they might be birds, but they were way too still and uniformly spaced. They were also way to low, dimly lit, and fast to be any sort of aircraft I know. The triangle itself blended with the sky behind it, but my friend said he would see the stars behind it disappearing when the triangle passed under them.It took maybe five, ten seconds to completely pass across the sky, and it was completely noiseless. My friends and I were amazed. A few minutes after it passed, I remembered the air force base about 30 minutes (by car) southeast of us - the direction that the Unidentified Flying Object was headed.

I thought perhaps it was a fire, on a mountain... but I realized there is no mountain in that area. At this point I just kept glancing at it, and noticed it started to become an oval of lights.  Then the thing moved... slowly to sit over the freeway.  At one point it started to move down the freeway (headed West.)  The lights I could see now.

Please use revised addition.Last night, Nov 13th, 2009, was the only clear night I&apos;ve been able to use my telescope in over 3 weeks. At approx 11:15 pm I saw three low flying silent green orbs traveling from east to west at low altitude. They followed the normal flight path that commercial aircraft use to land in Vancouver.  I am very familiar with commercial aircraft, however I was not able to identify these objects.  The last of the three appeared to be a glowing disc flying through the night sky as if a green halo around the craft itself.Now I am going to speculate and offer my own explanation.  Stealth aircrafts have their afterburners turned up so that they are not heard easily from the ground at low altitude.  There also might be a green light on the top of the aircraft.  As the afterburn of fuel from their engines is directed upwards it might have caused condensation to form thus appearing as a glowing green object from the ground in the cool temperature.  I guesstimate the speed at approximately 700-1000 miles per hour yet no sonic boom which is curious indeed.  However we know this technology has been worked on for years to what level of success I don&rsquo;t know.  We also know that a condensation halo can be formed around an aircraft at speed depending on atmospheric conditions.I am an amateur astronomer and have been for years but I&apos;ve never ever seen anything like this before either prior or post military.  I don&rsquo;t want to say that they were extraterrestrials but I really don&rsquo;t have any explanation for this at all.  I always like to error on the side of caution. However, the sight of these objects was really something!  One more thought, due to Olympics we know they&rsquo;ve been flying aircraft over Vancouver city often.  But not like these ones I think!

PD))", "Bonneville Salt Flats, July 09, Investigator, Bright White Lights, Semi-Circle, Pulsations, MotorcycleI am an investigator for MUFON and the state of IL.  I purchased a bike in Reno on Monday 7/27/09, and was driving back to St. Louis on I-80 on Monday night.  I had just crossed over the Utah border and saw the Bonneville Salt Flats exit sign on I-80.  The wind was blowing about 30 knots, which caused my bike to lean as I drove at about 80 miles per hour.  It was dark, very few if any clouds, dry and the conditions were nominal except for the tremendous wind from the north blowing southward.   I was also wearing a helmet, full face.I was looking up at all the stars and the blinking lights of many airplanes traversing the sky as I drove towards Salt Lake City to find a hotel room for the night.  As I was driving, I was thinking, this is the area where there are many UFO sightings.  About then, a white light then appeared to my right (S-SE) at very high altitude at about my 40 degree position.  I estimate the altitude and distance to be 15,000 feet at 10 to 15 miles out.  Why?   Because it was about halfway from horizon to where the strobes of airplanes were flashing; therefore, 10 to 15 thousands feet.When it shown its single light, it appeared to be a plane with a running light, breaking through the clouds--in other words, it had a halo-like effect.I dismissed this as a plane, even though there were very few clouds directly above me; however, at that distance there could have been more clouds in its position, obviously. As I drove, the ultra bright white light descended and was moving towards me. About 1 to 2 minutes later, the light appeared again, altitude this time much lower and much closer than before, maybe 8 to 10 miles from my starboard, same position. This repeatedly happened about every 2 minutes, the light would power up, shine in my direction, then it slowly turn off, as if were a river barge light powering off. It didn&apos;t just switch off, it phased down.I kept looking in my rearview mirror thinking that the light should eventually cross the road behind me since it was on a 90 degree angle to me and heading in my same direction. At some point, I should have traveled east of it&apos;s trajectory towards Salt Lake City moving past it&rsquo;s heading to the north since we were on a perpendicular intersect, but that never happened. The light lit up about 6 to 7 times, each time it was closer, brighter, lower and especially disturbing, it was always in the same 40 to 45 degree position to me as when I first viewed it. Logically that meant, I thought, that the light was somehow keeping pace with me, which became disturbing.  I was extremely compelled to continue to look on that same starboard heading of south, south-east to try and figure out what this aircraft could be. I couldn&apos;t decide which was more interesting, the fact that it was getting closer to me, or the fact that it was always in the same bearing to me.After about 6 sequential events of the light turning on and then off, duration each time as being about 3 to 5 seconds, it then was at its closest distance to me, about 1 mile or less. What happened next was absolutely exhilarating and I will never forget it, and this event then caused me to completely dismiss my original assumption of an airplane or helicopter and/or the characteristics of a man made craft that I had ever seen before.The second to the last time of this sighting the light shown at me, very close, one mile or less and at this time it continued to stay on. One to two seconds later, two other lights to its left came on along with it, same luminosity, same distance, moving with me but NOT horizontally symmetrical to each other. They were all three equidistant to each other, but the middle one was at a higher elevation than the other two making it appear to me as a very flat pyramidal grouping of three white, brilliant, lights about 1 mile away from me. Now I could actually see the craft moving with me, matching my speed, as the light(s) stayed on much longer.There was never any beam of any sort that I could see, and I looked to see if the white salt below the craft became illuminated because of these lights. It did not. Just brilliant white lights off to my 40 to 45 degree bearing each time. The lights didn&rsquo;t appear to illuminate my bike either.At the closest point to me, I estimate the altitude to now be about 600 to 1,000 feet at a distance of no more than 1 mile from me, if even that.Then, the three lights all turned off at the same time, slowly vaporizing down, like a river   barge&apos;s lights. There was no sound.  My bike didn&rsquo;t loose power or suffer any electrical failures.At this time, I now assumed these lights to be directly pointing at me for some reason. This craft was intentionally pointing these lights at me.  I somehow felt that this sighting was now more of a personal experience and not just some random lights. There was too much evidence of this now for me to dismiss.  I always saw stars in the background as if these lights were not a part of any solid craft or solid sphere. They appeared independent of each other but always uniformly symmetrical in their formation and distance, except, as I reported, for the slightly flattened pyramidal characteristic described above.The last time it shown on me was amazing! That same single light appeared one last time, same heading to me, same distance and same altitude as before. From a distance of about half a mile away, I saw what looked like brilliant LCD lights, orange-ish/red-ish in color, lights SCROLLING from behind the light/object, arcing up and to the left in a huge semi circle, and as it came around the circle towards the front of the craft, I could see even more of the colored lights scrolling around the circumference of a huge, circular disk.  But it was only a half disk and it was tilted left side up and right side down.About 6 to 10 of these very fast pulsations of brilliantly colored lights came from the exact same spot behind the light, circled around a huge disk shaped object and then came in to full view to me, larger and brighter and then abruptly ended at the white light that was still showing at me.This was one giant pulse of about 6 to 8 individual scrolling lights which made the outline of a circular half disk. But the disk was on a tilt slightly, about 15 degrees, so the lights went slightly up, over and downward and then abruptly ended at the white light that had stayed on the entire time, about 10 to 12 seconds.I was so shocked by this......I pulled the bike over on the shoulder of the highway. The wind was so fast, it nearly blew it over. I was speechless at what I had just seen and was hoping for it to appear to me again so I could video tape it with my blackberry phone, but it never did.Some time went by as I had resumed riding and the light never appeared close to me again. However, I saw the light one more time off in the distance.  It had flown back towards the Bonneville salt flats again in the distance and I last saw it just above the horizon, very far from me, south, where it illuminated one more time looking very much like a helicopter showing its lights on the desert floor.It didn&apos;t seem hostile in any way.....moreover, it seemed to want to show me that it was not a plane or helicopter that I kept insisting it was in my mind.It revealed its disk shape, 180 degrees of a half circle, in the most brilliant orange and red pulsations of light I have ever seen.  It was the same color as a cutting torch, maybe. I could always see stars behind it, but the pulses did reveal a huge semi-circle.I had not been drinking, I wasn&rsquo;t tired nor was I on any kind of medication or drugs of any kind. I was just enjoying my ride home.  There&rsquo;s definitely something weird at the Bonneville Salt Flats, in Utah?", "Three pulsing lights, flying low and fast.It was 6:40pm-ish when the three of us saw the lights go across the sky.  There were three lights in a line, flying pretty low and fast, from north to south.  (many planes were in the sky also, so it was easy to compare, and these looked completely different.)   Each light was large elliptical shaped and seemed to be moving independently, while flying in formation.  There also seemed to be a pulse that went back and forth through all of them.  It &quot;pulsed and shimmered,&quot; as if you were seeing them through a mirage or a film of steam.  Before the three of them disappeared behind some clouds, the last light seemed to speed up and align itself to the right of the front light, forming a triangle.", "Large, white orb breaks apart into 4 equally sized orbs that slowly spiral downwards, disappearing over the horizon.Driving home along  Alexandria Pike from the Walmart in Alexandria in the direction of Cincinnati, Ohio (headed North), a large, white orb was seen glowing, hovering in the sky.  We watched the object trying to determine what it was.  Suddenly, after about 3-4 minutes of watching, the large object broke apart.  Four equal (but smaller) orbs appeared with what appeared as red &quot;tails&quot;.  For the next 14-15 minutes we watched as these four lights spiraled downward - towards the Ohio River - in a slow, spiral descent.  Once arriving into Newport, Kentucky we could no longer see the lights - they had disappeared over the mountainous horizon - presumably into the River.", "7-8 reddish orange orbs forming a triangle zoomed across the sky7-8 orbs of reddish orange forming a trianglar shape zoomed across the sky from the north of the city towards the south in mere seconds.And I was with three other people who also saw it.And was very dark, but they were very bright.", "Sentient red lights move across aI started to look out of the window and saw a small red light that was moving outside of the window.

It was about 4 weeks after the Hurricane.As evacuees, had little to do, and even less money. I had just washed everyone&apos;s clothes by hand in the utility sink, and was hanging them out on a line to dry. Everybody was sitting outside on the patio, relaxing and enjoying the beautiful, crystal clear Fall day. I was facing South, hanging the laundry on the clothesline, when I turned around to go back for another wet load, and I saw something hovering over the house.I stopped in my tracks and tried to focus on whatever it was, because what I was seeing made no sense and it was very close to the house. There was a clean, white rectangular box hovering over the roof. It was hard to tell how big it was or how high it was, because the sky was a dark, pure blue, without any clouds to help determine the depth of field. It looked exactly like a shirt box you would put a dressing robe in to give your dad for Christmas, you know, before you wrapped it. It was a plain, white rectangle. It didn&apos;t seem very big, maybe only a couple of feet wide and about three feet long, but like I said, there was no referencing objects near it. It could have been 10 times that for all I could tell. It seemed to float only about 25 or 30 feet above the house, but I couldn&apos;t really say. At the most, though I would say it was maybe three or four telephone lengths above the house. It didn&apos;t seem very far, like I could yell at it and it would hear me. But I didn&apos;t yel! l. I was too confounded by the sight. I could have shot at it with a gun and likely hit it, if I was the kind of person who acts first and thinks later.I called my 4 friends out from under the patio cover to see it. I asked them what they were seeing (not to influence them as to my version of the sight). They all saw exactly what I was seeing, and they noticed it was actually moving very, very slowly.  We watched it for about 20-25 minutes as it crept over the house, across the yard, and over the pasture towards the South. Some of them got bored and went in the house, but I stayed and watched it glide away until I couldn&apos;t see it anymore. It never made a single sound. It never lost or gained altitude.  It never turned.  It had no= sound, openings, windows, wings, vapor trail, lights or markings. It just looked like a plain old white shirt box, cruisin&apos; over the house and yard.It continued in a straight trajectory at a painfully slow, almost unobservable rate of speed South toward another unincorporated area a few miles away called Structure, TX.I&apos;ve never seen anything that unexplainable, that close, or for that long. It defied all logic. I think about that box-thing in the sky all the time, and wonder what would have happened if I had shot at it. Or if we would have gotten in the car and followed it, or what the police would have done if we reported it to the authorities.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))", "Bright, neon-green fireball (or flare) falling towards ground slowlyRoughly Midnight, I was at a aircraft gate and saw what appeared to be a bright neon green flare appear out of nowhere and float slowly towards the ground (as if it was simply dropped out of a plane). This occurred roughly southwest of the airport, but still close enough to be on the airport property. The intensity is what I&apos;d expect from a anti-missile flare from military aircraft.The flare had a smoky white trail approx. ten times its own length (illuminated by the flare) as it fell.Lost sight behind a building, appeared to have hit ground.

At about 2:00 AM GMT, I was awake on the transatlantic flight at the time the cabin lights were dimmed and many people were sleeping and there was very little to no activity going on. I looked out the window at the stars, and noticed three bright red lights overhead in the one- to two-o&apos;clock position in the sky. Thinking this was a reflection of cabin lights, I cupped my hands over my eyes to block out any reflecting light. The lights were bright and clear overhead, so I then immediately thought these were outside lights. I looked down over the wing lights, and noticed that the right wing light was white; since I couldn&apos;t see the tail at all from the window, I realized these were not tail lights. In addition, they were overhead, where I had to actually look up from the window,! so I realized these lights were neither part of the plane nor were they land lights, since this was over the ocean.As this was also in the middle of the non-eventful flight, the cruising altitude had not changed, so the three red lights in triangular form must have been at the very least, 60,000 - 80,000 ft. high. The lights also had a blinking pattern which uniformly looped over and over for the ten-minute sighting: the two left side lights blinked once, followed by the top right light; then the two top lights blinked once, followed by the bottom left light; then all three lights together blinked in unison. This pattern of blinking was happening during the entire time.In addition, unlike seeing another plane in flight, these red lights were stationary - with the Delta airplane moving away. It was like seeing bright blinking lights on the ground - but in reverse. The blinking lights were above and we were flying below, moving more and more out of view. After about ten minutes, the stationary blinking lights were moving out of view as the plane moved further to the &quot;left,&quot; or east. After they were out of view, the view out the window looking in same direction was pitch black; it was then, when I realized this was clearly not a reflection but an actual set of lights in a triangular form, blinking in patterns and &apos;hovering&apos; over the North Atlantic Ocean.", "Blue glowing object in tampaMyself and two children driving south on Himes avenue and saw a blue triangular glowing object.  We stopped to watch, was west of Gandy and Himes.  I&apos;ve lived here for over 30 years and haven&apos;t seen anything like it. It was moving sporadically, not like a plane.  It moved around for about 5 minutes then disappeared.", "Several constant beams of light spread out across the skyWalked outside to see several constant beams of whitish lights shooting up into the sky.  The beams grew and fell off in intensity, all while maintaining their locations.  Some beams were grouped in fours, others in two&apos;s, and were spread out in front of me as in a line.  However the beams were not all on the same line but had some depth to them.  It was like they came from a promotional spot light but were too many in number and covered an area far too great to be spot lights.

After the fourth illumination, I saw 4 tiny white dots moving very slowly across the sky and within a second or two all the lights disappeared.

The object did not appear to have a shape that I could see but the light was bright enough to have a kind of flare effect.  As I watched the ball of light ascend into the clouds I lost track of it.  There weren&apos;t many clouds in the sky that morning I could see stars clearly.  The object did not appear to alter its course in any way and I assumed it was a rocket launch from the nearby Kennedy Space Center.

Having served in the Marine Corps, I am very familiar with this sound and usually stop what I&rsquo;m doing and locate the choppers in the sky.  This was totally different.  The sound was of something absolutely huge.  We could hear it approaching and stopped what we were doing to locate the &ldquo;object&rdquo;.  As it neared, the sound became almost deafening until it became a feeling that literally shook the ground.  I was walking all over the area searching the skies for an object.  When the sound became directly over our heads, it remained for some time, as if hovering.  Our only guess was that whatever it was, it was somehow not visible to the naked eye, or as we assumed, &ldquo;cloaked&rdquo;.  At this time, there was no point in moving around, as I had searched every available spot in t! he sky for an object, to no avail.

The craft frequently dove and dipped in the sky, often seeming to flip over or rotate. The craft flew very quickly, faster than any regular aircraft. The craft often crossed the sky within eight seconds or less. When the craft appeared to be in the center of the sky, a slight whirring noise could be heard. About ten minutes into the encounter, the lights appeared to split and fly separately. The lights separated into smaller lights, a string of six to seven.

It appeared as if one of the larger objects was emitting the smaller objects, which also resembled the same shape. The objects slowly rotated around each other in a clockwise motion.

First my companion and I had stopped in Homestead for dinner in a local Mexican restaurant, which I remember closed at 10 or 10:30, and we left shortly after that to return to Miami. It was late and dark over the ocean as the car went over one of several bridges between Homestead and the islands east of Miami, where we were headed. Freeway bridges. I remember we were still well south of Miami when it happened.I was in the passenger seat with the passenger window open wide, looking directly out to the black ocean beyond the bridge. Roughly, to the east. There were lights along the walls of the bridge, but not too bright, because the darkness beyond was visible. It was very still and not many cars. No sign of anyone in particular below, or any boats there. Nothing stirring around the sky, the water, or on the sidelines of the bridge, where there were buildings or concrete, where some sort of aspects of the ongoing urban zone had vaguelly registered on my mind. It was not a swampy area or rural zone.It had been raining, and was still a little bit, so the humidity was feeling pretty high, and there was the apparency of some degree of condensation. Before my eyes my brain registered a sort of swooping thing, what I don&apos;t know. It was only visible there about a second, maybe less. The shock of it was less strong than my mind&apos;s effort to try to place what it was, but it couldn&apos;t. It still can&apos;t.It was possibly a foot across and a foot and a half long. But it was shaped something like a teardrop or a puff of smoke with a wider head and a long, thin sort of tail or an impression of a projection - sort of shaped like Casper the  Friendly Ghost in the cartoon, when Casper was about to swoop away, his &quot;tail&quot; down to a small squiggle. Hard to describe. But I had the sense, at the time, that the tail-thing was moving a bit. Propelling it? I couldn&apos;t say. But that it had some sort of motion to it stays in my impression of it. Not a terribly pronounded thing, maybe, but there was that aspect to my initial impression.The thing started out like it could have been a flare up of some kind, like when a fire or a spark might pass over a small concentration of gas lingering somewhere in the air and cause it to flare up for a second . That was exactly what it seemed like at the time. Except for things that bothered me about it, even as it happened. It was a rainbow of light flaring up toward me. I remember I started to automatically jerk back, but realized it wasn&apos;t coming any further.Throughout its entire form,it looked like a rainbow, almost exactly.Only not quite. Some of the colors were missing, mostly the subtle blurred shadings between colors, were sort of missing. And there was too much white, or yellow-white, in it, which increased with each successive flare, of which there were two more.The first one had a lot of green and blue and red, pretty much like a rainbow. Only the colors were too something - too milky, maybe - to be from light refraction such as I have ever seen it before. Too solid. And shaped like the blob I described.It came literally out of no where. I was staring out into the night to the right of the car, and it flared up out of nothing. One instant it wasn&apos;t there and the next it was. And to me the oddest thing was, even though  the colors were there so bright against dark night sky, there a blackness surrounding and encasing the spectrum which I saw was not quite the blackness of the sky behind it. It was black like the sky, but somehow it didn&apos;t quite match the sky. And odd as it seems now to have noticed this, the edges, where the black of the sky met the black of the shape, the edges between the two seemed to blur, where the object&apos;s edges sort of &quot;ran&quot; like a watercolor, over the top of the sky. It had something about it that reminded me of the quality and order of blackness of the old telephones in the 1950s. It had a different aspect of solidity than the blackness of the sky behind it, too, though in a way it seemed to match the color of the sky. And the shape of the spectrum inside of the black surrounding it was a bit off from the type of shape than I have associated with any random spectrum I have ever seen. And the colors were very solid and bright.Not neon bright. But, at the least, outstanding.And when it appeared, it loomed. It came out of nothing, surged a bit toward me, forward and nose slightly turning down toward me, and then stayed suspended there, and then just vanished. It didn&apos;t fade away. It&apos;s spectrum was not moving, but was not rigid, either, in the glow or strength of the colors it had.Oddly,the car was going pretty fast, faster than the speed limit, possibly as much as 80 mph, based how how fast my driver is inclined to drive in such road conditions. Yet I am aware for an entire half to whole second, I could observe it right there where I was looking. That seems odd, too. And it is also possible the bridge had columns or slates at regular intervals, because my impression seems to incorporate them into the event.The second incident was beyond another of these break points in the side of the bridge. The first one seems to have occured within a different break point than the second.The first one never came beyond the edge of the side of the bridge.I don&apos;t think it ever was extremely near to the bridge itself, though my impression was it was not very far beyond it. Maybe a few feet. The others were about the same distance.A couple of seconds later, when I was only a little beyond the first sighting, another, smaller sighting appeared. The same way.Maybe half as large. The second one didn&apos;t surprise me as much, it only seemed interesting. And it disappeared maybe a little faster.It had had more white/yellow to it, but was otherwise similar enough to be considered the same phenonena. The third one, basically the same, though far smaller and not so much color, came and went the same way, though it appeared before, or maybe as the second one was vanishing. I&apos;m not sure I saw the third one vanish before we had moved beyond it. Neither of these were appearing to zoom toward me as the first one did.When they were gone, I watched a little bit for others, still sort of assuming they had been something typical for whatever atmospheric conditions there were off the side of the bridge. Once we were off the bridge I asked my friend what they were, and described them to him. He is a Miami native and has driven north over that bridge many times at night from work he was doing in Homestead. He had no idea what I was talking about and said it sounded like I had been drinking, which I had not. I asked him what was along the seawall along that stretch. He said he thought it might be something industrial, but he wasn&apos;t sure. He was vague on where that spot even was, only having ever passed over it on his way to somewhere else, and there are a lot of bridges along the route.My window was fully open  and I was looking directly out of it. I never smelled anything unusual. No car exhausts. No unusual smells at all. It was all fresh and clean out there, after a recent short bout of rain. There was no sound to what I saw. It all came and went so fast, no fanfare, no aftermath. In a way it seemed perfectly normal and natural. But it wasn&apos;t. I don&apos;t know what it was..", "these crafts were not planes.I don&apos;t recall the exact date, but I have witness these crafts twice, on November and on December 2009. It was between 7 and 8 pm, it was dark already, some clouds. I was having a smoke on my balcony which faces west. I see planes almost every day far and close, so I know planes. I lived for over 8 years near the Miami International Airport, before I moved to this new place. I know airplanes, how they move their colors, the sound, just the way they move is enough to tell me that what I was seeing that night were not planes. They move too smooth and no noise, the color of the lights also was different. Planes are required to have green and red lights so that it is possible to tell if they plane is approaching or getting farther away. Those crafts I saw had no lights like this. What they had was lights bluish white which blinked, like on and off, on and off. They just felt strange, this is the only way I can describe. After seeing planes all my life, these jus! t were different. Now they were traveling from my left to my right, since my balcony faces west, they were moving from south to north. There is nothing south except the sea so go figure were they came from. My first sighting of these strange crafts was on November probably mid November 2009. Then in the middle of December, I was smoking again at around 7:30 pm and I saw them again, this really stroke as fancy, I mean do they do this every other day? I have not seen them anymore. There were maybe 5 to 7 of these things, they were not in any kind of formation. I would say they were in a circular formation, if you can call that a formation. Both instances I saw them at the same angle of view, I would say 60 degrees, I think, with the horizon being 0 and straight up from my head being 90. It is hard because I live in the fourth floor. There used to be a base down here, the homestead base, but it has been close since the mid 1990s.Now I want to tell you about another sighting I had a few years back, the reason is that that craft was also coming from the south. This craft I saw in this occasion I got to see its shape, it was a charcoal triangle, not black, dark but it had a sort of blue around it. This was seen by 4 people, including me. We saw it and then some one said, that is what people see like UFO don&apos;t you think? No nose and the same smooth going which planes don&apos;t have, it is like they are not feeling the resistance of the air around them or something, this is the best way I can explain.I believe in the so call aliens, not only because of the sightings in modern times, but I think these beings have been coming and going way before man ever walked the earth. But I don&apos;t know why I have the feeling these triangles are &ldquo;Made in the USA&rdquo; just something. You have seen how the government can hide things like the stealth fighter, the blackbird SR71, and Aurora, we are talking technology which was developed 50 years ago, so imagine what they have now. When will we see this technology? As soon as they have a better one.I also believe that not all aliens come from this universe by traveling billions of miles, I think there is enough evidence to show some come from other realities as well. I guess those too fall in the alien category. Can contact me if it is worth it.", "Triangle ufo over Santa Clarita. Possible man made!I was outside last nite having a cigarette when I heard a large low flying plane and noticed a large army plane which was not unusual since Edwards Air Force base is not to far away.  But after looking at the plane I notice that out in front of the plane by about 500ft was another craft with no blinking lights just a faint light in each corver, Red, Blue, Green.  I immedietly called my wife who was able to see the craft as well.  It seamed that the plane was following the craft so I dont know if this may be a man made ufo or if they were observing it.", "followed by giant flashing orb for quarter-mileDear reader  I was on a trip across cuntry heading home.

A very dark rainy night.  I saw 3 lights in a straight line, red on both ends and white in the middle, the red lights blinked in an alternating pattern. In a straight line the lights moved from horizontal to vertical.  Top red middle white bottom red. Lights were much higher in the sky than radio/cell phone towers.  These lights seem to be too stationary to be an Air Plane.  There was also another stationary white light, possibly a helicopter. Closer to the ground, but far away from the other lights.  The singular white light moved under the three other lights, still much closer to the grown.  Once the white light lined up under the three lights, they turn into one  non blinking red light, and quickly goes into the distance.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We were outside of our little country church with several other kids waiting for choir practice to end.  Someone noticed an object hovering near us in the cow pasture very close to where we were standing.  No sound.

My husband has been after me to tell someone about this since he has known me.  It was such a long time ago that I felt it was not prudent now.  Windsor,  North Carolina, is a small county town with a lot of farmland and open spaces. There have been multiple sightings.  My older cousin saw a disc-shaped object nestled in a field surrounded by woods on her way home just around dusk one evening.  (I believe it was not long after my sighting). It lifted up and over her car, hovered in an adjacent field then took off.  This was years ago and told to me by my mother.  This was when we lived a mile down a country dirt road, and she lived just past us with her husband.    The object that I witnessed was apparently seen by adults the following week at church.  I was not there, I did not see it again.  What I saw left a lasting impression on me.  I am a true believer.  I wish I could re-live the moment and remember everything.  I have always said that I would love to be hypnotized and return to that moment and see it again as an adult.  I would love to remember every detail of my experience.  I now live just outside Raleigh, NC, with my husband and children.  I have never seen a UFO again, but always look to the sky&apos;s in hopes of seeing one.  This experience is always with me, so many years later.  Never far from my mind.  Isn&apos;t that crazy?I will ask my brother, but he is retired military and works for the government in Virginia and may not feel comfortable doing this.  The others, I have lost contact with 20+ years ago and have no idea where they are now.

PD))I went to sleep at 7am in the morning.  I had a dream that my parents bought a new house and then a friend and I where checking out a room in the house. The room had a back sliding door (glass).  We went outside for some reason and down from the sky past a tree with no leaves a bunch of these tiny balls floated down. well they didnt float they descended down under their own power it seemed but slowly.they started out as barely visible dots in the sky.  These balls looked to be about 10 inches in diameter maybe a little bigger.  The balls I saw were see through navy- light blue that looked plastic with a solid orange core about 3-4 inches in diameter.  They floated around us and we ran inside. One of the balls managed to get in and i picked it out of the air with both my hands cuped around the bottom of the ball.  I dont remember it feeling like plastic or not like plastic, i just remember it feeling like a smooth surface thats how plastic probably feels im sure.  It was very light pretty much weightless.  Anyways it came in and I picked it out of the air and put it outside quickly because i was freaking out on some calm level. when i tryed to shove it outside I closed the door while i was putting it out there so it couldnt get back in kind of what someone would do if they we putting a bug outside. when i put it out it seemed like it tried to get back in as it was ascending but couldnt fit through the 3 inch crack of the door. It ended up going straight up and over the house and the gutter. After that in my dream i was trying to call the police but i couldnt for some reason. Then this is the seemingly fake part that makes me think it really was just a dream. It was a dream but ever since i woke up it just felt so real i have never had such a realistic dream in my life ok heres the fake part. After the ball went over the house i went to the front of the house and there was this small auditorium facing a bunch of glass doors not sliding ! doors like in the back of the house but like office building d! oors. th e seats were facing the front doors. On one of the seats of the auditorium was this sprinkler head looking thing spewing out some kind of dark smoke on two side as it was spinning. it was deployed from one of the balls im pretty sure, so then i grabbed it off the back of the seat and threw it outside onto the ground. Then for some reason the auditorium was full of young to middle age people after i turned back from throwing the sprinkler looking thing out the front door. I remember this all vividly and perfectly but the end part is a little hazy. I remember telling anyone around me to call the police and the military. The police never showed up but i do remember a military guy wearing a decked out military navy blue uniform with lots of metals like you would see on a navy officers coat. Most of the metal were on his left breast like in real life. The military guy was the only one in uniform and he was in the front row of the full auditorium standing up looking at me along wi! th a few others in the front row standing up. He was the only one that stuck out in my mind. This all was probably just a dream. All my logical tells me it was just a dream but my emotions and feelings and body tell me it was real. It was so vivid, it seemed so real and it still does, even while typing this up 3 hours after I had this dream. I have never seen or heard about these types of blue balls with the orange centers so i dont know where i would get the idea about them. very strange. After i woke up i looked outside to see if they were out there and thinking that they would be; there was nothing. This was not at all dissappointing i hope to god it was not real it really freaked me out. I was scared when the balls came down the only reason i grabed the one and put it outside is because no one else was going to so i had to and i feared for my life. same with the sprinkler thing i thought it was trying to harm me in some way. It was probably just a dream but if not i don! t want to see it again and for that matter i hope i never drea! m about it again. disturbing.  I appologize for wasting anyones time for reading this if it was just a dream.

Iwas still hungry though so i got out of bed. 07:18 Looked out of the bedroom window, facing NE towards Cottingley &amp; Bingley and saw what looked to be a right star which i had never noticed before. I studied it thinking it was a helicopter or satellite. 07:19 From my view it made maneuvers inside a small circle and then went back to being stationary. I flashed some of the lights in my house with the curtains open and waved, wanting it to notice me. 07:20 There became a yellow shimmer around it as if it was looking at me, i waved, the shimmer dissapeared after a few minutes. 07:26 Had Breakfast  07:31 Went back upstairs and checked the window. The light was slowly appeaing on and off and stayed on when i stared at it from the window. 07:36 When i squinted at the light i saw a light comming around it. When it came inline with the first light it becam stationary also. I went away. 07:40 I came back with a pad and paper to draw it so that i could remember it later and now there was three lights in the sky like a triangle. With a Haze around them that was a darker colour of the sky. I stood and drew it. By the time i had finished drawing the first two lights had disappeared. 07:48 The light flashed a blue electric arch around it, i rushed off to tell my sister (only other person home) when i came back it was gone.  I feel that i have missed out some pieces of this as it has been an hour since the sighting, i drew a picture on paint of what i saw. (note it wasnt pitch black but it was dark.)

Everything stopped when i turned they keys the car wouldn&apos;t make a noise.  It was very quiet and then we got out of the car and looked up. We saw two 15-20 feet long chevron shaped flying objects.  I was scared out of my mind. They were still were rimmed with blue and red and green and yellow lights.  It was a full moon and they had a distinct shape due to the bright sky of the full moon they were black but because of the lights, they kind of glowed they were moving slowly and down toward us.  Then something must have startled them but they moved north at a speed i have never seen anything go, and in a instant, the car turned back on, and the car alarm went off as well.My miles in my car are now set to zero, which is cool, but my radio doesn&apos;t work and neither does any of our cell phones.

My husband asked if that was a star in the sky and I said no it is too bright to be a star.  The object wasn&apos;t moving so as we got closer to it, it started moving slightly toward our car. When it directly over our car we pulled over to get a better look.  The object just hovered mostly but as we looked at it longer it started to move away from under our car.  It was very quiet.  Never heard a noice from it.  We watched it fly away slowly and so we proceeded on our way.  As we were driving down FM1008 I noticed another one in the sky.  It could have possibly been the same one but I don&apos;t think so.  This is the second sighting I&apos;ve had in this area in past 2 years.", "Two white fireballs seen in sky.

VERY bright, was in a straight line time facing NNW.The light was white with a tinge of blue, light itself was the straight like a bar bell with 2 lights on the end.IT had a smaller light on each end of the bar that were identical in shape. There was a light, then a small space then light. This composed the SMALL light at each end.Then there was the middle BAR light which was about 5x the length of the small end lights.Had a middle longer bar then the light like the video again in a straight line.Since it was there for about 30 minutes or more as I was watching it, I was hoping it might be there for a while longer, so I rushed home to get a camera and my Night Vision Monocular.When I got back, it was there for only about30 seconds more, I couldn&apos;t even set up the camera to take any video then it disappeared.I waited until after 9:20pm to see if it would come back but I didn&apos;t see it anymore.Just before 9pm, still looking in the area of the sky where it was using my Night Vision Monocular, I suddenly saw a DOT just like a small star moving in a straight line and immediately thought it was a Satellite as I have spent countless nights star gazing and see satellites every 5 minutes sometimes which is nothing unusual.This light however  stopped going straight, slowed down smoothly, but quickly, and turned, started flying around that area with incredible speed and maneuverability, it&apos;s very difficult to describe the type of movement...it was FAST, reactive, but still smooth flying, not like a bug or bird or anything I&apos;ve ever seen....keep in mind I&apos;ve star gazed for decades, have owned numerous telescopes, so I&apos;m familiar with what I can see out there, this was like nothing I&apos;ve ever seen.This point light looked to be very high as it was in FOCUS with the stars, anything very close would be out of focus on my Night Vision as it&apos;s manual adjusted focus so it had to be quite distant.This light then darted off in a straight line after the maneuvers, and the lights from the street and buildings flared up the Night Vision and I couldn&apos;t view it anymore as there were street lights everywhere. The whole time I was yelling out &quot;that&apos;s impossible&quot; etc, I couldn&apos;t contain myself.", "Walking on Cordova westbound just before the Hilton.

We were out watching our neighbors shoot fireworks from our back windows and my husband in the yard.  We then saw what we at first thought was an aircraft coming very fast.  It was unusually bright though. We thought it might be a plane on fire.  It was a very yellowish/white light.  Then it abruptly stopped and began to hover over our neighborhood.  It hovered then disappeared in a blink then two more air crafts came on very fast, hovered then dissapeared in a blink as well.

I spotted something just above the tree line, three bright lights that were very intense.  Mind you that the trees were at least 100 feet tall, and we were a good 1 &frac12; mile from them, also it was midday and partly cloudy.I yelled to the rest of the car what is that!?  And we came over the hill for town hall road and saw it still had not moved, we saw that about 15 other cars were pulled over on each side of the road, with everyone out staring at the object with cameras and cell phones.  We attempted to get several pictures but we couldn&rsquo;t because of the low quality of my camera phone.The object stayed in the same place for a good couple of minutes.  The object began to lift and as it did we all heard something that sounded like an electric engine winding up.  The object at this point was about &frac14; mile away and yet it looked like it was right in front of me, I&rsquo;d guess it was a few hundred feet in diameter.  The lights flicked off and I saw it had the reflectivity of polished aluminum or steel but was so light of a color that I had never seen metal that color before.  The trees below the object didn&rsquo;t move as it changed from a hover to achieving lift, which was weird because it was not that high above trees directly below it.  The object then got higher and higher then it seemed to disappear.  After the object left (about 2 minutes later), we saw a dual prop plane come from the same direction the object was first sighted in, the aircraft circled the spot a few times were the object was then left back in the direction it came.

At first they were in a triangular position, then they moved into a straight line, somewhat horizontal to the earth. I went inside to call a friend or two and when I returned outside one of the lights was gone. The other two lights started to flicker and die out, then one died. The last light remained for a couple minutes more, then it too died out.  Other than coming into alignment with each other, the lights did not move at all.

At around 7:40 pm near my home in the Cincinnati neighborhood of Westwood I viewed from the road while driving my car what looked like 3 flaming objects descending to Earth. As CKY is just across the Ohio River and a major flight path goes over my neighborhood I assumed it was a mid air explosion of a commercial aircraft. As I drove towards where the objects seemed to be descending I saw there were actually four burning fire balls moving in formation. These were not burners, they were visibly flaming and left &apos;tails&apos; as they moved. It was an irregular motion and I watched them until they moved out of view. There was a lot of other aircraft activity in the sky as well, including a low flying(and fast) military aircraft that was discernably terrestrial and several civilian aircraft mentioned above that flew much higher and served as a point of reference for both fireballs and military plan.

I have also worked at the airport for about 3 years.As I looked up at the stars I saw orange lights moving from North to South at a height of the same as a landing aircraft.  I did a double take when I realized it was not an airplane, or one that I would have recognized as there were no standard aircraft lights visible.  I tried to knock on the front window to get my wife&rsquo;s attention, but to no avail.  I went to the street to follow the lights as they went south over my house and disappeared.  The event lasted about 5-15 seconds.

As I proceeded from the traffic lights I noticed two red circles to the south-east.  I pulled to the side of the road and signalled to other our family in the car ahead to pull over.  We all witnessed two slow moving red lights about drawing pinhead size, one behind the other. At first we thought they were helicopters but no navigational lights were visible and there was no audible sound. They flew together for a short time then one changed course.  We all joked that they were checking out the house of lights and my d-i-l suggested it was Santa arriving with Rudolph! As one faded into the western sky it no longer glowed but appeared as a pinprick constant red light.  We continued to see them as we walked to view the house and as my husband and I returned to East Auckland we spotted the lights again - this time two side by side and one on top.  We quickly searched for a safe spot to stop the car but they had disappeared.The Auckland Herald also reported strange lights over Tauranga the same night but the Police had no reports of other sightings.  I did not report our sighting other than to this site.", "Shape shifting worm like ufoThis object flew into view behind my house in NE Ohio on Sept. 9 2009 while I was sitting out back at around 8:30 to 9 pm. From the ground with the naked eye I thought it was the lights of an airplane, but it stopped and stood still in one spot for at least a half hour. When I went back in the house after taking the photos, it was still hovering so I don&apos;t know exactly how long it was there. After about 10 minutes I grabbed my Fuij digital camera and took a series of 8 photos a few seconds apart. I could not make out any shapes, only flickering lights, with the naked eye and the screen on the camera. It wasn&apos;t until I zoomed in on the object in photoshop that I could see the shapes of the object. The UFO was changing shapes as I took the photos. I would have taken more photos if I knew that this was what I would find when I zoomed in on it. I think that the colorization of the UFO is very similar to the those in some of the recent Kumburgaz UFO Videos. I hav! e the original unzoomed photos, they are about 1 mb each, taken at about 3 megapixel resolution. Unfortunately my camera was not set at full resolution or the photos would have been much better.

I looked up at the sky as I walked from my car to the house to look at the clouds.  Almost directly overhead, in a clear patch between the clouds, I saw a brilliant, glowing orange V-shaped object.  It appeared stationary when I first saw it.  I went into the house to get a small spotting scope that I use for bird watching and returned. Using the scope, I saw that the V object was not solid orange, but had alternating sections of orange and white.  It had some type of structure to it that I could not quite make out due to distance.  The best I and describe it is a length of a crane or bridge, with it&rsquo;s intricate crosspieces, bent at a 45 degree angle, painted orange and white. I was not a wing shape at all, as the arms of the V did not have much width to them.  The object would drift in and out of the clouds as they passed by to the NE, the clouds sometimes partially obscuring the object. I would estimate the size as similar to the wingspan of a commercial jet aircraft.  The object seemed to maneuver periodically to remain near the edge of the clouds.  I watched until the cloud cover thickened and the object was not visible any longer, about 5 minutes.I realize this is almost 5 years ago and I am just reporting it now.  At the time, I assumed that, due to the color, it was some sort of experimental device.  I also considered the date (day after Valentine&rsquo;s day) of the sighting, that it may have been a balloon arch that got loose, but I have since had the chance to observe balloons released into the sky and they did not behave or look they way this object did.  I am reporting it now since I see so many reports of V and triangle shaped objects, maybe this is some piece of the puzzle.", "Solid orange light appears near Covina, ca.My fianc&eacute; and I were in our backyard 10 minutes before the stroke of midnight of the new 2010 new year.  We were looking up at the sky because the moon was full and bright. We were facing south and we saw this orangish light going across the sky from east to west.  It was too high to be a helicopter and too fast to be a plane.  The solid light was steadily moving across the sky. As we keep our eyes on it, we notice it begins to slow down.  Then it comes a complete stop. It hovers there for about 5 minutes.  By the time I found my binnoculars the light, still at a stop, begins to dim and slowly fades away.

It changed formation and moved on a curve several times.This is probably going to sound crazy, but I can&rsquo;t explain what I saw tonight.  My husband saw it too, he thinks it was just a plane, but he can&rsquo;t explain how the lights possibly looked if they were a plane.We went to Disneyland tonight.  We got off the Nightmare before Christmas ride and were walking back towards the lake when I saw 3 multicolored lights in the sky over the lake in triangular formation.  Disney normally has this light show over the lake, where they project lights and movies onto water fountains that shoot out of the lake.  I though the lights were something for the show, and I pointed them out to my husband and told him I wanted to see what they were doing for the light show.As we walked, the lights were moving slowly upwards.  I still thought they had to do with the show, until we got over next to the lake and no one was there because there was no light show.  We could still see the triangular formation moving up and to the right.  I asked my husband what it was, and he said it had to be a plane.  But the lights did not stay in one formation, they changed places.  I could tell because each one was a different color, and they switched as they moved. I kept telling my husband to look, and asking him what he thought it was, but he couldn&rsquo;t answer.  He said it was a plane, then that it was too foggy to tell, but I know what I saw.The lights moved up and to the right, and finally, and turned to look at my husband and when I looked back they were gone.  I&rsquo;ve thought it over 100 times, and I don&rsquo;t know what it was. They did not move in a straight line, they changed formation, they were much closer to the park when I saw them than when they disappeared.  Even if there had been a light show it couldn&rsquo;t have explained this.   I know it sounds completely crazy to say you saw a UFO at Disneyland, but I have no explanation for what I saw.I have photos, but they are long exposures and not very good, but you can see in the few shots that they are getting dimmer.

The lights were different from the lights used on light aircraft (i.e., the position lights consist of an Aviation Red light on the left side, an Aviation Green light on the right and an Aviation White tail light).  There were no position lights and no aircraft noise was audible, just the bright white strobe effect from three different positions in the sky.  The distances changed and shifted, but a triangular pattern of some sort was maintained, and after about 8 minutes one of the lights split into two.

I was fishing on a dock facing south on Clear Lake just west of Seabrook, TX. Actually I was in El Lago, TX. In a south/southwest direction up in the sky, way up above the Hilton Hotel and was already in motion and continued in a perfect geometrical arc in direction and down towards and disappearing, not over the horizon, but just above the west horizon.  Object appeared to me about 1 and 1/2 times the size of a full moon, just off of round.  I would say slightly egg shaped.  Object had no sound and moved from where I started to see it to where it disappeared in about a fourth of the time it would take a fighter plane to travel.  Now then, the color and radiance of the object stayed the same throughout the sighting.  It was a very bright light green almost like a glowing type of green although it didn&apos;t do any glowing.  Just the object itself had the color and light.  There was no light emitting off of it into the surrounding dark sky or a! ny halo and I hope I am discribing this so as to give an accurate picture. There is no way to come up with a guess on the actual size of the object or how far it was from earth.  And like I said there was no sound, perfect arc descending pattern,  size abnormally large compared to anything that we would normally see in our sky.  Speed incredibly fast compared to our F16&apos;s, etc. and the way the light emitted from the object was not normal.  This happened in Oct of 2000.  I reported this on this site back in 05 or 06 although I can&apos;t find my sighting in your archives.  I would really like for someone to let me know if this was something that has a logical explanation behind it.  Nasa is right there at that end of the lake.  If this is something of our government, we have nothing to fear from other country&apos;s military might.

I was the FSO and Director of Security for several years. I received my training at DOD in Richmond Va. I held a TS Clearance.A report was filed through I think this site at the time it occurred. The date may be 1992. A report was filed and came back with no explanation. My father told me to leave it alone and I did.

About 3/4 of the way out. It was close enough that I could make out the details. It was a silver color Circle shaped with a circle Dome on top smaller then the bottom part. It looked like something out of those old Sci-Fi flicks.While I was staring up at it a shield opened on the upper dome for about 2 mins then closed. The cloud slowly coverd it or it moved back into it and disappeared. I got into my car and told my family friends and filed a report.I could pass a polygraph test on this event.

Dix / McGuire AFB Broad daylight!While observing the moon over McGuire AFB to the east something caught the corner of my eye kind of overhead at 90 degrees. As I looked up I observed 2 oval shaped objects about half the length of a commercial airliner. The objects appeared silvery almost liquid silver. They were approximatley 1/2 half a mile from each other moving from west to east - towards the Ft.Dix / Mcguire AFB location. These objects moved at a high rate of speed at least 8-10 times faster than any commercial or military craft that I have seen in my lifetime. As they traveled parallel to each other towards the military installations I observed each one of them simultaneously split into 2 craft making now a total of 4. This must be about 10-13 seconds into the observation at this point they were approximatley over or very near the bases now and I observed all 4 of the objects turn abruptly to the north and immediately vanish.As I stood there looking around to see if someone else was around that maybe saw this I took my cell phone out to call my wife and tell her of this extraordinary incident, I looked to the sky where this began and there was a single one flying even faster than the first ones. I had the cell phone inmy hand ,hit the camera button on the side aimed as quickly as I could hoping to capture this on my phone. I was gone in 5 -10 seconds.Not a sound at all was heard from this.

Between Preble and Homer I saw a streak of white light in front of the car entering my field of vision from the East. I imediately thought it was a meteor, but then it slowed down, directly south of me; it slowed to a crawl. It appeared the size of a bright star or planet in the night sky. After a few seconds it sped up and flew off to the West. When it came in it was decending, when it flew off it was either level or slightly ascending.This event lasted aproximately 3-5 seconds, at about 6:57 pm. The object was at about 30-40 degrees up in the sky.", "Light that appeared, hovered, and promptly disappeared with no sound emitted at all.We had just anchored the boat for some late night fishing. Within about a minute of our arrival on our favorite spot, a light became visible moving at a (relataively)slow speed. At first, it appeared to be nothing more than a bright satellite or other man made space object. But it soon became apparent that it was something more. The light grew increasingly intense, and our engine that had been running stopped abruptly. The light grew even more intense and the water and nearby forest was lit almost as brightly as it would have been during the day. The object moved across the forest and stopped, appearing to hover. All three of us were in a state of shock. The object emitted a near-blinding light. The object then proceeded slowly across the botom side of the lake and vanished just as quickly as it had appeared. We immediately left the lake and went back to our cabin. All three have sworn to silence, this is the first time that this information has been shared.! At first, I believed that this was an intense iridium flare and it only appeared to be getting closer because the diameter of the phenomenon was increasing. But I can confidently say that this was not an illusion and that the object was at a low altitude and very near to our position.  A hill visible about two miles from the lake was lit up entirely so that proves that the light was in between us and the hill. I have no idea what this was. It moved swiftly, slowed and hovered momentarily, then disappeared. There was no sound that was emitted from the object, and no trail left by it. No one else that we could see was on the lake but I am sure that a few othersmust have seen it. Two aircraft were nearby, one was an unidentifiable high-flying jet. The other was a small single or dual engined propeller aircraft approximately 3-4 miles away that appeared about five minutes after the object vanished. To note: I have always dismissed stories of extra-terrestrial beings and UFOs as! irrational and ludicrous. Therefore I am not considering this! inciden t to be a visit by some green skinned alien from outer space. I Believe that this WAS however some man-made craft or some extremely rare natural phenomenon. Scenario A seems more probably because the &quot;maneuvers&quot; the object performed seemed crisp and defined unlike something that would be a natural occurrence.To summarize: The object first appeared to be am Iridium Flare or something of that kind. Next, the object became increaringly brighter to a pont where it was difficult to look at directly, The light was white, and white only. The object then leveld off near the lake at a low altitude; 2000 feet or less. Absolutely no sound whatsoever was emitted from the object. It then proceeded to move across the forest, and stopped near the lake. It hovered there, then moved across the southern portion of the lake. As it was in motion it disappeared in an istant. Gone, just like that. I have absolutely no explanation for this. At first it appeared to be an iridium flare, but the rest of the incident proves that it could not be. It was very low to the ground and moved silently. I follow aviation closely and know that the government produces advanced aircraft. But putting a massive light on a silent and stealthy airframe would make absolutely no sense.

I finally left the telescope and walked to the edge of the dome from where I could see the slowly flashing light in the sky through the dome opening slot.  The light appeared to be about a mile away.  Everyone in my group of about 75 people saw the slowly flashing stationary light.  For two hours everyone saw it.

It was dark, and cloudy, but the moon still kept in light enough to see. I watched it for a few more seconds, confused as to what I was really seeing. I pointed in the sky, and asked my friends if they saw taht was well. As we kept driving, we could see it from underneath and to the side. The UFO was a wide triangular shape, with two red lights that sort of blinked at each end on the back. At the front tip was another light, and underneath there seemed to be another light closer to the front. The craft was dark, and thick. It was close enough that I could see the wings were the thick side angles. The craft was sleek, like a jet, but wider then anything I have seen. We all grabbed our cameras and pulled the car over.

They are outside our atmosphere and appear as something similar in size to stars (as we view stars from Earth) but they move in every given direction. I&rsquo;ve observed them stop and then start moving again, make 90 degree turns, suddenly increase speed until they appear almost a streak, stop just as suddenly, etc.  I&rsquo;ve seen as many as 9 of them at one time (about 2 years ago), with all 9 of them going in different directions and patterns and &ldquo;performing&rdquo; in a manner that I would liken to an air show.  I&rsquo;m so curious about them that I watch for them any time I go outside at night, just in case they might be there.On December 30, 2009, at about 6:30pm I was outside smoking when I saw two of them toward the south-southwest and moving in a northerly direction.  About the time I saw them, my husband joined me on the porch and I pointed them out to him.  (I would note that my husband was in law enforcement for several years and is skeptical of nearly everything.)  As we were watching them, one of the &ldquo;dots&rdquo; split off into two &ldquo;dots.&rdquo;  I had never seen them do that before and it certainly got my husband&rsquo;s attention.  At almost the same time, a 3rd and 4th one appeared in a different area of the sky (slightly more westerly and also moving north).  We noticed them at the same time.  The 3rd one then turned hard toward the east and immediately became incredibly bright &ndash; something else I&rsquo;ve never observed one of them do.  It appeared to be banking in a turn and it grew even brighter as it banked and also seemed to elongate.  It quickly gained speed as it went east; turned a soft red color and ! then faded out of sight.  My husband asked if I had seen it get longer and I told him that I definitely noticed that.Tonight (1.04.10) at about 7 p.m., I went out onto the porch and saw one of the &ldquo;star dots&rdquo; very far away and moving very slowly.  I was surprised as I usually don&rsquo;t see them that close together, with the previous sighting being just 5 days ago.  As I watched it, I caught a bright light out of the corner of my eye.  I called out to my husband &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one of them flying VERY LOW this time!&rdquo;  It appeared, of course, to be much larger than they usually appear because it was so low &ndash; somewhat lower than a commercial airliner would fly - but the light of it was too bright to allow us to make out its shape.  It was not flying in a perfectly straight line; it wavered slightly from time to time.  As we watched the low, bright one I remarked to my husband that it seemed to be tracking the smaller, more distant one move for move.  He agreed that that&rsquo;s what it looked like it was doing.

I happened to look out my kitchen window that is over the sink, and something caught my attention.  My window faces east, and I&apos;m about 7 miles to the SW of the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center.  What was so intriguing about the sky this morning was that there was a bright light, that appeared to be spiraling towards the ground.  If it was to be moving through the sky, it would have been moving an eastern direction, however because of the angle, it looked like the light was making movement towards the ground.At first glance, I thought it was a plane crash or a shooting start, but then before the light hit the horizon, the light froze in place.  The light didn&apos;t emit any type of trail.  The light was a very bright and was blinking the whole time.  What made me think that the light was spiraling was how fast the light moved from right to left.The light &quot;fell&quot; for about 20-30 seconds before it reached it&apos;s &quot;hover&quot;.The light then hovered in place for close to 10 seconds.  Following the hover, the light moved quickly to my right, in a southern direction towards Joshua Tree National Park.  The light started to get smaller as it moved south towards the park.  Then, all of a sudden, it disappeared.There were no clouds in the sky.  A few aircraft could be seen flying in the vapor belt, leaving normal contrails.About half an hour later, I was standing out in my back yard looking at the sky, trying to figure out what I had seen. I remember counting four visible aircraft (I counted four contrails) when a thin, concave, dark metallic object appeared in the sky slightly higher from where the original light have hovered.  If I was to put my had out in front of my face, with my four fingers extended, the shape was about as wide as my four fingers aligned are wide.  It was VERY large compared to the size of the aircraft in the sky.The shape was larger and more pronounced from what I had seen 30 mins earlier, and wasn&apos;t &quot;glowing&quot; at first.  Then, as suddenly as it appeared, it got incredibly bright, almost like looking at the sun, and took off in an eastern direction VERY quickly.As soon as the object started moving east, the four aircraft in the sky turned east, it what appeared to be a pursuit and that was the last time that I saw the object or light.", "Bright powder blue puck shaped disk flying in circles near reagan pres library, 50 to 75 ft long, 1 mile awayIt was 5pm and like usual I was making dinner for my daughter and myself.  My daughter is 7 years old and was playing in the back yard.  I had just plugged in the deep fryer and had my back to her when she called to me to look.I turned around and saw it immediately.  You couldn&rsquo;t miss it.  The sun was setting behind the mountains between my house and the Reagan Presidential Library and the sky around the mountaintops was a beautiful orange glow.The craft was a bright glowing beautiful light blue exactly the color of the inside of a flame from a lighter.  Not the red part of the flame, but the inner blue part of a lighter flame.  It was shaped like a hockey puck.  It was flying less than 100 feet above the ground and was going around in circles over the mountain slopes.  I saw it from the side from my backyard about 6000 feet or1 mile away, so from that perspective, it looked flat just like a hockey puck.I gauged the size of the craft, from 50-75 ft. in diameter, based on a large white water storage tank that sits on one of the hills it was flying over.  It flew silently in circles over these hills and since I saw it from the side, it was banking from side to side as it reached the outer extent of its circular flight, like a skateboarder in a pool.My first thought was how beautiful it was and how gracefully it traversed the sky.

It did not so at that time we pulled over and I opened the sun roof as it was passing overhead then, it made a very abrupt 180 degree turn and proceeded back towards where we first sited it then made a 90 degree trun to the left (South to Southeast) and then disappeared.I am very involved in the aerospace industry and experienced aircraft observer (night and day), there were no red or green navigation lights, no white strobes, no flashing lights at all, it was a flickering orange yellow light that reminded us of flame whichis reason we thought it was a satellite at first.  With the windows down and sunroof open we heard no sounds at all.  The clouds were scattered and broken at 12,000 ft.

Heathrow airport was busy at the time, and I was watching many other planes around us out of the window.  We had reached about 1000 feet when I saw a dot about 500 feet below us, at a perpendicular angle towards the plane.  I followed the object, looking intently, expecting to be able to identify the aircraft as it approached closer.  As it approached I was very surprised to see that it did not materialize into any sort of aviation related object.  It was a perfectly spherical shape, a light yet dull metallic gray in colour, with no visible markings or imperfections in the purely circular shape. It caught my attention, and I struggled to figure out what it was.  I assumed it must have been a stationary object on the ground until it passed approximately 500 feet below the ! plane at a relatively high velocity.  From my guess it was relatively small object, no more than 5 metres in diameter.  I was completely and utterly puzzled, having never seen anything like it.  I have excellent 20/20 vision, and it was a perfect day visually, no clouds/precipitation or fog, and the sun was not too bright.  I was quite alert at the time, and was not tired.I made out the object very clearly, and could easily define the spherical shape and dull metallic colour, it was not blurry in any way and definitely was not a speck or smudge on the aircraft window.

I could barely make out a dark silhouette between the lights.  They appeared to slowly begin moving south when the light on the right side of the object flickered out slowly.  The other light remained, but appeared to be dimming.  It took approximately 30 seconds to one minute before the left side or remaining light dimmed then flickered out as well.I regained my composure and began to try to rationalize the sighting.  Maybe it was something I just hadn&rsquo;t noticed before.  Anyway my Wendy&rsquo;s was getting cold, so I began to leave.

I then thought they were two fighter aircraft, because of the small size, but the objects were round, with no wings, no tails, no projections of any kind and they were completely silent.

I think it might have been some kind of rocket, and am primarily looking for ways to check and see if any known launchings were taking place on November 6, 2009, at about 6:50 pm CST near Oklahoma City.  I don&apos;t know how to look for that kind of information, since searches online aren&apos;t bearing much fruit. I was driving home with my boyfriend, and for about seven minutes, we drove towards a little pink dot near the sunset.  From far away, I asked my boyfriend what he thought it was, and he guessed maybe Venus.  However, as we got closer, the object got significantly larger.  We only traveled about two miles, so I don&amp;#8217;t think this thing would have been particularly high in the sky. When we saw it at its closest, it appeared to be two white streams being emitted from a single tiny black dot situated above the streams.  That dot flickered orange frequently.  I&amp;#8217;d pass it off as a jet using its booster from Tinker Air Force Base, but this object did not appear to move.  My boyfriend said it looked like it might be moving slowly upwards, which would make sense if the streams were coming from thrusters. Unfortunately, I had to turn the car at that point, and we couldn&amp;#8217;t see it anymore.  It had gone from near the horizon to almost directly overhead as it got larger, and once we turned, it was obscured by the car roof.  I rushed home, which probably took about five minutes, grabbed my camera, and ran back out...  But we couldn&amp;#8217;t find it again. I saw an airplane flying on the horizon near it, when it was still too small to distinguish the streams.  The plane was much smaller than the shape, even then, and looked farther away.  I could also see the plane moving, while I could not observe the object moving. It seemed terrestrial to me, maybe a rocket taking up a satellite or something.  I just don&amp;#8217;t know where would be close enough to launch something like that, for it to be close enough to visually change so significantly in size after driving only a couple of miles.  If there is anywhere I can check records of what&amp;#8217;s been launched when and where, I&amp;#8217;d really like to check out whatever it was that I saw.

It was while my daughter and I had driven into the McNeil High School parking lot to pick up my son after school that my daughter observed a strange object in the sky.  She asked me what it was as it was getting closer to us, and I looked at it carefully before responding because I didn&rsquo;t want to make more of it than was necessary in case it was an identifiable craft.  However, upon close inspection, I could not see a tail fin or wings on what appeared to be a cigar shaped object, slightly larger in the front, and made up of two colors, orange and silver.

This thing would be right in front of us and in about 2 seconds it would look it was as far as the stars. I&apos;ve seen this thing a couple of times since but not as close as the first time. Now as in right now I can walk ou! tside my house and look up at the sky and see about hundred of those things and who knows how many more are out there but something is going on cause every night I see more and more of them. You can spot them out pretty easy. Whenever you see a star and it looks like two side by side its one of those things and they&apos;re not that far up, some are but every day more of them get lower and there is one main one that sits the lowest and is the shiniest one out of all. If you have a bright laser, (I use a green laser) you can point it at them and watch them move out of the way of it. See for your self, but I think something is about to happen and these things do not look man made and I think that mans technology is not this advanced. Oh also these things blink red, yellow, blue, and white lights.

Traveling SE on I10, right upon merging I noticed a bright disk glowing white, red and blue.  I estimate it was at around 40~50 thousand feet.  I immediately check my iphone application to see if there were any planets visible.  I did notice that Jupiter was directly due south at an alt of 40 degrees.  This light source was due east over what I would estimate to be over San Manuel, AZ. After 10 minutes of my wife and I observing this light, we noticed the flashing strobes from military aircraft either from Davis Monthan AFB or the Guard Unit at Tucson International.  The military aircraft moved fast towards the craft, which hovered the whole time.  When the military craft approached, the craft rose up immediately and disappeared into the darkness.We noted times, places and conditions.  Then we starting thinking about an interesting sighting my wife and I experienced much earlier in our trip.  We were heading east on I10 near milepost 170 due south of Phoenix when I looked to the west, admiring the sunset (5:25pm), when I noticed what appeared to be a plasma arc about a few miles from the highway, which blinded me.  My wife asked me what I saw and I pointed in the direction.  Then a few seconds later the plasma arc showed itself again.  The &quot;arc&quot; appeared to be in the direction of AZ347, but prior to reaching it.I work for an airline and am familiar with altitudes, various aircraft and their capabilities.  What we say this day was nothing I&apos;ve ever seen before.  We live near Davis Monthan AFB in Tucson and are exposed to military aircraft on a daily basis.  The craft we say was not military or private.

It had 4 very dim red lights on each end and was solid black. This was at night. It moved with no sound at all. passed over my head and was out of sight in about 30 seconds.Im not sure if this was because it was moving fast or because the lights were very dim. I called the police dept a couple of days later and there was no reports of this thing. I was the only one that saw it.There were no FAA lights just 4 very dim red lights on each corner and the craft.I think it was one structure because I could not see between the red lights and the lights did not change in formation so it was solid and seem to be moving slow and did not go up higher or go lower. It was moving as a public airliner plane would be moving at 30,000 feet but the UFO was much closer to the ground.I would have never known it was there unless I was looking up.The next day I talked to some people at the gas station and a couple of customers were telling me that they have seen red glowing UFOs in my city and others close by at night too but not a brick shape like I saw but round like a saucer with red lights also.At least Im not the only one that has seen these things around here.

I stayed at my sister&rsquo;s apartment while my car was being fixed last week.  On Friday, I got my car out of the shop but decided to stay at my sister&rsquo;s to watch movies.  However, first I wanted to come home to feed my dogs and wash clothes.  These would take some time as I live deep in the country in Arkansas, near Memphis.  It usually takes me at least 15 mins. to reach my house from my sister&rsquo;s apartment.I came home around 5-5:30, during dusk, and noticed this weird shape in the sky that did not move.  I didn&rsquo;t think about it for long due to the fact it was kind of far away.  I came home, did my chores, and left for my sister&rsquo;s apartment.  After watching movies (2012 and Zombieland), I started for home around 1 in the morning.  As I got closer to my house, I realized there was this strange light in the sky around a field.   Once again, I didn&rsquo;t really pay attention.  I thought it was a lamppost.As I rounding the third curve, I saw the light right above the field near the Waverly Gin.  This really freaked me out.  I was the only car on the road, in the country, near a field.  I thought for sure this thing was a helicopter, crop duster, you know just trying to rationalize what I was seeing.  When I got to the curve where the Gin and field were, I started to slow down.  As I slowed, I literally saw a disk like shape with one light, like a flood, search light looking-thing, and two red lights on the side.  I rolled the window down to hear, you know, if this was a helicopter or what, and I heard nothing.I seemed to be hovering over a line of trees about 100 feet away.  When I slowed down, I sat there for about 30 seconds to figure out what this thing was.  As I sat there, I started to see it coming closer to me.  I freaked out and tried to get as far away as possible from this thing.  It started to follow me and did so for about a mile.  I started to look at the clock and at the road, a little back and forth motion, to make sure I was still at the right time.  I remember the time was 1:45 the last time I looked at the clock in the car.  After I rounded curve number 5, I was no more than a few hundred feet from my house and looked in the review mirror, out the sun roof, and both side mirrors and saw nothing.When I pulled up to my house, the next thing I noticed was the neighbor&rsquo;s outdoor lights didn&rsquo;t come on when my dogs ran into his yard barking insanely.  So that started to weird me out.  I sat in the car for 5 mins. looking everywhere I could outside my car to see if something was around, above, behind, or anywhere near.  I got out and tried to peek above the trees to see if I could see whatever it was I had just encountered.  I saw nothing.  For the past two nights I have been freaked out whenever I drive home because whatever it was a I saw was not a plane.", "Large object floating in from over the Pacific Ocean in early morning daylight in southern CaliforniaMy husband and I were returning from walking our dogs at 7:45 a.m. on March 26, 2010, coming down a hillside overlooking the Pacific.  We saw something floating over the Pacific and moving towards the coast. It seemed to be coming from the west, heading slightly south east--perhaps toward Torrey Pines. It did not have the symmetrical shape of a hot air balloon, nor did it seem like a parasail craft. It was about 1/4 the &quot;size of a full moon.&quot; It looked to be dark blue, perhaps with some &ldquo;cardboard brown&rdquo; coloring&mdash;and no discernable markings. It had a cobbled-together appearance and if I was told it was a home-made craft, designed out of about a hundred card board boxes, and filled with helium I would think that was a viable possibility. There were no lights and no sounds. It appeared to be moving &ldquo;about as fast as a hot air balloon&rdquo; and did not appear to be under power.  As we finished our walk we kept an eye on it, and at one point it looked to be changing direction, heading more north-east. It seemed to be gaining altitude. Back at the house we found the binoculars but were unable to get a good focus on it.  My mother who was visiting from out of state tried the binoculars, too, but with no real success--it was too far away. Finally it changed direction again, and appeared to be heading more distinctly south east, toward the Miramar Marine Corps Air Station. Concerned that it might tangle with the flight pattern of the F-18&rsquo;s that fly out of Miramar regularly, we called the San Diego County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department, letting them know what we saw.

I was parked on the street by myself waiting for my sister to come out of my mother&rsquo;s house because I was picking her up. The street lights were on, and nobody was out on the street. While I was sitting there waiting for my sister to come outside, I experienced something that was very unusual and strange.  I saw everything turn pitch black and the sky turn into a bright light. I know it doesn&rsquo;t sound like something out of the ordinary but trust me it was. I keep replaying it in my head and it just doesn&rsquo;t make any sense to me. The best way that I can describe it is like a sudden and instant flash.  The thing that made me wonder if it could be linked to something abnormal is because when the incident was occurring I saw the sky and it was like nothing like I have ever seen before.  The whole entire sky turned as if it were daylight for a split second, while everything else was blackened.  After the incident happened, I kept replaying it over my head and tried to make logical sense out of it, but nothing seemed to add up.  Then I started to look around me to see if anyone else saw what I had just seen, but there was not a soul.  Since I was on my own, it did cross my mind that perhaps it was my imagination but then my sister came out about a minute later and casually asked me if I had seen a flash or if it was just her.  Without me even mentioning anything to her.  When she asked me that, I knew that it wasn&rsquo;t my imagination anymore, it was far more than that and that this actually did happen.  I am just confused on what I did see because it was honestly something very strange and unusual.  I am not trying to conclude that this can be something related to aliens but I am curious to know if you guys can give me any sort of information regarding this.", "Appeared At First Like An Airplane, But Was Defintely Not!This morning, at around 12:15 AM, I stepped outside for a smoke.  Looking up, straight in front of me, facing north, I could see two red lights, side by side similar to the lights on an airplane.  However, the lights while they were red were dim and more of a reddish brown, no other lights flashing or otherwise were spotted.  The lights moved very uniform and very much in sync, flying south.As the lights started to turn towards the east, at about ten seconds after initial sighting, the lights spread out far apart, again very much in uniform, flying very aerodynamic just like an airplane.  The lights continued to turn back towards the north, completing a &lsquo;U&rsquo; shape trajectory, and the lights moved back towards each other in their original position, next to each other.  The lights moved consistently, never stopping and moved fast.

All of a sudden the closest light to the South faded away and disappeared.

The light was bright white at first and then, as it neared the trees, turned to a bright yellow-green color, then disappeared.I could not pinpoint where the light disappeared, but it seemed to be in the area between Brocktown Road and Meadows Road to the east of Hwy.16.  Thinking the object might have been a meteorite, and therefore hot enough to spark a woods fire, I drove out part of Brocktown Road and all of Meadows Road in an attempt find the landing spot.  However, I did not find any sign of the light, nor did I see any smoke or flame.

While looking at one aircraft on approach my eyes were drawn to a spherical reflective object directly above it approximately 1,500 - 2,000 feet.It was highly reflective and pulling very tight circles, very fast.  Far to fast to be a bird. To tight to be a conventional aircraft.  I watched this object do this for about two minutes before it shot to the SW at incredible speed.

When I drew the curtains back, just about my house was a giant circle shaped ufo, a dull metallic tin foil color. The bottom was all I could see, it was covered in piping. It was so big, so close, no more than 20 feet above my home, as it passed- another one fallowed.

I have had dreams &ldquo;vividly&rdquo; off and on since it happened.  Just recently,  I began experiencing these dreams again.  After searching on the Internet for the meaning of these dreams I found this site.  I am a very &ldquo;down to earth&rdquo; type person that usually believes in only Science and Facts.  I have heard many stories from family and others about UFO&rsquo;s.  And never believed until ten years ago.It was the summer of 2000.  I was traveling down Highway 11, a country road between Weippe Idaho and Orofino Idaho.  I was on my way to Orofino Idaho after visiting a friend in Weippe.  This stretch of road is in the middle of nowhere.  It is on top of a mountain surrounded by wheat fields.  The most you might see normally is a deer in your path.  About 2130 as I entered an area of the road known as &ldquo;Fraser&rdquo; (Fraser is a small section of land named after a few old time farmers from the past) I was shocked to see several lights hovering over a mountain top roughly (as the crow fly&rsquo;s) 25 miles away.  This particular part of the mountain has no what so ever houses or lights and barely any roads.  As I slowed to a near stop I noticed two other vehicles pulled over looking at the lights.  One was a beat-up pickup and one was a station wagon type car.  I pulled in behind them and turned off my lights.  I immediately got out my binoculars and started surveying the lights.  What I ! saw was literally &ldquo;out of this WORLD&rdquo;.  There was 6 lights surrounding one singular light in the middle.  The light in the middle was very strange as it was not as bright and pulsated from green to blue to red and back again.  The shape was in a perfect triangle shape just like a upright Pyramid.  The most Awesome thing about this was the size.  It had to be as big as a CITY!  Measuring the only way I knew how, I stretched out my thumb and forefinger and put it up to the sky, It was as I said a good 25 miles away and was at least 3 &frac12; inches between my thumb and finger in width.  That would make it at least a mile or more wide at this distance.  I and the others watched it for at least ten minutes.  The lights where so close to the top of the mountain it was over that it actually lit up the peak.  After about ten minutes the Station wagon car took off down the road back towards Weippe at a high rate off speed almost hitting me.  Just then the &ldquo;object&rdquo; turned slowly just so y! ou could see it&rsquo;s bottom 3 lights.  Those three lights slowly ! powered up &ldquo;got very bright&rdquo; and the whole thing disappeared in a explosion of light.  Just like you would see on Star Trek when they went into &ldquo;Warp&rdquo; drive.  I then, dumb founded went over to the pickup truck to see what they had seen only to realize that there was no one in the truck at all.  I think that they all left in the other car, or the pickup was empty to began with.  I think back and could slap my self for not getting the trucks licence plate number if only to verify that I was not going nuts!  I then drove home very shaken up and tried to go to sleep with no luck.The dream that I keep having involves this craft coming over the horizon and a feeling of &ldquo;impending doom&rdquo; like the world is going to end.  I know this sounds unbelievable but it is true.  I am of sound mind and have never told this to anyone other than my wife.", "Fast moving light curves in skyOutside of a theater, 2 observers witnessed what appeared to be a &quot;shooting star&quot; streak across the Eastern part of the sky, headed in the northeast direction.

I was completely still for about six or seven seconds.  There were a series of thee lights, bright yellowish in color in the center, two lights on each side above the series of three center lights, and a glowing rounded bottom.  I was in my car leaving work when I noticed it out of the corner of my eye.  It was shocking because I knew it was unlike anything I had ever seen before. I kept yelling out loud &quot;what the hell is that&quot;, then as I pulled out of my parking spot into the street the object was slightly hidden by a tree, so I reversed my car as to get a better look and within a blink of an eye it was completely gone.", "Three Silver Boomerang shaped objects spotted in broad daylightI was leaving work and was looking up at the traffic light (in a SE direction) in a highly wooded area waiting for the light to turn green. Something shiny reflecting the sunlight caught my eye above the trees. There were three, boomerang shaped objects hovering right above the tree tops making no sound. They were larger than the size of a motorcycle but smaller than the size of an SUV. They were chrome silver in color, very shiny - unlike anything I have ever seen. I lost them over the tree tops. The traffic light changed and I had to turn onto the parkway to keep traffic moving. There were a lot of other cars on the road, this was during rush hour in broad daylight. There was not a cloud in the sky, it was beautiful weather conditions. I dismissed it thinking I may have been hallucinating since I couldn&apos;t make sense of it and they had disappeared...My Cell phone rang as I was driving and it was my mother.  I told her what I saw and she started asking me questions.  By this time I had pulled up to the light to get onto the very busy HWY 280.  I was in the turn lane to go NW onto HWY 280.  I was facing North and still on the phone with my mother looking up in the sky trying to see if I could find the objects again.  Sure enough they had made a circle from where I had originally spotted them and were flying over HWY 280 going in the same circular direction I had spotted them going in the first time only this time they were at a much higher altitude.  I told my mom I had to go b/c I was going to report this to 911 since this sighting was close to the eighth anniversary of September 11th and I didn&apos;t want to take the chance of it being some kind of terrorist surveillance or something of the sort.The light changed and I started to move away from the objects.  I pulled over into a parking lot and had my digital camera in my purse.  I pulled it out and got out of the car and waited for them to circle again.  They did return in the same flight path that I had seen them twice before but they were flying at an even higher altitude than they were the second time.  I tried to snap a picture but they were too far away from me at this point. I waited for them to circle around again but they disappeared.  I called 911 and the operator said she was getting similar reports and she was sending a sheriff&apos;s deputy to check it out.  I gave the operator my information and got back into my car and waited for them to fly over again.  Every single time i saw them they were flying in a V formation.  They were all the same size and color, hovering with no sound and could take off at speeds so fast that they seemed to disappear.  I watched them fly over the same restaurant but this time instead of continuing the circular flight path I had watched them make before they turned and flew NW over HWY 280 following the Westbound traffic.  They were flying lower than airplanes but higher than the tree line.  This time they disappeared but it wasn&apos;t like they took off it was as if they were invisible, they were there one minute and then the next they were not.  I didn&apos;t see them take off at a higher speed I just watched them disappear into thin air, it was as if they could make themselves invisible.I called my younger brother since he had a sighting near this area a few years before on a fishing trip to see if the shapes of the object were the same.  Mine were different in that they weren&apos;t completed triangles, they were shaped like boomerangs and were smaller in size than the object he saw.  He saw his at night and mine were in broad daylight and made no sound.  I didn&apos;t know who to report them to so I wrote down my experience and I found this website and I&apos;m reporting it for the first time in writing.  I still don&apos;t have an explanation for what I saw that day and I wonder if I ever will.

The &quot;UFO&quot; was triangular in shape with somewhere between 40-60 lights on the underside of it all with the same brightness and standard yellowish color. I stopped on the side of the road, got out of the car and starred at the object for at least a minute, watching it hover around over the tree tops. I tried as hard as possible to absorb as much info as I could about this object because it would be so hard to tell someone what I saw later on. I was able to conclude that if it was on the ground it would have been about 10-15ft across with about 50 lights tightly packed together taking up the entire area of the underside of the object. The lights stayed on as rows consecutively turned off and then back on as th! e next row did. After about 15 seconds some of the lights turned off to create an arrow shape on the underside of the object with the rows turning on and off the same way; the arrow was pointing in the direction it was moving. The object made no sound whatsoever and made erratic movements back and forth on either side of the road going only a few miles per hour as if the wind was pushing it along back and forth. After staring at it for a minute the object started going down the street in the direction I was heading. I immediately got back into the car and started chasing after it. I never lost sight of it while chasing it and it started going faster than I could keep up with it. I looked at the speedometer and I was going in excess of 60 MPH and still accelerating for another quarter mile until the road came to an intersection where the road i was on ended and the object continued straight in the direction it was going over the tree line due east. I could not get a photo be! cause it was dark and the quality of my camera phone was poor.! The wea ther was clear and it was at 7:00 pm so it was dark. About my self, I have never believed in UFO&apos;s and I never had an interest in it before in fact I would laugh about it when people on tv claimed they saw something. I was going from my house to my job as a firefighter so there was no drug/alcohol involved. I am currently a college student.

My wife and 21 year old son witnessed this very strange event while traveling Southbound on 5-S.  I am currently in Tucson,  AZ, as a retired U.S. Navy Chief (reason being that I retired June 1 of last year and due to our economy going down the tubes, I had no choice but to lose everything and begin traveling in search of my post naval career), but back on topic...my wife called me to report seeing 3 rather large (larger than anything Boeing has ever made) triangular shaped craft which was soon joined by a 4th craft.  Then the craft merged into one and began making some very interesting shapes in the sky (as you will see on the photos).  I immediately informed her to pull over as soon as she could and begin snapping pictures.Unfortunately by the time I got that message across (our first 2 attempts at connecting via cell phone were no good as we would lose signal), but by the time I got the message across sunset had already set in however, my wife used a Palm Treo 650 cell phone with its camera settings on maximum resolution to take the pictures (in which I have about 25 total).  The Palm returned some very interesting photos to say the least.  Upon receiving the pics I immediately reported the sighting to MUFON and filed a report:  Case Number:  22723.  At the end of the event they all seemed to merge into 1 or 2, dipped down from their hover and shot skyward at a very high rate of speed (in which one of them pulsed red as he/she ascended)   Later that evening I noticed that 2 or 3 other people in Southern California reported UFO activity.

It was a very large Ball of Fire.At first I thought it was just a firework due to the fact it was bonfire night, maybe a rocket type but it was moving slowly towards us.  I could see that it was not an aeroplane or a Helicopter because of the speed it was moving.It started in the sky about 2 miles away and within seconds it hovered across our garden approximately 500-600 metres up in the sky, as it passed over head I could see it.

I told him to stop the car and to look at the sky.  I asked him if that was a plane and he told me it was a small airplane.

It was large, and the length of the craft was a longer  than the hover altitude so I&apos;d say it was somewhere around 75-100 feet in length.

She noticed in detail that the bottom of the craft was roundish oval shaped like the top but longer. It had red and purple light with a pink coloring mixed in it. She says that it is very difficult to explain and that she had never seen anything like it before. She described the bottom to look something like a brain with texture and the colors mixing together. The whole bottomed had a yellowish pink/peachy/ amber glow. She said the bottom seemed to smooth directly in the rest of the metal above the craft.

She describes the bottom as if you could put your hand through a light pink wettish layer but then it would be stopped by a hard layer where the lights seemed to be coming from.She was shocked and then paused for second in her bed and the ran to the bathroom window in the back of our house to see if she could still see it. She seen it just as it was moving over the trees in our back yard.... she said it was gliding right above the trees and moving at a steady slow pace like it was observing something. The craft then faded in the distance beyond the trees. I asked her if it was spinning and she said no. The most remarkable thing to her was the bottom of the craft...she described it a beautiful...but very strange...jello like but firm. According to her the craft was the size of 4 cars put in a circle.She tends to not believe in these sort of things and is very sincere...therefore I am reporting this because I truely beleive her and it was such a detailed, close sighting.

Heavy objects were being tossed about by the strong winds and it was very dangerous to be traveling as almost all traffic lights were malfunctioning due to the weather. It was about six o&apos;clock in the evening as i started to cook when i heard a great noise out on my balcony. I walked over and saw my heavy metal and glass furniture being lifted and tossed about like newspaper but i looked over toward my right and saw bright flashes of lights almost like fire over toward a heavily wooded area.  My first thought was a fire must have started over there but the way the bright lights were lighting up only that part of the sky seemed weird to me.  It seemed as if something on the ground over in that direction was projecting a light towards the sky in a cone shape not a natural shape as if it was a fire. Yet the lights kinda flickered like a fire with orange, pink, white and yellow colors.  This lasted for about fifteen minutes. I was stuck in place and suddenly i saw a round object shoot directly up from the spot that the lights were coming from into what seemed like clouds or fog.  At that same moment all the lights sort of sucked into the sky where the object disappeared and then total darkness as if no light were ever over there.  Seconds later a bright blue/green light flashed in the area of the sky where the object and the lights disappeared and the blue/green color lingered for a few seconds and sort of drifted off into the clouds or fog.  I was still standing there trying to understand what i saw or was seeing when about ten minutes later a flash of lightning came pretty close to my apartment and kinda woke me up out of my trance of thinking and made me look up and the same blue/green! color w as now right above me in the sky and in a flash disappeared.

So, then I thought &ldquo;ok maybe it is a comet or meteor&rdquo; when suddenly what I saw it split into three white circles in a backwards &ldquo;L&rdquo; shape.  I was not too far from home, so I immediately called my dad and told him to go outside and face south. He saw what my boyfriend and I had seen, and then, it split into five circles. We were amazed and going crazy trying to figure out what it was. As we drove as far South as we could we noticed the five circles of light were vertically straight. Trees got in the way of my view, but when I managed to get another glimpse of it, it was horizontally straight. We saw a plane that appeared to be heading in the same direction and then it took a turn away from it. I am not sure it had to do anything with what we saw, but it seemed interesting. The five circle! s of light clustered a bit closer together and quickly faded out of sight.I did try to take pictures of these mysterious orbs in the sky in the duration of about ten minutes that this was going on, but my camera phone could not capture something at the distance of the lights, which I want to say was possibly twenty to thirty miles away. Relative to the size of full moon that was out at the time, I would say it was about one eighth of the size (and the moon was big and low around 1850 hours), or about three times the size of the North Star, or maybe even the size of a light bulb twenty to thirty feet away. I am sure more people had to see it if they were going south of Krome Avenue.

It looked as if it were a giant 3 orbed blimp, reddish brown in color. I ran into the apt. and snapped some pictures of it from my balcony. I watched it morph into the familiar classic saucer shape as it flew in a perfectly straight line south to where the helicopters were earlier. It hovered in the exact same spot for about 3 minutes and I took some more pictures of it. It slowly be! gan to lift up from its hover and ascended in a straight, vertical line up high in the sky to a point that it stopped and allowed for a passenger plane to pass by.

The angle of decent to earth was approxomately 10-20 degrees, nearly straight down. with two slight changes in coarse.  The object was oval shapped light very clear and clean around the edges.  The light was coming from the oject and not a reflection of the moon or stars.  I ran to the window but it was out of sight being too late to get another look.  I then opened the window to see if I could hear any sound.  There was no sound or the object was too far away for me to hear (I am partly deaf).  Grabbing my 10 power binoculars I ran outside thinking it was a plane crash and would see light or smoke.   I saw none.   Looking into the sky I did see a red blinking light of what I thought was a jet aircraft or passenger liner, flying above where the object went down.  The aircraft was going in a north to south direction, very high and I followed it for a few seconds with my binoculars.  My first thought was that a piece of the aircraft had come off and was falling to earth.  I dismissed this notion as the two objects were seemingly not related.  I tried to find the white object but was not successful.  I then ran back into the house for my silva compass and plotted the direction of decent as South 84 degrees East (declination of 20 degrees).    After a few minutes, the object did not reappear. the esitimated distance to the object is estimated as 1-2miles but distance at night is uncertain.  The sky was clear and the stars were out (34 degrees F), with no wind nor clouds.  The 1/4-1/5th moon (a sliver of light) was in the west, the direction to the object was to the east.  The object is not the moon and is too large to be stars.  I dismiss the object as a meteroite (previously seen meteroites) as the rate of decent was too slow.

It lasted for at least a half an hour between 9:45-10:30 pm EST.  My husband and I were on our way to return a movie rental and from there, to the gas station.  A few minutes earlier, I had tried to go to the gas station that was closest to home, but the lines were backed up and the attendant said the systems were down.  So, I came home and told my husband what was going on and that I&apos;d try later.  He said he wanted to make sure the tank was filled, so he decided to come along and after returning the movie, we would just go to the gas station that&apos;s a few miles down the street.  As we were leaving the parking lot of the video store, (driving west) I noticed a very bright white light, coming from the east just over the trees well north of us.  At first, I thought it was a low-flying plane but it seemed to be moving faster than a plane and it had no colored lights just very bright white.  I told my husba! nd, who was driving at the time, what I was seeing and he tried to get a look, but we were on a fairly busy street and the object was coming in and out of view from behind trees. He didn&apos;t want to cause an accident so, I just kept watching the object, waiting for it to reach an open area.  While I was watching it, the object went from a fast-moving white light to nearly a stop and all the bright white lights turned bright red.  It appeared to be hovering or moving very slowly in the north sky.  As I was telling my husband what had just happened, that I wasn&apos;t crazy, and I knew what I had seen...we turned south.  It was then behind us and out of view.  While driving maybe 3 city blocks south, I noticed the red lights again, this time, in an open area in the distant southwestern sky.  It must&apos;ve moved really fast toward the south (without us noticing) in order for it to be that far ahead of us that soon.   Finally, my husband saw it too.  When we reached the gas station (the ! one that&apos;s a few miles from home) I went inside to pre-pay and! the att endant said the system had just went down.  My husband stayed outside watching the object that appeared to be hovering or moving really slow still to the south of us.  We pulled out from the gas station (driving east) and the object appeared to be moving again slowly toward the northeast.   It looked like it was going to pass directly overhead and we were in an area where we could pull off the road into a vacant lot.  My husband got out of the car, looked up, and watched it slowly pass over us.   He described it as a triangular object with distinct bright red lights at the corners and 1 white light, that made only a slight humming sound.  I couldn&apos;t hear anything from inside the car.  I would think any plane flying that low and that slow would be much louder than a slight hum, but I could be wrong.  I had my cell phone on me but didn&apos;t think to take a picture because, at that time, we were just trying to figure out what it was.  It seemed to be heading northeast toward the s! ame area where I had initially seen it.  We pulled out of the lot and headed north again to the gas station nearest home to see if their systems were up yet.  The object remained on the west side of us moving north toward the east.  We watched it the entire time we were driving, and this time, I tried to take a picture of it with my cell phone.  The street lights and the treetops that were near the object were visible on my screen but, the red lights were not showing for me to get a picture.  It was like my camera couldn&apos;t pick it up.  We pulled up to the gas station (nearest our home) and I went inside to ask if the system was working yet.  The attendant told me it was working fine now... so, I pre-paid.  I went outside to pump the gas and the pump said OUT OF SERVICE.  The attendant came over the intercom and said &quot;I&apos;m sorry, it&apos;ll be a few minutes the system just went down again.&quot;  The object continued on it&apos;s way to the northeast until it was out of view. It was then, t! hat conveniently, the system came back up and I was finally ab! le to fi ll up my tank.  I never saw it return to the bright white lights that I had initially seen, it remained red until it disappeared from view.  I don&apos;t know how to explain the systems going down whenever that thing was in the vicinity, or how I couldn&apos;t pick up the lights on my camera.  I don&apos;t know if anyone else noticed this or reported it.  It happened right over town and there were many people out and about.  Maybe it was just a plane and the systems failing was all just a coincidence...I don&apos;t know.  All I do know, is it was a &quot;weird&quot; and rather frustrating experience for us.  I would also like to know if anyone else experienced this.", "Saw first magnitude pinpoint moving south to north around 7:00 pm EST near Polaris from Miami1/26/10 Miami FL lat. 25-57-53;lon 80-11-15 at approximately 7:01 pm EST I saw a 1.0 magnitude moving pinpoint object traveling from south to north, and it passed by Polaris within &frac12; degree.

Suddenly she stopped singing and because of the sudden quiet she emitted, as a Mom, it sort of startled me. But I was driving on a busy highway and concentrated on the road instead of attending to her. After about 10 seconds she finally expressed a sound (she&apos;d been staring intently out the window). She said: &quot;Oh, wow&quot; or something similar and that she was watching a UFO!   Of course my initial reaction was to totally dismiss it, like she was being childish and I told her there was no such thing, it was just twinkling in the stars.  In Hawaii, of course, the clear night sky is utterly spectacular and pristine. I never glanced in her direction and we talked about space for the remainder of the ride.We pulled into our apartment complex&apos;s parking lot, about 5-10 minutes later and we both got out of the car.  I still needed to get my 2 yr-old out of the car, who was sitting in a car seat in the back, but something made me look up in the sky first.  The sky was completely sparkling clean with no clouds.   Directly above us I saw a large cloud with a bunch of multiple dancing lights inside, as if someone was projecting a light show into a cloud.  My 6 yr-old can describe it more accurately since she watched it longer than I did. I couldn&apos;t believe what I saw.  It didn&apos;t make any logical sense. A lot of my mental energy went into attempting to process the meaning of it all, as I was watching it.  The only possible explanation I could think of, was that a big light show was happening on the beach about 100 feet below me and being projected into a cloud.  The lights were dancing quickly and there were many lights, like a show.  The only other answer was that it was a UFO.My 6 yr-old&apos;s description, is better since I needed to attend to my 2 yr-old abruptly:  She said it was 3 to 4 circles of lights (like a craft) in the transparent cloud (the cloud reminded me of the material a ghost would be made out of, invisible, yet, not invisible).  When my daughter initially saw the thing in the car she said the circles, were dancing around in circles really fast, going first, clockwise and then, counter clockwise, in rhythmic motion.  Later, when we saw it in the parking lot, the lights changed movement and direction: blinking sort of haphazardly but with purpose, not clumsy, and not going in just circles any more and they were &quot;dancing&quot; quickly.  To me, &quot;dancing lights&quot; fits well because the &quot;feeling&quot; I received was that of a kind of rhythmic motion and almost celebratory, as if a light &quot;show&quot; was taking place. My daughter saw the lights as: about, 4 circular crafts, with fast blinking lights.Neither my daughter nor I could &quot;believe&quot; what we saw, we kept rubbing our eyes to see if our vision was messed up, but it wasn&apos;t, it was real!   I&apos;d turned to retrieve my 2-yr-old daughter out of the car and proceeded to discard of some rubbish in a nearby trash can, and the thing had totally dematerialized! My 6 yr-old hadn&apos;t seen it vanish, either, for she had looked away momentarily, too.The weirdest disappearing aspect, was the fact, the wispy cloud the lights had been projecting from, was gone, as well.  Not a trace of a cloud was left in the sky.", "Triangle ufo seen flying of the city of miramichi, 3 lights on on the edges and a search light in the centerWhile coming home from work after 11pm I noticed A triangle formation in the sky flying over the City Of Miramichi.

We were driving down a paved road traveling toward the airport in my town. I think it was a little after 10 PM because it was dark out. As I was driving West I had to make a right. If I had turned left, this would have led me right to the front of the airport. As we took a right we traveled down another road going in a north east direction. On the right of my car was the city, the other left side was woods. As I was driving I look up,over, and to the left. Just above the tree line 30 feet feet from the road was a triangle black object. This had three lights on the bottom. When I seen this I was like &quot;Oh my god dude a UFO!&quot; my friend looked up and cursed from disbelief. I pulled the car over on the shoulder and shut it off, we both got out. The object was stationary in the air and made only a faint &quot;windy&quot; sound. I observed a regular light that was on in the cockpit. There was a guy with a helmet on reading a book or manual of some kind. (It looked to me like he was trying to figure something out about the craft)  It was driven by a human for sure, but the craft was strange. Also there is a fighter pilot station at the airport less than three blocks from where we seen this object. The craft was kind of small to, it moved as slow as a helicopter and flew out of our sight slowly.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a hoaxed report here.

I concentrated on the larger amber light in the eastern sky. It seemed stationary to me, then started moving to the south. As this light was moving south I still saw amber in the front, blue, yellow (as we know it..other variation of amber to me). Colors were flashing on outside of craft.

As I looked to examine it, I noticed it was not an airplane but a darkly-colored (black or dark grey) saucer-shaped object that was moving at what seemed to be a low speed and at what seemed to be a low altitude. It was difficult to tell, as my car was moving past it at 70 mph in the opposite direction, but the craft appeared to be travelling somewhere between 40-70 mph, going north, and only a few hundred feet off the ground.  This would have made the object itself a bit smaller than an airplane, although it is too difficult to estimate a size. What was then even more interesting was a blue light that emitted from the side wall of the craft, moving in a circle around the ! craft, looking a bit like a reflection from a glass wall, but perhaps coming from within the craft. It was then that I really thought I&apos;d seen a U.F.O.I had never seen one before, and I still have my doubts about this one.

After a great day of fishing we headed to the house to unload clean up and cook some fish.At around 9:00pm my father was frying some fish outside and my uncle and I were preparing some food in the house.  My father opens the outside door and calls us out to go outside quick! We run outside and he points to the sky.We were facing North and we saw at first 4 amber (lighter flame orange) orbs moving in towards land coming from the east (ocean side).  They were about airplane altitude but I would say just a bit lower in altitude.They were moving very slowly but at a semi constant speed but almost evenly spaced apart traveling in a straight line playing follow the leader sort of speak.  There was absolutely no sound!  No red or green lights which is mandatory for aircrafts, and the sky was clear of any cloud cover.  We could see all the stars out that night.As the first orb got to about mid sky, it gave off a soft pulse effect and zoomed out of our atmosphere at an incredible speed, almost instantaneously turning into a distant white star, then after a second it was absolutely GONE!  It did not break the horizon like any regular aircraft, this thing broke out of our atmosphere! The following 2 followed suit, doing exactly what the first one did in the exact point in the sky traveling in the same direction.  By the time the forth one was reaching the spot in the sky where the others had gone, 3 more same looking orbs popped out from the same direction from where the other 4 originated from.This time the first one after about 10 seconds of moving slowly following the same path as the others, decided to zoom out to the point of looking like a white star and came back as the orange orb really fast!  After, the 6th orb decided to do a little dancing zig zag side to side a couple of times then got back in line.  They all followed the same direction and broke out through the atmosphere 1 by 1.  Truly was an amazing experience.  Ive tried to think of all the things it could have been and I only have one answer&hellip;&hellip;UFO&rsquo;s.  Our neighbor was present during the event with us.My Uncle got his camera but its not an amazing camera and could not get a good picture of the spectacle. But the event will forever be imprinted in my head.", "BALL OF FIRE IN SKY IN UNITED KINGDOMOn November 5th 2009 I was standing outside in my parents back garden in Dagenham, Essex when something caught my attention in the sky.I had drunk a couple of cans a lager and wasn&rsquo;t sure at first but it seemed to move so slowly, almost hovering across the sky that I knew it was not normal.  It was a very large Ball of Fire.At first I thought it was just a firework due to the fact it was bonfire night, maybe a rocket type but it was moving slowly towards us.  I could see that it was not an aeroplane or a Helicopter because of the speed it was moving.It started in the sky about 2 miles away and within seconds it hovered across our garden approximately 500-600 metres up in the sky, as it passed over head I could see it.  A large clear Orb with a Ball of Fire inside once it got 200 metres away it suddenly shot upwards very quickly and disappeared out of sight within seconds.I knew this was not normal and told family who of course took the Mickey out of me.I have never seen anything like this before and am certainly not the type of person who would normally tell people about this or fill in this form but today is the 10th April 2010 and I and my Wife have just seen exactly the same thing again.My wife did not believe me when I told her in November but she was just with me smoking a cigarette on our balcony in South Ockendon, Essex and she witnessed it with me.  Again it was a large Giant Ball of Fire in the sky approximately a mile away from us and I would say about 500 metres up into the sky.  It was so clear that you could see it was fire and it was hovering slowly from right to left of our view.  It was far too slow to be a plane and had no noise to it.  My wife could not believe what she was seeing and I told her it was what I saw before.  We watched it for maybe 30 seconds and the Orb changed route and shot extremely quick straight up into the sky and out of sight.I am both amazed and confused to what I have seen and still not quite sure how to explain it.", "I was driving back home to Purcerville from my job in Berryville.

It stopped in mid air about 2-3 miles south of me at the top of the ridge and then it slowly descended into the woods.

Just wanted to submit the photo in case anyone else ever see&apos;s or has seen something similar. The photograph clearly shows a few raindrops as it had just started to slightly rain (which I must say didnt last for long, the rest of the day was sunny but there were big rain clouds around) so you can easily compare the raindrop to the disk shape in the picture.

We noticed five beams aproximately two feet wide protuding out aproximately three feet from tho top to the bottom.  The main body color was off white. The beams or legs had some red, grey and light blue with no other colors noticed.  We were not able to see the bottom of this craft as the bottom was hidden from view by the levi.

I watched for about 20 seconds as it slowly tracked from North West in a South Easterly direction.The sky&rsquo;s above us are on a busy flight path so I was used to seeing the flashing lights of aircraft in the sky.  What made this sighting unusual and what captured my attention was the orange colour and the fact that it was not flashing.The night is question was a very clear night with a full moon high in the sky and to the south.I thought I would get some binoculars and watch the object from the rear of my house. The rear of the house is south facing. I waited outside the rear of the house expecting to see the object.  After 10 &ndash; 15 seconds, there was no sight of the orange glowing object so I went to the side of the house to see where it might have been.To my amazement I saw in total three objects of the same colour, two which were slightly less intense in luminescence.At this point I ran back into the house to get my binoculars and called my partner and two children.  We ran back through the house to the front door.From the front of the house, which is north facing, two of the objects changed to a different path, rising in the sky and losing their luminescence.  The third object continued on a south easterly track.I followed the remaining object through binoculars for 5-10 seconds and then went through to the back of the house where again I was able to track the object on a south easterly direction.The luminescence of the object faded as it continued south easterly direction.  I did not see this as unusual as it was heading in the direction of the location of the moon, not directly at the moon!.   However, I was able to continue to track the object as it moved into a south easterly direction while losing it&rsquo;s luminescence.I could not distinctly make out the shape of the object.What was additionally so unusual was there was no sound from the object(s).  Normally as aircraft pass over head their engine noise can be heard very distinctly.  However on this occasion there was no sound what so ever.", "Two orange orb-lights under disc-shaped objectApproximately 8:15 pm, my friend and I were on Walton Rd. heading West when we saw two orange lights to the South.

We simultaneously observed what we thought was a shooting star streak across the sky.  As we &quot;ahhed&quot; in pleasure at the sight, the &quot;shooting  star&quot; stopped above our heads and reversed direction.  We immediately became silent and confused when another &quot;shooting star&quot; streaked back toward us crossing the path of the first object at a sharp angle. At this point, we both confirmed that we were actually seeing the same thing.  The objects both turned and then slowly headed back toward each other and appeared to come together and turned away at extremely tight angles.  As we watched, another object streaked across the paths of the first two.  During the time we watched, these lightly glowing objects continued to streak across the travel paths of each other.  They moved slowly when they were grouped near each other and we could see that they were more or less chevron shaped with the entire shape being defined by a clear, visible glow.  The glow was about the same intensity of the surrounding stars with a greenish tint to the light they appeared to emit.   All of their movement was in straight lines or at sharp angles, creating invisible triangular travel paths as they flew past and crossed over each other.  Occasionally, they would come together for a fraction of a second only to break away quickly in different angular patterns.One of the hotel employees was cleaning the pool.  He did not speak English and my Spanish was quite rusty.  However, when I asked about what we were observing, I understood him to explain that these were birds and they glowed because of the plankton in the waters that that also glowed.The explanation seemed acceptable to a point.  That could certainly explain the greenish glow and the chevron shape.  However, I live in an area where there are a lot of hawks and falcons that fly on the thermals created in the hills of my community.  I have not seen any of these birds flying in the angular patterns that I observed.  Their turns tend to be more gentle and curved.  I have seen none of these birds come together but would allow that at night, seeing the objects seemingly meet may have been an illusion as one object could have been above or below the other.  This does not explain how the objects would consistently appear to break away from each other and travel in different directions but I feel that even some of those observations could also be attributed to illusion and vision impairment created by the night skies.  Perhaps the most extraordinary behavior that gives me pause to question the bird explanation more than any other is the fact that all of their movement appeared to be in straight lines with all turns seemingly to be accomplished only with sharp angular movement.  I have since attempted to research sea bird sightings under similar circumstances and watch the movement of other groups of birds but have found no descriptions that seem to fit my experience.   At this time, I cannot say for sure that what I saw but they were not shooting stars.  However, I have seen that other visitors to Cancun have described similar sightings at later dates.", "Red light bouncing in the  sky.I woke up about 3 am to a noise, and then could not go back to sleep so I went out to the back deck to smoke and as I went out I picked up my camera to look at my days pictures.It was kinda over cast so no stars were visible.  I heard that noise again, and looked up and I saw it.  So having my camera I put it on video and got it.

On a cruise ship departed from Miami Fl, off the coast of Puerto Rico. My wife and I had returned to our balcony stateroom.  I stepped out onto the balcony just to have a look at the ocean and see if there were any other ships around. I did not see any other ships. What I did see were three red lights in the shape of a triangle,one light above 2 below, possibly 1-2 miles away, in the sky, probably 15 to 20 degrees above the horizon. The sky was clear with scattered clouds. At first I thought these three red lights were some sort of helicopter formation.I am an Air Force veteran, I quickly dismissed the helicopter formation as these light were, infact, perfectly stationary. They made no movement and there was no sound coming from them. I assumed that I was too far from the object to hear any sound anyway.I looked at the lights for maybe 5 to 10 seconds, watching for any movement and could not detect any. Next, I turned a! way from the object and looked around the sky , deliberately trying not to view the object. I once again found the object, still in the same location, unmoving.

My immediate impression was of a helicopter or some sort of military aircraft, which I dismissed. Then I thought it might be some sort of marine navigation device such as a channel marker, which I also dismissed.I then began to get the feeling that these lights were &quot;watching&quot; us as I was watching them.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

Last Saturday night I went out with my girlfriend, who lives in Laconia, when we had the following experience:  I was with her around 11.  We wanted to take her Mom&rsquo;s car because it was nicer and we wanted to go look at the stars.  We went to Fun Spot at the back parking lot in Laconia.  There were 8 cars already there when we arrived.  Little by little, the cars started leaving one by one.  We were the last car in the parking lot.  Then the lights of the parking lot and the lights of the houses around us and the lights of the houses down the street started to go out one by one.  Then my girlfriend noticed something blocking the moon and asked, &quot;What was that?&quot;  I knew it wasn&rsquo;t a cloud because it moved back against the wind and blocked the moon again.  I don&rsquo;t know how to explain this but it turns into a ball when it wants to slow down and move around quickly and when it wants to go fast, straight, it turns into a flat plate with maze box-shaped lined lights.  These were on all the time. The colors were dim yellowish white and did not change. I cannot tell whether these were part of the bottom or not.  It flipped a lot.  I did not know which side was right or up on it.  It was doing this over the trees  across the street from the parking lot.  It suddenly crossed the street towards our car. Its size was as big as 14 houses.  It was really quiet. That&rsquo;s when we had to leave.  But I did not have time to turn on the headlights.We put the clutch in to start the car and jammed it into 1st and floored it.  The front end got picked up and the car could not move.  We steered left and right but the car just kept on going up into the air. My girlfriend was scared and she had boogers coming out of her nose while I was cursing.  The car was going up and the back wheels were off of the ground. Then I looked out of my window and saw that the parking lot park lines started getting smaller. Both our windows were down this whole time.  The front windshield started to crack and shake and the cracks spread from the passenger side to the driver&rsquo;s side. It popped outwards like it was pulled out.Something yanked my wrist. Not aggressively.  And the whole time in my head something was telling me &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t panic,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be scared.&rdquo;  And it wasn&rsquo;t in English in my head but I got the meaning.   It wasn&rsquo;t a language &ndash; I don&rsquo;t know how to explain it.   And on my girlfriend&rsquo;s side, it had her half-way out of the window.   Her butt  was off of her seat, maybe one-and-a-half or  two feet?  and the car was pointed almost completely straight up at the stars &ndash; yet I saw no stars.Every time I tried looking at it, in front, a white film went over my eyes.  It was kind of like staring at the sun with your eyelids closed.  I could not hear her screaming but I know that she was screaming. My ears felt like they kept on popping from the altitude.  I couldn&rsquo;t hear.  The smell was like unbearable, like you want to close your nose.  It was spicy, like pepper-sprayish, and clean at the same time &ndash; it was a smell that you could stand but you would close your nostrils because it still smells bad.  When I tried to fight and get my wrist back in the car, that&rsquo;s when the grip got stronger.  It was pulling my left arm up out of the window &ndash; there was no pain but it was strong &ndash; &hellip;.  I was trying to fight off the grip on my wrist.  My tongue was numb.  The horn beeped  by accident and the grip got a little loose.  It beeped again in the struggle and my arm flopped down in the car.  My girlfriend also fell back in her seat and we realized we were still up in the air. ! It  took 2 seconds for the car to drop. When we dropped, the air bags came out.  We floored it  as fast as we could through the town.  It was almost a straightaway to go to my girlfriend&rsquo;s house with very few turns to take.  During this time, both of us couldn&rsquo;t stop crying.  We arrived at her house and her Mom asked, &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; All this took place from 11pm to 12:30 am.  It seemed like we were in the air for 10 minutes and it felt like it was forever.    Her Mom called the police, and a policeman came.The policeman did not believe us when we first told him what had happened until he looked at the vehicle.  There were no scratches or dents or anything.  He said that there was no reason for this to have happened to the car when there are no dents or scratches and no reason for the windshield to shatter and pop out the way it did. He had no explanation for why the windshield popped outwards. Also, when I went to open my cell phone in front of the policemen, I got shocked by it.On Monday, I went to my doctor to get a whole physical to make sure I was OK.  My wrist had a puncture wound while my forearm has a cut that is semi-circular and there&rsquo;s blood on it.  I do remember that when I first looked at my arm after I got it back in the car, it was red with blood.  But by the time we got to my girlfriend&rsquo;s house, there was no blood anywhere.  On the center consul of the car, there is an imprint of her hand.  I don&rsquo;t quite understand what the policeman said but it was something about the skin of her hand leaving an impression.Now, I don&rsquo;t like to feel bumps in the car, or feel anything that trembles like a boombox.  I don&rsquo;t want to be out in dark areas at night. I also don&rsquo;t like to walk out to my Mom&rsquo;s car, anymore, outside. &ldquo;", "UFO Sighting in  Laconia&ldquo;My name is E  and I&rsquo;m eighteen years old.  I live in Laconia.  Last Saturday night, my boyfriend D came up to see me and we went out.  When we got to Fun Spot, in Laconia, we parked in the back in the separate parking lot.  We turned off the car and it was totally silent.  We were just sitting there and I looked up at the moon.  I saw this weird black-shaped object.  And then, I said to my boyfriend,  &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; He looked up at it and he said, &rdquo;If it gets any closer, we need to leave.&rdquo;  I kept staring at the moon to see if it was just a plane or something.  It moved back across the moon.  It was huge and it looked like it was zig-zagging or changing shape.   I couldn&rsquo;t tell. He said, &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s coming closer.&rdquo; It flew so fast over the trees getting closer to where we were. It felt like it was zeroing in on us.  It blocked the moon. And then, we started panicking and driving away.  I thought were were going to hit the Bingo building.  We turned left but it felt like we went off of a jump &ndash; you know that feeling? like we were on a rollercoaster?   And we were in the air.  I was trying to pay attention to everything that was going on but it felt like I couldn&rsquo;t.  When I looked up, everything was black.  The smell was not nice but it was like something you could stand.  It was an odor I&rsquo;ve never smelled before.  I heard absolutely nothing &ndash; it was silent.  I felt immobilized like I had no control over what I was doing or over my body.  I could see nothing.  It was like opening your eyes in a pitch black room.I felt really nervous and scared.  I don&rsquo;t remember crying or screaming.  I held on to the center console because I felt like I was lifted.  I was holding on so tight that my thumbprint is imprinted on the center console.  And then, when I finally realized what was happening, I was so close to the windshield that my body was going forward with my arms behind me.  Everything was black.  I heard a loud noise like a horn.  Once.   And then, the car just dropped.  I hit my eye on the dashboard and the airbags came out.  I couldn&rsquo;t believe what had just happened.   I held my face and I looked over at my boyfriend.  I saw that his left arm had blood. I said, &ldquo;Are you OK?&rdquo; I looked at the windshield and it was cracked, totally, but only on the passenger side.  I could see D but I couldn&rsquo;t see anything outside.  The only thing that made the car drop was the sound of the loud horn.  When the car dropped,  there was a loud boom.  After that, we just drove so fast out of there. The smell went away after we drove away.   And I started crying.  And  I said, &ldquo;What the h&mdash;l  just happened?&rdquo;  My boyfriend  said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;  I didn&rsquo;t feel like they were following us.When we got home, my Mom said that she could hear me from the outside while I was freaking out.  I couldn&rsquo;t stop crying.  My Mom said, &ldquo;Calm down and tell me what happened.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re never going to believe me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Is it my car?&rdquo;  she asked.And I said, &ldquo;Let me explain,&rdquo; because I felt that if I didn&rsquo;t explain it fast enough, it was just going to go away from my mind.  At about 12:15 am, a cop arrived.  I told him what had happened while I was sitting down at the dinner table.   My boyfriend was sitting next to me &ndash; it was then that I noticed that there was no more blood on his arm or his clothing.  The cop didn&rsquo;t believe me at first until he finished looking at the car.  He told my Mom that there was no reason for the air bags to come out because nothing else on the car was damaged.  He didn&rsquo;t check underneath the car but we found out later that the underside was totaled.  The cop said that he was going to the place where we had been.I just felt thankful that we&rsquo;d gotten out of there.  But I couldn&rsquo;t stop crying for more than 2 hours afterwards.  My Mom said, &ldquo;You should go take a shower and get the airbag dust off of you.&rdquo;  But I didn&rsquo;t want to be alone at all.  I felt lucky.   And there were no scratches or anything anywhere on my body.The first night, my dream was that I was a little girl, maybe 6 or 7 years old, in an Elementary School classroom.  I was looking at myself as a little girl.  And then it was like the teacher called me up and I couldn&rsquo;t talk or say anything - but everybody else seemed to say something for me.  Like everything I wanted to say, everybody else was saying it except for me.  They were saying exactly what I wanted say.  I have never had a dream like this before &ndash; where I am a little girl and see anything about the past.  I did not feel right at all.I am better now. I still worry about seeing this thing again and I pay attention to the sky at night.  I really don&rsquo;t go out at night, anymore, because I&rsquo;m scared. &ldquo;", "Two Whitish triangular flying objectsThere were two triangular objects flying from East to West.

I looked at the bike, shut the barn, and the night was so beautiful I just looked up at the stars.  The sky was so clear and the stars were so crisp, I wandered to the middle of the yard trying to pick out constellations.  Heck, the stars were so bright, they ALL looked like constellations, so I just decided to head in to bed, and as I lowered my eyes, I saw it!  Off in the distance, over my neighbor&apos;s roof, there it was.  It was a dark sphere, roughly 10+ times the size of the biggest star, with strobe-like blue, white and red lights flashing around it in all kinds of ways.  Like one of those kid&apos;s balls you hit and the lights go wild inside of it, only on the outside of what I saw.  The lights were mostly around the edge, with two constant white lights that came into view from time ! to time, as it would rotate off and on.  It hovered, totally quiet, rising a little, or dropping some from time to time.  I didn&apos;t want to leave it for a camera or to get someone up for fear of missing it doing something or being gone.  I watched from my neighbor&apos;s side yard and for awhile and from the big empty lot across the street where the school used to  be.  I watched, and watched and watched, and it hovered and slid around totally quiet.  I watched and heard a few planes go by, and heard three trains pass through while I watched.  This thing made no sound.  I kept trying to see under or around it for something supporting it, or waiting for it to make some kind of move I&apos;d recognize as a plane, etc.  Nothing.  After some time, it became harder to distinguish the color of the lights, and I realized it was getting smaller, and then I realized it was moving away from me.  It just kept getting smaller and smaller, bobbing around until it became just a pinprick like the st! ars, then it just disappeared down behind the trees.  When I c! ame back in, I found I had been watching it for an hour!  It was 1:10 on the microwave when I closed the door.  It was the most incredible thing I&apos;ve ever seen!

I have seen shooting stars before but they always look so far away.  What stood out to me was this shooting star scared me because it appeared so close, it seemed to be a few blocks ahead of me.  It kind of looked like fire work show or comet but is didn&rsquo;t have a long tail.  However I could see clearly that it was shooting in a downward direction in a way that I have never seen a firework do.  It also seemed to be too large to be any type of firework.  Basically it looked like a cylinder shape fire ball that shot down the sky and disappeared before it hit the ground.  It was the strangest thing I have ever seen and at this moment I think I either saw a comet, shooting star or a UFO,((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was six to seven squared lights lined up next to each other to form a long rectangle the lights flashed on and off in a sequence.  Centered above the lights was one squared light that did not turn off.  The light was intense with a true bright white color.  It seemed to hover close then went further until it went out of sight.

We were the only vehicle on the road.  I woke my son up to see the object just then the radio started to whine (I listen to AM radio stations) the lights of the vehicle went dim.  I rolled down the window even though it was raining and try to hear any sounds the object was silent.

I work as a waiter and a carpenter and go to school as well. I understand the skepticism regarding UFOs. I accept the existence of aliens as extremely likely, but I recognize that there are people who misidentify things they see or falsify reports for attention or other personal gains. This is where my skepticism lies; not in the subject of UFOs, but those who report them. This may seem ironic as I myself am reporting a sighting, but my hope is that this report will not be disregarded. I have neither a desire nor motive to claim to see something I did not. That being said, I do wear contact lenses and had them in during the sighting. I was not under the influence of alcohol, tobacco, or any other drug with the exception of caffeine as I had a cup of coffee about ten minutes before the sighting occurred. What I witnessed occurred for approximately five minutes at 8:10 pm in the eastern sky. There was not a cloud in the sky and the stars were visible in all directions. At about 8:00 pm I finished my cup of coffee and then took my dog for a walk. A couple of minutes into my walk, I saw a shooting star in the southern sky as I was about to turn left (to the east) onto another street. This got my attention, and I began to observe the night sky in hopes of possibly seeing another.  Now heading east, I continued walking, periodically scanning the sky. It was after another few minutes that I first noticed an amber ball of light, which struck me as being at a very high altitude, moving from south to north across the sky. It was about 45 degrees above the horizon at first, but then it turned to the east while slowly climbing degree by degree above the horizon, getting smaller and smaller. It appeared to me that this light had turned away from me and was gaining more and more altitude. It began to twinkle, much like a star, as it got smaller and smaller until I could no longer see it. I continued walking east down the street and checking the area of the sky for another minute until I reached the point at which I normally turn around. Seeing nothing where the light was, I turned around and began walking to the west. About a minute later I stopped and turned around and looked to the area of the sky where I had seen the amber speck of light. I observed a second moving in the same south to north fashion as the first at about the altitude. I watched it briefly until a car was coming and I turned back around. A few seconds later looked back again and could not locate the light which I attribute to a nearby street light. I continued walking west. I checked the sky over my shoulder three more times as I walked, and on the third scan I saw a third light. It too was the same amber color as the first two, but it was moving away from me to the east, and climbing degree by degree above the horizon as it did so. I feel this was a spate light from the second as this one was more to the right (south) in the sky than the first two were. Again my impression was that this light was both gaining altitude and moving away from me, getting smaller and smaller.  There was no street light nearby, so I was able to observe this light for the longest before I could no longer see it. As it got very small, it emitted a single pulse of white light which was much larger and more intense than the amber ball itself. The ball then rapidly became extremely tiny in the sky, twinkling until I could see it off and on for a short while then not at all. Only after the balls were gone did I notice other aircraft flying in the sky, mainly because this is when I looked for them. I saw several, all much closer to the horizon than the amber balls were, and they were all equipped with strobe and running lights. Three in particular caught my attention. They were headed to the east and appeared to by flying in a widely spaced diagonal line formation. Whether or not they were military I do not know, but that was my initial impression. These balls of amber lights and the pulse of white light emitted by one are beyond my identification. I do not believe they were ball lightning as the sky was perfectly clear. My theory is that the lights I observed were those given off by the method of propulsion used by alien craft. This is only my best guess however, and while I do realize there may be other explanations, I could not think of one that fits to what I saw.", "3 to 4 ft long,gun metal color,very load shook home and us,could sit still above us, was seen two yearsVery load shook home and us.

I went outside my front door to my yard, which is 30 meters from the street and extremely dark. No lights were on in the front portion of the house so there was a very clear view of the sky. The witness exited a few seconds behind me and we both heard the noise again and noticed at approximately 75 degrees E from our location / 20 degrees above the horizon, a dull-white craft circling around the North End of Boise. It was just below the cloud deck which was estimated to be approximately 1800 feet above the ground. It emitted noise a third time and circled around in a somewhat erratic manner. I reached for an extr! emely bright flashlight (StreamLight STRION LED), which is basically about as bright as the high beams of a car... I shined it towards the craft. There was no reflection. However, it did produce the following reactions and data.1) Craft stopped suddenly and started heading towards us 2) Craft changed shape and luminosity became greater 3) There was a noticeable crackle sound in the atmosphere (similar to lightning in the distance; note that there was no precipitation nor any Stratocumulus clouds or similar type clouds to produce lightning--nor were the weather conditions such to generate lightning) 4) Craft appeared to be approximately 1000 feet away (based on known distance that flashlight can illuminate and known distance of background objects) 5) Craft was estimated to be about 8-10 meters in diameter  Craft circled for the first 15-18 seconds, then stopped, changed shape and headed towards us, became much brighter, then headed North at an estimated 300-400 mph before disappearing above the clouds.Although there is Boise Airport and Gowen Field, there were no aircraft flying. I have an application (FlightTracker Pro) that tracks flights (including some military aircraft without N-numbers). There was 100% cloud coverage so it was not a planet, star, or satellite. Also note that I track the ISS with &apos;ISSLite&apos;, and satellites with TLE Files on &apos;Satellite Tracker&apos;  I do not know what this object was, but it was the latest in a flurry of objects that I&apos;ve witnessed above Boise in the past year. It&apos;s become one of my hobbies! And it yielded a video that I submitted to Mr. Davenport on Jan 16th. Please come forward if you have any sightings in Boise as I personally can attest to at least 30 that in my opinion, were not aircraft, atmospheric effects, other manmade craft/materials, or near or far space base objects (stars/planets/etc). I have also seen a dramatic increase of meteorites and fireballs over this same period even during periods that aren&apos;t charted as annual meteor showers.", "cigar-shaped, no sound, sub-sonic vibrationI make this report from a story my mother told me.  The date, year, and time are approximate.  When she was a young girl, her family lived near Baron Fork Creek east of Proctor, Oklahoma.  Around sunset, her father told her to go and fetch the milk cow.  She headed toward a wind-break of trees.  Up from behind the row of trees rose a shiny silver, cigar-shaped ship.  There was no sound.  However, she could feel a vibration in her throat and lungs (may indicate a low, sub-sonic vibration).  In the blink of an eye, the ship zipped sideways and disappeared out of sight.  She fetched the cow home and never said a word about the incident to her family.  I asked her why.  She said her parents wouldn&apos;t have believed her and she didn&apos;t want to be laughed at by her brothers.((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))", "A UFO across Merthyr Tydfil that appeared to be fire hovering through the skyA ball hovered erratically from Gelligaer Common, appearing as a redish orange colour that looked as if it was a floating ball of fire. Thin short lines of red light came from aroundthe outside of the object. It made no sound and passed across Merthyr Tydfil to Cefn Coed and then west towards Aberdare. It was to low and silent to be a plane or helicopter. There was no wind to carry anything across the sky and can&apos;t come up with any logical explanation for the UFO.", "UFO  Sighting 01/07/12010  My wife and I were sitting in our hot tub when we saw it.

The light was flickering, I assumed that it was a helicopter but then I remembered that it was storming pretty badly ten minutes prior to this.  After about 5 minutes, it disappeared.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I would like to point out these are not the lights I&apos;m referring to as these have been dismissed as a hoax.That being said, the red lights caused me to notice the sky more than I had been and my husband and I noticed at least a couple dozen stars that flicker, rather than twinkle as a star does. These lights can be either a silvery color, or golden, but they all alternately flash red also. The first couple nights, we just gazed in amazement and didn&apos;t notice too many details. But I do know they seemed to move very slowly if you watched them long enough. I don&apos;t mean that my perspective on them changed as Earth rotated; I mean that they steered every so slowly to a different position and then stopped. They also seemed to be clustered in one small area around Orion&apos;s belt mostly, until Orion&apos;s belt moved out of sight. BUT even after Orion moved out of sight these strange fake stars would still be in the same area. They never left the area even after Orion (there are rarely any other stars visible in San Diego at night lately) was way out of sight due to the Earth&apos;s rotation.Nights of 1/3-1/5, I stayed out as often and late as I could given that I have three kids to take care of. I peeked out a couple times per hour, staying up late and watching them til 3 or 4 in the morning. They seemed to light in 1 position and stay there constantly for the most part on these nights, with the occasional one disappearing suddenly or shifting slightly. Colors remain same. I have noticed that there is one set that I call the Non-Rectangle, because if it weren&apos;t for one &quot;star&quot; being up and out a little bit too much, they would form a perfect rectangle. However, they are in a different configuration every night, i.e. the &quot;slightly off star&quot; would be on the bottom and left one night, and on top and right the next. Makes me think it&apos;s a craft that lands in a different spot every night and thinks we won&apos;t notice.1/6 and 1/7, 2010 I have not been able to go outside to watch their behavior, I have just had too many things to do.I got video, in fact about 10 of them with my webcam since I don&apos;t have a regular camera, but strangely, I can&apos;t get them to upload to any of the sites I tried to upload them to. I managed to get 1 pic on my cell phone to show up and I will try to attach it.The oddest thing of all to me, is that no one else is talking about them, everyone is concentrated on the sham red lights of New Year&apos;s Eve that one guy hoaxed. However, my kids and mom see them, and so does my apartment complex manager, so they are truly there.One other strange detail is that on 1/3-1/5, there have been a highly unusual number of small, low-flying normal planes as well as helicopters, making me wonder if they&apos;re &quot;investigating.&quot;  I have not been able to stay awake and outside to witness them make their &quot;disappearance&quot; at dawn so I don&apos;t know what that consists of.They are currently still there, although small in number at this precise moment. I can&apos;t figure out for the life of me why people aren&apos;t interested in them.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

As we were traveling north on route 95, we were driving about 60 mph and I observed a stationary light on the west side of the highway, about the height of one of the large powerline towers.   I thought to myself a powerline must cross the road there, and it was lighted for aircraft.  We were talking and driving, and as I approached where the light was (I could not see it without leaning foward and looking up) I noticed there was not a electical powerline tower there.  It was odd, and I leaned foward and looked up (as did my wife). We both observed a cylinder shaped object, about as long as a city bus suspended in air.  There was a window across the cylinder, and the window appeared to be at a 45 degree angle downward facing towards us.  There appeared to be a panel of somekind the entire length of the window.  There were figures seated at the panel across the length of the object, and what app! eared to be several figures standing behind them.  My wife and I both got the feeling the figures inside the objects were looking at us.  The interior of the object was illumintated, and we could see clearly inside.  As we passed, we were both surprised because the object appeared to be suspended in air.  I asked her if she wanted to turn around and go back, and she said yes.  I found a place to complete a U turn, and as we approached the object from the north a hundred yards away, it &quot;streaked off&quot; in a southeastern diretion towards Las Vegas, on an horizontal plane.  It rose abrubtly over a mountain, and then downward over the top...and disappeared.  From the time it started south, to when it disappeared was within a couple of seconds.  There was no noise as we passed by it, or as it left the area.", "Unusual Lights SeenI was walking my dog and paused to talk to a friend when behind her were a set of 7-9 circular orange lights all in a straight line that appeared to be flying low.  They were there for about 10 seconds before reducing to 4 lights, then 2 and then one singular light which stayed for about 7 seconds before completely disappearing.

The blueish light was horseshoe shaped, with sharpish points.  The orange light was more circular, but not perfect.  The lights faded and came back in intensity as the clouds passed under.  The two lights were directly overhead.  The moon was visible to the northwest and a star was visible slightly northwest.  Eventually, the clouds overpowered the lights, and they disappeared.  Also worth noting, this was near downtown Tulsa so the building lights overpowered a lot of weaker star light.  These lights were far enough above any manmade structure, as well as above the clouds, to be sure that there was nothing that any of us could think of what could be causing it.", "Slow moving triangular object with bright light and no sound at relatively low altitude spotted at dusk.Myself, wife and 9 yr old daughter observed strange object in sky while driving home from parents house.  Was dusk and object appeared triangular in shape with bright white light in center.  Smaller flashing lights blue in color were also visible.  Pulled into our driveway and continued to watch.  Seemed to be stationary at first then moved slowly eastward, paused and began tracking west.  No sounds were audible and could see what appeared to be a beam of light projecting out sideways from the object visible as it passed through some cloud cover. Moments later bright light in center turned off and object continued in westward direction at a higher rate of speed until we lost sight of it.  Was definitely not a helicopter with search light.((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS REGARDING FLAWED DATE IN ORIGINAL REPORT))Yes sir it was last night - very fascinating and my curiosity led me to find your site.  Thanks.  ((name deleted))", "Very Bright in due West, Hovered about 2 min&apos;s, then accelerated very fast stright up.Driving due west toward the mountains, approaching north HWY 287 in Fort Collins, I saw a very bright light between 18 to 20 degrees west above the mountains.  At first I dismissed this as a planet, as it looked as if it was stationary.  The time was about 6:48am and in Fort Collins, this is during Civil Twilight where the sun is 6 degrees or less below the horizon. (Sun rise is at 7:08am).  I was about to dismiss this object and turn north to go home, when I had to stop at a red light.  I lined up three points using my Bronco, a tree for line of sight, just to make sure that the object was not moving.  I watched it hover for about 10 or 15 seconds, when I noticed that it was indeed moving very slowly.  At first, I thought that this was my imagination, but the object started to accelerate, and I knew it was not a planet.  When the light turned green, I did not turn north, but went through the intersection and pulled over as fast as I could.  I got out of my Bronco, and watched for about 30 seconds.  The object moved about 1/3 the distance it was from the ground in about 4 seconds.  It accelerated very quickly, and then disappeared.  Still assuming that this might be a Jet that was reflecting the sun light, and possibly approaching my line of sight until it turned, which would look as if it were hovering, and then accelerating, I went home and crunched the numbers.  This is what I got:  The altitudes of most commercial jets are about 30,000 feet.  If the object was 18 to 20 degrees from my line of sight, that would make it 16.61 to 18.32 miles away from me.  I went to Fort Collins airport, and found the visibility for 7:00am, and it was 10 miles.  This indicated that the object was close to double the distance for visibility.  With the sun hitting an object, one might still be able to see it, so I calculated the speed. It the object moved 1/3 its altitude in 4 seconds, then it would be traveling close to 2400 feet per second, (rounding off).  This equates to 1630 mph, which commercial jet cannot do.  My conclusions suggest that unless this was a military craft that was reflecting the sun and traveling directly into my line of sight, (which made it look like it was hovering for over two minutes), and then shot straight up at a climbing rate of 1630 mph, then it is something unique.  Lastly, if the object was indeed moving at a velocity of 1630 mph, and was coming directly at me for over two minutes, then it would have covered a distance of 54 miles, which would have brought the craft over my head in less than 60 seconds, which it did not do.  I would be interested if anyone else saw this object from another direction so I can get better numbers.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

About 20 minutes after the pilot announced we had reached our cruising altitude of 35,000 feet, I noticed what appeared to be five large rods protruding upward from the clouds off the right wing about 1/4 mile to a 1/2 mile out.  The rods looked like manmade structures, each about 10-20 feet high.  Each rod had the appearance of a cell-phone tower -- metallic weaving.  There were five rods in total, each spaced approximately 80-150 feet apart, forming what looked like a pentagon. No connecting tower or craft was visible.I pointed this out to a younger friend, who at first didn&apos;t notice them.  After a minute or so, he finally located they him.  He said they appeared to be &quot;drifting.&quot;  Again, we were at 35,000 feet, so there&apos;s no way they could have been part of a grounded structure.  They remained visible for about 6-8 minutes before our flight moved away.  They never appeared to move and visibility was very good at our altitude.We checked into weather instrumentation and nothing matches.

I looked up in the northern sky and saw an extremely bright but small light traveling east in a straight line and it just looked very wrong and out of place.  It was hard to put my finger on what was wrong about it.  The light was too bright, it didn&apos;t strobe or blink, but it was changing.  I didn&apos;t think of this at the time, it only occurred to me the next day, but I think one reason that it looked so out of place is that I see plane after plane, all night long, make their landing descents towards Toledo Express Airport, but all of those landing descents take place in the southern sky - well south of my position at work.  But this light was in the northern sky.Anyway, I didn&apos;t think much of it, other than a kind of &quot;that was weird&quot; notion, and I went back inside to pull another coil off the beam.  This time when I came back to the storage yard outside, there was the brightest light I&apos;ve ever seen in my life sitting in the northern sky.  I literally said out loud &quot;Oh my God!&quot;  The brightness of it looked like someone was welding or torch-cutting the sky.  That&apos;s the best I can describe it.  If you&apos;ve ever looked at somebody welding without a visor on - it was that level of brightness.  It was stationary - it was not moving, and it was huge.  I&apos;m not good at estimating it&apos;s size but I would figure it was maybe about the size of 4 or 5 two-story houses put together.  It did not have a shape.  It was constantly changing.  &quot;Boiling&quot; is almost a good description of its manner and consistency.  It was like a bubbling glob of light in the sky.  It&apos;s colors alternated between white, red, and green.  Now I know that white, red, and gree! n are the colors of every single airplane at night but I assure you this was no airplane nor did it even remotely resemble an airplane.  It didn&apos;t have lights that were blinking or changing color, it was light and it was changing color, and it was doing so about thirty times a second.  I would compare it to when someone blows into a pinwheel.  That&apos;s how rapid the color-change was occurring.  I&apos;m also not good at estimating it&apos;s altitude but I would roughly guess somewhere around 5000 feet or so.  It was a clear night, but had there been clouds, it would have been below them.I called my coworker on the radio and asked if he was in the office.  He said that he was so I told him to step outside and look above Winchesters (the truck stop on the corner of State Route 109 and County Road H.) &quot;WHAT THE F**K IS THAT!?!&quot; he said.&quot;Ok, I&apos;m just making sure someone else is seeing this,&quot; I said.It was absolutely amazing.  My heart was racing, my hands were shaking, and it wasn&apos;t out of any kind of fear.  It was out of excitement and out of the fact that this didn&apos;t belong or have any logical place in the sky that I&apos;ve been looking at all of my life.  This made no sense.  We watched transfixed as the light behaved the way I described above for a minute or two.Then, while we were sitting there watching it, two much smaller orbs came off of it (out of it, through it, I don&apos;t know) and began to fly independently.  The main light was stationary but these orbs came off of it and flew east.  My coworker and I started shouting and swearing like lunatics, making sure the other had just seen that happen.  After the two orbs flew off, they began to increase in size and brightness and the main light began to decrease.  Soon all three lights were the same size.  At this point, I grabbed my cell phone and called my fiance because I wanted her to go outside and see if she could see this from Swanton.  She didn&apos;t answer but she still has the voicemail I left describing the event as it was happening.  I did not think to try and take a picture but I doubt much would have shone through a cellphone camera anyway.  In hindsight, I should have tried to call everyone I know.Soon the three lights formed the shape of a triangle and then held it for a minute or so.  Then a fourth light appeared out of nowhere.  The other three lights broke their triangle formation and began flying around.  The flying was not dramatic in the sense that they were zipping all around the sky, because that was not the case at all.  Almost all of the flying was relatively slow but it was obvious that these lights could, and were, moving in any direction they wanted.  They could fly in a direction, stop on a dime, then head back the other way.  Same thing with up or down.  It did seem very deliberate to me and impossibly exact.  It wasn&apos;t chaotic.  At one point, they formed a straight line, at another they would be jumbled together.  I don&apos;t know if there was any noise because I was in the forklift but my coworker didn&apos;t hear anything.  The most I saw was five lights flying at the same time.Then, one of the lights flew in a straight line heading east, away from the rest of the lights.  Once a considerable distance away, it stopped and then dimmed completely into disappearance.  At the exact moment that it was dimming away, a new light began to shine into existence in the western sky, on the other side of the rest of the lights.  This would continue for a while.  One of the lights would fade out while another one would simultaneously fade into existence.  But that wasn&apos;t always the case.  Sometimes two would fade out and no new ones would appear.All the while, I had work to do so I had to keep returning to the beam to grab coils but then I would sit and watch the lights for a minute or two before I would have to return to the building again.  The whole incident from start to finish was about a half hour.  The whole time it was occurring it looked like the event as a whole was slowly moving north.  At around 18:25 all I could see was one large light in the sky, just like it had started, but it was much further north than when it first appeared.  Then, around 18:30 I returned to the building to grab another coil and when I returned the light was gone and I never saw it again.Luckily I have a witness to back this story up but I didn&apos;t think that was going to be valuable or even be an issue.  I could not wait to get home to watch the news that night because I thought for sure every single person that was traveling on the Ohio Turnpike or Airport Highway (Rt. 2) had to either be calling this in or recording it.  To me, there is no way anyone traveling on either road could have missed this;  Or anyone in Fulton County, for that matter, with a view of the northern sky.  I honestly expected helicopters or airplanes to arrive at any minute to investigate.  This was too unmissable, unnatural, and bright to be missed by anyone in the area.  I thought for sure this was going to be story #1 on every single news program that night.  So you can imagine how disappointed I was that night when there was no mention of anything on the news.  To this day, I cannot find anything about strange lights or UFOs on any of the local channels&apos; or the Toledo Blade&apos;s we! bsites.  I&apos;ve also searched YouTube to see if any footage has been posted - If there has been, I haven&apos;t found it.  But I&apos;ve also searched YouTube to see if I can find any footage at all from around the world that resembles what I saw that night.  So far, I&apos;ve found a clip or two that is similar, but nothing at all that makes me go: &quot;There!  That is what I saw!&quot;  It is surprisingly frustrating.The only tiny piece of validation I have, other than a 2nd eye witness, was a friend of mine who works at the Air National Guard base at Toledo Express Airport.  I was telling him about the sighting and he confirmed that he was working the night of my sighting and he heard a group of coworkers make the joke that &quot;Well, it sounds like the mother ship has landed.&quot;  They were discussing the UFOs in the sky that night.  My friend didn&apos;t think much of it at the time and he didn&apos;t have any other information.  He didn&apos;t know if calls were coming into the base to report the UFOs or if the base itself was able to see them on radar.  He did not know if jets were scrambled to investigate (I never saw any.)  But he did confirm that the base was at least aware that there was strange phenomena occurring in the sky on that night.", "2 bright circular lights seen hovering at dusk in Barrow County, Georgia (Second sighting in 1 week)Driving West at dusk on Highway 316 we noticed a bright white light hovering low in the sky (same object as report filed on 3/15/10).  Stopped car to take a picture and look through binoculars and then continued driving on 316 toward the light.

As I got out of my car I was looking at the Eastern part of the sky, which is very open from my driveway and this night was particularly clear. I instantly spotted two faint glowing orange lights off in the distance out of the Northeastern part of the sky that were headed South. The two objects, which had what I would describe as a fiery glow, were moving in formation, with one apparently leading the other and at a slightly higher altitude in the sky from my vantage point. The objects were traveling at a steady pace and appeared to float across the sky. I could not make out any sound coming from the objects, and to my knowledge they did not make any noise. I ran in to my front yard to try and track the two objects as they glided across the sky and disappeared behind my neighbors house. I ran to my side yard and around the back of my neighbors house, but the objects had vanished. T! he event was very brief but profound, I would have given anything to have had someone there with me to witness what I saw. This event felt like I was witnessing something that I could not possibly explain, which made the hair stand up all over my neck and arms. I have recently taken a more keen look at the sky as I am currently enrolled in an astronomy class at the University of Kansas, and I have to say that witnessing these two objects was easily the most intriguing, confusing, and spookiest thing I have witnessed to date.", "Flat football shaped object hoving over passing planesI was at my high school with my boyfriend in the football field and a passing plane caught my attention.  There was a shiny, fish/football shaped object floating above and a small distance from the plane.  It was rotating on it&apos;s axis, moving very slowly, much slower than the plane.  The object was about a forth smaller than the plane, accounting for perspective. It went in a perfectly straight line and stopped.  It seemed to stop rotating, then changed the direction of its rotation from counter-clockwise to clockwise.  Then as another plane passed below it, it changed its trajectory and moved higher and away at a slight angle until neither I nor my boyfriend could see it anymore.  He didn&apos;t believe me that it was a UFO, he said it was balloons, but I&apos;ve never seen balloons do what that object did.", "Gliding silent set of lights over Gilbert, AZ.2/08/10 I took a break from work and walked outside the building at approx 8:22pm.  Building is located at 459 n Gilbert Rd in Gilbert, Az.  I saw in the north area of the sky, over the apartment building across the street a set of lights.There were two steady white lights with blinking red light equidistance in between them.  The red light was smaller than the two white lights and appeared to flash off something metallic or silvery in color when it was blinking.  The object was about the size of my thumb to the second joint held horizontally at arm&rsquo;s length, that was the width of the object.  There was absolutely no sound.  The object moved in a slow and gliding motion towards the west and slightly northwest.  At first I thought it might be a plane, but it had no flashing red and green wingtip lights and no sound.  Also the lights didn&rsquo;t look like a helicopter and again there was no sound and it had that gliding motion.  I lost it behind the trees, it was that low and then caught a glimpse of it again further away and more to the west and slightly northwest but then lost it again behind the buildings.I did not see it emerge from behind the buildings so it may have turned more northerly or it may have descended even further.

Emmediately I notice to balls of fire.  They were orange and they were moving.  They moved for a few minutes getting closer and then light started shooting out of them on the bottom and they disapeared, first one, then a minute later the other one. That was in the west.  The third one came from the north and looked like it was coming straight towards my direction.  It was big and bright. I had time to go and wake up my husband so he could come outside and see.  When he came out, it took what seemed like five minutes for it to shoot out light and then sputter out and disapear.  After that happened.  About five minutes later, what looked like a very big bag was floating down and it landed on the main street about seven houses down from my house.  I think that was just a bag, I could&apos;t tell because it was dark.  It made me want to go down the street though to look, but my husband wasn&apos;t willing to go because its cold and late, so I stayed in and got on the internet to see if anyone else saw it.  I have seen manys strange things in the sky, but never that.  I saw something once that looked like a battle happening in space.  I counted 14 total lights chasing each other.

It wasn&apos;t completely dark yet.  I noticed a round shaped golden light coming toward me from the north, heading south, and I watched its progress until trees got in the way.  At first I just thought it was a plane, but it looked too big, because I couldn&apos;t hear a sound from it.  I saw two little balls of light blink on and off along the sides a couple times, they were white.  I thought planes had colored lights.I ran to keep sight of it, and saw it again.  I expected to be able to see it disappear in the distance, growing smaller. Instead it disappeared instantly.  By that time I was wondering what it was.  I am familiar with satellites, have seen several flying over here.  This was visually larger and and maybe a little slower.

Directly in front of use was an object the kept flashing different colors.  It was at about 30 degrees above the horizon and much larger than any stars. I told my girlfriend that I had seen it before and had watched 3 or 4 times before during 2009 and that I was not sure what it was.  Streams of light would come out the bottom at times it appeared to be 4 of them and they did not go to the ground but stopped a ways below the object.  Then off to the north another object that looked exactly like the one we were watching came in close to the first one and stopped a distance from it, about three or four lengths of the object away.  They stayed there for a few seconds stationary.  Then the second object took off angling up into the sky to the west rapidly getting smaller and smaller and when it was just about out of sight it turned and came back toward us and passed over us a! t a very hig attutide and continued out of sight to the east.  The first object just kept moving on to the west slowly and was almost out of sight when we got home about 5 mins later.  This object is multi-colored and give off beams of light down from it.

So i step outside and look up to the west and see the jet and the jet trail, but i&apos;m still hearing the nose and notice almost parrell is a second jet. some distance away i would have to say but seeing to jets matching speed and general direction strikes me as odd, and as they fade away under the tree line the noise i can still hear, and i look to the east, to 2 more jets. They&apos;re not to low, normal distance from ground for normal everday jets. Exceptthey&apos;re cruising quit fast, with both direction and speed i know they&apos;re niether circling to land at bradely nor west over.  I notice with the one now diretly over head from the wing span, general shape, and th! e spilt in each jet trail after the exuast that these birds have 2 engines per wing, and the cool flat grey of the air force, maybe a c-5 or a c-17 again not out of the ordinary, except they&apos;re going fast from an odd to vector to an unknown destination and even wehn we first entered the war in iraq i&apos;ve never seen more then 2 of these in the air like this at the same time.  Thats when i noticed a 5th? aircraft for the last set as they head west in between the 2, this one was either smaller or higher up, no sign of the ussal jet trail and was matching speed. However as they&apos;re heading towards the sun i figure it could just of been a glare as it soon disapeared. In the Last year when comes to air traffic, i&apos;ve seen a few things out of place in terms of military aircraft.  most things are ussal, A-10&apos;s flying either from bradley air national gaurd or from West Over (both currently deployed in the middle east)C-5,s C-17, C-130/ac=130s, black hawks (CT home of skikorsky afterall) and chinooks.  but then theres times were things are odd, i remember seeing here abotu a report in neiboring enfield about 4 f-15s flying overhead, and i remember that night with my brother seeing and hearing them but with being night i could not identify them as f-15&apos;s but just airfighters in formation minimal lights on them going rather fast and low in both a residential area and a general area for comercial airfact to circle.  Back here in somers myself and a friend witnessed in daylight back in janruary a fligth of 3 f-15&apos;s crusing low enough to read USAF on each wing headed towards west over, and last summer my self and my neighbors got to see a little ar! iel show by a lone f-22 doing barel rolls and the short at high speeds and low altitude.

I now believe it was not a dream but an abduction experience.  This occurred in Huntsville, Alabama at night. I have three memories: I was placed in a seat that looked like plastic similar to fast food restaurants.  It was curved and had a high back that protruded above my head.  I was not belted in the seat but I was stuck there and could not move.  My eyes were open but unable to move so I could only see in front of me.  There was a man sitting across from me in a same type of seat, and he was not moving either.  I could see more seating behind him but with the design I could not see anyone sitting.The second memory I woke up and was on a table in the middle of a room.   I was laying with my head in the south and my feet in the north.  My eyes could not look around, but I could see part of the ceiling and part of the wall on my right.  It appeared to look rounded and somewhat reminded me of commercial office partitions, grey/silver and flat.  I did not know where I was, then my head rolled to the left and I saw a woman walking up a small ramp to a door that I heard open with a &quot;swish&quot; sound, like a hatchback car when you open it.  I could see a little of the hall way and it appeared to curve slightly.The woman was wearing a red bodysuit and seemed to be physically fit.  I saw her head was different, it was larger in the back like it was deformed and her hair was blonde and extremely thin like a chemo patient that is losing most of their hair.  She was on the west side of the room and to the left of me.She had to know I was looking at her from behind because after the door opened she quickly turned and looked at me.  I saw her in the front view before she knocked me back out apparently with her mind, she did not say anything.  Her body seemed human but I have never seen a face similar to her.She had a bigger forehead and bigger eyes than a human, her nose was extremely small, almost no cartilage and reminds me of Michael Jacksons small nose.  Her mouth was small too with very thin lips.The last memory I was in a different seat facing west looking at black windows.  I saw the seat I had been in and it was emply, I still could not look around but I saw a door to the north behind the seat I was in in the first memory.

(It is not uncommon to see jets in the sky over northeastern West Virginia, but seeing three of them fly so close together and in the same direction is a rarity.) Within minutes, many more similar objects appeared, all with the same general heading, coming from multiple directions (most were coming from the south, and a few were coming from the north). At this time, there were about 10-15 objects in the sky. All of these objects had vapor trails, which is why I assume they were jets, but I began to notice that three or four of the trails were distinctly different from the rest; they had a slight blueish tint, and seemed to flash or flicker. I then noticed that one or two of the objects seemed to be traveling vertically, toward! the ground (albeit at a very high altitude); I didn&apos;t notice when these objects appeared or if they had been traveling west like the others, but I did notice that their trails were curved, as if they had been flying from the west to the south-east, then suddenly and drastically changed their pitch. I lost visual contact shortly after this as I was traveling in a different direction, but the event might have lasted longer. I believe some of these objects might have been meteorites or debris entering the atmosphere. I am unsure if this event has been reported, but perhaps the nearby North Central West Virginia Airport (CKB) would have some information about the incident.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Weather was overcast and object was below the cloud deck. What at first appeared (and was assumed to be) a very large commercial aircraft took on a very different appearance upon closer inspection.An impressive display of flashing lights is what caught my eye. Green and red lights similar to standard aviation craft were seen...however these were arrayed in larger numbers, particularly the red lights. A deep fluorescent violet light began to shimmer at one point along at least one edge of the object. As the object passed more overhead I could then see the bottom of it. On this aspect I could see a large bank of white lights (these were not bright white but had a somewhat warmer and yellow/orange tone) in a rectangular pattern. These somewhat shimmered and sparkled.The object was traveling due east at a steady but undetermined speed. My guess was that it was traveling at approximately 300 to 600 MPH (depending on the actual height of it).The object appeared to be quite large in that as it got further away, it did not really seem to diminish in size too much. On the other hand, it was below the cloud deck (the altitude of which I do not know), so sizing the object in that regard was not possible. I was driving alone and simply could not pull over in traffic to get a better look. There was a solid black background slightly visible behind these lights...so it was almost assuredly a solid structure that I was looking at.If I had to guess, my general impression was that the object had a somewhat triangular shape. The size of the object by pure general impression, would have been approximately the size 1 to 4 times the size of a Boeing 747. I lost sight of the object behind trees.The type of lights on the object were shimmering (violet), flashing (red and green), steady (red and green) as well as the steady yellow white rectangular lights which had a shimmering to sparkling aspect to them as well.

It was completely dark that night and the shape of the object other than the lights was difficult to distinguish.  It was difficult to get a distance on the object as it was so big.

It was late at night, my best guess would be around ten p.m.  My family was sitting around the campfire and I walked out to look at the lake.  Across the lake directly West of where I was standing on the opposite bank were three lights that formed a triangle.  The triangle it formed was huge and originally I though that it was merely the intersecting  of three tower lights, perhaps from the plant that is in Ponca City or from oil rigs.  As I continued looking at it, however, I noticed that it was moving.  It was moving very very slowly and was very close to the ground.  Since I knew it was moving I started to consider maybe it was three military airplanes flying together in formation and I was looking at their front lights.  That didn&rsquo;t match up either though because as low as it was there is no aircraft that I know of that could fly that slow.  Also, I ruled out that it was three separate aircrafts because the lights started to turn off one at a time.  One would turn off and then come back on, another might flicker and go off and then come back.  I watched it for about 5-10mins and then left.  I have never really believed in aliens and what I saw intrigued me but that&rsquo;s about it.

After making sure there were no aircraft to be seen or heard in the area, we shone the laser pen at a few stars (you have to make sure there are no aircraft in the area, especially helicopters as it is very dangerous and ILLEGAL to point this thing in the sky when aircraft are present!).I shone the laser pointer at three stars in the sky which are shaped like a triangle, They&apos;re in the west of the sky and are visible most nights. After touching each star with the laser beam I put the laser pen into my back pocket and lit a cigarette while me and my friend chuckled because I was putting on a stupid voice while pointing at the stars.From the east and for approx 1-1.5 seconds a brilliant white sphere with no glare or tail. The object appeared as bright as magnesium burning as it passed over our heads at a speed which was far less than a shooting start, but much faster than any known plane or helicopter.There was no sound and the object looked to be very defined and solid (perfect sphere, or ball).I have seen many shooting stars, satellites, commercial/military planes and many helicopters.This object did not fit into any of these criteria, nor did it resemble a comet in any way.I have never seen a large meteor in person but have on video and this object did not in anyway resemble this either.The object was difficult to scale, my friend and I talked for a while and decided it to seemed to looked a little bigger than a passenger jet in the sky but lower than a jet would fly (30,000ft). We cannot verify any size or height of the object as it was very fast, very solid and very visible but so fast that it is hard to from memory alone judge.The object did however, fly quite precisely through the centre of the triangle of stars above, pretty much the centre of the three points I shone the laser!  I have created a couple of images using Google map to point out a rough flight path. I started small then worked out. Which I have emailed to yourselves.After returning inside My friend tried to use the GPS on his phone to work out the direction of the craft, but the GPS did not work when it usually does there. It said we were out in the bay towards the direction the object flew!  A little while before my Friend and I went out to use the laser we were smoking a cigarette and My Girlfriend, My Friend and I saw two aircraft that looked like helicopters with a droning sound. They had red and green and white lights on them like a normal aircraft but were flashing differently.I know the red and green lights are used to determine which direction an aircraft is flying so other aircraft don&rsquo;t hit them. But these red and green lights were alternating and the white light stayed with them.

Then, all the sudden, it shot down at I&rsquo;d say a 75-80% angle and the lights grew much more intense as it fell to the earth.  It looked like a bow tie shape where the inside had a straight, large black line and on both sides was a triangle of bright light.  The triangle was fuzzy on the sides and looked &ldquo;jagged&rdquo; on the outside edge, almost like sunrays.  It shot down past the top of the trees, and I could no longer see it.

As we were starting the vehicles, we both caught sight of an object in the air approximately 1 mile away.  We both made reference as to how low the object was, maybe 1-2000 feet in the air.  The trajectory of the object was by no means in the direction of any nearby airports, and was flying in an extremely straight path.  These things in and of themselves are not entirely out of the ordinary.  However, the following statements were mind baffling.The speed of the aircraft was very slow.  Judging from our vantage point, the object appeared to be moving somewhere in the range of 30-50 mph.  To say that the object was &ldquo;probably 2 miles up in the air so it appeared to move slower than it was&rdquo; does not apply here.  If that were the case, then my estimated size of the object would be about 1000 feet wide, as opposed to the large airliner-size that it appeared.  There were 3 lights on the object; one on each of the sides, and one near what would be considered the back.The final piece of information about the object was that it was completely silent.  On a clear, cold night in January, with little or no wind to affect the sound, almost any plane in the air is audible to some extent. Not this particular object.   Normally with an aircraft at 5 times its height a faint engine roar could still be heard; but totally silent.  We watched the object for a couple of minutes as it slowly made its way off into the distance.  It was not until I got home and started looking online did I realize that I very well might have seen a UFO.", "Four circular objects emitting a dim redish light sighted traveling a great speed traveling east to west.I was leaving for work in the morning when I glanced up at the sky and noticed 4 circular objects. They appeared to be in pairs. They all displayed a dim redish light that gave them the appearance of being donut or circular in shape.

Then the second aircraft flew with great speed and had rotating lights (Blue, green, red, an white) that went faster than any airplane that I have witnessed.  After it went out of sight, two more aircraft came from the east and was also flying very low and at great speeds with the same rotating lights that were on the second aircraft.

It looked like a star and was very very very high up. It could have been misinterpreted as a meteor, but it stopped all of a sudden.  I ran inside to get the binoculars and when I got back out, I looked at the object again.  It just looked like a larger white orb of light, just slightly larger than a star.  Then another one showed up. My dad was saying, &ldquo;see that! See that!!&rdquo; Then one backed up a bit and the then the other one did as well.

My whole life I was certain of what happened and was surprised I never heard anything more about it.  In my adult life I have heard people on TV and in articles describe what they have seen and I have never heard anyone describe one like I saw.  Then I just came across your site and database, and went through all the months and years of my childhood hoping to find something that has troubled me my whole life.  All of the sudden &quot;Disco&quot; I came across that blew my mind and is about exactly the right time of when I was a child that I may have seen this.  The thing that blew me away was his description of the ship...when he described it the hair on the back of my neck stood up.  It was the case reported on 6/15/76 in Smithtown New York.  I am almost certain we saw the same thing.  Is there a way for me to get in touch with this person and ask him more questions?  I mean to be alone with this! my whole life and find this is no way a coincidence.  What I really want to do is see if we can compare sketches of what we saw.  Please help me this is so important to me.I need to tell you what happen to me as a child though because I probably have thought about it every day of my life.  It was somewhere between 9-11 pm...I don&apos;t know exactly what I was doing prior to going into the bathroom, but I went into the bathroom and was standing in front of the toilet.  Immediately to the right of the toilet is a window that you can freely look out.  I glanced out the window and was immediately captivated by what I saw.  Above the tree line was this craft hovering above the trees.  Around the bottom of the saucer was lights flashing in a sequence all around the bottom of it, lights going in circles.  These light panels so to speak were also windows.  In the center on the top was a cap that may have been clear.  I knew the second I saw it exactly what it was, which was a UFO.  I also knew deep down inside something was aware that I was watching it.  It wasn&apos;t a scary feeling of any type, but I knew someone was aware of me.  It mostly hovered the whol! e time in the same place.  I knew what I was looking at and was so excited that I ran into the living room and was screaming for my parents to come and look at this.  We ran back to the window for me to show him and I pointed out the window.  He was starring out the window going, &quot;where, where??&quot;  Here is the total bizarre thing...the UFO was sitting there as clear as can be and I am starring at this thing pointing and screaming at it and he just could not see it at all.  I also was then set in with a feeling that for whatever reason, it isn&apos;t possible for him to see what I can see.  As this was going on, I can still feel this really weird awareness.  This sense that they are aware of me, and I am aware of them, and at this time I am only able to see it.  I don&apos;t know how that is possible but as a child this was all crystal clear to me.  I also was aware that they were now leaving and I watched it slowly move away from me as it is leaving, again I had this awareness inside ! they were leaving and still can feel them watching me as they ! moved aw ay, and then there was just this sudden zip away from me and it disappeared.I am going to try and explain one other thing that is probably going to sound absolutely nuts!  Truth is, from the time I saw the craft out the window, to the time I ran out for my parents, I really have no idea how long that time is.  It feels like it is only a moment, but something deep down inside me feels like it was actually a lot longer, but &quot;made&quot; to feel like a moment or two.  I feel like I just completely lost a sense for solid time during this period.  Even after the whole thing was over, I still had this feeling of &quot;lost time.&quot;  My memories feel fluid, but even today there is this feeling of lost time somewhere in there like something happen to me but I really have no idea what.There is something else that is very odd and probably completely off the wall.  I have no idea why I associate what I am going to say with the sighting but I have always wonder this my adult life.  I have also never told another soul this in the world because I would think somebody is completely nuts if they told me this.  Around the time of all this in my life I have noticed a little bump under my skin on my shin that&apos;s like a small pellet.  I didn&apos;t have any type of accident, there is no scar, no childhood accident that would of cause this but my whole adult life I have always felt that something was put there by them somehow.  I have no memory of anything like this at all happening surrounding the craft, but something sick in my stomach tells me otherwise.  One of these days I am going to get that thing cut out and find out exactly what it is.Anyway...the report you have I am certain by his description of the craft that we witnessed the same thing.  Is there some way of digging a little deeper into this?

We were eastbound on Hwy 98 in Destin, Fl. Having just left the restaurant which is at 21000 Emerald coast highway.  After driving about a half mile east, I happened to notice a series of lights to the north of the highway, hanging in the sky.  They were quite bright and stationary, so I thought they were probably some outdoor stadium lights.  They literally lit up the bottoms of some low clouds that were passing above them.  That&rsquo;s when I realized they weren&rsquo;t stadium lights, since they wouldn&rsquo;t have projected upwards.  My wife also saw them and thought they were lights on top of a hill, then realized that there are no hills around here and wondered what they were. When I saw them, there were three lights, when she saw them, there were two , but then.another showed up to form a triangular light pattern, then two more showed up below and to the west of the first group.  We continued to drive east and talked about them.  At first I thought they were helicopters with their front lights on,  but as we drove along, they got neither closer nor farther away and also seemed suspended in one spot relative to one another.  Also, there was no familiar sound such as 5 helicopters would have made.  Here in Destin, helicopters are flying around all the time and there is no such thing as a silent flight of them. We continued to drive east, discussing what they might or might not be&hellip;&hellip;all the time they were just hanging in the sky.  Finally we came to an intersection about two miles away at Matthew Road where I could pull off, which I did and turned into the parking lot of a service station.  I grabbed our FLIP camera, rolled down the window and started filming them.  Shortly after that, the lights began dimming, one by one, till they were gone from the sky as shown on the video. Some observations that are not apparent from the video:  The lights were VERY bright, lighting up the bottom of the clouds more than is apparent in the video  They were absolutely stationary relative to our position, even though we drove over two miles on the ground as we observed them. The lights were also sharper and better defined than on the video.    That&rsquo;s about it.

I find myself in a very desolate part of New Mexico on Highway 60 heading east.  I am on the road so early because I couldn&apos;t sleep, I am sure with anticipation of the very long drive to Denver ahead of me.  I have driven up to Eager Arizona to see a friend, stay the night and head out the following day.  It was suggested to take 60 because it&apos;s a much prettier drive than Interstate 40.  I had done that so many times, I could drive that in my sleep, a new route was in order.  However, because it was so very dark, I didn&apos;t see much.  The occasional fog patch and lone vehicle heading in the opposite direction.  I could see silouettes of the landscape and there was snow on the ground that dimly luminated my surroundings.  I was awake.  Very awake.  Just finished a large cup of coffee, listening to Sirius stand-up comedy (satellite radio) and driving very fast 75-85 mph.  I was alone on this road.Judging from some of the signs I had passed, I thought I was coming up on a small town and slowed down a bit.  I started to gain on a mini van and decided to hold back and not pass until we went through the town.  Being the kind of driver I am, I am constantly looking at my surroundings.  Both side mirrors, rear view mirror and of course, straight ahead.  Not coming up on any town and I start to think about passing the van.  I look in my driver side mirror and there is suddenly a vehicle directly behind me, only more toward the center of the two lane highway than in my lane.  As if it were thinking about passing me.  I&apos;m thinking, what the...I did not see anything in the distance, had not gone around any curves, nothing obscured my view of several miles behind or in front of me.  I did not pass any roads either for somebody to get on to the highway.  My first impression other than how freakishly close it was to my tailgate, was that is was the grill of an older model 80&apos;s, boxy Chevy truck.  I never saw a truck, just what I have illustrated on my drawing.  It was directly, 3 - 4 FEET behind me.  We are traveling at maybe 75 mph. .. I&apos;m thinking, pass me buddy.  I look in my rearview, see only the lights (not all of them), side view, looks like it wants to go around.  I move to the right to indicate he is cleared for passing. Look again, it&apos;s right on me, look forward to make sure I am not too close to the van which is at a very safe distance, then look back to see where it is.  It vanished.  I even slowed down to look behind me to see where it went, no dust from going off the road, we did not pass a road to turn (going to fast and it was far too close to me to make a sudden turn), there were no ditches, no tail lights behind...nothing.  Just gone.At the time, I wasn&apos;t thinking UFO, but I thought the grill was odd and the lights weren&apos;t the average color or placement. Why didn&apos;t I see the shape of  the truck I thought it was?  Why were the main headlights a soft orange and why was there more than one turn signal light? Honestly, I did not see the whole thing, just what I could see in my drivers side mirror at a very close range.  There is no way it could have come up so fast without me seeing it.  I was going very fast and was on the lookout..(I didn&apos;t want a ticket for speeding).After it was gone, my mirror was really dirty, foggy, I rolled the window down and tried to wipe it clean. It wouldn&apos;t clean up, just smear. AND, I felt a tremendous need to sleep. I could not keep my eyes open.  I rolled the windows down, thinking the cold air would keep me awake until the sun came up.  Didn&apos;t help so much.  I fought it and finally came upon a very small town just as the sun started to come up.  I pulled over, where there were several buildings and some activity and gathered my thoughts.  At first, I thought maybe it was a ghost truck, don&apos;t laugh.  I did think that.  Then as I drove on it occurred to me Roswell was just over the mountain range...really??  could it be??  It all really struck me as bizarre, the way it happened. The rate of speed, how it suddenly appeared, how close it was to my truck and the way the &quot;truck grill&quot; looked, not quite right..and, how it suddenly vanished.Do I report this?

The way it was traveling did not seem plausible by Science.  It shot FAST across the sky as if the sky was sucking it in.  Like it was traveling through another dimension.I don&apos;t know if it was actually a feather that we noticed which drew our attention to the small white object or if the feather transformed into the white object.  But it flew SO fast and high and eventually disappeared.  As it got further away it looked less and less like a feather and more like a tiny white dot that was glowing. Like a shooting start that went up instead of down.  I hope this made sense.I looked around to see if anyone else in the park was noticing it but no one was.

While attempting to grasp an idea of what type of aircraft would be that low (150-200 ft approx) I was assuming I would see a newly constructed drilling rig in the field with an illuminated light platform.   But as I approached, slowing down to get a better look, I realized the object! seemed to be moving southwest towards my north-northwest approach.  My wife, who was just ahead of me in another vehicle, did not see the lights at all as she passed.  There was a vehicle right behind me on this two lane road,so I couldn&apos;t stop - as I wanted to.  Instead I slowed to a crawl as I reached the spot the lights were hovering or flying by, leaning forward as much as possible to see to my right if I could see a structure attaching the lights.  At the same time I rolled my window down to see if I could hear a jet engine or roto blades as I passed.  The only thing I could hear was my truck engine and the road.  I believe the object passed over me from the passenger side as  I passed the spot I originally saw them at.  I looked back over my right shoulder to see if I could see the back side of the lights and I couldn&apos;t see anything.  I drove into my neighborhood, constantly looking back to see if I could see anything and there was nothing there.  My wife and I grabb! ed a video camera from the house and drove back out minutes la! ter to s ee if we could see anything at all and there was nothing else unusual.  The next day we drove down the same road several times, taking pictures of the area the lights were seen.  By estimating the one stand of trees just in front of the lights, I would guess the lights were just above them at 150-200 ft. above the ground.  The night I saw the lights was very clear, no clouds.  Intercontinental Airport is due east of my house and the local airport is northwest of it. Planes were all around that night, but at about 3500 ft at the lowest.", "Metallic Teardrop Shaped ObjectI was walking past my bedroom window when I saw movement in the corner of my eye; I looked out and saw a dark gray metallic &quot;teardrop&quot; shaped object.  At first I thought it was an odd looking balloon floating down but it never changed speed and looked &quot;heavy&quot;.  It had been raining during the day and was slightly breezy outside, I noticed that the object moved down in a straight line, not blowing around like something lighter would in the wind.  There was nothing attached to it, nor were there any lights around it and it was the only one I saw, it was about maybe 3 feet wide and 4 feet tall if I were to guess.", "Bright green fireball appears at the end of a burning meteor tail.I was driving home from work on the Adirondack Northway, heading north.  I noticed a very bright orange-colored tail (which looked like it belonged to a meteor) appear in the northwest sky.  It was very big, and looked like it was on fire.  The tail was pointed directly down and then a very big, bright green ball appeared at the end of the tail.  The ball appeared to be on fire as well.  The ball and the tail disappeared following a bright flash of light.  I was in the midst of approximately 20 cars, and I could tell they had seen it to because everyone braked at the same time.  Some people pulled over to the side of the road.  I listened afterwards for a sound, but there was none.

I looked up and seen what appeared to be an Airplane flying overhead. I ignored it for a few seconds, then looked back and saw that it had seemed not to move. I noticed there were no blinking lights on it, and It also was orange in color. We often see airplanes overhead heading North and sometimes in the East. This was different much slower and no sound. I went and got my Video Camera and started filming. As I watched it, I walked toward the back of my yard and could see another one over the top of my house. Then I noticed they were moving very slowly because as I stood still I could see the change in height compared to the top of my roof. They seem to be five spheres or lights together in an arc. The middle light being the biggest, getting smaller toward each side. As I watched and filmed another appeared coming from the same southern location in the sky moving in a straight line! . I filmed one near the Moon as the other two rose in the sky. Then the one near the Moon disappeared fading out as I watched. Then I noticed as I watched each faded as I watched them get higher in the sky from over the top of my roof to above my head. But I started to realize by the time the fifth one appeared it had rose from the south but was disappearing more to the west and not directly overhead anymore. To me this meant it may have been moving outside of the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, and the earth was moving below them. Each faded out to the naked eye as they past slowly overhead. But if I used my night vision on my video camera I could still see them as they faded away.This was seen by my wife and two children ages nine and ten.4-1/2 minutes of my video is posted on Youtube &ldquo;Objects in sky over Antioch 12:33AM Jan 1 2010&rdquo;.", "Orange glowing orbs  floating gracefully and stopping in triangular and linear shapes.On 10/03/09 four of my friends and I were driving through Manchaca Texas (just south of Austin), when my friend saw a light in the sky.

They seemed to be stationary in the sky. We stopped on a bridge over a creek to get a better look when all of a sudden they started to move. Next more of them, one by one, started to appear seemingly from the creek. Three of them formed a perfect triangle and then a perfectly straight line(stopping for a few seconds each time). We sat on the bridge for about 10 minutes and saw about 15 or 20 orbs floating/dancing oddly but gracefully through the sky. As I stared at them individually I could not tell exactly how close or far away they where, or what was making them glow. When we started driving away I kept looking back and saw them spanning the whole s! kyline behind us. Regretfully none of us got any pictures or videos.

The craft resembled a B-2, but it emitted absolutely no sound, not even the low sound of a landing stealth airplane or jet. The aircraft was not flying parallel to the earth, but at a 45 degree angle or steeper, and its trajectory was parallel to the earth. The sighting occurred between the Sea World exit and the I-8 exit on I-5 at 1730 PST or GMT-8. I turned in the passenger seat to see if I could catch a glimpse of it through the back window of the car. I could see the aircraft silhouetted against the sky for several seconds before the aircraft vanished in an instant. There were other commercial aircraft in the vicinity due to the proximity to the SD international airport, but the chevron was definitely not commercial.

Austin, a object with unusual lights was seen about 100 yards off of the interstate, hovering completely still about 300-400 feet in the air. The object had larger and more luminous lights than normal, with one steady blue light and one slowly blinking red light. The driver approached the object and it was completely stationary. First impression was that the object was some sort of tethered balloon with lights, but subsequent events ruled out this possibility. Upon passing underneath the object, driver noted that the body of the craft appeared to have a very unusual shape, possibly triangular, though it was difficult to see under the conditions. The object remained stationary for the duration that the driver could view it in the rear-view mirror.  Driver then made a u-turn on the interstate as soon as possible to return to the sight of the spotting. Upon returning approximately 2 minutes later, the craft was nowhere to be see! n, which was thought to be unusual since if it had been a hovering helicopter he would have expected to see it moving off into the distance.

I was driving and noticed 2 white lights in a straight horizontal line off to the right and slightly ahead of me. Not knowing the area, I assumed they were lights marking the top of a tall building. The area is surrounded by trees so I lost sight of teh lights and really thought nothing of them at the time.Approximately 1 minute later I saw the same too lights appear from behind the tree line on the right side of the road and slowly cross, disappearing behind the trees on the left side.

I was 16 years old and was studying in the second year of college. I do remember that I recorded the EXACT date and time of the sighting along with a verbal description of the nature of the UFO, but cannot find the original record anywhere. I also wish to state that the reason I am submitting this report is because of a second sighting I made barely a week ago, in the same country but a different city hundreds of miles away from the first and a full nine years later. I am 24 years old and havehad two sightings in my life thus far.Situation and description:  It was summer and I was on the terrace at our place in Bangalore, India, at around seven in the evening.  My brother had just headed back downstairs and I lingered on for a while longer as the weather was pleasant.  I lay down on the ground and stared at the sky star gazing. I don&rsquo;t remember which constellation I was looking at exactly, but I spotted a bright shining light from the corner of my eye, a little distance away from the spot I was looking at.   As I first looked at it I thought it was a star because that&rsquo;s exactly what it appeared to be (almost as bright as Sirius). Then I realized it was moving, albeit very slowly, to the right.   As I watched it suddenly seemed to accelerate for a while before stopping abruptly and changing direction at an angle of ninety degrees.  I sat up as I thought my eyes were tricking me, but the object did not stop and was definitely not an illusion or a trick of light.  It stood out against the pitch black sky, which ! I thought was remarkable considering Bangalore&rsquo;s light pollution.  The object continued to zig-zag along a roughly linear axis,and it was this zig-zag motion at high speed that amazed me for I have never seen an aircraft capable of such abrupt change of direction at such high speeds before.  As it proceeded along its path it changed seemed to me it was changing colour, from the dull yellow, starlike tinge it originally had(at least when I spotted it) to blue and finally to a dull green flicker.  This &lsquo;phenomenon&rsquo; lasted for a good couple of minutes, disappearing behind the silhouette of the taller building next to our own for some twenty-thirty seconds before reappearing on the other side.  It then disappeared in a matter of moments, with the intensity of light decreasing to zero and vanishing. This was all I saw.I have seen weather balloons before, and I am absolutely certain what I saw was no such thing for without adequate propulsion I think it is impossible to move as rigidly and discretely as this body did.  Same reasoning also rules out any form of burning/incandescent matter floating toward the earth.  As for the object itself I know absolutely nothing of its form, shape or even size because all I saw was a bright spot of light.  Curiously enough, this was a few months after news of the Mir space station&rsquo;s &lsquo;demise&rsquo; and its break-up in the atmosphere.  Clearly this had nothing to do with the &lsquo;sighting&rsquo;, in my opinion, considering the time-gap between the two events and the obvious impossibility of debris acquiring wings of its own and flying about.  Also, there is an air-force base in Bangalore, but I enquired about and have been told Indian Airforce crafts are NOT allowed to fly over the city airspace. And in any case I know India isn&rsquo;t capable of such &lsquo;top-secret&rsquo; flight testing programmes, yet.I have no choice but to brand this sighting an UFO.((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

This is the second time that we have seen the lights.  The previous time was the first or second Tuesday in January.  Earlier that evening, there had been a series of sonic booms that were similar to a series of sonic booms heard all along the Gulf Coast last fall.  The booms were heard over several nights.  During the initial sighting, an attempt at photographing the objects was made, but t! hey did not appear in the picture.", "Rectangular object moving across the sky.My Girlfriend and I went out on the porch to have a cigarette and she said (What the hell is that?). I looked up in the northwestern sky and saw a very large rectangular object that seemed to be about 1000 feet up.It was about 100Ft. long by about 75 Ft. wide. It had four light orange lights, one on each corner with a solid beam. It was moving to the southeast at a moderate rate of speed. I would say a little faster than a jetliner. We could hear no noise at all, which we both found very strange.I ran in to get my camera but by the time I came out (about 15 seconds) it was to far away to capture on film.

It was dark and the stars were shining brightly.  I saw two things:  the first was clearly a jet airplane, very small and moving near the horizon in a southernly direction,  but with the blinking lights there was no question it was a jet.  I then saw what I first thought was a &quot;shooting star&quot; to the west of the jet, but it was moving in a north westerly direction--kind of at a 45 degree angle--moving UP, not down.  But it did not dissipate like a shooting star, it just kept moving upwards at a 45 degree angle at a high rate of speed for somthing that small.   It looked just like a twinkling star--similar to those in the sky around it--not like the far off jet I had already seen.   It continued to move up in the western sky, then slowed and stopped.  It looked just like the other twinkling stars in the sky.   Then it just stayed t! here, fixed.  I thought it must be another jet that had ascended then turned either away from me, or towards me, and would either grow larger or disappear, as planes at night do.  But it did neither.  It just stayed there with the same twinkling intensity for about 5 minutes.  I got tired of looking at and came inside.   This twinkling thing was probably a jet, but I&apos;ve never seen one just hang in the sky and not move at all.", "small silver/white light , making rapid zig-zag patterns in early morning skyI looked up at the sky this morning at 5:40, looking north, and I saw what I thought was a satellite- small whitish/silver circle, like a star.  Instead of taking a steady path like a satellite, this whitish circle began to make irregular patterns very quickly.  It almost looked like a white/silver balloon that was getting caught up in the wind and was blowing from random gusts of wind.  It remained the same color and brightness, but would zig zag, then seem to stop, then repeat the irregular rapid movement.

I had just turned 16 and was thinking I was now allowed to drive but here I was walking.  It was 9:00 PM and I had to be home at 11:00 PM.  So at 10:45 I headed home. No booze, no drugs.  As I walked along in the quiet night, I felt someone was watching me.  I turned to look up and and right there, probably 500 feet up and back was this set of lites that I felt was watching me.  The white square lites quickly blinked and moved from left to right like a marquee drews ones eyes along. I got the impression they were windows.  As a &quot;Coast Guard brat&quot;,I grew up around naval bases and was familiar with aircraft.  Even blimps make noise at relatively close range.  This was silent and I stared for approximately 30 minutes or so. It never moved and neither did I.  Finally, It just very slowly moved off from northwest to a southeastward direction. I slept all night and saturday until 4:00 in the afternoon.       My mother had my dad go to the C.G. base the next day to see what he could find out.  He came home tight lipped and we all just went on with our lives but never forgot this incident.  My mother always said that this episode did something to me.

As I walked to the dumpster I looked to the sky  I saw some lights that at the biggining I thought were like from an helicopter as the object approched more (it was very hight) at an speed that a normal place would reach, I saw with astonishing that the shape was not that of an helicopter, as it approached the area I was in (near the called intracostal between North Palm beach and singer Island)I saw the real shape above, it was an oval and i got astonished when I clearly saw that the oval underneat had an spiral and it rotated as giving impulse to the ufo or so, I do not know. 3 things called my attention.  First, there was no noice and that made me stare at the object when approaching and Second, as the object approached, what I thought therewere lights, might have been the bright of the top part of the object, therewere no flushing lights or so the third thing is that as the object cleared my location and I could saw completally the underneat shape (oval and spiral)and it was not bright, like from a different material, the color was dark could be easily disgazed and camuflated in the clouds, as if purposely it had been colored to disguised in the dark clouds.

They each had a light on each of the three points of the triangle.  One light was red, one was blue and the third looked white or off white.

People do see things they can not explain or identify. But remember the F-117 first flew in 1969. The stealth single wing bomber around the same time. The F-71 Blackbird before that! Please tell me we haven&apos;t made any advancement in aircraft in nearly 40 years? I&apos;m fully convinced of UFO&apos;s but of our advanced military.

I heard the jet-like sound of the previous night, went outside to see the same or similar craft with the same loud jet-like noise in the same circular pattern around my house, that is, coming from the east, turning over my house and then heading back east toward the ocean.  I got a good look at the lights on the craft and they did not resemble at all the lights on a jet; the lights were two solid red non blinking circles.I call the South Kingstown police as I did the previous night, spoke with the officer/dispatcher who took my call seriously.  I told him that the craft resembled UFOs and not jets by the lighting pattern on them.

The dispatcher said he would call the state police to see what they knew.I didn&apos;t hear any more about it until the next night while watching the evening news at my mother&apos;s house some 30 miles away.

I paused for awhile to look thinking that these maybe falling stars but the trajectory of the movements were about horizontal (zig-zagging smoothly) and one star-like object following (chasing?) the other.  These two star-like objects looked about 5-10x larger than an airplane in the night sky but moving much faster (maybe &gt;&gt; 20x ).  The objects were also much closer to the ground.  The objects were in the sky for about 5-10 seconds before disappearing in the horizon at a much faster speed.

It didn&apos;t have any of the typical characteristic movement patterns of a plane either.  I got my sister from inside to come observe with me.  She also agreed that it didn&apos;t appear to be anything like a plane or anything that she recognized.  The object still had a bright iridescent white shine as it slowly moved.

The object seemed to stay in one place and then slowly move in a linear fashion.  Not anything like any aircraft.  The object then appeared to start flashing different colors. It would flash a bright red, then bright green, bright blue, and yellow and then back to white in no particular order.  It seemed like the entire object donned the color that it turned to, much unlike blinking aircraft lights that are separated by wing space.  As the object turned different colors it seemed to hover in one place.  It would then slowly do a somewhat figure eight pattern or a circular movement pattern and would at instances seemingly accelerate very quickly and then slow back down and then just hover in place.

It was close enough (about 100 yards up) that I saw the bottom of the triangle shaped vehicle.  I was thinking it would hit some trees or crash because it was so low.  I could see the bottom of the jet sized vehicle, but it was triangle shaped and didn&apos;t look like a plane or jet.  There were bright orange lights on the bottom.  I watched it zoom by at about 100 miles an hour - it looked like a fast moving car speed.  I could only watch the vehicle between the trees, probably for about 5 seconds.  We ran to see if we could see anything on the other side of the trees but it was no where in sig! ht.  The dogs kept barking when the vehicle passed over where the barking noises came from. After the vehicle had passed I stayed outside looking in the sky for other signs and I saw a lighter gray trail in the sky.

Following it, the light would turn blue as it flew to my left and then it would turn red as it flew back towards the right.  It circled in the same exact spot in the sky that I&apos;ve seen it before.  The light also hovered, dipped, and shot up into the air, behaving much like a toy helicopter.  Once again, though, from this distance, someone must have put a ton of lights on it, if that&apos;s what it is.

In this third sighting, I contacted the local PD for the second time.  I did not report it to the local PD the first time I saw it, but I have for the second and third sightings.  I still believe that someone may be flying something that&apos;s either a remote control plane, helicopter, or a! toy UFO out of a neighborhood park near Poinsettia Ln and Ambrosia Rd.  I will get video if this continues.  It seems to disappear by slowly circling down towards the ground as it gradually drops out of view.  That&apos;s the main reason I believe this is coming out of a local park and not an actual aircraft flying out over the ocean. I may have the distance wrong, however, and someone may be flying this from the beach.

This was early on November 6th, 2009 in Saquarema, a beach town in Rio, Brasil with only low rise homes. It was quiet and dark all around except for one light inside the room on my right. My friend was sitting by a table on the same veranda and stepped inside for just a couple of minutes.First sitting:  This was around 03:00 or later and as I leaned my head back on the hammock I looked straight up and saw 3 reddish orange lights, shaped in a triangle, equidistant from each other, all the same size, approximately the size of a nickel coin at arm&rsquo;s length.These 3 lights were not moving, just still in one same spot, strong lights but not shinny nor flickering, each one was the same and had no variation of color.From the angle I was looking (up) they were in an arrow shape and I can&rsquo;t remember if this way  : -   or this way  - :  , and I was quiet, analyzing what I was looking at when just before my friend stepped back to the veranda, these lights all of a sudden, altogether in the same shape took off to the right at lightning speed, they did not leave any streak behind, and I could not follow them further because the roof of the house created an obstacle to my view. This entire sighting seems to have lasted only about 10-15 seconds, just enough to appreciate it. There was no sound from the lights the entire event.Second sitting:  I immediately made a comment to my friend of what I had seen pointing in the direction of where the lights had gone but at the same time I looked around the sky when I spotted another single light, of a smaller size, about the size of a dime coin at arm&rsquo;s length but white, it was further away and not overhead and located in the opposite direction from where the other 3 orangey red lights had gone. This whiter light was similar to the color of any big star in the sky but bigger, and it was also standing still when I saw it, just bright, not flickering, and just as I was guessing it was not a star it zoomed off horizontally that other way (to the left) to quickly disappear in the black.My conclusions: What I saw had nothing to do with the characteristics of any balloons, nor fireworks, nor any earthly manmade airplanes, nor a manmade satellite, nor falling stars or comet, nothing that we know made today on Earth can move as fast and silently in the sky from a still position. It was definitely something not Terrestrial.Me: I believe in non-human extraterrestrial intelligence existence. I have been a photographer for many years but did not even try to get my camera so not to take my eyes off of what I was seeing, and it lasted only seconds anyhow. I have always wanted to see a &ldquo;UFO&rdquo;, a real one myself, not in pictures. I was not scarred, I was not surprised, I would say I was momentarily perplexed. I just looked up, saw what I saw, and enjoyed it.And: To my curiosity I googled the date of my ufo sitting and was pleased to see that someone from the beach in Saquarema photographed a strange dot in the sunset sky over the ocean the day before. It was good to know someone else also saw something unusual in the area skies the previous day.", "Saw what appeared to be stars shooting &quot;laser&quot; lights down, also an object emitting other objects in to anotherI have seen the same things in the sky for over a year.  One night my dog  was extremely anxious and began to bark angrily and excessively at the back door. I was reluctant to get up and let her out as she had just been out. I had gotten off work late and was eating dinner at the table, my dog was going crazy (like when someone knocks on the door) I finally got up and took her out, she ran out with the hair on her back standing up. When I got outside to take a look around I looked and saw what I thought was the police chopper, It was a large light hovering pretty low. I went back inside to finish my dinner, however my dog continued to be very upset, so I went back outside to physically carry her back inside. When I went outside I stopped and watched what I originally thought was a police chopper, and as I watched I realized it was something else. The light seemed to grow in size and it shot a smaller &quot;star&quot; out and that star shot out and we watched it glide across the sky, ! it shot north and we watched it until we could no longer see it. It also appeared to have what looked like a streak of grey afterburner smoke under it.Naturally I called everyone I knew to tell them about what I had seen, my brother suggested that I keep my cell phone on me and try to get a picture of it, if it happened again. I decided that was a good idea. I never thought I would see anything like that again, however the next day I had my phone in my pocket, and my dog began to bark excitedly again. I ran outside and looked up and around for a while, then right above me  I spotted a red laser looking thing shooting out of what I thought was a star. At first I thought it was my imagination, but I put my cell phone on video and held my arm up for about half an hour and suddenly I actually saw it again and got it video taped on my cell phone. After that point in the days to come my dog continued to bark excitedly and sure enough when I go outside if I look up in the general direction where she is barking, I almost always get a shot of a &quot;star&quot; shooting a laser usually white sometimes blue and red only twice.  It  has been a! year and I probably have around 60 videos of these things. I can only surmise that they make a sound that we cannot hear but that my dog can hear. Aside from the &quot;stars that  shoot lasers, we also have videos of what looks like 5-6 &quot;stars&quot; and suddenly one &quot;star&quot; like light comes out of the bottom of one &quot;star&quot; and slowly goes up in to another. I keep referring to  the word &quot;star&quot; because if you do not know what you are looking for they just look like stars. It&apos;s my dog that hears or senses something that alerts me to something strange up there. Often times there are three &quot;stars&quot; in the shape of a triangle out there and the two bottom stars of the triangle shoot lasers.I  have been hesitant to report anything because I don&apos;t want to be classified as a crazy person, however I need to report to someone, I know what I have seen and what I have on video.I live in a town where there is a military base, and I sometimes wonder if they are experimenting with something, but I am tired of seeing things, I am tired of my dog getting so upset and I just want to know what these things are.

We for some reason looked up to the night sky to see a disc shaped craft approximately 100 to 200 feet in length and  maybe 50 feet in height.  The craft was very low in the sky maybe fifty feet taller then your average telephone pole and It had several different colored lights circling the craft and several black &quot;windows&quot; around the saucer.  The craft was a light grayish blue color that to this day I have never seen on any aircraft.  It passed over our grandmothers house making no sound at all.  We witnessed it in the front for about one minute moving very, very slowly as if it was studying us.  We then ran through the house to the back yard and the saucer was gone.  I spent four years in the United States Marine Corps working in and around aircraft from several branches of the military.  I have never seen an aircraft that matches the color or metal con! struction to this aircraft.  The saucer appeared to be one smoothly constructed craft something that I have never seen since.  I have seen other things in the sky since then and have heard numerous stories from around this area, even a couple of abduction stories, and was wondering what information if any you guys had on this area.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

As I got to my foyer I looked out my front door and saw what I appeared to be an airplane with its landing lights on. I watched it for about 30 seconds and at that point told myself that this did not appear to be an airplane due to how the lights looked now. So I decided to get my jacket on and just step outside for a momement. Now looking at this object I knew by seeing the lights moving across it and what appeared to be some kind of red laser type of light on the bottom, that looked like it was hanging quite someway away from the lights on top, that this was something that I have never seen before. I observed this for approx. 45 min. At times the lights appeared to be in a cross shape but most of the time it was just straight across with the red light on the bottom. This red light appeared to be going in a circular motion and just not oneway, in some kind of scanning mot! ion back and forth. The light that appeared from this object was white and sometimes blue lights running through the white. There were times that both ends of the light were lit up in blue also. I know this seems crazy but I truly know what I saw and maybe there is an answer. I don&apos;t know but I thought I would at least document this sighting with the first hit I got on the internet.", "Large Square UFO over Car Ahead of Me, on Route #2 Highway, Nearing Moncton, New BrunswickI observed an incredibly large square UFO while driving on the Route #2 highway at 9:57pm approximately 50.42km before Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada.  This was seen for an estimated 30 seconds as it appeared over the car in front of me then carelessly hovered to my left over a forest hill.  Light given off from the horizon of a city behind the forest hill was enough to see the UFO tilt!  When first viewing it over the front of the car ahead of me, I thought of grabbing my cell phone for a picture but did not because I just wanted to see it.  When the spacecraft passed by to the left, I beeped my horn to the vehicle ahead of me, incase he was not looking to his left and I am not sure if he observed anything. I am glad I did not grab my cell phone for a picture as the car ahead of me slowed down after it disappeared onto the hill and I may have hit him.  I know the time of this incident because after it disappeared I instantly grabbed my cell phone and quickly called my best friend in complete hysteria.The engineering technology involved in this was incredible, to have such a huge square object hover in space.  I now do not define a spaceship or spacecraft to be from &quot;outer space,&quot; but rather to &quot;suspend itself in space.&quot;This unknown technology was far more advanced, even in comparison to &quot;Big Dog.&quot;", "Bright lighted object zigzagged quickly and suddenly moved upward out of sight in just seconds.At about 21:23 March 19, 2010, I walked out onto my back porch to smoke a cigarette.  I always keep my porch light off and my kitchen light off with only my dining light on.  I also close the door almost shut to keep the smoke out of my house and so I can see the stars better.  I often look into the sky at the stars which are very visible.  I noticed a very large and bright white light coming in my direction.  I noticed it zigzagging back and forth in quick changes in direction.  I thought that maybe clouds may be causing the illusion of the zigzagging.  As I watched it, I rolled my eyes off it on each side to make certain there were no clouds, there were none (was taught this by the military).  All of the sudden the object moved upward out of sight very quickly.  I could see the light go from very large to a tiny light to nothing at all but with a light trail behind it upward.  Just to make this clear, I served in the Marine Corp and worked with UH-1 and Cobra helicopters both at night and during the day.  I&rsquo;ve been around the flight line both night and day with both rotary and fixed wings.  I did not see a starboard or port light on this object, nor did I hear any noise coming from it.   As close as this object was from me, if this were a fixed wing aircraft I would have surely heard the thrusters especially as quick as it went upward out of sight.  If it were a helicopter, I would have heard the chopping of the blades and there is no doubt in my mind that a helicopter could not have climbed that quickly upward to out of sight in two or three seconds.  The object was coming from the west with probably 15 degrees of it to the north.   Almost as soon as the object excelled out of sight, a plane (jet) of some type flew over my location coming from the south west.  I could hear and see the port and starboard lights on it.  I&rsquo;ve never seen or heard of anything with the kind of speed which I witnessed tonight.

I looked up for a second and saw a strange formation of white, red, and green lights that moved in an odd motion without blinking in the night sky. I first believed it to be a helicopter, but it did not sound like one. The craft moved very slowly, and then started hovering at the same altitude. The craft also made a low, humming noise similar to a blimp.  The problem was that the craft was much smaller than a blimp.  There was only one of these strange crafts.  Scared, I called out my two sons who inferred the craft to be a circular shape because of the light pattern.  The three of us examined the craft for approximately 25 seconds when the craft disappeared in the blink of an eye.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was a clear day, about 1pm, when I crossed 15th Ave. when I noticed a bright glare to the south.It appeared to be a reflection of a plane, but it wasn&rsquo;t moving.  I noticed it was only 20-30 feet above the roofline of the houses along the road; almost buoyant.  It seemed only 100 yards from me.  The center was about 8 feet long, maybe 1 foot in height, and very bright white (like magnesium).  It had light &ldquo;spires&rdquo; extending from the left and right horizontally.Now I thought it might have been a toy rocket (residential area), but it was too bright for that.  The light did not shimmer, twinkle, or shift.  I could not figure out what it was, it did not smoke like a flare or move.After about 10 seconds as I was watching, it just disappeared.  I watched it vanish!

I called the FSS in Seattle and they told me the bottoms of those clouds where at thirty two hundred feet at that time.  So the object could have been that high as it moved under them.  However I did not see the clouds above the object. As bright as the object was if it had been close to the clouds it would have illuminated them.  So therefore I believe the object was less than three thousand feet above ground level.  Possibly as low as a thousand feet agl.", "Brilliant Blue UFO with three levels of lights and one red light on topA UFO sighting with photo and video evidence.  There has to be a rational explanation for this sighting.  I&apos;m sure there is.  And I&apos;m really curious to identify it.I&apos;m in Valencia, CA.  After midnight on March 27, 2010, I came upstairs and immediately noticed a blue light (like a huge glowing LED) emanating from outside the large window in the baby&apos;s room.  Looking outside, I could clearly see three rows of brilliant blue lights hovering low to the ground over the mountains -- perhaps a mile away.  I had an eerie sensation seeing this unidentified object, as I had never seen anything like it before.  The mountains are free of houses or any man-made structures, so it was completely out of place and very prominent.I immediately ran to grab my Sony Cyber-shot.  After taking a few pictures, I tried to take a video, but it was not very clear.  So I ran downstairs and got my Panasonic DVX-100 and started filming with that.  The video doesn&apos;t begin to do it justice, but at least it&apos;s something.  You can see a blue-lit object just hovering there.  From what I could make out, there were 3 rows of brilliant blue lights and one pulsating red light at the top in the middle.  (You hear me describe this on the video.)  There appeared to be slight movement or rotation, but I can&apos;t say that with any certainty.After the camera battery ran out, I watched the object for a few more minutes and then went back downstairs and tried to convince myself that there was a rational explanation.  I came up fifteen minutes later and the object was still there.  Went to bed soon after, so I&apos;m not sure how much longer it stuck around.  Kicking myself for not continuing to watch, but quite frankly, I couldn&apos;t quite believe what I was seeing.  It was only the following morning when I reviewed the footage that it really began to sink in.To be certain, I recorded video out the window at the same time the following two nights, but no lights appeared.  I searched around online to see if anyone else reported a similar sighting.  It looks like there were two other reports on or around March 27 -- one in Tracy, CA and one in Blue Lake, CA.  Specifically, I believe both of those reports also cited the pulsating red light atop blue lights.I have both video and pictures of the object.

It was about 6:30 in the morning, and we had just taken off.  The sky was dark and clear with very few clouds, and it was my second time on an airliner so I was looking out through the window. As we were passing over a town outside of milwaukee, I noticed a large spotlight passing over a few neighborhoods.  The yards and streets that it passed over were brightly illuminated.  You could see the grass in the fields and chimneys on the rooftops and such as they were being lit up as the light was passing, and you could see the outline of the light. I looked to see a helicopter or even a plane generating the light but I could not find one.  I told my grandpa to look over and check it out and he said he didn&apos;t know what it was either.  I was tempted to ask a flight attendant but noticed they were pretty busy, so I just let it go. The moon was out and full, but i&apos;ve never heard of the moon creating such a focused, concentrated light of which I saw. I followed the light up and you could see the light was in a conic, searchlight projection, but nowhere was there anything to be making it.  No tower, plane, or helicopter.  The light seemed to be shining down from about 1-2 hundred feet up.  I followed the light for a good 2-3 minutes and then it dissapeared.  It was sort of making the same path as the plane, except that it had more of a wavy pattern slowly angling away from the plane and it moved very quickly. It came back into sight again shortly after and then it just vanished, like if someone just flipped off the switch.  I don&apos;t know if anybody else had seen it, but it was clearly something strange.

First began at approx. 23:00 with a large, fast moving, blue lighten (6 blue lights), curved, arch like formation over some trees in the distance. 2 witnesses saw this event, the third missed it by a fraction of a second.  About 15 minutes later, a similar craft with 4 lights was seen moving much faster in a different direction across the sky, except this time it was a light grayish-brown shade.  Moments later, in the opposite side of the sky, 5 very distinct, very bright lights slowly glided across the sky.  These lights had a symmetrical formation and moved in and out like a flowing organism.  All three witnesses were taken by the sight, and amazed at the possibility of three sightings in a matter of minutes.  Then, about 10 minutes later, out of the center of the sky appeared two, candle like lights floating symmetrically across the sky, to the edge of the horizon.  Flowing i! n and out in perfect motion. And again these two appeared in the same way another 5 minutes later.  Next, after about 15 minutes of waiting, a single glowing object appeared on the far side of the horizon and floated behind the home, out of sight to the witnesses.  Then, to conclude the experience, 5 very prominent, bright candle like objects, floated very slowly, very low over the home.  They drifted further and closer to each other and seem to have a distinct pattern to them.  They drifted slowly across the sky, and went out of sight approximately 45 seconds after they appeared. the last event was significantly longer than any other sighting of the night.

I recall objects very similiar to these at that time.  I was at the very northern tip of North Center Lake in Lindstrom, MN, watching a 2+ hr fireworks display.  There were approx. 200-300 people that observed the very same thing as there were 100+ people with me on the beach and 60+ large boats in the bay.  These objects were peculiar at first when we all saw them rising from the treeline straight south of us and I recall people calling them UFOs and a few even got a little nervous until them floated a couple hundred yards off to the west of us. You could visibly see outlines of the objects. They were Chinese paper lanterns... a lot of them, 10-12 sounds about right.  They were following the same line of flight and were spaced out about a minute apart (that was the time in between sightings as they rose out of the treeline.)

(CDT)  A gentleman telephoned NUFORC on July 05th, 2008, to apprise us of a sighting that occurred near Minneapolis, MN, shortly after the local fireworks display.  He reported that many people witnessed the event, and that it was quite dramatic in appearance.  The witness is an airline pilot, with considerable experience, and he is a skilled amateur astronomer.  If anyone else witnessed this display of lights, we would welcome additional reports.

The report above may have merit, but we would be a bit surprised if the airline pilot, who first reported the phenomenon, could not distinguish pyrotechnic lanterns from something more dramatic.

There is a racetrack in Crete and I frequently see lights form over that area for no reason.  These are hovering bright white lights low to the ground, they are not helicopters or airplanes.I initially saw two lights that turned into four light in the shape of a triangle but it was not a fixed object because a couple of lights would slightly move out of formation.  As I was focusing in on what this formation was I turned to the left to kind of see behind me as I was rounding a curve and I saw more lights that were bright, white and the same size and they made an even bigger formation.  I was only able to count about 10 lights but there may have been more behind me that I could not see.I had a very unnerving moment where when I looked up at the expanse of the sky it was a complete horseshoe and they were all in a line and just hovered and were bright.  I cannot believe the news did not report on it, I was not the only one on the road - there were plenty of us driving that night.  I have a feeling there were more lights behind me but my vantage point would not allow me to look as I had to concentrate on the road.When I pulled into my driveway, I got out of the vehicle hoping to see a big circle or the entire formation of the lights and half of them were gone.  Then I saw a couple more lights just go out. Then there was nothing. It was incredibly weird and I felt uneasy about it.

I live in a single-family home on approximately 3 acres. The night was clear and cold. I looked up to the stars as I usually do, as we walked in the backyard. Something caught my eye for a moment to the east in the sky. It appeared to be a low flying craft, with a bright light, what I assumed were landing headlights. I see them all the time because my home is situated under a normal flight path for Logan, and there is a municipal small craft airport about a mile from my home so it&rsquo;s not unusual to see several aircraft in the sky along with the nightly stars, so I didn&rsquo;t pay much attention. At that time the &ldquo;light&rdquo; was approximately 15-20 miles away. As my dog was finishing up her &ldquo;business&rdquo; I looked back at the light because I thought the angle of the light was odd. A direction I hadn&rsquo;t seen before so I stopped and gazed up, facing directly east now the light was of a pattern and configuration I! had never seen before, and I watched and waited for it to come closer, as I am in the habit of doing, I like watching the different jets pass overhead again I spend a lot of time outdoors here especially at night, I have a nice telescope that I enjoy using an outdoor fireplace, so the backyards a lot of fun. Anyway as the &ldquo;what I think&rdquo; is a jet gets closer, I start to see odd lights Like on the &ldquo;belly&rdquo; The first thing that came to mind was that it must be some promo like you see at the beach, when planes drag those banners in the sky except this must be something knew, because its like so bright and so BIG and there is 2 white lights and this big red sort of like times square blinking symbol. Of what I have no idea. At this point I notice 3 odd things. One the ozone smell is stronger than I&apos;ve ever smelled, the air seems to be electrified somehow and this thing passing directly over me now is NOT A PLANE, it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve never seen before, wedge shaped, triangular, si! lent, slow, and HUGE, 2-3 footballs fields huge.

I saw an round &quot;shadow&quot; move through the light cast on the clouds.   I don&apos;t know the size because I don&apos;t know the distance but it was the same size as the moon in the sky.   I could tell it was behind the clouds and and it totally blocked the light from the moon.  Once it was out of that halo of light I could not see it any more.  It made no sound.   It  moved through the sky the way a spot light does, kind of a sweeping circle but it was not a light.  All of this happened in about 5 seconds.  I went and got my husband and we both watched for about another half an hour but never saw it again.((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

Three round white lights (like small moons) in a fixed triangle configuration. They did not appear to be crafts. They turned together (around a central point between the three of them / not their own axis) one way (about half a turn clockwise) and then back again over some 6 or 7 seconds approx.  The three then moved quite quickly (a second or 2) to the centre to form the one (same size) circle of white light.  After a few moments it disappeared.  These were not moving across the sky and were crystal clear.

I pulled off the road, my girl friend then saw it and it was about the size of a marble, but a very intense green and it slowed down going north.   It passed behind some High Power Lines and it slowed down considerably, like it was watching us.   Another vehicle came from up behind us and passed us, then slowed down, I think saw what we saw, he had a handlight on the driver sideof his truck and turned it on tried to flash it on the greenlight in th sky.  As he did the green light sped up like it did not want to have the spot light on it (?).  Then it sped up and went north.  The duration of all this was 5-8 minutes.

I apologize for being so far off in my estimation of the length of time I observed the craft in Feb. &apos;09.  Subsequent to my report, (Jan &apos;10), I stopped at the same intersection at approximately the same time in the morning.  The length of time I could possibly have been able to see the aircraft was between 3-5 seconds rather than several minutes.The craft did enter from the right.  However, due to the proximity of the intersection to the overpass and the heighth of the trees at the freeway level I could not have seen it until it was only slightly right of my position.

Both lights were flying exactly parallel with our vehicle, and appeared to be about the size and speed of a small jet or helicopter preparing to land. We quickly discounted this explanation because of the green color of both lights and the fact that they immediately disappeared in what looked like mid-air. After we had turned on to Hwy. 152, we looked back behind us to our left and could see no evidence of a conventional aircraft like possibly a low flying cropduster with lights having landed on the groun! d.

The cabin is in a tiny town located in the Mt Baker Snoqualmie National Forest (outside the town of Granite Falls) in the western cascade mountains of Washington. The lights were very bright and were shining through my window at an angle that would indicate it was coming from the sky and lit up the second floor deck. I got up and went to the window and looked outside and then realized that the entire cabin was being lit up by some kind of a giant spot light.This is very strange as this area is very remote and there is no electricity. The other strange thing is that there was no noise at all, as I first assumed that the lights were coming from a helicopter or plane I listened to see if I could hear anything and I could only hear the creek running outside.I can quickly dismiss the lights coming from a helicopter, plane, or any type of nearby machinery because of the remote location of my cabin in this little town. The lights disappeared just after I got up to look out the window. When I got up, the first thing I thought about was that there was a search helicopter hovering around, but as I said there was no noise or rumbling at all. The light on the cabin was very large and bright and was not wavering around, it was very still.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was traveling slowly in the westerly direction, as I was traveling eastbound on Schoenersville Road in Bethlehem.  I noticed the shape coming towards me in the sky as I sat in my car at a red light.  As it came into view I realized that it was not a jet flying at a high altitude, but a substantially smaller craft.

We were then looking upwards towards the Eastern sky when 3 dim but distinct white lights forming an equilateral triangle flew overhead at high speed on about an 80 degree Easterly heading.   No outline of a craft was visible.The lights each had appearances more like that of illuminated rings rather than being solid, and the intensity of each ring was about that of a medium star that is easily observable.   If there had been street or yard lights nearby, they probably would not have been visible.  I definitely feel that they were all on one craft of some sort as they did not vary in distance or orientation to each other at all.  As for the size, the palm of your hand would have covered them all with your arm extended.  The diameter of each ring was approximately 25% of each leg of the triangle.  They had already passed overhead when we spotted them at about 75 degrees above the Eastern! horizon.  I&rsquo;d estimate that they traveled 30 to 35 degrees of the sky in 3 to 4 seconds before we lost sight behind the trees and roof.  The wind was calm and we heard absolutely no sound.   This craft had just went out of sight, when we spotted a single ring of light of the same magnitude and speed following a parallel path slightly to the south.  It may have been slightly larger than the other rings.  Or lower?   My initial gut feeling was that these lights were traveling at an altitude in excess of 10,000 feet with a speed in the thousands of miles per hour.  I have no way to know what the actual altitude was, but they did not appear to get smaller or less brilliant as they passed, so that indicates to me that they were of significantly high altitude.What appeared to be an airliner was almost directly overhead shortly after the rings and the lights on it were much brighter and the speed was slower by many many times.  The temperature was 12 degrees and the stars were bright and crisp, so even thought they were dim, the rings of light were very distinct and stayed at the same intensity for the brief time they were visible.Added 1/27/10:  My date read the above and agreed on everything other than she said she thought the rings were visible at least 4 seconds.   I  feel the speed could have been  15 - 20,000 mph if the airliner speed was 600 MPH.((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF REPORT))&quot;4 Rings of light accompanied by 1 ring of light&quot; should have read: 3 Rings of light accompanied by 1 ring of light((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

They didn&apos;t move much until we were on our way back to Boone. One of them skimmed the horizon, hovering, drifting, close to the mountain tops, before zooming off into the distance. We drove up to Deep Gap to sky watch, which is where we saw the third.  It was so bright.  I could make out an eclipse of light that hinted at a spherical, not saucer shape.

They colors were green, red, blue, white, and maybe a few others. I knew it was not an airplane as it&apos;s flight pattern was not as our planes could do. It would raise altitudes and go from side to side at such great speeds our planes wouldn&apos;t stay intact.

I first noticed a very small, faint cigar shaped object going by at a relatively steady speed in between two stars, my first thought was it being a satellite, and instantly told my girlfriend who was walking with me to look upwards, she had some trouble seeing it as the object was relatively above us, and there were no objects in the ground to help give an idea of its precise location.  After a few seconds she managed to get a small look at it, before her eyes gave way and got teary, making her look away and loose sight of the object.

It wasn&apos;t too late, being a school night.  From a distance, my mother and I thought that it was a blimp preparing for an emergency landing.  When we drove closer, we realized it was actually two ships.  They were larger than cars, maybe 15 or 20 feet radius.  They looked like what you would see in a Hollywood movie: disk-like or saucer shaped.  The center seemed more spherical.  They reminded me of pewter or stainless steel - a dull shine.  There were lights going around the outer edge, although now, we can not agree on the color.  The lights did not shine down on anything.  I didn&apos;t see any seams, doors or windows.  I remember getting out of the car and thinking that it was all true...all the reports that had been made at that time of sightings in our city. The two ships were just above the two-story homes in the neighborhood.  They made no sound.  I remember only hearing the strange buzz of our street lamp.  It seemed like one ship was following the other, just above our street, just above roof level.  At first, I got the impression that they were trying to hide from us...they went down one street, them came back into our view...maybe they knew we saw them and came for a closer look at us.  I had run into the house and got my father, then the three of us were now out standing on our front lawn with our dog. The two ships slowly rotated, or maybe the lights were revolving around their perimeter. I took a step forward, thinking I would be one of the first humans to meet these visitors...but my father said, &quot;Stay right where you are.&quot;  And being only 13, I did.  I wasn&apos;t afraid, but the tone in my father&apos;s voice scared me. We watched as the ships slowly went down the street, one following the other.  They were over the elementary school I had attended, and for a moment I thought that perhaps they would land there.  But the leader seemed to move forward - like a slight pull or jerk - and then shot off to the right with a streak! of white light.  The the second one did the same thing.  They were gone.  We went into the house with our groceries, and I wanted to call the newspaper, or maybe the police...My mother looked very concerned and my father just said no.  He didn&apos;t want anyone to think that we were a bunch of nuts.  The next day, at school, I told my science teacher what I had seen.  He listened respectfully, since I wasn&apos;t the type of kid to be speaking up and never known to lie.  After a few minutes I kept asking him what could fly like that, without sound or air movement or anything...just gliding along like a boat on water.  Of course he said there wasn&apos;t anything and then I could tell he didn&apos;t believe me and some of my friends were looking at me kind of funny....so, I knew what my father meant...&quot;Some kind of nut.&quot;  But it really happened and it certainly peaked my interest in science, especially astronomy.

The ufo passed over and all I seen after it was around 50 yards away from me and around 15 foot in the air was a very bright light in the sky then it just dissappered   I have never in my life seen anything like that.  I used to never look up  into the sky, but now I do.  I told my love ones they didnt know what to think and I dont either.  I know what I seen.  The ufo had NO windows in it so I was wondering how they could see where they were going.  The ufo had no sound at at all that I could hear.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

All lights were moving together; looked like a very large craft.", "five glowning globes over waukesha,wiAround 7:30pm i was heading to my mothers boyfriends house to pick her up,i was parked outside. She came out a few minutes later and then we went on our way a minute late i spotted tho lights in the sky,on our right. Just a note we live in a normal small city,normal housing, plenty of people,but not a big city with skyscrapers.There were two light in a straight line there appeared to be on the same craft. The object was moving at a fast pace, there were airplanes in the sky around that same time and compared to this object they were going very slow. As we were still driving home which is a ten minute drive, we saw the object again but it added three more lights and they were traveling together in a slightly curved shape. Me and my mother were scared and we were close to home. The rest of the way we just kept looking forward and as soon as we reached our house we dashes to the door.", "triangle over south bendI was driving west on 80 90 (toll road) in Indiana. I was at mile mark 74 when I looked at the sky it looked like it was around mile mark 72.  I saw a two big lights pointing down  I did not know what this was.  It was just standing still then it moved south about four miles in a matter of two seconds, at this point I saw the shape of the object it was triangular shape.  It kept on moving south then it took off it disappear.", "Large white light surrounded by flashing red/green lightsOn Friday, January 29, 2010, at 2:20 in the morning I walked past our sliding door and saw a large (6 times larger and brighter than Jupiter) light that looked like a giant star, very bright just above the eastern horizon. I could see a little bit of twinkling like you sometimes see around a star, but could see some red color. I got the binoculars to look and this large white center light had pulsing green and red lights the whole way around it. It was just above the tree line on the horizon. I ran to get my camera, took a couple pictures inside and tried unsuccessfully to get the flash off.  I went outside on the deck and took a couple of pictures of it. All of this took about ten minutes. The entire time it remained still.I ran upstairs to wake my husband who came down. He looked out through the sliding door and said it was gone. However, when we got out on the deck, beyond the roof, we saw it again about 10-15 degrees higher in the sky, still not moving, just staying still.  It started to move fast toward  our house. When it got close we could briefly hear a humming noise. When I could no longer see it from the deck I ran inside and out the front door. Just that quickly it was completely gone. We live in the country with no outside lights so the sky is dark and visible from one horizon to the next.The red and green lights were not airplane lights as we see those fairly often.  These lights totally surrounds the bright circle of light and were all flashing.The picture that I took shows groups of lights that look like they are hooked together with lines. The numerous lights, although not colored, are fairly accurate. The lines, I think, are from my not holding the camera completely still.  The picture was taken with a Kodak digital and only shows a faint light in the center of the picture. When I put it on the computer and zoomed in you could see different lights.We have lived here since 1969 and have never seen anything like this.", "very close encounter with what i truley cant imagine The ufo that I saw and experienced was a disk/saucer shape that at first appeared to be a ball of radiant blue/white light.  That then turned into a saucer shaped object hovering in the sky it moved back and forth from north to south emitting a very high pitched sound as it got closer and closer.  It was metallic silver in colour with blue and white flashing lights it shined a very bright energy field and light beam at me.  From there I have little to no recollection of what happened with 3 hours of time missing and a few short flashbacks. I awoke with various lacerations bruises and markings all over my body my nose was bleeding and I was sicker to my stomach then I ever have been and I feel/know that have had a very close encounter only with who and what is beyond my wildest imagination and I would really like some answers.", "Fast black UFO.I was looking at the plane going towards the sun. Right behind it there it was going real fast. It was black. Not sure of shape. There were thin clouds but I saw it before it went into the clouds. I got a picture of it after it went past the sun.", "Red blue green and white light slowly floating randomly within same area, disappearing and reappearing brighter and dimmer at times.Last night my girlfriend and I had my cousin and her boyfriend over as well as my girlfriends best friend and her boyfriend.  I had never met her friend before which made the night extremely weird. &quot;Hi nice to meet you, come check out this ufo in the sky!&quot;  My cousin, her boyfriend, and myself were standing out in the freezing cold last night smoking cigarettes and talking about life in general, when all three of us suddenly got silent and began questioning what was visually in front of us.  It was a bright white light high in the sky with six smaller lights blinking around it on both sides, six total.  There were only three other colors besides the white light in the middle.  RED BLUE GREEN, RED BLUE GREEN.  That was the pattern.  At times it would move farther away making it appear as one bright light.  Every few minutes it would begin to move around very slowly but then return to sitting still.  This took place for around two hours.  After I built up the ! self esteem to go inside and tell the others what I was witnessing thats exactly what happened.  They came outside and it only appeared to be a very bright star.  They began to laugh and give us funny looks when the light completely disappeared for three or four seconds only to reappear bright and flashing the pattern of multi-colored lights again.  We stayed outside observing for nearly three hours stunned in disbilief at what we were witnessing.  Im not saying it was a ufo I do not know what it was.  I am 22 years old and the five people with me were all between 22 and 26.  None of us have ever seen something like that before and when you witness something like that it is truly disturbing in a sense, it makes your spine tingle.  Shortly before the object went away two planes circled within the area of the object but would not get very close.  I just hate not knowing something and I really wish there was an explanation to what we witnessed.  I certainly never thought I wou! ld be sitting online typing this but i don&apos;t know what else to! do.  ho pefully others around the area saw the light also and they will hopefully talk about it as well.", "A bright light hovering in the southwestern sky.I woke up around 1:00 A.M. last night.  For some reason I glanced out the window, and noticed a large bright star and it caught my attention.  It was blinking with different color lights; through a pair of binocs you could hardly look at it, it was so bright.  Well i noticed it moved then stopped. It would hover then move again.  It didn&apos;t seem to have any set direction.  I woke my brother up and he was stunned at what we were watching.  While we were watching my dad heard the commotion, and being a skeptical man, he was dumbfounded at the object.  This object was in the southwest sky.  We couldn&apos;t hear any noise from it.  The object continued this for a couple hours until I went back to sleep.  If anyone could please tell me what this may of been I&apos;d be obliged.  It was quite an alarming thing to watch it hover then move then hover again.((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius.  PD))", "Pseudo sunrise / sunset at 03:30Dury military war games I had the midnight watch. I woke up my relief at 03:30 and told him to come out and watch the sun rise. I can best describe it as a band of light that reached from the left to right horizon. It traveled across the sky until the entire sky was light. It was twilight - light enough to read by, but not daylight. I could not see a source for the light. The entire sky was illuminated equally. There was a gradual lighting until the entire sky was light, and the a gradual darkening - much like a sun rise and sun set. It took approxametly 15 minutes for the entire event. I have heard of a similar incident, on the History Channel, that had been reported by Christopher Columbus.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))", "It was around midnight  I had woken up to a humming sound , and bright orange light that was moving back and forth outside my window. There were dogs barking from somewhere down the street and my radio that had been previously off kept was kicking in and out, I went to my kitchen window to look out into the back yard. I had no sooner reached my window when there was a loud bang. The light disappear and the dogs that had been barking quieted down.In the morning I went out into the backyard to look at my window I found the screen a couple of feet away from the window it had been ripped off it&apos;s frame.", "Driving south on Florida Turnpike and noticed a strange &apos;fireball&quot; with a tail falling to the earth very slowly. Thought it was a plane on fire crashing. Then before it hit the ground, it seperated into 4-5 objects and flew in different directions and different angles but relatively horizontal.  Objects looked to be moving at different speeds until we could no longer see them.  This occured in homestead florida, near homestead airforce base. Unless this was a military exercise or an air show, I have no other explanation.", "It was a typically hot Summer&acute;s evening in Gibraltar.  I enjoyed walking my dog and on this particular day I had chosen a relatively quiet area, where Scud, my dog, could run around freely.  This area is known as the lower southern plateau, at the very tip-end of the Rock, from where you can see the Mediterranean Sea to the East, the Strait that divides Europe from Africa to the South, and the Atlantic Ocean, which lies to the West.  I remember sitting on the edge of a cliff and was facing the Mediterranean Sea.   Although the reader may find it difficult to believe, I felt compelled to look in the general direction of a natural elevation (the edges of the Upper Plateau) that stood behind me about 120 metres away.  Over this elevation you find a military enclave that includes an enormous and conspicuous white spherical radar.  There, I saw this metallic round-shaped craft, hovering motionlessly and making absolutely no noise or sound whatsoever.  It just stood there for nearly an hour, above the radar at about 75 feet from the ground. Suddenly, it vanished as if it had imploded.  The next day, GBC TV showed footage of an enourmous baseball shaped craft, from where a small sphere descended into a nearby Spanish oil-refinery and then slowly climbed up again only to vanish seconds after.  Interestingly, there had been a wildfire on the Rock that was put out only one day before my particular sighting. Thank you.", "Bright lights and fast moving object!I was in the front of the house when I saw a rectangular (almost square) flying object with rows of bright lights, going from north to south very rapidly and it disappeared, there was no noise coming from the craft. I live in a farming area, I have a field next to me and surrounded by trees, called the Redlands near Homestead. Upon seeing the object I called for my family to come out and my sister in law got to see it also.", "We seen two orange lights in sky which other people who were in a different part of town seen 6 orange lights.Me and my husband was driving down the road when I saw two slowly moving bright orange lights in the sky.  I asked him to look up..   He seen the lights as well.  I was pretty sure they wore moving yet my husband says they were staying still. when I came home my mom asked me if I seen.. I interrupted her and said the glowing orange lights in the sky?   She said yeah and that she was talking to her boyfriend who explained he and a friend seen 6 orange lights in the shape of a pyramid that were slowly moving.  So 4 people in different spots of the same town seen the almost the same thing.  There were clouds in the sky which were brightly lit up glowing orange.

However, after I stopped walking to get a better look at the object, I realized that it wasn&apos;t moving, but rather drifting ever so slowly, and at times, it would remain stationary.  I stood staring at the object for a number of minutes trying to decipher what it was that I was looking at.  I thought to myself, is that a balloon?  I just couldn&apos;t figure out what it was that I was looking at.  It was just a sizable black object high in the sky, about the size of an aircraft, but shapeless.  It didn&apos;t make a noise, or have any lights, but it did seem to have a whitish hue or ambience to it at times.  After a number of minutes staring at the sky, I said to myself, I must look ridiculous, so I decided to move on, not to mention that my dog was ge! tting very impatient.  I probably wouldn&apos;t have thought much more about it, but what happened next is what dictated that I report it.  I looked away for only a second or two, probably took three or four steps, and then glanced back up at it, but it was gone.  It simply disappeared.  I immediately stopped again and stared in disbelief.  It was nowhere to be seen.  There were planes flying all over the place, but no black object.  I searched the sky for a number of minutes, but it was gone.  That&apos;s when I started to question the reality of what I just witnessed.  What did I see?  There has to be a rational explanation.", "Just a large round silver disk and acorn type craft hovering low in around the center of Deming in around 1965I was about ten years of age.  Early in the morning my mother went out to hang clothes, she describe an acorn shape object flying low among the tree tops, it did not make any noise.  It flew about fifty to one hundred feet from our home.Soon afterward, we noticed a large, round, silver object hovering steady to the west of our home.  It was at a stand still for nearly three to four hours clear as can be.  It was very large.  Right in the middle of Deming, n.m.  Then three fighters jets came out of no where and began to approach the object.  To my surprise it went from a football field dimension to a pin in a spit second.  The jet aircraft split in three directions and suddenly it just vanished.  I cannot find anything on this.  My father and mother and four of my siblings witness this object for hours, it was very large, I cannot understand how this was not witness by the whole city?

This peaked my interest and I went outside to check, but saw nothing. I returned inside and a few minutes later, the infrared cameras picked it up again.  I then inspected the perimeter of the building and searched up and down the adjacent streets; it was then that I noticed a bright red object to the NorthWest of my location.  It was above the cloud deck and was not a planet. Note that Mars was on the Solar Planar and visible to the East and other planets were obscured by cloud coverage.  I hopped in my truck and felt compelled to investigate this object.  As I headed around my block and onto Hill Rd.  I continued to keep an eye on the object, which was descending and/or getting brighter.  Having seen MANY objects similar to this one over the past 9 months, I was very calm and prepared for almost anything.   But this was different.  I traveled no further than 8 blocks and traveled up a dead end street to the north.  All lights in the neighborhood dimmed, my truck lost power, and I was mesmerized as this Red Light became a shape. It descended even closer to me and literally came to within 100 Meters from my vehicle.  I pulled out my cell phone and began filming it.  The video details far more than what I saw... I saw a Red Craft maneuver from at least 15K feet altitude to 100 meters in front of me in 3-5 seconds!  I found myself face to face with something that looked like it had retro-rockets on it, and then an EXTREMELY bright light that it shined into my face, causing nausea, mild confusion and a severe headache.  I&apos;ve seen at least 100 unexplained objects in my life, but based upon my background, training and desire to not jump to conclusions, I&apos;ve never reported one before.  This one is different.  It sent a message.  I feel ill right now and have what appear to be radiation burns on my fingers and symptoms of radiation sickness. The video when viewed  frame by frame, along with my narration, details a few seconds when the craft seemed to generate a &quot;plasma-like Orb&quot; and then swirled it around and shot a beam at me. Close analysis by my Dad and I found at the same moment, the glass of my vehicle warped, and I stopped talking, lost my bearing and then regained focus again. It wasn&apos;t so much that the object seemed malevolent, but rather that it was aware of my presence and allowing me to film it, yet at the same time, it felt like it was telling me to leave.OBSERVER BACKGROUND: Observer is a 41 year old College Educated Computer Engineer with 16 years experience, as well as P.O.S.T.
