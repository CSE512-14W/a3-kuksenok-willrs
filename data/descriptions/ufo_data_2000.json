["I was looking through the window of my bethroom, watching the plains that flew by in the night. Suddenly I saw a bright orange licht that was floating behind a row of trees. While I was looking at it it began to accelerate till I lost sight of it. I don&apos;t now what it was, but it was surtenly no normal plane. bethroomAll details were naimed in the above mentioned description.", "My Grandmother and I were going home on Hwy 51 in Southaven, MS when I saw a flying disk, metalic in nature move through the sky.My Grandmother and I were returning from the Walgreens on Hwy 51 at Bullfrog Corner.  We traveled south on Hwy 51 to the four way stop at the intersection of Church Rd. and Hwy 51. As we traveled south from Bullfrog Corner, I noticed a strange shiny light in the sky. The disk, metalic, moved from right to left, like a bee dancing. I watched for a few minutes to make sure. I informed my Grandmother, because I was that sure it wasn&apos;t a plane. She could not figure out what it was either. It moved in a southernly direction for a second. A green plane moved through the sky beneath the disk. The unidentifed object moved closer and then disappeared in the direstion of the plane. Down Church Road in that direction, in the woods, are large radar dishes fenced off from the road. A small airfield is at the end of the road.", "While driving west bound on Route 17 near Rock Hill, New York, my wife,son and myself saw a triangle shaped object moving across the highway diagnaly. The object was moving toward Pine Bush NY roughly.The object moved with very little sound, just a whisper of air movement but now large turbine or motor sound. It was dark but there were lights on all three sides of the object allowing to see that there was a center and it was solid not small planes flying in tight formation as the militatry sugests. The duration of the sighting was about one minute. Traffic was slightly heavy for that time of year and I did not have a camera or camcorder with me so pulling over was necessary. This object ot me was not a normal plane or like anything I have ever seen. I am not convinced it was full of little green men (but not oposed) but  it was not a plane or conventional aircraft by both visual or audio recognition.", "It was a partly cloudy night in April 1997, the thursday following Easter Sunday.  My two friends and I were hanging out on the roof of my college apartment.  Two of us were lying down staring up at the sky. I saw this rather bright object in the sky between a break in the clouds.  It was blue in color and aparently stationary.  I thought it was a star. It then slowly disappeared as if it had &quot;winked&quot;.  My friend was evidently looking at the same object.  It then &quot;winked&quot; back, and we could see the light again.  It &quot;winked&quot; off, and then on again. Then it seemed to shoot off in a southwesterly direction.  I have no idea what it was.My summary description basically states all of what I had observed.  Being that I perceived the object to be simply a blue light high in the sky may seem a bit obscure as far as descriptions are concerned, but that is simply what it appeared to be.  Because I was in the middle of town where street lights abound, I do not beleive that either my friend or I could have resolved the object any more so due to the interference of the extraneous lights.  Pertaining to the observers, I would consider both of us to be at least highly open-minded individuals.  I, myself, have always had taken interest in supernatural/paranormal phenomena, although I cannot remember experiencing close encounters in my past.", "Spotted strange pulsing light flying at a high rate of speed north to south.Considering the proximity to the airport, I was hesitant to make this report.  However, being past this airport so many times, and never having seen anything that could explain this, I decided to.  It was a somewhat overcast night, and the lights of the town and airport were visible to my left as my girlfriend and I drove north on Interstate 95 towards Orono.  I noticed a flashing out of the corner of my eye and turned to see a white pulsing, circling flash moving VERY quickly across the sky in a southerly direction.  It pulsed intermittently, looking very much like a strobe but a bit slower.  It was out of site in only a few seconds, but the speed it moved at was not explainable by normal aircraft, nor was the strength of the light.  There was no plane attached to the light - just the light.  I saw a plane not a few minutes before that.  I told my girlfriend to look, but it was already out of site and she discounted it.  It was apparently close, only a few hundred feet up and it moved by flashing along, sort of in an incredibly gentle U-fashion to the south.  It was over a small line of trees and the town of Bangor.", "Large object, possibly a meteor or space debris flew into view in the southern sky, between Cornville and Phoenix, Az .Large object, possibly a meteor or space debris flew into view in the southern sky, between Cornville and Phoenix, Az .  Cornville is about 80 miles north of Phoenix, and 20 miles south of Sedona.There was a full moon that night, so the stars was hard to see, but not this object.It appeared to be very close about thirty to sixty miles away. It was very bright like a meteor but 500 hundred times brighter and closer. Even considering it was a full moon.When it descended below the tree line I lost sight of the object. One second later it then appeared to hit the earth.  At the time of impact there were two bright burst of light, from what appeared to be the point of impact. No sound was heard. It was Truly Breathtaking.  I have not heared any news reports about the incident.", "A strong light, a blue object, no noise, traveling south to north.After hearing Mr. Davenport on the Art Bell program I thought I should pass this on.  On or about 4-22-98 but definitely around 2130 hours, something illuminated my backyard as well as the entire area.  It was much like lightening but of shorter duration. I looked to the east and saw a round, blue object which instantly changed to red.  The object was traveling south to north at a high rate of speed with an altitude estimated to be 1500-3000 feet.  The downward descent angle I would estimate at 25-35 degrees.  There was no noise and the entire incident lasted 2-3 seconds.  I have not found another person who witnessed this incident.

Nearby small airport has planes usually flying nearby, thought it was one of them.  Roaring became louder and sustained over three minutes, so looked out West window.  Sky was overcast.  Observed three blue-white strobing lights similar to aircraft strobs in the following positions, indicated by an astriks and periods.  &quot;  *      .                .  &quot; The top left light would strobe or blink and the two bottom lights would blink off, then they in turn would blink while the top left would be off.  The sequence repeated in regular cycles of approximately one second.The window was opend.  Tempeture was near 25 degrees.  Roaring sound could be heard comming from the direction of the lights.  Secon witness was called (wife) who watched for a minute, commented that that can&apos;t be a plane since it was not moving.  In fact, lights were stationary.  Got out 7x35 binoculars but could not detect any observable shape.  Distance from one light on left to one on right was eight inches at arms length with naked eye.  Brillance of light was similar to venus and hour after sunset. As I watched, noticed lights seemed to be drifting due west.  Continued watching for nine minutes  as they indeed moved away at an incredably slow speed.  Just before dissapearing behind foortops in the distance, noticed the top left light drift or rotate towards the center light, then slightly back.  Then lights were out of sight. Third witness , 83 year old mother, heard loud roar and went from window to window.  She lives 4 miles due west.  She is hard of hearing but thought a truck was outside or something. Called Cuyahoga county airport at 22:30 to ask if any military craft was in the area, negitive response.  Called Cleveland Hopkins airport tower and received same respose, but was advised to call FAA the next day. Called FAA on 2-16-95 sometime in the late morning and reported what was seen.

Object was silent, immobile, and when I glanced down and then up (2 sec.) it disappeared.It was morning, around 9 AM while I was going to work.  I had stopped at a red light and glanced upward to see a cigar shaped object, @ 500-1000&quot; up, could not tell how big this was, perhaps 100&quot; in length.  It was very silvery, almost white, with the sun glinting on it.  There were no markings, as would be on an airplane.  No windows, no doors, no colors, no wings or fin.  It was completely stationary.  I stared at it for several seconds, trying to make out if it was an airplane.  It was completely silent and not moving at all.  I then glanced down to shift gears, then looked back up. It was gone.  This glancing down could not have taken more than  2 secs and when I looked up, it was gone.  I frantically searched the sky for it, thinking if it was an airplane it could have moved.  It was no where to be seen.  The sky was cloudless and bright blue.  Never found it again.", "Triangle shaped craft with three brightwhite lights and strobing colored lights dropped items behind treeline formed into one light and disappearedI was siting at a stop light and noticed what I thought was a plane out of the corner of my eye, when I looked at it though it was moving so slow accros the sky that it would have to be some distance away if it was a plane but the lights were so large that it had to be close.  I looked at it more carefully, it was three bright white lights in a triangle shape at a slight angle, lights strobed from red to green across the body of the craft then it changed direction and headed away from me, when the light went green I followed it, I only had to move 10 miles per hour to keep up with it.  It disappeared behind the tree line and I thought I saw it drop two or three objects (bright lights) but I can&apos;t be sure, it emerged from the tree line, strobed again then disappeared back under the tree line, when it reemerged it was a single white light, it then once again passed under the tree line and I lost it after that.  Not moments after I noticed an unusual amount of helecopters in the sky.", "We  (my wife and I and our 4 children) were headed south on Interstate 75 when to the west we saw (my wife and I) what appeared to be two craft, or other flying objects (I thought they may be too small for occupants), flying in a pattern much like two buterfly might but much faster.  They went up and down and covered a good distance in moments.  Then the larger of the two objects seperated into three and kept flying the same errratic flight in the same tight pattern that the two had made initially.  I stopped the car to see them better and did not see them again.  I am a school teacher in Ft Myers FL who has more than a passing interest in UFOs but cannot say for certain that I have ever spotted one before this.  My wife is a housemom.  What was odd about this was the length of time we were able to watch this. Because they were in constant motion and never kept one side facing us for any length of time it was hard to get a good look at the shape.  The closest description I could give would be spade shaped.  There were no lights or trails and the color appeared to be be between gray and black.  I heard about your site on Art Bell&apos;s show and hope to hear something about this there.

I looked out my window, and I see about 3 UFO in a diamond formation, hovering.  And I look at the street lights, and they start dimming low and would light back up at about 3 second intervals.", "It was flying over the top of the truck I was driving, &amp; there was another one off in the distance. They Looked Like flying Merry-go-Rounds with blue &amp; white irridescent lights.", "I first noticed a long, thin, sort of cigar shaped bright white light slowly moving W to E behind my house. Upon looking out the window that was gone but, after several seconds 3 lights just came on, about 150 or 200 ft. up. They were in a triangular formation, the front being yellow, one red and one green. These lights made several odd manuvers and never flashed or blinked; we are realatively close to Port Columbus so, I am used to seeing airplanes and helicopters yet, I have never seen anything like this.The long, bright white light was odd because it seemed to be close and flying very low,( 20-40 ft.), and even though this was a very intense bright white light it cast no light on surrounding objects. I could see the trees in my neighbor&apos;s yard silohetted against the light as it moved across the neighbor&apos;s yard. This object was about as long as the first joint of your finger,( from the tip of your finger to the first knuckle), held at arms length - as I sat about 22 ft. from the window that I saw it through. The triangular shaped object that I saw after I got up and went to the window appeared over the intersection of Morse &amp; Westerville Roads at an altitiude of about 100-150 ft. and headed due North, in my general direction. Once it got slightly North of Morse Rd.,( which runs E &amp; W), it banked slightly and headed west, the whole time going about 25-35 mph. The object traveled West until it was 200 ft. or so past Westerville Rd. then, came to a stop rotated 180 degrees and began flying back East at about the same speed as before. When the object got back to where it origanally began moving to the West it suddenly got a burst of speed like nothing I&apos;ve ever seen and made a U-turn that seemed to take it slightly higher and its own width to the South. This U-turn was one of the main things that made me stop and think &quot; Hey this is not a helicopter or airplane&quot; because, just last year I went to the Dayton Airshow and saw how fast these modern millitary planes can accelerate. Let me tell you nothing I have ever seen could do this- not to mention the g-forces this manuver would have exerted on a pilot would have been more than any human could ever stand. After this abrupt U-turn the object immediately returned to its previous snail like speed and continued on to the West. As it got about 300 ft. or so from Westerville Rd. it slowly turned to the South South West and as it made this turn all the lights instantly turned red but, there was no blink or flash as though I was seeing a different side of the object, the lights just simply switched colors!!!! After the object had changed course and color it just flew at the same slow speed out of my field of view to the Southwest. This triangular object seemed to emmit a wide, highly despirsed light at about a 45 degree angle, from the front yellow light- this light is totally different than a normal search light on a helicopter. It also seemed like there was a triangular shadow inbetween the lights so that since the sky was overcast the clouds were slightly brighter than the object itself- so, it was possible to make out the shape but, there was only a slight hint of it. The object appeared to be an equilateral triangle of about 50-75 ft. per side. I also stuck my head out the door during the sighting and heard no sound, other than the usual traffic sounds, and there was no change in the object&apos;s appearance.", "object was flying from north to south.at arms length a silverdollar would have been the size.no noise,very low.2 large lights on bottom.solid object,til lights detached,one flew NE one NW.It was 10:30pm sat.(last-nite).I was laying on the divingboard, looking up at the sky.the sky seemed extra clear except, one large mass of low white cloud directly above me.It was long semi-wide and streched N to S.I was watching the cloud shape shift and change forms due to the wind.Then directly above me and a little to my right(north).I don&apos;t know if it caught my eye or just appeard.Below the already low clouds this large triangler object flying from N to S was at arms length, I approximate the size of a silver-dollar.The corners were all rounded.I was lookinging at the underneath part of the object.There was 2 very large circle lights.They did not glow like a light,the only way I can explain it is like the nite-lights you put in your house,the ones with the plastic white covers,how they look with light shining through them.That the closest I can explain how these lights glowed.The object itself was brown.It was below the white clouds so that allowed me to get a good clear look at it.There were no other lights whats so ever on the object.I stood up and started screaming my fiance&apos;s name,yelling look at this what is this!It continued to fly towards the south,about the speed of a jet,then as it got a ways to the left of me(south).I still had a good view due to the size,,it seems the end of the cloud may have hung lower than the rest of it, but was thinning out density wise.

Chased by two Ohio Air National Guard F-16&apos;s.On or about 02/15/98 at approximately 23:35 Hrs. I observed a large Charcoal gray to Black UFO. This craft was slowly traversing the sky from North East to South West at between 1000 to 1500 feet in altitude. There was a very low more felt then heard rumbling coming from the craft as it moved. It was approximately 100 to 150 feet long, and 100 feet wide at it&apos;s widest point. There were three strobing lights shifting from dull green to bright blue on this craft. One at each of its three tips. I would estimate the crafts origanal speed at between 150 and 200 MPH. This sighting took place within hearing distance of the local Airport extimated range to the airport is from 3 to 5 miles maybe more. As I spent 21 years in the military I know the sound of Combat Aircraft as they take off under full military power with after burners. I heard two Ohio Air National Gaurd F-16&apos;s take off from the Toledo Express Airport and head in the direction of the Unknown. Both F-16&apos;s passed directly over head I could clearly see they were both armed with two each AIM-9 Sidewinder Air to Air Heat Seeking Missles. As the two F-16&apos;s approched the craft it looked to me as if they were attempting to get a weapons lock. The large Unknow suddely increased it&apos;s speed to well over supersonic but without the resultent sonic boom. It then tilted upward at I would say an almost 90 degree angle and continued to excelerate. Both F-16&apos;s attemped to stay with and chase the craft but they were quickly out distanced. I continued to watch as they both broke off persute and circled back returning to their base at Toledo Express Airport. Again I state that the craft made a very low possibly subsonic rumbling sound that I felt more then heard. I would discribe it&apos;s shape as the same as the expiremental XF-16XL the Cranked Arrow (An expierimental Delta wing configuration of the F-16 Fighting Falcon.

The V shape also moved across the sky at a constant velocity.

Then I realised that I was in the middle of Texas and the lights of the nearest town were not even in view so it was unlikely that anyone was sitting in that field setting off a single bottle rocket. Also, it was too big and travelling downwards from left to right trailing sparks behind. It was a baseball sized ball of green light trailing yellow and reddish sparks. So then I assumed I saw a meteorite, although I&apos;ve never seen one before, but I thought it was weird that I did&apos;nt see it hit the ground.  I was listening to Art Bell a few hours later and heard all sorts of reports about similar sounding sights, except I had felt that this was smaller and closer to me.  Of course, in the dark it&apos;s impossible to tell, but now I suppose that if it was actually very far away, that would explain why it disappeared, if it was falling behind a distant hill.  The land was pretty flat but there were a few hills. I&apos;ve seen shooting stars, but they are obviosly as distant as stars and in the upper sky, this was definitely within the atmosphere.

After obseving the lights for a couple of minites we both ask each other if the other had noticed the lights. They were moving parallel with the power line and would soon be very near to us. At one time a beam of light shinning towards the ground came from one craft.We both became very frightend and I cranked up the jeep and drove hastily out of the treeless area and parked about 50 feet in the woods. We both grabbed our guns. I had never been so scared. I was shaking. I turned off the engine and rolled the window down. Looking straight up I saw one of the craft had moved straight above us. It was about 60 feet above the tree tops. The bottom of the craft looked very different. I recall a triangular pattern of amber lights with some long neon tube type lights also. The craft hovered above us for a few minutes. It made a continuos shhhhh sound. I thought we were about to be ether dead. But the craft moved slowly away keeping the same altitude. Fear left us as we figured, if the craft wanted to harm us it would have when it was above us. Our mood changed from complete fear to courisity. We put down our guns and ran into the opening under the high power lines for a better view. We noticed one craft had stayed back in stationary flight position while the other craft made a circular horizontal flight pattern which had taken it over the jeep and near the club house where the only other people where for a 10 to 15 mile radius. The roving craft returned near the stationary one and both hovered for a few minites. They both looked like to very bright spherical lights aganst a very star filled night sky.No blinking lights where seen. Then as we looked on hoping they would take us for a ride, they both shot silently into the upper atmoshere like a shooting star in reverse. This event blew our minds. We did not tell anybody for a couple of years. I was 16 years old at the time and my brother was in his mid 20&apos;s. He was a private pilot at the time. He knew the craft where way below stall speed for a conventional non helicopter type of flying craft. I think they used some type of EMF propulsion system.", "I was working as a DJ at WCLG in Morgantown WV.  I am sorry I dont know the date and am sorry that I am now reporting a 9 year old sighting.  But I finally found your website.  I started getting alot of calls about lights in the sky.  Between songs, I looked out the window and saw them too, creeping slowing across the sky, almost like a blimp, but with many colors, green, red, white, etc.  Continue at full description below...So I watched this large thing with flashing lights slowly move across the sky north of Morgantown West Virginia.  I am undertain of the exact date but I think it was on a warm fall Friday or Saturday night.  The lights were almost in the shape of a triangle, like a fat arrowhead.  They were not perfectly outlining the object but instead appeared somewhat at random.  The object would be stationary, then rise, and then move forward slowly again.  This went on for about 20 minutes.  I even announced it on the radio and I got even more calls from people who also saw it.  Finally, I went back to the window and it was gone about 20 minutes after I got the first call.  That is it.", "One light approached from the SE.  Another approached from the N.  Approached one another in close proximinity.  Did not come together.  Passed each other, barely, then stopped.  Altitude was very very high.  The light that approached from the North remained stationary.  The SE light changed direction and headed North.  It began to zig zag, then stopped, paused for a few seconds and then sped off really fast to the north, then just blinked out.   I don&apos;t know what happened to the other. I was to intent on watching the one moving.P.S.   The northern bound light turned red while zig-zagging, then back back to white,just before it sped off.((NUFORC Note:  Satellites??

At first I didnt know what to think and I started to get nervous,..... as I waited my heart began to race in anticipation to what this could be. As it drew closer I knew that this was something not of this earth ,because of the strange glow it had and how perfectly its color matched the stars, triangular in shape bigger than a C-5 military cargo plane and no sound..

They were strangely foggy in appearance but moved independently.  No craft visible.Returning home from work on March 7, 1998, I turned east on Bullard Parkway off 56th street in Temple Terrace, Florida.  My attention was drawn to two bright white lights aboput 30 degrees above the horizon and visible in my windshield.  They were strangely out of focus or hazy.  They moved independently from one another, i.e. they tilted.  Each was more or less formless, but also strangely each seemed to have a shaft of light pointing down as though each light was fastened to the bottom of an aircraft and pointed straight down.  But the shafts of light were not vertical cylindars, but truncated cones of white light.  Neither pointed down very far.  I estimated that they were less than one mile away and perhaps 2000 feet high, given their brightness.  I became concerned tgaht I would drive under them and lose sight of them, but it did not occur to me to stop off the highway and get out to look up. As I drew closer they were higher in my windshield, so I moved forward against the steering wheel to keep them in sight.  Before I reach my turn off the right hand light faded and disappeared, then the second light faded and disappeared.  They were rather peculiar, so I was at first reluctant to tell my wife, but I finally did before we went out for the evening.  I checked the sky as we left home about 7:30 but they were not to be seen.  I was relieved to see a haze in the sky then, as that would explain their foggy or out of focus appearance.  On the other hand the cloud layer was much to high to have had an effect.

As we descended from Hancock&apos;s Summit, I noticed a light skirting the ridgeline that surrounds Area 51 to our left several miles in the distance.  We took app. 8 minutes of videotape of this object.The object is reddish-orange, and appears to be a typical disc-shaped UFO turned on its face.  At first I thought the camcorder was out of focus, but later in the footage, half of the object is clearly obscured by the mountains.  The object was a minimum of 13 miles away (I need to get a detailed map of the area with correct scale to figure out an exact minimum distance).  The object blinks, changes in luminosity, disappears and reappears, gets enormous, moves a great distance to the right and back again in an instant (although this may be camera motion), moves quickly to the right and disappears.  The object&apos;s structure is readily apparent in the video:  a disc with a ring around the outer edge, and a darker &quot;hub&quot; in the middle. I was shown another video clip of the same object in Rachel the next day--much better quality, but without the mountains as a frame of reference.  There are four groups doing analysis on my tape, and the footage will be posted on my website and several others when analysis is completed.", "Object moving slowly down a row of homes. Crossed boulevard and disappeared over warehouse. drove under it thinking it a police helicopter dowing surveilance.  Very disturbing and panicked when eyes met driver of on coming traffic who witnessed same.Ok, so it bothers you&apos;re web site doesn&apos;t make any mention of this because it was in the local paper the following day as having been witnessed by a cop patroling Milwaukee Street.  Anyway as for my experience I was coming home from the Univ of Wisc Madison&apos;s library and it was late and very cold out.  I pull up to the light going northbound on Johnson Street (just past Tenney park near the police repair shop and old paint warehouses) and about 15 feet above the roof of this house down Johnson Street on my right is this thing.  It was black, but appeared illuminated - kinda dim like - underneath.  I didn&apos;t think much about it. Thought it was probably a police helicopter searching the neighborhood for some East High School punks.  But it kept my attention cause it wasn&apos;t really a spot light eminanting shining down into backyards.  Also it didn&apos;t have any blinking helicopter like lights on top.  What ever it was doing it was moving slow, steady and smooth and kept following over the row of roofs.  From what I could see it look like a rounded off van with a fat base.  My light changed and I started on my way about the same time the &quot;helicopter&quot; finished with the roofs and was headed across the street.  Alot of observations started coming real fast as I approached to go under it.  It was about 15 feet off the ground.  It was uniform in its black color but had definite seams. No windows. The one distinct feature I remember the most was a cross like seam (real pronounced like) on its belly.  This is about when all the contradictions started pooring in.  First off, there was loose snow - if it was a helicopter how come it wasn&apos;t kicking up snow?  And the bushes in the boulevard - they didn&apos;t twitch like they were caught in any chopper wash either.  I remember shutting the heater off and coasting without the gas peddle down so I could hear the helicopter.  Helicopters are noisy but none of the houses had woken up, and I wasn&apos;t hearing anything and I was right underneath it. And I felt kinda funny passing underne! ath it.  The car reacted like it was mildly buffeted by helicopter wash and I can recall kinda of a slow down.  And something was wrong about the illumination it was casting down. The light was dim but clear and the shrub branches kind of reflected like hotdogs under a heat lamp at the gas station.  So I realize now somethings fundamentally wrong.  I take my foot of the gas and this thing rises slowly to pass over the warehouse just beyond the oncoming lane&apos;s traffic.  I&apos;m borderline freaking out and so this guy in this big vanilla colored older model chevy (the kind that seats about twenty) is coming at me in the oncoming traffic lane and he&apos;s got his face like smashed up against the windshield over his steering wheel looking real hard at what ever the thing was.  And he gives me this blank big eyed look.  After that I this wasn&apos;t right and went  right into an adreniline pump that kept me pacing when I got home for at least a half an hour.  The next day it was the newspaper being reported as mussing around on the far east side.  I really try not to talk about this.  And if I&apos;m not sure I think I entered this same experience into this web site before - it feels good to say something.", "Recentlt while attending a house party that friends of mine were hosting for Memorial Day Iwas invited by the host to see something strange that appeared overnite on property adjacent to his home. He led another friend of ours along with myself through a small thicket of trees to a clearing just beyond a small baseball field. what we saw was the strangest thing, an almost perfect circle measuring approximately 60 or 70 feet across burnt into the ground. The ground looked like it had been boiled(for lack of a better descrip tion). the trees that had been there just disappeared, no charred hulks you would normally would find after a brush fire,just gone. the wildest though is the soil that exsist today is almost looks like lava but very brittle wich is completely out of character of the surronding soil. in fact the ground dirt is only a couple of inches thick due the fact that this location is on top of a large granite ledge.

Completely blackened and traveling at about 35 miles per hour, no lights and no reflection other than off the upper edge of the fuselage.I was anchored in tarpon basin which is just off the howard johnston restaurant and adjacet to the tower which placed the tower north by east of out boat.  This was in jan 1996 just prior to crossing to the Bahamas.  I got up to check out the anchor and went on deck as it was a clear warm night,looking up I noticed a line of white being reflected in a diagaonal formation to it`s line of travel looking and traveling somewhat like a flight of birds. A split second later I realized that it was a hard edge reflecting light back towards me ,but not down.  We sailors always have binocullars available so I was able to get a better view immediately.  Being 50mm lens and having good light gathering ability I was able to see the bottom somewhat,; it appeard featurless. At this point I called Connie on deck and gave her the binocs and she was able to see it also. At this time it was impossible to see with the naked eye.  I again watched it go slowely to the northwest  until it completely  blended into the night sky. It was easy to judge the hight and size due to it`s close proximity to the tower.  My background as a private pilot and having built and flown my  own planes and ultrlights allowed me to judge the speed.

I was looking almost straight up. The rectangular shape had clearly defined edges. The long part of the rectangle was oriented east/west. I looked back at the shape several times in the next few minutes. I always located it quickly in the same spot. It looked like a patch on the sky. There were other spectators around, but none with binoculars. I didn&apos;t mention it to anyone, because the demonstration had everyone&apos;s attention. After a few minutes, I became very concerned that there was going to be a violent accident with the ultra light aircraft, because the pilot was trying aerobatics in the flimsy craft.

I was flying into the DFW metroplex on the evening of January 30, 1998. It was a clear night. At approximately 6:50 local time, I noticed what appeared to be a very bright star above and slightly to the right of my course. This object was very high and accelerating, albeit slowly. I thought that it was a meteor, at first. I noticed its acceleration and gave extreme notice. It was then that I noticed the second object ahead of the first and traveling in the same direction (north). The second object was much smaller and less bright. Both objects moved to within a few degrees of directly north. The first object began a slight, curving turn to the left and began to fade away ( as if to move into the earths shadow ). A few seconds later, the second object faded from view and with no turning noticed, as with the preceding object. They disappeared in the reference vicinity of two stars to the distant left and &apos;below&apos; teh orion constellation. I notified a friend who was behind me by some miles in his aircraft (40 - 50 nm). He remarked that it was probably an aircraft, given the large number of them in the area. This was not possible. I have seen aircraft all of my life. These objects had none of the characteristics of aircraft and were either in the extreme upper atmoshere or in space. They looked very similar to satellites moving overhead. This is unlikely, in my opinion, due to the fact that the first object began a slight, parabolic turn to my left. Approximately 2 minutes after the initial sighting, the objects reappeared in the same fasion as before. They moved in the same fashion and direction as previously noticed. The smaller object was in the lead, as before. I noticed them this second time directly above. They moved in the same direction as before in almost an identical path. The fact that I saw them a second time is why I am writing this. If these objects were satellites, they would not have been seen twice, moving in identical fashion along the same route. During this second sighting, the! re was no turning motion seen. They were directly in tandem and some distance apart. My friend behind me observed the same phenomenon and stated that he saw the objects turn slowly to the right. I did not observe this. I did observe that they &apos;faded&apos; from view in virtually the same position as before. They were not seen again. Approximately 2 minutes after the second sighting, I queried ATC to the effect of &apos; did they see two objects very high directly above Dallas aand at extreme altitude&apos;. The response was &apos;negative&apos;. I have a question for my reader-Does the space shuttle move south-north? Is it capable of retracing its path in a very short time, in what must have been a large distance? Can it turn in orbit to appear to be curving to one side? This is the only possible solution I can give.

While leaving for work on a crisp, cold, clear, starlight morning I stopped before entering my jeep. Above, against a starlight night, I saw a green-white orb traveling southeast through the sky. It was twice as bright as the North Star, soundless, and traveling half as fast as a shooting star--much faster than any plane I&apos;ve ever seen. There were no other navagation or strobe lights on it. I was alone and thought it odd. I felt no strange paralysis or anything like that; I just watched it fluedly traverse the sky in one straight, quick, silent slash then I went to work. I only saw this one object. It seemed far away, high in the sky, much too bright to be a star, and much too fast to be a plane. I&apos;m a well educated person and a realist. I don&apos;t know if there are any spooky grey beings out there or what our government is testing. But I know I witnessed something I&apos;ve never seen before and I thought you should know about it.", "A large white light, moving from north to east.I watched this large white light come closer to me as I set on back of pick-up ,in the yard .I was a little scared when I first saw it, but the longer I watched it the more scared I became, because it getting closer and I felt as if it was coming after me. I was so scared I jumped in the truck and took off, I didn&apos;t stay around to see where it went. It was not of this wourld. I am a mature 19 year old farm girl who isn&apos;t afraid of much.

The fireball was moving to the west, and disappeared over a hill to my right.The object looked like a green fireball, with a long tail. I was travelling home on the freeway named above, and looked up just in time to see this green fireball.  I thought it was strange, since it was big enough to be very close, yet it did not die out, like fireworks would do.  It just kept moving towards the west, and then disappeared over the hill on my right (out of view).  There was one other person with me in the car, but that person was talking and did not see it.  It did not give it any more thought, until I turned on the Art Bell show, and heard a lady in Seattle call in and describe the very thing that I had just seen. I know the time was right about 9:10pm, because I had just left a store in the University District, and the travel time to the point of observation was about ten minutes.", "While driving south on Route 53 with my brother, we were exiting a thunderstorm.  Leaves, trees and branches were moving violently.  It had been raining hard.  It had stopped raining.  As we were coming up on a plateau where a silo, cow barn and cow field are located, we saw a light hovering above the cow pasture.  We saw this light at 1/4 miles from plateau.  My brother and I watched the light as we approached the plateau, not saying anything. Almost like we were in shock, I mentioned &quot;What was this?&quot; He acknowledged the same.  We sped up and started approaching the hill to the plateau. As we came to approximately 100 yards, the object started to move. It had been hovering approx. 75-100 yards above the cow pasture. The object was round and orange-yellow in color. It was maybe 5-6 feet around. There was no sound.  It took off and sped toward the ridge.  I sped the auto to app. 85 mph to catch up.  I was flashing the lights of the auto and blowing the horn.  Personally, I felt as if our metallic presence of the auto was making the object move.  It moved as we made our closest point of approach.  Unusually, the object stopped at the ridge.  It could have been our perception, but it appeared to stop before going out of sight.  I had stopped the car and got out and yelled at it.  I told my brother that if it were extra-terrestial, then I wanted to meet them. My brother and I travel down into the valley to cross another ridge. I had presumed that if it did land, then it was on top of the hill. We went down into the valley and lost sight of the object. My brother became terrified to go up on the hill to look for it.  As we looked for something, I had felt that something was there and maybe it had landed. My brother did not want me to get out of the car.  I did and I felt a strange sensation believing that there was something outside, possibly that this object had landed. This was many years ago in the 70&apos;s in approx. 1977 or 78.  I would have cast off this sighting as something not worth mentioning but my brother had another sighting of the round object recently.  He delivers newspapers in the early morning before dawn.  I will get more info from him if you want. I did not see it recently but I always remember the sighting.  I just got out of the Navy and I never knew where to report objects.

We had just finished looking at this home and were outside looking up at a lot of gnats just twenty feet in the air, when my brother-in-law said look! I said yeah I see the gnats, but he said no, farther up in the sky. Then I focused my eyes much farther up and saw a small silver sphere which hovered in one spot.

We were traveling in 3 seperate vehicles and traveling betwwen 10 -15 minutes apart. We noticed some lights moving strangely in the sky, and as we watched them we were going up a very steep hill on I-25 and as we came to the crest of the hill, and to the point where we could see the valley below, we were presented with a scene that brought us to a stop in the middle of the road.  It was like a scene from a movie,the valley was filled with light and ships-they were at 500-600 feet off the ground.  There were at least 8 vehicles pulled off the road that we had seen, with people standing out and looking up at the craft in the sky.  We were between Rye Colorado and Walsenburg, Colorado.

They moved in and out of the range-as we were in front of the front range of the Wet mountains. Two helicopters and two fighters approached from the direction of Norad or maybe Ft.Collins. The helicopters and the jets stayed mainly on the perimeter of the objects, which at times were in an area of the sky, of about a mile.  The two main objects were orangest and the smaller ones more yellow. The objects were moving south at a very slow rate and seemed totally unconcerned with the helicopters or the jets.  The smaller objects did manuvers unlike anything we had ever even imagined and the seemed to glow and blink at each other as if enteracting. They moved at times together and then other times apart.

Base Disclosure&quot; planned an all-night long research event on the nights of Jan. 30th and 31st of 1998. In an area known for unusual UFO activity, the researchers set up their equipment on an isolated hilltop near the Bradshaw Ranch (which has been featured on the TV show &quot;Sightings&quot;). One man driving a Jeep Laredo, and a married couple in a Suzuki sport-utility eventually joined our party, and we built a camp fire as we gazed the night skies. The first sighting came at dusk, with a few stars beginning to show up. An object, descending from the east, was spotted. The object was bright white in color, approximately 10,000ft. in altitude, and about three times the size of Venus. It seemed to be a solid object. Adjacent to the object, at an est. distance of 1,000 ft. was a smaller object traveling synchronously with the larger object. We all witnessed these objects travel for about 1 minute, until they disappeared behind 6,500ft. Bear Mountain (3 miles to the east of where we were). The objects were very unusual, and did not look like any conventional aircraft. The second &quot;sighting&quot; was witnessed throughout the night: a bright light flashing numerous colors was seen low on the horizon near Camp Verde, a town about 15 to 20 miles south of our location. The light was quite clear, thus suggesting that it could not have been very far away (maybe 20 miles in distance from us). The light, when first seen, was moving up, and left and right slowly. Then it ABRUPTLY vanished. The light would then reappear in the same location...then it would eventually vanish. This activity went on throughout the night. The light simply was not an airplane due to the bright blinking colors it emitted, what&apos;s more, the light was not located near any known flight path for airplanes or near any known airport.

About 5 - 10 minutes before landing, I was watching attentively out my window when in front of the aircraft, at about the 2:00 position in the sky, I saw a metalic silver and navy blue disc like object.  It was about 2 feet high and 2 feet wide.  It may seem odd that it was disc shaped with these specifications, however, it was almost as if it were segmented.  Imagine a disk about 8 inches with squared off sides sitting on top of another disc about 16 inches wide, sitting on top of another disc about 24 inches wide.  Under the 24 inch wide disk sits another 16 inch disc and under it another 8 inch wide disk.  The top and bottom and each side were symetrical. At first I though it was a bird, but a couple seconds latter in came into clear focus as we flew only about 200 feet away from it.  It was on the right side and roughly the same altitude, about 4,000 feet.  I am familiar with altitude as I have about 20 hours of flight instruction.

(Thickness of fingers).9:46 pm, Mar 20, 1998. I went out side to get something out of my truck and heard Geese flying over.  I was looking up, blocking the house lights so I could see better. Some times when geese fly over at nite in the dark you can spot them in the city lights glare. As I looked somewhat to the west I thought I saw some comming over me going east. But as the lights from town hit IT,  I could make out a perfect triangle.

But the harder I Iooked, the more I realized it was a solid shape,  not a &quot;V&quot;.  It looked dark gray or black with only reflected light illuminating it. It continued east untill it was out of the glare of the city.  I continued to watch that direction to see if it blocked out any stars momentairly,  but it didn&apos;t, (that I could tell).  When it was directly overhead, it didn&apos;t pass over any brite stars, to block them out.  I couldn&apos;t tell how high it was but it was 2  1/2 fingers long.  That is, the thickness of my fingers at arms length.

Just here a few second...then gone.", "It was triangular in shape, but hard to describe, because of so many different angles.Well, it was not my plan to report this, because I have never in my life seen something like this, and figured no one would believe me.  After listining to the Art Bell show last night I figured &quot;why not&quot; so here I am.  I work for a hospital in the Portland area.  I start work at 2300 hrs and usually arrive around 2245 hrs.  On this night I pulled into the parking lot, and began my short walk to the engineering shop where I work.  I am not sure why, but I just happend to glance in the sky, and I saw this object traveling across the sky at an increadiable speed.  It was not real high.  I would say about 500 meters up.  It was solid black with a strange triangular shape with a lot of sharp angeles.  It had no lights on it at all, and made no noise what so ever.  It traveled from the south to the north, and went from my field of view within 3 seconds or so.  It gave me the chills because I know I did not imagine what I just saw.  I was able to see it because there was a heave cloud cover this night, and the city lights put a white glow on the clouds.  When this solid black object came across the sky, it was not hard to miss against the city lit clouds.  This object was fairly big.  I would say about 75 to 150 feet long, so it appeared to me.

I wake up at 1630 hrs each day.", "Large elipsoid object (greenish hugh) hovering and slowly moving forward just above the treeline (approx. 150 feet) in Los Gatos foothills.I was eleven years old.  Standing on my driveway in the rustic Los Gatos Foothills with my younger brother (9 at the time) and neighbor (16 at the time).  We were talking... then both of their mouths fell open.  I turned to see what was going on.  A large elipsoidal object (about the size of a 1/4 mile running track oval was hovering toward us (very slowly) just above the sycamore trees (approx. 150 feet).  We all stood in silence and awe for a minute as the object moved almost directly over head. I ran into my house to get a camera.  Here&apos;s where it gets weird... .  I asked my mother for a camera (we had two olk kodak&apos;s in a drawer) and she forgot where they were (my mother knows exactly where everything is in her house, she&apos;s meticulous like that)  I went to the drawer where the cameras were and pulled one out.  My mother stopped me saying she didn&apos;t know if it had film in it.  I thought it did and took it and ran through the house to go outside.  (It gets weirder now)  I ran through the television room where my father was watching a rerun of Gilligan&apos;s Island (he never watches the show, doesn&apos;t like it much, BUT it was MY FAVORITE SHOW)  I had the thought that the object/UFO was now gone and sat down to watch the show (which I had seen many times before).  When the show ended... I saw that I had a camera in my hand and couldn&apos;t figure out why.  I thought hard and knew that there was something &quot;really important&quot; that I was forgetting.  I remembered the UFO and a wave of terror came over me.  I ran outside to see if it was still there. I found my younger brother and neighbor exactly where I had left them.  Only now they had been joined by two other neighborhood kids (I believe 18 and 19 years old at that time).  The UFO was no longer there.  I asked where it went.  They asked &quot;where did what go?&quot;  I said, &quot;The UFO, where did it go?&quot;.  They said &quot;oh, that, it took off real fast, but that was a while ago&quot; (all four of them saw it leave). I find it odd that they shrugged it off as if it was no big deal. A few years later I was with my mother in a local shopping mall.  I went into a bookstore to find her.  The book &quot;Communion&quot; had just come out and wsa displayed in the store.  I literally was scared for my life when I saw the cover... I was terrified that the alien on the cover was going to kill me.  Now, I&apos;d never seen a picture of a Grey up to that point in my life.  And I had no idea that it was an alien.  Non-the-less, I ran out of the bookstore and sat outside for 1/2 an hour scared to go back in and see the image of the alien. Was I abducted?  I don&apos;t know. All I know is I saw that UFO (or at least something without wings or propellers)  when I was a kid.  And I was terrified of the picture on a book cover.", "This is an investigative report of this sighting report from your webpage. Carlisle PA sighting of a formation of lights - 3/27/97 I have investigated several similar reports from the Carlisle area.  There  is a club of ultra-light plane pilots operating from a small airport nearby. They like to play UFO games, and also fly formations.  The fact that the lights reponded when the witnesses flashed a flashlight is a sure giveaway.  Also, this sighting was near twilight.  Ultralights pilots are not licensed.  They are not supposed to fly after dark, but have lights for twilight.  They use Visual Flight Rules and almost never fly flight plans because they return to the same field from which they took off.  They are too small and fly too slowly to appear on radar screens, if at a distance are noiseless (or if the wind blows the wrong way) and may seem to hover, particularly if flying into a headwind.  I have been told by a member of this club that &quot;If you want to see a real UFO, you should see us turn our spots on and fly IN A CIRCLE,&quot;  and he roared with laughter. How to identify possible ultralight formations: 1) the &quot;leader&quot; effect, wherein the lead plane (as with birds) moves around, but the others seem to be steady because they have someone to guide on. 2) unequal number of lights on each wing of a VEE (even number of lights or planes) 3) seen in twilight (although illegal after dark flights are sometimes made) 4) motor noises (but only if very close) 5) usually no motor noses, particularly if at a distance 5) slow or hovering 6) respond to lights or signals from the ground. Investigators should seek out local flying fields on a nice Saturday and make friends with pilots.  They are good sources of info, but be careful you don&apos;t give them any ideas. Conclusions: These sightingswere most likely ultralights. PS: I once spoke to an ultralight pilot who told me that in the ealry 1980s he belonged to a flying club which operated out of the airport at Stormville NY.  They even called themselves &quot;the Martians&quot;.  He said a pix of their formation once made the New York Times.  A 1984 investigative article in Discovery magazine concluded that they were small planes.  He said that the small plane pilots also also tried UFO hijinks, with spots and Christmas lights, etc., but he said the &quot;real Martains&quot; were the ultralights.  They stopped doing it after literally thousands of commuters were stopping on roads and they were afraid they would be heldl responsible for traffic accidents.  These were the stimuli for the &quot;&quot;Hudson Valley UFOs&quot;.  Of course, once people started looking up, they saw UFOs everywhere. There is an incredible amount of air traffic in the NY metro area. Delgado and Hynek&apos;s book &quot;Night Seige&quot; dismissed the Discovery explanation with only a couple paragraphs, yet included sightings with &quot;UFO motor noises&quot;, no radar contacts, &quot;hovering&quot; etc. This book can&apos;t be taken seriously because of its dismissal, withouht much discussion, of the Discovery investigation. My acquaintance related this story to me and then roared with laughter, &quot;Now everybody&apos;s doing it&quot;, he told me.", "TRIANGULAR SHAPED OBJECT MOVING TOWARDS ME THINKING IT IS A AIRPLANE I WAS LOOKING TO GET A GOOD LOOK IT WAS VERY LOW HEARD NO SOUND FLEW RIGHT OVER ME MADE NO SOUND WHATSO EVER AND DISAPPEARED INTO THE NIGHT SKY BLACK TRIANGULAR OBJECT ", "The craft first caught my attention by it&apos;s size and lack of noise since the Sudbury airport is so near.The object appeared to constructed in segments along it&apos;s length(130&apos; approx).It&apos;s shape was odd in that though cylindrical it&apos;s ends were well like the ends of a bean.I was only a 1/4 mile away as it overflew Hwy 69 heading north @ 400&apos;alt 40-60kph.It ever so slowly stopped dead, pivoted directly east and proceeded directly to the radar domes @ CAFB Falconbrige in plain sight which was part of the Pinetree line(NORAD) in those days.Somethings you never forget like just how casual this thing behaved.Not long after it was&apos;nt visable anymore a CP airliner 4 engine turboprop came just a howling along the exact flightpath of that...that whatever it was.I&apos;ll never forget what I saw in the afternoon sun.WOW.The overall dimensions 130&apos;long 35&apos;wide 30&apos;high.The construction appeared to be 9 or 10 segments of a stainless or aluminum material as it refected the sun which was on my left while the craft was on my right.No doors or openings,no lights or appendeges,no noise.It&apos;s flight was at a constant slow speed throughout the event.When it stopped and turned it happened very slowly approx 20-30 secs with no change in altitude.I was the observer and  was 14yrs old.I had my first helocopter ride when I was 3yrs and had flown in many aircraft in fact I had spent that summer working at a fly in fishing camp.You Know it depresses the the Hell out me that the goverment isn&apos;t more forthwright.If a little guy like me Knows..... whats the problem.I&apos;m presently a member of the CAF", "seen 2 gold circular shaped lights in northeast  region of sky.

Not Fireworks...4 intense glowing green &quot;Stop-light&quot; type orbs holding tight diamond formation.  I just left home on my way to driving 35 miles to SLC to a radio station(I was a late night DJ and needed to be there by 12:30 am).  When driving eastbound on south end of town, I spotted the 4 described orbs hovering maybe 1000 feet over the Oquirrh mountains (approximately directly over Kennecott Open Mine Copper Pit).  I pulled the car over and assured myself I wasn&apos;t seeing a reflection on the inside of my window.  (I moved to various areas of the window, and also rolled down my window and looked outside, the orbs remained stationary).  Even though this was 4th of July, these were definitely not fireworks, as the tight formation hovering continued for somewhat over a minute.  Then the orbs flew in tight formation in a very horizontal direction to the north, following the mountain range.  Apparently the orbs were either in the mountains or in the Salt Lake Valley, because as they flew northward at an extreme speed, they dissapeared behind the mountain range.  I am unaware of any reports on this, but I was on my way to a radio station and broadcasted my sighting on-air and requested further reports to be called in.  I didn&apos;t receive any comments, so I may have been the only one who saw this.", "My wife and I were on our deck watching the fireworks display at Webster Groves Recreation Center, about a mile from our location. A bright light shot across the sky and lit up our entire back yard. It was going from east to west.                    A brilliant white light appeared from the east, traveling in a westerly direction. It turned the whole area bright as day for a few seconds. It did not make any sound. this happened about 9:30 in the evening.", "A friend and I had just dropped off another friend in a suburban neighborhood.  My friend was driving, and I was in the passenger seat.  It was a very stary night, and the sky was completely clear.  We were coming upon an intersection where I saw a red, glowing object hovering over a corn field in back of a house across the street, in the left corner of the intersection.  I alerted my friend to its presense, where upon he accelerated in order to get a closer look.  As we neared the intersection the object began to move parallel to the road that we were traveling on.  I had my head out of the window.  The object seemed to be silent.  It maintaned a steady altitude of maybe 300-500 feet.  It then crossed the road in front of us, while gaining altitude, and then traveled off in what appeared to be a southwesterly direction.It was difficult for my friend and I do accurately estimate the distance between the object and the ground when we first observed it hovering.  It was oval or egg-shaped and glowed red. It seemed to emit an aura of sorts.  When I think back to this experience, due to the behavior of the object and the apparent absence human activity, I do feel as if we had surprised the object when we came upon it.  When it did cross in front of my friend&apos;s vehicle and continued to ascend into the atmosphere I believe that it did so to a certain point at which it stopped and once again hovered.  Because I followed its path with my eyes, I could see its ascension, but eventually the light ceased to move.  At this point I observed that the object did not appear to change in size, as it would if it were continually moving away from my point of observation.  In addition, the intensity of the red light it emitted did not change as it would if it had been moving away in a continuous manner.  At that time it appeared to me as a red light &quot;camoflouged&quot; amongst the spectrum of lights present in the sky.   Although we try to remain skeptical, my friend and I had never before experienced a ufo encounter of this nature.  We are both highly interested in the pursuit of the truth underlying this type of phenomena.", "A glowing green sphere, with a white rectangular light behind it, emerged and then streaked westwardly.  As it streaked it slightly grew in length.  The next day in Cicero Il., I witnessed the same sphere.  It also streaked westwardly.  Both instances were somewhat like a shooting star.  But was much closer and the streak was wider than one would see with a shooting star.I had just got out of work and was waiting for my brother to pick me up.  I glanced up at the sign on our store front when I noticed a green sphere begining to streak up above.  As it was streaking, it left a white trail behind it that elongated as the green sphere advanced.  Then suddenly the sphere gained velocity and vanished.  Upon gaining speed, the white tail shrank and dissapeared along with it.  I have seen shooting stars before but never like this. I was curious as to what it was.  It appeared not to be in the immediate atmosphere but instead just outside of it.  This occured thursday morning at 12:25.  On friday as, I was walking with a freind, we were talking as I glanced straight ahead and saw the same sphere streak by ahead of us not above us.  Like the first instance, it also headed west and lasted only 3-5 seconds.  This second instance occured at 9:30 p.m. .  I could not believe that I was seeing the same thing I had witnnesed a day earlier.  My reaction was that of amazement and reduced my ability to react.

I had a strong feeling not to discuss this sight with anyone, as interesting and astounding to me as it was.While riding home from middle school in the backseat of a Volkswagon Beetle I was gazing out the rear window of the car when I saw a silvery perfectly round object that resembled a full moon rising steadily against a gray overcast sky.  There was no rain occuring, just a dry overcast gray day.  At that time, I was thirteen years old.  I knew that what I saw was not a weather balloon, due to the fact that my father, a small aircraft pilot, had taken me numerous times to the local airport to view weather balloon launches, and I was very familiar with all that weather balloons involve, both visually and mechanically. While watching this object for about thirty seconds, I felt that I was not intended to see it, and I made what I felt was a conscious decision to never discuss what I had seen.  I noticed the object ascending from the East, and I watched it with apprehension until the vehicle in which I was riding turned a corner and went down a hill towards my home, and my view was blocked by landscape and trees..

I brought a super high powered flashlight that is used for my fathers boat.  My cousin was flashing it in the sky pointing out different stars that we could see through the clouds.  This might have attracted them who knows.  Throught the whole thing I was amazed at it and perfectly calm.  Next week we are going to sleep out again w/ cameras and if any thing happens i will write back.", "I saw a fireball fall from the sky.I saw a white fire ball come out of the sky at about an 80 degree angle. The fire ball was about as big as your finger nail with arm extended. This white ball had a tail following it. In the middle of the white ball was blue. Like the color of natural gas burning on your stove. I looked like a shooting star, but was too close to the earth and too big. I live in the northwest part of Houston. I was sitting in my garage, looking south- southwest when I saw it. I didn&apos;t see where it came from, it appeared and fell to the earth very fast. It dissapeared behind the house across the street. I&apos;ve never seen something like that before. I thought it was a plane crash. Nothing on the news untill I heard your director on Art Bell&apos;s radio show last night.", "Bright fluorescent blue-green object, flying very fast East to West, in Southern sky. No noise. No tail, but very phosphorescent. Called Renton air traffic control tower. Woman on duty had seen object too. Described it as flying across whole Southern horizon, no noise, &quot;glowing&quot;. Wondered if anyone else had seen it, as I was her first caller about it.See summary description.", "Going down the road I came up to a turn with a Sub station off to the left the UFO hovering above the sub station with a light fog around it then it flew off with incredible speed. The UFO was a bright blue floresent light like a sauser shape. Then after it whent off it changed to a floresent green color.story above", "I glanced skyward and saw an object moving extremely quickly across the night sky. It appeared as two points of light, seperated but traveling uniformly. The object materialized, traveled very quickly on a straight path, then disappeared. I confess that the object was quite faint.The object was two points of light, seperated by just a degree or so. The lights appeared white in color and kept a constant level of brightness.  The two points of light were obviously traveling as one unit as they moved across the night sky. I just happened to look upward to admire the night sky when I left a restuaraunt and noticed the object moving on a southeast to northwest path. Within 5 seconds, the object vanished as quickly as it appeared.  The object never came near the horizon. I recently graduated from college with a degree in Sociology.  I took an Astronomy class in college and consider it somewhat of a hobby of mine.  I have seen countless shooting stars and this object was very different from anything I had seen in the night sky before. It traveled way too quickly to be a jet and there was no actual &quot;streak&quot; as is commonly observed with meteors. The intensity of the lights remained constant until it disappeared.", "Summary : Saw a very large (size of a school bus) bright light wide triangular shape in the sky hovering above a nearby mountain. Then second craft about a mile above us racing over our heads at an incredible speed that came to a dead stop unlike any aircraft.It was Saturday morning 1/24/98. The time was 5:45am. It was unusual I was up so early (for some unknown reason) after having a long 15 hour work day. I was wide awake so I turned on my television and sat on my couch when I noticed a peculiar bright light in the corner of my eye coming from my kitchen window. I got up from the couch to get a closer look and it did&apos;nt seem to be moving. It was a very large (size of a school bus?) bright light in the sky just hovering above a nearby mountain (apprx.4 miles away). From my distant view the light was clearly shaped like a very wide letter &quot;A&quot;. I immediately told my wife who first thought I was teasing then responding with a jump out of bed after my unsettled behavior. She quickly acknowledged this was definetly no plane, no helicopter and  no weather balloon. We both ran outside to get a closer look. I then called my brother who lives next door, who joined us with his 3 children aged 12,13 &amp; 15. All eyes were totally glued to the sky for a good 2 hours as the craft very slowly ascended. It&apos;s movement was so slow it took the 2 hours for the craft to become just a speck in the sky, at which time it came to a dead stop. It was about 10 minutes later after the craft had stopped that we then were alarmed by a second craft about a mile above us racing over our heads at an incredible speed that I have never seen before from any aircraft. I had been to air shows before watching such events like Thunderbirds &amp; Blue Angels and is somewhat familiar with jet speed. To better describe the speed at which the second craft was moving is to take your hand and put it on top of your head and fling it forward as fast as you can. By doing this you can experience the same feeling we all had from the second craft. It was the speed from the second craft that  confirmed that the first very slow craft was a genuine UFO. To continue with the second craft maneuvers - after streaking through the sky it came to a dead stop and then also hovered over the same mountain as the first craft di! d. Now we could see both craft within our sight of view. The first in the very very far distant and now the second craft which we could&apos;nt determine it&apos;s simular shape until it had come to a stop atop the mountain. The second craft hovered for about 5 minutes and just disappeared. We did&apos;nt see it streak off or anything; we just could&apos;nt see it anymore. We all just said &quot;where did it go&quot;? The first craft was still just a speck in the sky and just stayed in the now bright sky (getting hard to maintain a constant view in the daylight) by which time our eyes were irritated and we just got tired of looking at it so long. But before I went inside I remebered it&apos;s location in the sky by using some telephone wires to refer to as a guide to where it&apos;s location was. 3 to 4 hours later I went outside and it was still there. Went to work told some fellow co-workers, made some more phone calls in addition to earlier conversations with the police station and a military base (felt foolishly uncomfortable) to see if anyone had reported any sightings to no avail - bought a telescope came home that night 9 hours later and it was still there. Frantically I set up the Celestron scope with a 4 1/2&quot; (114mm) x 910mm accommodated by a 10 &amp; 25mm lense and 1/2 hour later went outside with it where we had a clear view but not a satisfied magnification of it. My wife and I was sure and precise to it&apos;s location but we lost interest after a couple of hours when it would no longer perform for us. As I sit and type this report 42 hours later from that first moment I saw that bright light outside my kitchen window......(pause) I stopped to look at my now frequent favorite spot in the sky between the telephone wires and see what looks like a distant star in our exact location......will it move again? Who knows? You can bet we will keep looking. But, it has been nice to tell our experience to someone after those foolish sounding phone calls. However foolish, to see what we saw was fun and exciting and a  previlege to have had a little disc! overy channel stuff right in our backyard. Thanks for your time - we are your newest fans of your great web site and the job that your doing.....maybe you can reccommend a quality telescope with photographic capabilities. Thanks again!", "Digital camera shots which contain unknown object not seen until photos were downloaded to computer.I was using my Epson PC500 digital camera to take exterior shots of the view from a Bed and Breakfast for a web page.  No objects were observed with my naked eye except for the seagull which appears in photo no. 2.  Photos were transferred to my computer and were being reviewed in Corel PhotoPaint ver. 7 when I noticed the bright white dot on Photo no. 2.  I then reexamined photo no one to see if the object was present there also.  I discovered the object, only this time appearing as a dark spot.  I then increased the resolution from 288 dpi to 1200 dpi and cropped the object.  I then increased the size 300 percent and was surprised to find what I did. The physical shape of the object appeared to change as well as did the color.  The photos were taken approximately 1.5 minutes apart. I am e-mailing both photos 1 and 2 as well as the enlarged cropped object image of both.", "Green Pulse light seen for the second time in Diamond Bar. Last year the same light went horizonal across the sky. It was traveling faster than a jet. Very fast, but straight. This light just showed up from nothing! It was very bright and green and pulse down slowly down to ground.Green pulse seen in Diamond Bar last Friday night. I did not report it until I heard people in Seattle have seen one. I thought you should know. It is the second green pulse light see in a year over Diamond Bar. The one Friday night at appox. 9:00 showed up very low like 1500 feet in distance. It was stopped in air, and went down toward earth. The area I figure was a hills and cows pasters.

Later that night my Mom and I saw it agian do the same thing, only this time is hovered and looked like it was either rotating or blinking.It was around 11:30 and we were all watching t.tv. in the living room. I got up to get a drink and looked out the kitchen window and saw an amazingly bright yellow circle hovering about 1,00 feet above the treetops. I thought it was aa star so i went back into the living room and started watching t.v. again.  My brother went to the kitchen and got a drink also and he also saw it and told us to all go there quick. So went over and looked out the window and the yellow object was going striaght up and down.  it did this for 6-10 minutes and then dissapeared. We talked about it for a while and then my Mom&apos;s boyfriend and his son had to go so we went to bed.  About half an hour later I got up and looked out the hall window and there it was doing the same thing.  i went into my Mom&apos;s room and she was satill awake. i told her and we watched to gether for 3-5 minutes, this time though about halfway through it stoped about 10,000 feet off the ground and hovered and we couldn&apos;t tell if it was blinking or rotating.

We had heard there were sightings in the area by the locals, so we watched the skies each night of our stay. Nothing at all unusual for the first 3 days. On our last day, I awoke at 4:30 a.m. and looked out the window to the south. It was a very clear night. I saw an extremely bright light in the sky that stood out over all the stars. I looked at it through the binoculars and discovered that it was actually 2 separate lights, side by side. I awoke my son and brother to verify what I saw.  They agreed it was 2 separate lights and absolutely NOT a star or a planet(s). The lights were dazzingly white and stationary. We watched them until the sun rose and finally couln&apos;t see them anymore because of the sun, although they were visible in the early morning daylight hour after all the other stars had faded.", "group 4-5 dim orange ligths in V formation,fast silent displacement,east-west,looked changed positions at the end of sighting.

Called the attention to my wife,who also saw the formation. We are accustomed to the pass of light planes as there is a nearby domestic airport, and too to the characteristics of navegation lights of high flying commercial planes. To her the speed was fast. Also I estimated a change in the position of the lights at the end of the sighting, that was approx.to 45 degrees to northwest.

This was a large amount of lights and at first I thought that they was moving around but after stopping my truck and watched for awhile I summed up that the lights wasn&apos;t moving and that they didn&apos;t remind me of car lights for as I watched and moved about looking at this that it was just as bright from any spot that I looked at them where as car lights would be going in one stright direction and if you moved to a different angle and looked at them they would look different( not as bright) but no matter where I moved to and looked at them , other than the trees blocking the view, they was just as bright. After about 10 -15 min. watching this I raced home , about 5 miles from this spot , to get my binoculars, I was in my house about 5-10 min.then raced back to where I was watching this, thinking that it would be gone, but it was still there. In the same spot from what I could tell. I found a spot to pull over and from here with the binoculars I could tell , whatever it was that it was about tree top level and from my viewing spot it was behind some trees , so I tried to move to a different area and couldn&apos;t find a spot to pull over , so here I am in the middle of the road ( in a good spot now , with a break in the trees where it was at) I couldn&apos;t make out what I was seeing other than it was bright and lighting up the top of the mt. and I didn&apos;t see anything under the lights , but I didn&apos;t get long in this new viewing spot due to another car came up and I had to move and at the same time I noticed that I was a hair away from being out of gas and fearing that if it moved that I would follow and run out of gas and taking a chance of going for gas and coming back. Gas was about 2-3 miles away and you guessed it, When I got back it was gone. Went driving around but didn&apos;t see anything else. Came home and called the sheirff&apos;s office to see if they had any calls on this and was told no. And tried to sum up what I had seen. The best that I can sum up is that it looked liked something I had seen from a movie (as in &quot;Fire In The Sky&quot;) where that object was lighting up the woods. It was light lots of bright flood lights in a large circle and lighting up the whole area. No noise, to me this ruled out a plane or hellicopter, while I was looking at this , it wasn&apos;t like looking at headlights, with binoculars you would be able to tell that it was headlights.It wasn&apos;t moving from what I could tell , the lights wasn&apos;t flickering it was just like it was just hanging there. It was a clear night, you could see stars but then a couple of hours later we had bad fog roll in. I was looking north, but I&apos;m sure I wasn&apos;t looking at a star or airplane for this light was on that mountain. I know that that I shouldn&apos;t had left but I kept thinking that it would still be there when I got back just to find out that I was watching a new house with alot of flood lights around it but that&apos;s not the case cause it was gone when I got back.", "Humming then a loud subsonic boom or explosionHumming then object appeared in sky a loud boom or explosion then several flashes . Appeared to be decending after boom.", "We observed two sperical objects which were bright white surrounded by a haze which hovered in the eastern sky and then suddenly disappeared.We were driving south on Semoran Blvd. near the airport in Orlando when we turned east toward a restaurant. In the eastern sky, at approx. 40 degrees above the horizon, there were two spherical objects emitting a bright white light.  The objects were clearly defined with a haze surrounding them.  The closest analogy I can think of is the appearance of a flashlight in fog.  The sky was generally clear and the airplanes preparing for landing were clearly distinguishable. The airplane lights did not exhibit this same haze so I don&apos;t think the haze surrounding the spheres was the result of any cloud cover.  The two objects were hovering near each other but at slightly different elevations.  The sphere to the left was slightly elevated over the right sphere.  We slowed down to watch the objects, initially assuming that it was some unannounced launch from KSC.  However, the objects didn&apos;t move. They appeared to hover in the same position.  This period was long enough for us to observe them and conjecture as to what we were seeing.  The two objects disappeared suddenly.  When we got to the restaurant parking lot, several other people were standing around discussing what we had just seen. Orlando news covered the reports and showed video taken in Ft. Myers.  This video is an accurate representation of what we saw in Orlando.  Local news also reported that Patrick Air Force Base released a statement that the objects were the result of &quot;naval operations&quot;.

I was looking at the sky because it was so clear out on the road. Then I saw a light moving very high in the sky and I observed it for a few moments then it splitt into 5 lights about the same size or so they started going in circles following each other and speeding very fast away from the formation then returing back and doing it over and over again,by this time my brothers were trying fo find them I was pionting my finger at the objects and they could not find them untill one by one of my brothers found them and we were all going did you see what it did what are they is it a military thing but no it cant be because these things were playing I am lucky to have experienced this fenomena if indeed thats what it was. but I will not forget the exicitement it caused us all the objects only looked like blue in color and some times redish after 10 min of this going on the objects went in different locations.

As I walked into the backyard, I noticed an odd looking light in the Western sky. The light was amber/white in color, and was not blinking. It was located approximately 35-40 degrees above the horizon, and moving in a Southerly direction. I watched the object traverse the sky from due West to approximately W/SW. I was watching the light pretty intensely, and all of a sudden, it vanished. The color of the light reminded me of the color and quality of a vapor street lamp. You know, the kind that is supposed to reduce shadows. It appeared to be moving fairly fast. I have seen many airliners flying in the skies around here, and the object appeared to be moving faster than they normally do.

His bark was the bark as if he didn&apos;t want to leave the porch but wanted to summon someone in the family.  I went to investigate. Initially I saw nothing.  Then a rectangular craft flew by very slowly. The craft was divided into thirds.  Each third lit up sequentially with a red light.  The object made  no noise whatsover.In addition to the above information there is more to add that is very interesting.  One week later a friend of mine from high school, telephoned me in a panicked state.  Apparently he had seen the same object in the city of Sierra Madre, while on a night hike into Bailey Canyon.  He had stopped to tie his shoe lace while the others continued on the hike.  He stated that the object appeared to lose control and looked as though it were going to crash into the property of Mater Dolorosa Retreat Center.  This is a Catholic retreat center run by the Passionist Fathers. The thing that through us for a loop about this is this.... My friend who had witnessed this event, a week after I had, had gone to the whole life expo in Pasadena,Ca. of that year.  He left the convention being &quot;paranoid&quot; of ufo&apos;s and aliens.  I was a &quot;doubting Thomas&quot;.  I suggested that he go and see a psychiatrist.  Nothing more was said about the ufo subject untill the sightings that we  had It was that we had conversed, and realized that we had seen the same craft at two different places and times that there must be connection.  It was almost like as if some intelligence did something to get my dog to bark that night, to get me out of bed to investigate so that I would see this craft. Like I said...I never went to the whole life expo....but It was like as if some intellegent being heard me tell my friend Tony that I thought he was a quack.  And to make it even more believable to us it revealed itself to us...that well we never had many people believe our story except one of the priests at the retreat center with whom we were friends with.I didn&apos;t think it necessary to record the dates of the sightings, I didn&apos;t anyone  would believe us. So there you are.  I am a firm believer after having this experience with the object and I feel  ....almost on a psychic level that we are on the verge of something....a revealing of some sort...I cant  really describe it, but we are on the verge of something.", "On lunch break, heading east in car. Stopped at light, saw object in distance above the horizon. An airliner was heading south, away from it.I was finishing up my lunch break, heading east on Central Ave. While stopped at the light at Central (which goes east/west) and Rock Road (north/south) I spotted an object. This object appeared to be shaped more like an oil barrel, with a flashing red light on the top. An airliner was heading south, away from it. The object appeared to be hovering, but was moving southernly. It was hard to determine the distance from the object to the ground, and to the other objects (i.e. myself and the plane). Note also that at Central and Webb (the next major intersectiion going east)lies Raytheon Aircraft. This object did not appear to be a plane or a helicopter. I was also parked at this light for about three minutes along with about twenty others. I must have looked pretty strange sticking my head out of my car window looking at this thing. The road going east (Central) goes up a hill at this point. There is also a crosswalk midway between Central and Rock, and Central and Webb. This object was not a crosswalk light.

Object stopped suddenly on 4-5 occassions for 1-2 seconds intervals and resumed course. Est. speed 25-30,000 mph.   Similar witnessing by 4 Nat&apos;l Guard members of 184th Air Assault while on patrol within 80 miles of this location apx 8-9 weeks early.  Saw 4 similar lights that departed in opposing directions after travelling for some distance in a high speed straight line formation.  Radical high speed 90 degree turn.I was setting up my telescope ( huge 12.5 Meade light bucket ) with 20 year old son-in-law.  Night was especially clear and we were using my wide angle lense for moon viewing.  While I was focused on moon, SIL said, &quot;Hey whats that!&quot;  I turned, followed his pointing and coming overhead was a fast moving object.  It appeared slightly slower than a falling comet, but faster than any jet.  It was a single dot of white light that went in a straight line, but stopped, started and repeated this several times while I wheeled my telescope around to catch a glimps of it.  My SIL kept it in constant view by his naked eye and I aligned the Dobson mount and pointed the scope skyward at the object. It was nearly at the end of the horizon when I believe I caught a glimps of it.  It was only a fraction of a second, but I believe it was longer than it was wide and bright metalic.  No other detail could be determined.  While explaining this to a friend the next day I was advised he was 1 of 4 on patrol at apx 0400 hrs. in foothills about 90 miles away.  All 4 guardsmen observed 4 star-like objects flying high overhead until they shot away in different directions.  The were stunned.  In both cases we believe the object/s was extraordinarely high and there was no noise.  Sorry no other detail, just  the pin point appearance of a distant start moving fast!  Very fast.   FYI:  Beale AFB close by both sightings.  Also I am former pilot.  This was not a comet, strongly doubt it was a satellite, NOT a balloon or aircraft.  Served aboard navy missile tracker.  I know what rockets and sats look like.  Have no idea what this was.  I am not at all interested in having my name linked to some UFO sighting... no thanks, but I will at least share this story for what its worth.  Its 100% true, unembellished fact.  In closing I would not have believed the Guard story if I had not seen this first, even though the witness its extremely credible.  He seemed as astonished as I was.  He was in Nevada county at the time, just above Yuba County! where Beale AFB is located.

At very close to 9:50pm as we were walking around the hotel complex (to get some exercise) we spotted something very strange just north and west and maybe 45 degrees up in the sky from our location. It appeared to be a tight cluster of very dimly lit white spheres that were rising out in the distance (south and maybe west of downtown Seattle near SeaTac Airport). The cluster was slowly rising straight up in the air over a period of about 4 minutes. The entire cluster also pulsed a total of three times within about a minute and a half of first spotting them while they were rising.  Even though the objects were a dimily lit white, they pulsed in very bright colors (mostly red) and at exactly the same time. They were also moving around in their tight cluster in such a way that made the whole of the objects seem to change shape and sort of wave around in the sky. Although it appeared to be just to the east of SeaTac Airport we had been watching most of the airplane activity in the area and this was nothing even comparable to any air activity that I had ever seen in my life! The cluster continued to rise until it climbed up into some higher cloud cover and we couldn&apos;t see it anymore.

Blue sky could be seen through the center of the necklace.  Lights disappeared simultaneously.We were returning from a hunting trip, binoculars on the seat, two different vehicles, four people.  When I saw the necklace (I call it the Nevada Necklace), it was about 16 miles across the valley above the mountains between Hoppi Basin and Gamble Canyon, in clear view.  I said, &quot;What is that?&quot; and picked up my binoculars immediately and looked at the object carefully.  It was moving slowly to the north.  After viewing the necklace for several seconds, the multi-colored lights of the object simply turned off or disappeared with no after image.  The object was too high above the mountain to have been able to descend to the mountain or behind it.  I asked my passenger if she had seen it.  She said &quot;Yes.&quot;  The other vehicle containing her husband and son was about three minutes behind us on the same road.  We waited for them.  When they arrived, they confirmed seeing the same object.   In about five minutes we were back in Montello and there were several fighter jets flying all over the valley at that time as it got dark.

Godspeed!", "Approached by a small orange light.  Light changed to a large cicular object.During the summer of 1962, my friend and I were at the beach fishing for striped bass.  We had decided to make it an all night fishing trip.  It was a warm summer night and to the best of my knowledge no one else was on the beach.  I was sitting on a beach chair when my friend saw some- thing and yelled, &quot;what&apos;s that&quot;.  I looked up and saw a round rather dull orange light approaching us directly off the ocean. My initial thought was a lost fishing boat using a rather large spotlight to find its way.  It was an odd sight but at the time seemed to be a plasible explanation.  There was a river inlet close by which fishing boats used regularly and I was used to seeing boats in the general location, al- though not that close to shore. I would say the light was 50 yards off- shore and maybe 15 feet above the water.  The width was about the same as a large floodlight, the kind you see at movie premiers, maybe a little smaller.  The light was slowly approaching directly at us and I started to become nervous as it appeared the fishing boat was going to run ashore right at our feet.  When the light reached about 25 yards to our front it suddenly commenced to rapidly accelerate.  It was still heading directly at us and I jumped from my chair, ran back a few feet, and turned back around.  I expected to see a fishing boat run up over our position and ground itself.  To my surprise the light was gone but now there was a large circular object to our front at an altitude of maybe 150 feet. The object was lit but I don&apos;t remember any details or the exact size.  It departed to the NW at a steady slow rate of speed. At the time it seemed to be an exciting adventure.  I was 17 years old and my friend 16 and wow we say something spectacular.  As I think back there is something very disturbing about the event. What happened to rapidly approaching orange light?  Why didn&apos;t we see the large circular object until after the orange light disappeared?", "glowing oval-shaped aircraft were seen flying at fast speeds and shifting direction and stoping without slowing down periodically troughout the night.My brother and I were sleeping outside in the summer.

This happened aproximately 8 times.  We were too frightened to move.  It was a clear night with no clouds.

What I saw lasted approximately 2 minutes and in no way could it have been an aircraft or meteor.I was at a friend&apos;s house in his driveway talking.  I was looking at the sky, toward the north, at around 11:30 pm.  The sky was very clear and I was looking at a group of stars that seemed to be in the shape of the little dipper, but it was neither the big or little dipper.  This grouping of stars was much smaller.  Aproximately 1/10 th the size.  As I was looking at the stars one seemed to just disappear as if sucked into the darkness.  I thought this was funny and Iblinked and kind of shook my head to make sure I wasn&apos;t seeing things and when I looked up again the place were the star or so I thought was a star was just darkness.  I looked at my friend and said did you see that.  He had not seen this so we started to watch the sky in this area.  Within a minute of seeing the star or whatever it was disappear we both saw a light flash.  The light was kind of an off white color almost like the color of light produce by a house lamp.  This light was in the sky next to where the star/UFO was but the light I noticed when it flashed was quick and concentrated, not like glare you may see coming from a light source.  About a minute later we saw another flash in the same general area and of the same nature as before. This went on for about 3 minutes.  All three flashes were in the same general area according to our location.  Then the flashes stopped. My mind at this point didn&apos;t know what to really make of it at the time but I kept watching to hopefully see something else to make some sense of it.  With in a minute or two  we saw a streek in the sky of the same color light as the flashes but the streek was moving in an S-shaped pattern.  I drove home that night scared out of my whits and a little excited.  There was no aircraft in the area and nothing unusual about the night except for the light.  The light was farther away as in out of the atmoshere of the earth or right at the edge of the atmoshere.  Up until a few months ago I never really thought much of it other than I couldn&apos;t explain it.  I was watch a ! documentory on U.F.O.&apos;s and they showed one that took on this S-shaped pattern and one that seemed to become longer and then shorted as it moved.  Which if something moved in an S-shaped pattern, if seen from the right angle it would appear get shorter and longer as it moved.

At first I thought it was a black kite, but as I continued to look at it I could see two or three revolving objects that revolved above it and realized that it was some kind of machine. I was driving south and the object was to my right (west) about 150 feet in the air, hovering silently.  I hurried home and told my family, my wife and 2 of our children witnessed it, by this time the object had moved further away(south west), we took turns looking through binoculars. My wife thought it looked like colored balloons revolving around the top of the object. We called the police department and no one else had seen it at that time.  It was a triangular shape at the bottom, maybe about 20 to 25 feet in diameter, but it&apos;s shape almost seemed to fluxuate, with rotating objects above it. It was not floating in the air current, it was definately intelligently controlled.

Craft hoovered about ten feet over my head, backed off, lowered to eye level, then raised and hoovered over head again.It was about 12:30am, Lake Secession, in Abbeville, SC.  This event occurred aprox. a quarter of a mile from a hydro-electric dam.  I was alone when I noticed a whirring/whining dynamo type of sound outside.  I saw an amber colored flashing light reflecting on the trees outside.  When I walked out the door, overhead I saw a flying saucer (saucer/disc about 35 feet across and about 10 feet in height) hoovering above me no more than ten feet.  There were four sets of lights (each set had three rotating amber lights) which bathed the area in amber.  The outter skin of the ship was what appeared to be a silvery/shiney metalic color.  I recall being terrorfied beyond description to the point where I could not move.  (the house I was in was one of those lake houses that was on &quot;stilts&quot; where the outside deck was about 8 feet off the ground.  Also the lake house had twelve sides and would look circular from the air)  After hoovering overhead, the craft backed away some twenty (20) feet and lowered to where it would be almost eye level with me.  This craft was a saucer shape with a smaller dome on top.  The top dome had a round porthole (window) that was opaque/translucent and I could see that there was a white, low intensity light inside.  Due to the type of opaque/translucent characteristic of the porthole...I could not see if there was anything inside; however, I &quot;knew&quot; that something was in there and it was looking at me.  The craft then raised up, came forward directly over head and hoovered.  This event lasted approximately 5 minutes; although, there are gaps in my memory as to what exactly happened.  The craft then sped off effortlessly about 200 yards and hoovered momentarily over the Lake.  Then it sped off at a 45 degree angle towards the southwest at such a speed that I could not even begin to estimate, until it vanished from my sight into space.  That evening it was a crisp, winter night and the sky was clear giving me an excellent unobstructed view of the craft and the sky as it was departing. As far as my background.  At the time, I was 17.  I&apos;m a white male.  I currently am college educated with a degree in General Business.  I am also a Vietnam Veteran and spent about 3 years on a US Naval Destroyer and have put in many hours as lookout while at sea.  I have been trained to spot and identify various types of aircraft and missiles.  This craft was not identifiable to any aircraft in existense in the United States or any other country&apos;s millitary or civilian air force. I&apos;ve always had the feeling that there was something else that happened that night.  I have a gap in my memory as to all of the events that occurred that night.  I wish that there was someone that I could talk with about this.((ADDENDUM TO ORIGINAL REPORT))Change discription of noise....I need to make a change to my earlier report that I sent in.I just entered a report last night....please change the sound that the UFO made.  I had originally typed in it made a Whirring/whining sound.  It was a whirring/whooshing noise. Also...several years later...I had bumped into a fried that I had known for a very long time and after years of not seeing him.  He asked me &quot;whatever happened with that UFO that you saw?&quot;  I didn&apos;t recall telling him about that and asked him what he meant by that.  He told me that I had called him while the UFO was there...while it was over the house.  The reason that I said that I have gaps in my memory abouth this encounter was that I never recalled being on the phone with him and telling him about the UFO being there.  This more or less collaborates in a way, that this was happening.  Also....an addition to my background I have had many years experience as a radio announcer and radio news reporter.  At the time of this encounter...I had already had about 2 years experience in broadcast news gathering...so some of the details that I give are as specific as possible.

Smaller red lights came out of one end of lights then disappeared. Soon after I witnessed white, clustered, oscillating lights and a separate set of multi-colored lights that formed a line parallel to the horizon. This line sank out of view, but the white, oscillating lights continued to sparkle and dissipate once every 5-10 seconds for approximately 30 seconds.  I continued monitoring sky but saw nothing else.  There were numerous reports of strange lights in the sky that night, from Winfield to Wichita.At approximately 6:20 P.M. on October 30th, 1996 , I was driving east on 47th St. South out of Wichita Kansas.  When I got to about 2 miles west of Rose Hill Rd. I noticed 3 bright red lights, east-south-east, about 30 degrees up from the horizon.  They were lighting up, one at a time from right to left.  They formed a parallel line to the horizon and covered a sizable section of the night sky.  They lit up from right to left 5 to 6 times which took about 25 seconds.  I then noticed smaller, what appeared to be sparkling red lights just to the right of the furthest southern light.  They spread out and dissipated quickly.  The bright lights made one more sweep from right to left and then stopped.  I continued monitoring that section of sky as I headed east but the lights did not return. Ten minutes later I arrived home, 5 miles straight east of Rose Hill.  I got out of my car and then noticed very bright white lights straight east.  They appeared to be in a tight cluster and were oscillating.  As I watched they broke apart and dissipated.  I then noticed a multi-colored line of lights parallel to the horizon.  They were approxiamelty 10 degrees above the horizon and slowly sank.  They then disappeared.  About 2 seconds later I observed more bright white, clusterered lights that were above where the multi-colored line appeared at maybe 15 degrees above the horizon.  These disappeared only to light up again after about 5 seconds.  They appeared to sparkle for a few seconds and then die down.  After another 5-10 seconds the white lights returned for another few seconds and died down as they had done the first time.  I waited 15-20 seconds then ran into my house to find another witness.  When we returned, we monitored the sky for 10-15 minutes but saw no more lights.  We did, however. see approximately 5-10 airplane lights flying in the area that I had seen the lights.  I did not see these lights during the occurance. I called the Rose Hill police but they said they had no other reports of lights in the sky.  The local nightly news ran a story about strange lights being reported by residents of Winfield Kansas that night, so I called the Winfield police.  They said that there had been numerous reports of lights but that they had no explanation.  There was also a small article about the incident in the Wichita Eagle newspaper the following day.", "Object entered atmosphere from above, traveling east to west.Object entered atmosphere from just east of top dead center, traveling east to west. Object appeared to have a direct trajectory of 20 degrees downward as it traveled.  Initially appeared to be a meteorite, but blossomed into fireball within a half second of being spotted.  Fireball developed, appeared to be white/greenish white.  Looked reminiscent of re-entry of manned space capsules seen in pictures.  Appeared to be eminating from center of object and fanning out to the rear.  Object moved relatively slow compared to the quick meteorites seen in shower months.  Object appeared to burn out, dimming in intensity and just before extinguishment appeared to have several apparent red embers floating behind it. From south of Bothell, elevated at approximately 75 ASL, it appeared as one looks directly south, the bearing was from 160 degrees on the compass going to approximately 250 degrees. There was an aircraft on final for SeaTac who would have had an excellent view of the object, appearing to be about even with the 520 bridge on their approach.  The light as it extinguished appeared to be at an altitude well above the airliner on approach.  No other aircraft were noted to be in the area at the time. The object, for reference, seemed at it&apos;s biggest, to be about 33% the size of a full moon as it is typically seen overhead.

I thought it was a shooting star because of its speed, but realized once I was actually watching it that it wasn&apos;t. The object very faintly glowed a dull brown that would have been hard to see if the motion hadn&apos;t caught my eye. The length of the object was approximately the same as the apparent width of the full moon. It was wider than it was tall: probably a 3 or 4 to 1 ratio. I only caught a second of its east to west motion before my line of sight was blocked by the garage. I hurried down the porch and fell in the process. I was unable to see the object when I stood up -- it was moving pretty quick. I estimate that it covered approximately 20-30 degrees in about 1 second as I watched it. I looked in the direction that it had been traveling for about three or four minutes. A single flashing white light emanated from near Arcturus. It blinked 3 or 4 times, progressively getting brighter with each blink. After the final bright blink, which I estimated to be the same luminosity as a medium-bright Venus, it was no longer visible. There were no clouds in the sky, and I could ses faint stars in the location where it had been blinking. There was only a slight haze and the blinking was much brighter than the dim stars that I could see. Thios event lasted approximately 3-4 seconds. I watched for a few more minutes, but all I saw was a satellite traversing the sky in the east -- quite distant from the location of the other two objects. I have worked at this location for nearly two years and I spend considerable time outside at night smoking cigarettes and watching the skies. I have never seen a bird reflecting the street lamps at night -- that is the only the possible explanation for the first object that I can think of. If it was a bird, I probably would have seen the reflection changing as the bird flapped its wings, but the shape of the object and the glow remained consta! nt. The second object may have been an airplane, although it was quite high for the blinks to have been that bright. Usually when a plane turns you can make out different colored landing lights or something, and they usually don&apos;t just disappear as the second object did. I usually only see airplanes while watching the skies at work, but I have sighted a group of 2 UFOs on another occasion. Other than these two instances, the skies over my work are pretty boring. I am going to contact the Dane County Regional Airport to see if they received other calls or tracked anything unusual last night. Other than that, it&apos;s just another frustrating sighting.", "Various colored lights flashing after power surge &amp; failurePower surge/failure occured at 7:30 pm.  Lights went off but glowed hazy green for several seconds before immense lights began to flash over the foggy sky - central location of flashes from us was WNW.  The first flash was a general bright blue followed by several defined rays that spread out from the circumference of the blue lights this was followed by more flashing - yellow and red lines that horizontally crossed the original set of rays.  The flasing continued a few more seconds, was as bright as lightening: air temp. 39f; pressure 29.90.  We later learned that a powerline had been severed at the junction of Highway 61 and the Ryan Road - 15 miles up the shore of Lake Superior from central downtown Duluth.  It seem to us that a rather large craft may have come a bit too close to ground and that some form of its propellent energy caused the power line to snap.  We walked over to the site of the break later and saw several power company vehicles a couple of squad cars were present but left before we actually reached the scene.", "Observe a unos 3 Kilometros Dos Objetos que se acercaban a velocidad impresionante hasta el vehiculo que yo conduciaEran Ceraca de las cinco de la tarde, cuan a lo lejos rumbo cerca de un tunel observe dos objetos de mucha luz, que se aproximaban a una velocidad desmesurada, ambos objetos, se detuvieron justo frente a mi, y estuvieron cerca de 20 segundos apuntando una fuerte luz que me cegaba, el carro detuvo toda marcha posible, inclusive emisoras de radio, al cabo de los 20 segundos uno de lso objetos apunto hacia el otro una fuerte luz verde, el primer objeto dio varias vueltas al rededor de mi vehiculo, luego el segundo objeto emitio un sonido que imagino que era de muy baja frecuencia, digo esto por que el perro que venia dormido en la parte de atras del vehiculo saltaba mucho de repente y comenzo a ladrar hasta quedar agotado, luego de eso, ambos objetos subieron a tal velocidad que los perdi.

It started moving, assuming a cigar shape/outline with a tongue of flame under it and to the the rear. We noticed other cars pulling over to get a better look and as I started to do so I looked up again and saw it disappear, leaving only a glint of light where it had been. Amazing.I am a psychiatric social worker and am perfectly healthy and sane. I am 44yrs. Have a Masters degree. Have always worked. Have never seen a ufo before. I was on holiday with my wife and kid. My wife also saw it, and she has a similar background as myself.", "While driving to work, I noticed a light just below high overcast. The object appeared to be traveling east to west.I was traveling roughly southwest in my car on highway 146 at 45 mph. It first entered my field of view from the left side, or from the east. The object appeared round in shape and was glowing brightly, it was whiteish in color. The object was traveling at a high rate of speed and seemed to stay just barely below the high overcast until it left my field of view moving westerly. The object never changed direction nor did it change speed. I work in the tire industry as a mechcanical/electrical troubleshooter. I have done this for 12 years.

There were two on top and one on the bottom forming a triangle.  The moon was low in the sky and directly in front of me and the lights were a little lower than the moon.  They did not flicker and they did not move.  I had to turn north to get to my house and I looked over my shoulder as I turned and saw them.  It takes about 30 Sec. to get to my house.  I parked the car and jumped out and looked and they were completely gone.  I ran into the backyard and stood on the picnic table and searched the whole sky and they were gone and there was no moving lights in the sky.The lights were very bright and pure white.  There were no other colors and they did not flicker.  They were all the same size and appeared about the size of a pencil eraser.  There were two next to each other, horizontally, with a small black space inbetween.  There was one below that was positioned inbetween the top two, forming a triangle.  I was traveling east and watched them for about 20 minutes.  When sitting at a red light, I could determine that the three lights were stationary in the sky.  The moon was very low in the sky that night and directly ahead of me.  The lights were to the right of the moon (southeast) and just a little lower that the moon.  I had to turn north to go to my home and as I turned, I looked over my shoulder and could still see the lights.  I later timed it and it takes 30 seconds after I turn to get to my home.  When I arrived home, I jumped out of my car and looked for the lights and they were gone.  I immediately went into my home and to the backyard and stood on the picnic table and searched the sky.  The lights were gone and there were no moving lights in the sky, only stars.  I watched for quite a while because I live by Davis Monthan Air Force Base and I wanted to see if they deployed any planes, but they did not.  The base is about 3 miles from where I live.

It was about 01:45 I noticed what seemed to be landing lights but a very stange shade of white. It&apos;s movement seemed odd also because it did not seem to be getting closer fast enough for it&apos;s size. It finally turned to the noth and after awhile I for got about it. 20-25 miles latter I caught ashight of the odd lights agiain still dirrectly in front of me. On this part 64 the road is hilly and curvey and I lost sight of it each time I went in the valleys. I came around a left hand curve and started up the hill and when I came out of the fog it was hovering over my lane at the top of the hill. I was almost at the top when I pulled onto the shoulder and jumped out of my semi and stood in the middle of the highway in my socks looking up at a triangular 100&apos; from front to back and 120-150&apos; across the back. It had 4 lights across its belly from front to back like aflorresent bulb but you could not see the center of the light.

Object was spotted out sliding glass doors. I calculate my field of view to be about 30 degrees of sky from top to horizon. The object transveresed this arc in 1 1/2 to 3 seconds in a straight line. There are pine trees about 50 yrds from my location, and as the object disappeared into that ridge line, it was not low enough to light the trees or ground, inspite of being very bright. It was about 3 to 4 times the brightness of Venus at it&apos;s brightest. Did not appear to be a flare, or meteor, although the speed seemed slower than meteors I have witnessed. I also witnessed an unreported white fireball, at least half the diameter of the full moon, from the same vantage point, EXACT same tragectory, in August 1997. Flight characteristics were similar. Although I found the first sighting very odd, I dismissed it as either a meteor, or some incindiary, because the first, August 97 gave off &quot;sparks&quot; as it flew.

After I located the origin of the noise below my open window, I raised my eyes to look west, out over Lake Champlain which lies between New York state and Vermont. I saw what appeared to be 2 wingtip landing lights from a heavy jet aircraft, such as a Lockheed C-5A Galaxy, yet steady and no noise was heard. I quickly ascertained that the lights were far too spread apart and far too bright to be aircraft lights. After approx. 10 seconds from initial sighting, the 2 lights began to converge, left light moving toward the right light. At 15 seconds the 2 were very close together and began to head in a northerly direction, left to right from my westward looking viewpoint. However, during the last 5 seconds (approx.), the lights became smaller and smaller, then completely vanished at approx. 20 seconds from initial sighting, both still moving left to right.Detailed Report--This sighting occurred while in my 3rd floor studio apartment in my city of residence, Burlington, VT, on or about May 20, 1998, at 22:40.

Last night at about 1:30 am, we decided to take a study break and walk around outside.  After about 1 minute, we saw an object near the horizon.  It was a small circular white light that was traveling at a slow speed.  Since there is an airport nearby, we thought we were seeing the landing lights of an airplane.  However, the object slowed to a stop and then emitted a white flash and disappeared.  The flash was not very bright, but yet it seemed to cover the entire sky.

I looked up at the full moon behind the thickening layer of clouds. It glowed beatifully in a halo of mist. As I was admiring the view I suddenly noticed a strange point of light &quot;wandering&quot; around the sky at extremely high speed. It crossed my field of view in under 2 seconds. Because I could see a slight halo effect around the light I decided that it must be either inside or above the cloud layer. This would mean that its altitude was above 20,000 feet. The light was extremely small yet intensely bright. It was yellow or gold in color. The point had some dimensionality---it appeared to be a tiny sphere or oval---it definitely had some ball-like shape to it. After zig-zaging around the sky, making sudden turns and traveling in wild arcs, it vanished. The whole process took only about 2 seconds. I watched the sky for about 10 more minutes. During that time I witnessed 4 more lights appear, zig-zag at extremely high speed, and then dissappear. I could hardly believe my eyes. I was so entranced, I didn&apos;t think to ask any passers by to look at it and confirm what I was seeing. At one point two of the lights were in the sky at the same time, flying in very different erratic paths, almost as if they were dogfighting. All the other lights appeared in sequence, only 1 at a time. In each case, they seemed to appear from about the same point in the sky and then follow roughly the same erratic flight path and then vanish at approximately the same area in the sky. I could not tell if they were simply turning off or going behind thick clouds. After about 10 minutes the activity stopped. These lights were so small and fast that they were hard to catch even if one was looking up, so I wonder if anyone else saw them. A number of commercial jets were coming in or taking off from area runways during this event and they were quite clearly different in both appearance, sound, and behavior from the lights I witnessed. For one thing, the lights were single points of light and seemed to be far above the clouds, and moved much much faster than any of the jets (or any jet I&apos;ve ever seen for that matter). The lights did not flash or change color, although there was a slight flicker to them as they moved. It almost appeared as if something was literally skipping along the upper atmosphere. I considered the possibility that it might be some sort of debris burning up, but no debris can change direction or travel in series of loops, arcs and sudden right-angle turns, as these lights did.", "movement from east to west, travelling appx. 45 degree angle towards the groundI thought it was  fireworks at first, then considered ita meteor because it flared out.

It was the color of a green glow stick, seemed to have a slight trail, and was followed by two flanking objects, same color, but much smaller, which traveled at the same speed. The trailing objects were about a thumb at arms length back from the main object, with the appearant size each of the planet Venus. They gave the impression of being debris from the main object. They trasversed about 40 degrees of sky, as visible through a large sky light, in less than two seconds. The impression was of a rapidly falling object. The fire ball itself seemed fairly solid, only green flame like fuzziness at the very edges of the object made fireball the best description. There was the slight trail, very small, but no pronounced smoke trail that would be expected from a meteor. Except for the size and lack of smoke, seemed possible it was a meteor.

The object was always moving directly east. It changed color from orange to white and flew directly over our heads. It was about 1000 feet high. It was changing shapes. There was no noise. We have a clear video of this object.", "Heard on the local news a report regarding a possible UFO witnessed  3/17/98  in a small community S.E. of Orlando FL, called &quot;Narcoossee&quot;. Witnesses reported a &quot;bright light&quot; that lit up the sky &amp; one resident/witness related that the event actually &quot;scared&quot; 11 chickens to DEATH! NOTE FOR INVESTIGATORS:  Local Orlando TV, CH.9, an ABC affiliate, has a copy of the 911 call concerning this event, it was aired on the 11pm news broadcast, 3/18/98. Authorities assume &quot;someone was possibly shooting flares...&quot;, according to the news report...... ***************************************************************** UPDATE: Narcoossee, FL event of 3/17/98 According to ABC News affiliate, Channel 9 TV, Orlando FL, the &quot;Bright Light(s)&quot; experienced by numerous witnesses on the evening of 3/17/98, was due to &quot;Test Flares&quot; launched at the Avon Park Bombing Range. HOWEVER.....if one looks at a map, one can easily see that the distance from the Northern edge of the Avon Park Range to the town of Narcoossee is in EXCESS of 50 miles! HOW are they (whomever THAT may be!) &quot;testing&quot; flare-launches from Avon Park with the flares dropping over 50 miles away to the North?! ****************************************************************** ADDED NOTE: According to Ch 9 sources, the &quot;testing&quot; would continue for &quot;the next several nights&quot;. (Additionally, I Emailed the TV Stations Programming Director &amp; asked them to explain why flares launched from Avon Park Boming Range would be landing in Narcoossee, 50 + miles to the north! Also, one would assume that in &quot;testing&quot; said flares, PART of the test would be to view the flares lighting &quot;effectiveness&quot;......therefore I asked CH 9 TV to send a Film Crew to observe &amp; report how/why the tests were going by observing govermental workers that by all rights SHOULD be in the vicinity of Narcoossee, or any potential landing area to document the results of any &quot;test launch&quot;. I ALSO asked the TV station in my Email if having HOT Flares, buring brightly enough to have one resident blame them for the deaths of 11 chickens, drop on unsuspecting, populated areas such as Narcoossee, did not constitute a risk (duly warranted?) of fire/damage/injury/death from fires that WOULD occur if said flare(s) were to easily land on a residential/commercial/occupied structure.......I have not had a reply to that as yet.", "Observed silent, slow moving craft moving in Northeasterly direction. Lost sight as it moved over hills.I was training a new driver for my truck route. After we had passed the Ohio/Virginia border, he yelled,&quot;Look at that&quot;.  So, I pulled the truck over and we both got out.  Just to our left, and bigger than my hand as I stretched out my arm, was a black triangular craft with a dim, white, light on each corner and a dim red/orange light in the middle.  It seemed to be so close, you could throw a rock up and hit it.  However, it did not even make the slightest noise.  We observed it for at least ten minutes, as it glided toward the large hills that dominate the area on Interstate 77.  It should be noted that Wright Patterson AFB. is only a couple hundred miles to the west of this sighting. Personally, I do not believe that this craft was manufactured anywhere on earth. It did not have the look of any conventional aircraft that I have ever seen before or since. Also,  maybe you remember the story of Indrid Cold, this was the name of the alien who kidnapped a man from Mineral Wells, W.Virginia.  Mineral Wells, was only six miles more south from this sighting.  After much reading, I find there is supposed to be a vortex of sorts in this general vacinity.  Well, that&apos;s about the extent of what I have to say about this particular incident.  Thanks for listening. I appreciate it.

Seems to be hovering pretty high off the ground, but too low for a star.We viewed this object with a 10/50 binoculars.  We can only see that it is a fast blinking light, it was too far to see, about 20 miles away.  It blinked rapidly red, green and white.  It didnt move much, just seemed to hover pretty high off the ground, not moving fast at all. But a couple 1000 feet high off the ground, deffinitely not a star.  We called the airport and they showed nothing on radar, which was a 40 mile distance, and it was with in that proximity.  There were 4 of us that observed the UFO.  First was Carl, 45, no prior arrests, and didnt drink anything all night.  Second was Phil, 15, no drinks and no arrests.  Third was Pat, a little alchohol, and no prior charges.  Fourth was Rick, 26, no prior arrests, very little to drink.", "White disk flew underneath jetliner as we were descending towards Dulles Intl. We were at about 10-12,000 feet according to cabin monitors. The object moved rapidly towards N/NW. No wings, tail, engines or markings other than two black lines extending towrds center from outer rim. It was between jetliner and patchy clouds below. Maybe less than 500 feet below. Very clear view from rear window seat.", "Ball of light low in sky descending slowly at steep angle from East to WestAt approximately 9:00-9:30 pm, i was looking out a south facing window and witnessed a ball of light descending across my field of view from East to West.  The light appeared too large, moved at a rate to quickly, and angle to steep for it to be an airplane.  It also moved to slowly for it to seem like a shooting star.  It did not leave a trail. The path of the object was linear and did not vary, and descended from east to west at an angle of approx. 30 degrees. The light from the object seemed very white. I only witnessed it for a period of less than 5 seconds before my view was obstructed.", "Summary : Was staring at a very clear night sky over the Caribbean when overhead I saw what appeared to be a satellite (I see them very often).  This object started moving in a straight path overhead, but then made three radical changes in a north-northwest direction while moving at the same incredible speed.  To my knowledge, no jet can make those manuevers and satellites must travel a fixed path in orbit.  The entire event lasted around 5 seconds.  No weird lights, just what looked like a brighter (larger?) than normal satellite making a crazy pattern in the sky unlike anything should be able to do physically.I am a fund-raising consultant who works to help non-profits and churchs raise money for capital campaigns.  I was working for a church in Charlotte Amalie when this event occurred.", "It appeared above me app. 200 ft. with 3 lights; {leftlight, red} {right light,green} {middle light, bright white.} The middle light blinded me so bad I couldn&apos;t see anything else, Itried to move and found all I could move was my eyes from one side to the other. It then moved just to the right of me and then back to the left .I seemed to be in an upside downicecream shaped cone of brilliant white light the whole time. Then after what seemed to be 3 hours later, it just vanished out  of sight. I nevered reported it because I was scared to death!

I was facing at 310 degrees (compass heading) and looking up at what I think was the Big Dipper.  To the left of the &quot;handle&quot; of the Big Dipper, at about a 45 degree angle from the horizon, a ball of white light with a greenish glow arround the circumfrence;  looked as if it dropped straight down.  The light  lasted about 2 full seconds.  I&apos;m not sure if there was a &quot;tail&quot; or just the image of the bright light on my  retina.  I would approximate the size of the ball of light as about 5 to 10  times the size of the dot of light of Jupiter which was in the sky behind me.", "Observed object, nothing around it.  Pulsing red light, bright-dim-bright-dim. Moved slowly toward us.  Through binoculars, could see marquise-shaped lights, largest in center, and tapering to smaller in size towards edges. As approached, went up in altitude.  Directly overhead, shot up quickly to a pin-prick size, then disappeared completely.At 5:45 A.M. Pacific time, I looked out my kitchen window and saw a bright, intensely red light. The sky was clear, no clouds. We had just switched to Daylight Savings Time last Saturday.  The red light pulsed bright-dim approximately every second.  I looked at it for approximately thirty seconds, noting that it was not moving.  I went upstairs to get our binoculars.  I raised the blinds in the bedroom, waking up my wife.  I told her, &quot;Come here, there&apos;s something in the sky.&quot;  She observed the same red light.  We both determined it was not an airplane.  In fact, we are near the approach flight path for Lindbergh Field in San Diego, and during the event, we saw the lights of a jet on final approcah, and the plane&apos;s lights were below the height of the red object.  We also determined it could not be a helicopter.  I would also like to note that it was extremely early in the morning and there was no traffic noise, and we heard absolutely nothing from this object.  If it had been a helicopter, we would have heard the blades. My wife went downstairs to get our 35 millimeter camera (autofocus-type) to take a picture of the object.  I retreived the binoculars and went downstairs also.  My wife took two pictures of the object, hopefully one at its bright pulse and one at its dim pulse. To my observation, it moved slowly from the southwest toward the northeast, but not in a straight line.  It moved in what I would call a Lazy S configuration.  During all of this time, the pulsing of the lights did not change.  When it got directly over my head, it stopped and it seemed like it disappeared.  I looked for it through the binoculars again, and I found it, but it seemed much smaller and dimmer than when we first observed it, and then it completely disappeared.  It seemed to me as if it went straight up very quickly.  My wife did not see this movement because she had gone inside to try and find someone to call. My wife observed the object through the binoculars, and she reported that it appeared to her that the object had seven marquise-shaped lights that were glowing brighter than the surrounding part of the &quot;structure&quot;.  The largest one in the middle seemed to her to be the one that was pulsing.  Each of the marquise-shaped sections were yellowish at the centers, graduating out to orange, and then red, with the spaces in between red also. I am 44 years old, retired USN Chief.  I work as a Draftsman/Design Engineer for a metals manufacturer.  I have never seen an object like this before. My wife is 43 years old, works as a freelance court reporter.  She&apos;s never seen anything like this before.  We have been married ten years this September and have two cats.  I have three children from a previous marriage and two grandchildren.  We&apos;ve lived in this home since 1989. One other thing we would like to report is that we are close to a mountain in Spring Valley, CA called San Miguel.  Atop this mountain are a multitude of communications installations for probably every radio and TV station in our county, as well as Tijuana, Mexico.  We don&apos;t know if that has any bearing, but we did want to mention this. When we get the film developed, we will send the two pictures via regular mail.", "It was a ball of light that was orange in the center with a red haze around it. When it passed overhead it broke in two and continued on, and broke into other pieces.The object which was a ball of light that had an orange center and a red haze around it, was approx. 4,000 ft. up because it just barely cleared the mountains (Cascades? Leavenworth area), as it was traveling from west to east, at a constant speed, little faster than a cessna.  As the object was overhead, it broke into 2 pieces.  The second piece broke away at a 90 degree angle and remained at a distance approx. 500 ft. from the first object and continued parallel through the sky.  Both objects sent smaller objects toward one another and continued east when we lost the object over badger mountain. The sky was clear, no clouds, it was night.  There was another aircraft in the vicinity but it was not chasing the object.  The object produced no noise, no tail and no sparks. The other witness, contacted the local airport and was informed that nothing was seen. I contacted McChord Airforce base in Tacoma, WA and was told to contact the local police.  I have also contacted MUFON and no answer has ever been given.  I can tell the difference between an object re-entering the earth, like a rocket or falling satelite, this object maintained this altitude, and there was no tail at all. I have an AAS degree, with a major in engineering and computer science. I would like an explanation of what we saw.", "Summary : Saw triangle craft with 5 white lights on front and 1 red light on bottom. elev approx 500-1000 ft, moving approx 50 mph in a SW direction. Made only a low humming noise.coming home from ball practice, my daughter and myself saw this black triangular craft.  We stopped the car at the end of the drive way and turned engine off to listen. Heard low humming noise, Craft appeared to be on flight coming from the direction of Eglin AFB headed toward Pensacola NAS.  Moon was small sliver no clouds seen. the lights were: one on the front tip, one in the middle of each side and oone on each wing tip or the points of the triangle on the sides, the back was straight across without lights, one red flashing light in the middle of the underneath side.", "Summary : Noticed a semi-circular array of white lights with a pulsing middle light.  Observed object in southern sky.  Actually heard propulsion system activate before ship moved at a terrific speed to the north and west of sighting position.  Too dark and no moonlight to visualize true shape of craft.  The night was very clear and cold. On way to county seat viewed an array of white lights in southern sky.Traveling south on Highway 71 toward county seat, Maryville.  I was 19 at the time.  The other two individuals, men, were slightly older.  We noted a group of lights, in the sky to our right, paralleling our movement to the south and east on the highway.  The driver of the car pulled off onto a side road and the three of us stood outside of the car and observed the lights.  Upon first viewing the object it appeared to have 4-5 white lights on the bottom side it.  In the middle of this array was a pulsating light that would gradually change colors from red to orange to yellow to a bluish cast never actually going completely out.  The object was approximately 1/2 mile to our right and was moving to the east slowly.  Elevation was approximately 1/4 mile.  The object kept moving closer, in the air, and then came to a complete stop.  After stopping, in the sky, there was still no sound.  There were no other competing lights or phenomena so there was no distraction.  The highway was exceptionally quiet, no traffic.  As I gazed at the object and was observing the pulsating of the central light I heard an almost imperceptible sound.  Rather like a low pitched moan which seemed to be emitted from the object in the sky.  The object then moved from the point just to the east of us at a terrific speed and was out of sight in a matter of 2-3 seconds.  There was the almost inaudible hum and then the thing moved from a dead stop to the north and west and was gone.  I went into the Air Force the next year and served a year and one day in Vietnam, 70-71.  I have seen many types of jet aircraft and observed them in flight and have never seen such an array of lights, so closely together and the pulsating ability of the one cente one.  I have a college degree in business/technology and a separate technical school degree in electronics and am well read.  I have never anyone else who has seen or observed anything similar to this craft.  There was no sonic boom, when it took off or anything.  I did have corroborating discussio! ns from two other college aged people from two different places that night, though.  One to the south and east noted the same actual light array but, from a farther distance.  The other was from the north and west and noted a similar object hovering in a pasture area near the town of Elmo.  This event has haunted me since.  No one believes me, trully but, I know what I saw.  One of the two other men is now dead.  He drowned and the other guy still lives in the area but, I never see him.  I work for the State of Missouri and have a job of importance and responsibility.  I just thought that I would pass on my story.  I hope that this may dovetail with some other accounts.  Thank you.", "2 matalic spears connected to each other hovered in the southern sky for about 15-20 min.2 matalic sphears that were connected to eachother, hovered in one spot for 15-20 min.  they were spherical but were bade up of alot of flat sides.  I went in to get something to get a better look at it and when I came back it was gone.", "I was Parked at a stoplight, a light just above the horizon caught my eye.  A large, round, glowing object passed directly in front of me.As I was parked at a stoplight, waiting for the light to turn green, a glowing ball of light caught my attention.  I looked up in time to see the object moving north to south across my veiw out my front window.  The object was just above the horizon, and appeared to be traveling at a slight angle towards the ground and seemed to be only a couple hundred feet above the earth. The sighting lasted approximately 2-3 seconds.  The size of the object was not quite as large as a full moon.  The shape was essentially round and appeared to be moving through a either low clouds or a haze.  The object glowed much like a street light illuminating the fog near it on a foggy night.  The color seemed to be a pale orange.  I was in my car with the engine running, but could not hear any sound associated with the event(My first inclination was that it was an aircraft going down; the sighting occured very close to Sanders Field, but the object was much too large).  I am a 33 year-old male,married, with two young children.  I was most recently employed as a credit analyst for a national credit bank, but now am a full-time student.  I have never seen anything like this.", "I saw three triangle shaped craft fly over my neighborhood.It was early in the morning (appx 1:00 am) and I was in my room (second floor) when I looked out the window and noticed bright lights. It appeared to be a low flying airplane and I thought nothing of it. A few minutes later I noticed the same thing and I went outside to my backyard.  A large, slow moving, black, triangular craft with lights was moving across the sky.  Ahead of it, was the object I had previously seen that I thought was a plane, it was the same triangle craft.  There was also a third triangle craft.  They were moving in single file from east to west.  I stood beneath them as they passed and I could hear a very faint hum, it was barely audible.  Other than that, they were silent.  I would estimate that they were 100-300 yards in width. This happened a couple of years ago, so I apoligize for the lack of description.  I submitted this because I saw a report on this website (NTL UFO Reporting Center) from Rochester that also dealt with triangular craft.", "Single white light, no flashing green, red or white light.  Traveling from WNW to ESE.  Followed about two minutes later by similar light, traveling in same direction.At approximately 9:58 pm I went outside to investigate what at first sounded like thunder. There were approximately four loud booms.  I looked up to see that the sky was cloudless.  I told my roommate &quot;thunder doesn&apos;t go boom, boom.&quot; While looking up I saw the first light, about the brightness of Venus, traveling from WNW to ESE.  I thought it strange that there appeared to be only one light and no other blinking lights.  There was no sound of a jet either. I ran in to get my binoculars but could only make out a vague, black silhouette whose shape was not readily apparent.  I told my friend to come outside but by the time he made it out the object was out of sight below the tree line. As I was walking back to the house I looked and and saw another similar light. I said &quot;Look another one.&quot;  It traveled in the same direction, at the same speed. I got a good look at this one with the binoculars and saw no flashing lights, the vague, black silhoutte against the moonlit sky.  I saw both lights for approximately 15 to 20 seconds each.  They traveled in a straight line, again no sound that I could detect.  At about 10:02 pm I hear two more explosions about twenty seconds apart.  I have no idea what the loud booms were. Fireworks maybe, from nearby casinos.  There was nothing on the local news to explain the loud booms.  And, I have no reason to believe that they were associated with the flying objects.  Just a strange coincidence.", "In 1979, a large circular light was seen over the neighbors house behind N.E. 189th Street in Woodinville.", "I and a co-worker were traveling on Route 52, just past the bridge into Ashland, Kentucky.  A large, silent, matte silver object appeared in our view approx. 200ft. in sky.  Hovered stationary and then moved very quickly away. It made a triangular pattern over the Ohio River and then went out of view.I described the object as egg shaped but in reality it was more like a large, blunt-tipped diamond shape.  We both agree on the events as they occurered, but my co-worker refuses to discuss the incident.  I remember us talking that day in amazement that no one was pulled off the road gaping at the object as it was quite large and mesmerizing. The object was matte silver, almost like pewter.  There was a glint from the sun but we could not see any features on the object.  It moved away so quickly that I did not notice it was moving, only &quot;getting harder to see&quot;.  We both agree that we had never seen anything like this before and that there was no easy explanation for it.  Another thing we thought strange was the time of day - around 1:00 pm, on a beautiful sunny day.  We are both social workers who work with troubled youth.  One last detail, I experienced no fear when viewing the object but weeks afterward became very fearful and &quot;paranoid&quot; about ufo&apos;s, aliens, etc.  (This is definitely NOT a typical baseline ideation for me!)Partially, this effect is still present which is why I don&apos;t think I can provide any contact information.", "Summary : 2 objects seen in clear sky hovering. seen while driving E on US 30.

It appeared that the object was a low-mass object..it&apos;s speed did not seem right for the size etc. After a 5 sec. period, it simply blinked out..and the falling material actually continued for less than a second after it blinked out.", "Star like object that appeared moving slowly due south then increased speed.  Did not change direction.While walking in Dick Kleberg County park at 0547 spotted an object that looked at first like a star that was stationary, then began to move at first slowly then increased speed.  It was too far away to judge speed, but I first spotted the object at about 45 degrees looking due west and it dissappeared at about 110 degree, the event lasting about a minute.  Object gave appearce of a star, whitish in color, but did not twinkle, no blinking, more like the reflection of light from an object sufficiently high in the atmosphere reflect sunlight despite that it was still very dark in the park.  I have walked in the park for the last 18 months from 0530 to 0630 and have essentially identified all the air traffic that flies overhead from the airports in the vicinity, and this object was a new object and did not appear to be an aircraft.", "Two round, yellow, hazy lights. Smaller than full moon. Came toward us from the east. Sky was clear.  Light on left slightly lower altitude. Right light made circular move to the left in direction of left light.

It started about in the southeast sky at a downward angle and traveled west before it disappeared.My wife went out to walk the dog at 8:50 PM on Wednesday, September 23, 1998 in Bothell, WA. Right around 9:10 PM we were walking in a SE direction when I noticed a bright light in the sky but partially obscured by a tree. The light appeared to be about the size and brightness of (Jupiter?), the bright planet currently visible in the southward sky, but pale green in color. I soon noticed the light moving toward Seattle (west) and at a downward angle. I told my wife to look. We both witnessed it as it streaked into full view for about three more seconds. The light appeard to get bigger and brighter as it moved and had a small orange-red tail. The largest the light ever got was about the size of an eraser held at arms length. It seemed to disappear or burn out about 30 degrees in the horizon. My wife&apos;s first thought was that it was a firework because of its color and brightness. I believed it was too far and too low in the horizon plus moved too far and fast to a Roman Candle. It basically looked like a very bright shooting star - but green.", "I saw an object which I thought was a bright planet (I see every morning as I deliver newspapers). Instantly realizing the object was too large, and not placed where the planet usually is (lately). I have lived in East Central Florida for 40 years and have seen hundreds of launches from Cape Canaveral. Using those sights as a reference, I saw this object zoom into space at a speed very much faster than any spacecraft I&apos;ve seen.", "Light spotted moving very fast heading NE and quickly turning W. Other simular round lights seen w/ same characteristics. Objects moved to fast and silently to be planes.Myself and two friends witnessed a strange light moving North East very fast. The object was moving very quietly. It then turned very sharply twards the West. About a minute later we witnessed another object, which seemed to come out of nowhere heading North East. It was also moving fast and quietly. It turned sharply to the North and quickly faded. Another minute later we saw a light come from the North and quickly turn East a fade like the other lights.

One was red and flashed one was white.The lights were directly west, immediatly infront of the mountain about 3/4 up the height of the mountain. They were stationary for about two hours the moved slighly north.  We looked with binoculars but could not see any thing more than the two lights.  The aerostat was up that night and was beside us to the south and plainly visable with its flashing white light.  We observed the lights from our porch until we went to bed about 2300.  I thought I could see at times a white beam of light emitting from the red light.  My son thinks the beams might have been only glare because we could not see them when viewing through the binoculars.  We both wear glasses.  There was no other airial activity at that time.  We have had other experiences before but never have  told anyone.  The  thing  that upset my family is that when we returned inside and  got busy doing other things I  suddenly had a severe nosebleed.

Object would change shape and size and brightness/intensity. Also would change colors - white, red, orange, yellowish - no specific pattern/no consistency. Light got smaller and smaller and faded away.While flying from Portland Or. to Burbank, Ca. I noticed a white light outside the aircraft.  It did not resemble another aircraft - no strobes or consistant light patterns. This was just one light - which would change shape (from large ball to a much smaller defined point of light). Object seemed to fly alongside our plane for about 45 minutes.  It was really fascinating and as it changed shape it would also fade in and out of different colors. It went through shades of red, orange, yellow, and very bright white.  This whole time I could see other aircraft along other routes and this object did not resemble or act like any of them and it was not a planet or star (too low on horizon).  It always seemed to stay a consistant distance (hard to judge because it was so dark) yet it would morph into these different shape/color phases. The patterns of color and shape were not consistent and differed throughout the whole time.  I asked the person ahead of me on the plane if they could see it - they acknowledged they could and I told them to watch it for a while.  I noticed that person looking out at it occasionally yet they never said anything about it. Eventually the light seemed to start getting smaller and smaller (like a pinpoint of light) and it eventually disappeared - as if turned off!  It was really quite interesting and I am happy to have witnessed something like that. I have flown many times at night and have NEVER seen anything like that. It behaved like no aircraft I have ever flown on or seen while flying - it was really quite amazing!", "Summary : One night going to a friends house,I was walking.

The fireball was on a slightly downward course for the duration of time in which the object was visible (5 seconds). It disappeared in what seemed to be mid-air. There were no viewing obstructions as the particular area was flat farm land. There was a long white tail following the object. From past experiences witnessing meteorites we are quite positive in saying that the object seen tonight was not such space debris.

It was not hard to see what he was looking at. I observed an object whose shape was hard to determine at first, as it appeared to be coming almost straight at us. I did easily notice the long trail of exhaust and flame that trailed the object. The object progressed rather slowly, about normal aircraft speed, from our northwest(right), to eventuaslly end up to our southeast(left). As the objectbecame closer and crossed our field of vision, a shape could be better made out. At first, a couple of us thought it might be an airliner that was on fire, but we could not make out any wings or tail structure. The glow from the trail of fire was illuminating the rear of the object somewhat. It should be noted that this sighting occured on a cloudless night with a 3/4 moon in the western sky, many stars visible, and a very clear view as we were far away from any city lights. When the object crossed between our position and the moon in the west, we could discern a cigar-like shape, reminiscent to me of a large missile(icbm type). The others present were in agreement as to the shape of the craft. At a point where the object was moving away to the southeast, but still mostly in front of us, we observed a very bright and instantaneous explosion near the &quot;nose&quot; of the object, immediately followed by approx. ten small objects which streaked toward the ground in a fan pattern, disapperaing in the proverbial&quot;twinkling of an eye&quot;. In fact, if we had blinked, I&apos;m sure we would have missed them, they moved so fast. At that point, a couple of us were saying our prayers and waiting for the blinding flash and mushroom cloud. The closest thing I could think of to describe what I was seeing was an icbm that had just MIRV&apos;ed. There was fortunately no explosion, much to our surprise and relief. We continued to watch the main object progress in controlled flight, to the southeast fo our position, until it finally became nothing but an orange circle of light, as if we were now looking straight at the rear end of the thing. We continued to watch the object until we could no longer see any sign of it. It flew out of our sight. It did not explode, blink out, disappear, or streak off at an unbelievable rate of speed. Once we rgained our composure, I radioed the sheriffs&apos; office and asked the dispatcher to call the FAA Flight Control Center in McAlester. He asked me what was going on because he was already getting calls from citizens around the county who had also seen the object. He called the FAA and they had no report of any scheduled aircraft or any aircraft at all for our area. Within a few minutes, the dispatcher advised me he had received a teletype over the state law enforcement net of the report of an object that landed in a farmers field near Anadarko,Ok.(approx. 130 miles west of McAlester.), and that personnel from Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma City were enroute to see what it was. That was the last we heard about this until the next day. I channel surfed the news all day long, checking for any mention of this incident, to no avail. Of the seven separate news stations we had available, not one mentioned anything until 1730 that evening when KOCO channel 5 in OKC made a statement that if you saw a bright light in the sky the night before and wondered what it was, you were not alone. They claimed officials at Tinker had no idea what it was either. At a second newscast on this same channel 30 minutes later, in fact, during the weather portion of the broadcast, the weatherman stated that officials at Tinker had determined that what we saw was a Russian &quot;booster rocket&quot; re-entering the earthe&apos;s atmosphere and burning up due to friction. Well, I&apos;m no &quot;rocket scientist&quot;(pun intended), but what I saw was on a perfectly level trajectory(horizontal) with no angle. There was definitely a large streak of flame behind the object, but it was emanating from the rear of the craft, not the nose as you would expect if the flame was caused by friction. The craft was not on fire, it was under propulsion. No other mention of this incident was ever heard by me. Those of us who saw it don&apos;t talk about it anymore. I still have video of the few seconds KOCO devoted to it though.", "Three humongus craft with about 30 saucers about them loading and unloading something.I was stuck at Usal Beach (on the road going out to US Hwy 1) after finally getting unstuck and traveling to Hwy, 1 I went South and at the top of the hill just before going down to the ocean I stopped to have a ciggarette and let my friend behind me catch up. When he did catch up he got into the cab of my truck and we talked a bit trying to decide where we would camp for the night.  We decided on Union Landing, about 2 miles above Westport on Hwy 1.  While setting there alongside the road I noticed a blue light like electric arc welding flashes in the trees ahead.  I thought another fisherman was up late working on his boat.  Upon finishing my smoke we pulled out onto the road and started down towards the beach and union landing.  When I came to a point abreast of where the lights were I looked over to see what kind of a boat etc. the supposed fisherman was working on.  There was no boat, no house, garage or anything else.  The terrain dropped off steeply and I had a view of the ocean.  I was up about 800 feet above the ocean and looking out at one hell of a sight:  3 large ufo&apos;s, each big enough to put the Kibby Dome in (the Kibby Dome is a Football Stadium at The University of Idaho at Moscow, Idaho) as I said there were 3 of them they were the shape of a childs top or a beet.  They were staggered one in front of me another further out and to the right and the third to the left of the first two and further out still.  From my position on the Highway the first was a mile from me the second aboutthree miles out and the fourth about five miles out from me.  I saw two or three white light saucers to the left of the first big ship.  The second ship had none or maybe one about it but the third big ship had about thirty saucers around it.  The big ships were outlined with pink lights and the saucers were solid white light colored.  What was happening as far as I could determine was that the saucers were taking turns going into the bigger craft, one would come out and another from outside would go in.  I watc! hed this for about 15 minutes, all the time trying to describe to myself what they looked like and what it was they were doing.  Finally I got into my truck and went the 5 or so miles to the ocean(the road wound down to the place where it followed the contour of the ocean).  Upon arriving at the ocean I could not see the UFO&apos;S at all.  They had left.  I then continued on down Hwy. 1 to Union Landing where I made camp and stayed for 30 days.  The next morrning we saw 1 or2 F-4 Phantoms flying at about 100 feet elevation and going up the coast.  They were very close to the coast, 1/4 to 1/2 mile.", "from rt. 104 looking north saw bright orange light that faded away into a clear starlit night. traveling north toward lake ontario saw three bright orange lights,lighting up a saucer shaped object. 1/2 mile away.the object was about 1/2 mile away and 1/4 mile high and appeared at first as three big, bright, orange lights around a saucer shaped &quot;something&quot;. The lights got very bright and then slowly faded away. My husband pulled over and rolled down the window but we heard no sound.About 5 min. later we saw the single bright orange light farther out over lake Ontario and to the east. That too slowly faded away.There were no clouds in the sky this night.", "Light bouncing around a valley. Light changes intensity, brightness, and color.  Disappears, reappears different location.On 9/9/97 at about 9:30 p.m., a friend and myself were watching the most severe thunderstorm to hit our area that summer. Shortly into our weather session, my friend says, &quot;hey, do you see that?&quot;.  I looked where he was pointing.  The object was zipping into this valley about 5 miles away to our wnw.  We were located about 10 miles nw of Roseburg OR., USA. The object would be real dim, then brighten intensly, brighter than Venus, but pulsing also, sometimes every color of the rainbow, it seemed.  At one point, the light went down out of sight, then a pause, then it came shooting up out of the valley like a squiggly glowing red sperm, then disappear. Then it would reappear from somewhere else, moving a different direction. Keep in mind, a pretty violent thunderstorm is blasting lightning down, rather close to us at times.  This object was below the cloud deck. At one point it appeared to come very close to us, I swear, I could makeout some sort of lighted window panes, with a darker one in between. I assumed the object was close at that point, possibly within a few hundred yards.  In any case it must have been rather small, perhaps less than 15 meters in size. Well, this went on for about 1.5 hours and we simply weren&apos;t watching the lightning anymore, we didn&apos;t even care that it was getting within 10 miles of us. Ok your thinking, ball lightning right. No.  I would have settled for that, but then something remarkable happened. my friend was looking around for the onject to reappear somewhere else, like it was doing, then I saw it, a perfect white cone of light beaming accross the bottom of the thunderclouds.  There was very little thunder, and no rain at our location, and we could hear no aircraft of any kind. This &quot;spotlight&quot; came from the object, which had reappeared again. I yelled to my friend, but it disappeared just then.  It happened again, and we both saw it. This time, the object was near us and it beamed that perfect white light right above our heads about 100 feet and &quot;scanned&quot; the hillside right behind us. I have been an amateur astronomer and weather observer for well over 15 years, and I have never witnessed an event like this, in fact I have to say, it has been the most troubling event in my life. I also want to point out, at one time it appeared that the one object went into the valley, then came out with another one attached by, &quot;energy&quot; Something strange out there, and I think these strong storms have an adverse affect on them.", "Played with our car for over 5 min. deserted freeway, took off like slingshot returned and put bright light on car, only time made noise.Lady friend asked about funny lights in distance, I joked &quot;it&apos;s a ufo&quot; less than half min it was on us she said &quot;don&apos;t look now it&apos;s right behind us&quot;. I turned to see variable glowing dayglow green disc following pulled up alongside (way too close to mistake for less than genuine) and did some flying stunts for about 5 min.  Way strange, made all my hairs stand on end literally.  Reappeared and threw extra bright light on car, flying in front of us same speed, only time it made any noise.  We both waved hi heartily at it at this time, me feeling a sense of inner peace that there could or must well be life elsewhere, having somewhat Saganistic &quot;skeptic&quot; belief before.  Light and noise from under craft diminished in intensity then took off like slingshot again.  We stopped in first rest area, after passing airbase I believe and French man was running around jabbering about a &quot;phenomena fantastique&quot;. Lady frind drew nice picture of it.  I think it put bright light so it could make movies maybe.  Have wondered if other sightings were reported same areas, times.  I think it was &quot;curious of us as we were of it&quot;. Have no idea what they have about cattle.  It was about 2.5 Lincoln continintal cars long, as I remember. Since then it seems way too many people/friends have ufo stories, including DeForrest Kelley and Jerry Garcia.  It &quot;floated&quot; noislessly while it played with us, noise grew when bottom opened and light started to grow too.

My son noticed two pulsing bright white objects approximately one mile away.  They were located low on the horizon and were less than four inches apart when meaured at arms length.  The lights emitted charateristics not common to any aircraft or object previously known to us.  The light was circular with a definite edge, not diffused. We were not able to see any form or shape of the object emitting the lights.  The lights were arranged horizontally, pulsing on and off  but not at the same time.  Alternately, the lights would pulse vertically, diagonally and then return to the horizontal.  This was repeated with no apparent pattern.  When we would move, the lights would move in the same direction.  The objects seemed to move slowly across the horizon then away from us, leaving in a rapid fashion.  As they moved away, they continued to pulsate, sometimes closely together, and other times far apart.  All at once, they disappeared.

On or about 2/27/98 it appeared to be the closest.  It looked like a star, but it twinkled more than a star and was brighter than the stars that were out.  The strange thing is that the object appeared to hover in a general location but would make erratic movements in different directions from the central location, about 30 degrees above the horizon looking East. The object never makes a noise and is higher in the sky than any airplanes that pass under it.  The movements are sometimes quick and sometimes slow, but there is definite movement.  The eeriest thing is that when looking through binoculars, you could see bright red, green and white lights that appear to be whirling around the object.  No star does that.  I had 5 witnesses the night that it was closest, and there have been at least two other people see it on 2 other occasions, in the approximate same location.  I am near an observatory, and talking to the operators, the closest thing they can figure is possibly seeing Artuerus.  i plan on filming it the next time I see it on a clear night.  On one occasion, what looked like a shooting star shot out from the object.", "Saw bright orange light (size of Venus)  with diffuse and changing orange haze 1/2 size of moon around central light.I was in the kitchen of my house in The Woodlands, when an odd light in the sky caught my eye. The light was orange colored. I at first thought it might be a dim aircraft landing light. The location is within an approach area of Houston Intercontinental Airport (IAH). However, the direction which the light followed was not consistent with approach or departure paths for IAH. I looked at the light through the window and trees, and it seemed to be moving a little erratically as seen through the branches of the pine and hardwoods in the back yard. I grabbed my binoculars and headed outside. Again, the color and intensity of the light was unusual. the binoculars were handy for watching birds at the feeder. I went to a clear area just behind my house, and observed the light with binoculars and naked (I wear glasses) eye. The object continued moving from the East to a point nearly overhead, before changing direction to the North. The night was clear, cool (dry), and moonlit. The time just before 10:00 pm. I did not hear any sound related to the object. I could not estimate the distance to the object. It was not nearby, but could have been any height above, say, 5,000 feet on up to the edge of the atmosphere. I cannot estamte the speed of the object, except to say that it moved from Zenith to Horizon in about 3-4 minutes. The visual size of the central (bright) part of the object was like observing Venus. The color of the object was a golden orange, similar to a dimmed incandescant lamp, and similar to the orange sodium vapor lamps now in commom use for public lighting. The central part was not flashing, but there were some variations in the brightness. Although &quot;bright&quot; I would not characterize the light as &quot;intense&quot;. Around the center bright orange light, was a diffuse halo, or fog, of the same color as the central light, which would expand and contract, sometimes appearing to swirl around the central light. As the object was moving away from me, the intensity of the central light did not seem to diminish, as it would were it a lamp with reflector. There was no other light, nor shadow, nor detail observable with the object. It did seem difficult for me to keep a good focus on the object with either my eyes or the binoculars. The light approached from the East, till nearly overhead, then moved off toward the North, visible for perhaps five minutes before going behind trees to the north, and still visible through those trees until obscured by more dense growth and the northern horizon. This could give some indication of the altitude of the object; were it very high, it should become very small (due to distance) as it nearded the horizon, however, the size did not go very small. Consider a low-flying plane versus one crusing at 35,000 feet as it departs your area. This object appeared more like the low altitude craft as it reached my horizon, even though I could not estimate its height or distance while higher in the sky. The light moved slightly erattically in speed and direction. It did not make any dramatic changes in direction or speed, but did seem to wander around a bit. After I lost view of the object, I stood there contemplating what it was I maight have seen. I observed other aircraft approcahing and departing IAH. These craft were easily identifiable with the naked eye, red, green navigation lights, white beacons and landing lights, even lights on in the passenter cabin.  It was trivial to make out the outline (shadow) of the shape of overflying aircraft against the backdrop of stars and moonlit atmosphere. The orange object seen a minute before shared none of these traits. Every other questionable object I have ever seen in the sky finally resolved into something obviously of local origin... except this one.

It seemed to be moving at a pace equal to a typical jetliner, but when I got past the trees to get a real good look at it, it was completely gone.  The lights seemed to pulse rather than flash.  Mostly white but some were blue, green, and red.

It stayed in a genreral area moving back and forth.  It extended down from the sky to the lake and was very bright kind of like a strobe light.  It appeared to be thick in diameter and long given the distance out over the water.  As stated it would flash about once a second and move back and forth in the same general area.  It continued for about 30 minutes when it just stopped.  It did not look like a lighthouse due to the length of it and the way it moved from south to north and back again.

We have both observed many falling stars and both agree this was unusual in its bright intensity and blue color and direction of travel from south to north.

Directly above traveling in a east to west direction over San Jose and heading twards the coast I noticed four to five bright spheres. I focused on the birds again to make sure my eyes were not deceiving me, then back on the spheres. These objects were white and completely round in shape. No other characteristics were observed.It was hard to tell how fast they were moving. They were traveling in a box formation. One trailing object moved from left to right over another and then moved back to its original position. It was at this time I decided to go in the house a get my binoculars, when I returned they were gone.

We were going to be late for curfew so we were in a hurry. there were no cars coming in either direction. We were driving along and something caught my peripheral vision to the north. We saw about 5 or 6 bright lights coming up from the ground behind the tree line they were so bright they looked like spotlights shining straight up into the air. I was freaking out telling her to stop so we could see what that was so we slowed down considerebly then these lights started to turn in a complete circle all at the same time. We were both going Oh my God what the hell is that?!!! Then the lights just started crisscrossing over one another very fast. I was still begging her to stop so we could watch them but she was afraid of getting in trouble for being late for curfew already so we just drove off.

I was like WHAT THE HELL IS THAT!!! and told my friend to stop the truck so we could see she wouldn&apos;t stop partly out of fear of her parents and the fact she did not know what we were seeing but we did slow down to about 10 miles per hour there were no cars in either direction as far as we could see which was unusual. The lights started to turn around in a big circle  they stayed in their posistion but the whole thing was turning slowly at first then very fast.

It was dark, and me and one of my good friends had to retrieve something from the woods surrounding the Center (of course, we weren&apos;t allowed in the woods, but we went anyway). We were walking towards where we had our campsite and my friend stopped me suddenly. &quot;Check it out! Two werewolf (?) type beings just floated across!&quot; He shouted. I was looking down at the time, so I cannot acknowledge if he indeed saw this. We continued on when we spotted a UFO on the ground, barely discernable. The shape of it was roughly that of a saucer. It was doing nothing, just sitting there, silent. Strangely, no lights or anything else that could provide illumination was present on, around, or near it. It was more like we could see it since our eyes were adjusted to the dark (Since we didn&apos;t really want to get caught, we had no flashlights). We advanced slowly, hoping to get a closer look at it. No such luck. We stopped in our tracks when we realized it had disappeared! We glanced at each other, and moved on. We got close to where our material was when something compelled me to get out of there and FAST. I took off running and my friend was not too close behind. As I was running, I looked over my shoulder and spotted a tall, dark, large-headed being with a dark robe on and it&apos;s hands folded in front of it. I did not stop to talk to it or get any closer.

It was extremely fast for what would pass for an extremely bright satellite. The path was not predictable as a satellite is. The whole time I watched it, it never left &quot;Its area&quot;.  The light had a range or area it was flying, very small in the sky.  If you held your hand  outstretched, you could easilly cover the whole area.

Since we were heading toward the causeway we had an unobstructed view of these objects.  They appeared to me to be silvery and I asked my girlfriend if they looked to be in a haze and she thought perhaps they were.  I looked up through the sunroof of the car and saw the moon as clear as could be....there was no haze in the sky.  We continued to watch the objects, which appeared to be side by side.  They then separated for a bit, moving very rapidly.  Then after about 3 minutes or so they darted towards the north and disappeared in the blink of an eye.  These objects seemed to be very large.  At first I wondered if they were military aircraft, as we were heading towards McDill AFB in Tampa.

The light on the left was slightly lower than the one on the right. There was no sound from the objects and they appeared stationary 45 degrees above the horizon. We had seen dozens of small aircraft and large jets before and after this sighting and could hear their engines as well as see the red and green wing lights, the strobes, and the landing headlights. The two objects I am writing about had no colored lights, no flashing strobes, and made no sound. I definitly felt they were nothing I&apos;d ever seen in my 38 years on this earth.

Glowing object stationary for 6 to 7 minutes. Object turns on end, then turns to show triangle shape with bright light on one end then disappears instantly to the west.I was driving down Hiway 6 heading to Holstein with my son.  We noticed a very bright light ahead in the west.  It was about 6:05pm and the sun had gone down, but the sky was orange and clear with no clouds. We noticed that the object was not moving, there were two jets farther west behind the object, which I used to judge size. The object was very large and was stationary for 6 to 7 minutes.  As we turned south off of Hiway 6 on to the junction road that leads to Holstein we kept our eye on the object, which seem to be turning in place on end, to give it a long shape that look like a long glowing cylinder. Then the object turned again and we could see that it was a triangle shaped object, with a very bright light on one of the points.  We were head for the next gravel intersection road to turn west to watch the object.  We turned right and while we were watching the object, it seemed to dim a bit, then it was gone instantly.  We proceeded down the road further, but there was no sign of anything.  This object seemed to be very large and was definitley triangle shaped from our last view of it.  It was very impressive.  It was not dark out yet, and the sky was clear, so there is no doubt that we saw something very unusual.", "The object was very clear, no haze, no distortions, and silent. It was lighted with multiple colors on its bottom, remeniscent but not identical to the movie close enounters of the third kind. There was no energy phenomenon surrounding it as in that movie. I saw no occupants, and it was gone after a brief time. As it went behind the tower closer to the ocean, I walked down Ohua Avenue crossing this street wishing to see if it were still there behind the building. Going across Kuhio Avenue, I looked but saw nothing. If I had a camera that could have photographed what I saw, I believe it would be the most convincing UFO photograph on record.Since early April 1983 I have been aware by direct experience that we are not alone. On an early evening walk in Waikiki, Honolulu Hawaii, I witnessed a brief encounter with a UFO that appeared quite jeweled. Its multi colored lights and freedom from any sound whatsoever is entered into my own life of perceptions. It appeared right between the twin Banyan Towers on Ohua Avenue, on my left hand side while I walked towards the ocean. Hundreds of people must have had an opportunity to witness this sighting, if anyone looked out their windows. I am hopeful someone will reconfirm my sighting.. I walked ahead after it flew past that tower, and I crossed the street to go around and look for it. It was gone. It was the most vivid impression I have ever had, and the only time in my life I have witnessed the wonder of this apparently extraterrestrial technology. Once you have actually witnessed the phenomenon, you simply cannot believe every debunking of it by the conventional media. If anyone was staying at the Banyan Twin Towers on Ohua Avenue at Kuhio Avenue in April of 1983 please let me know if you also had a sighting. P.S. This is only one experience. It is a wide universe, and the possibilities are open. I also have a notion that some civilizations have progressed socially and even morally along with their gadgets to be emminently proto human. At the same time I note that a great deal of anti-social conduct demonstrates the gravity of science at times outweighing the relationship of any and all sentient beings to one another. Philosophically this is the greatest weakness of social strucutures that may tend to abandon notions of consanguinity inherent to a vital existence. I feel deeply sorry for UFO occupants who exist with such a poverty of social understanding, and even moreso that with all their technology that they are worse than primates in our worst apparent understandings of the term. At the same time I have an intuition that those occupants in my sighting may have been socially adept, even a moral set of civilization.", "Summary : we saw a saucer shaped object with a halo around it behind it followed three jets with after burners engaged colors appeared to be blue and red.

The morning of the sighting I got up to use the bathroom and saw the Orion constellation was incredibly bright and beautiful that morning so I stepped out onto our rear deck to view it, as soon as I stepped out onto the deck this object, impossible to miss was hovering directly in front of me at the tree line.  It wasn&apos;t moving and it wasn&apos;t making any sound.   It was about 30 feet in width in direct proportion with the side of a hockey puck.   It was split in precise halves, one side red the other blue, with a string of very bright, strobe bright, lights horizontilly through the center of the object.  It just hung there for some minutes.

One at the front, then two,  then three.  It then changed direction, the point of the triangle headed northwest. I could again see the blue side. It then went out of sight behind a stand of trees.

An oblong bright blue (cigar shaped) object had appeared in the sky from what seemed out of nowhere.  It was stationary in the sky for perhaps less than a second and then accelerated and disappeared again it what seemed a split second.  When I saw the object appear in the sky, my first reaction was to point at it and comment on it to my father (he is a law enforcement officer)  But before I could even say a word the object had disappeared.  Both of us remained speechless.  After a minute or two I asked him if he had seen the object and what he thought it was.  We were both astonished and speechless which perhaps explains the initial silence.  We had both commented on the bizaar sight and suggested that it had been an UFO. I was quite suprised by my father&apos;s suggestion and acknowlegdement that it may have been an UFO.  We have never spoken a word to one another about it since that day. It just seems too awkward.

It appears to be roughly oval in shape with what might be a triangular construction on top.  The triangular region seems to be highly reflective, while the lower oval portion of the overall object is dark and featureless. I have ruled out the possibility of lens contamination, it only appears on the one frame, and there were no rockets in the air at the time, and no other persons in the area.  Noone from the group remembers seeing anything, and we were all suprised by the photo.", "Witnessed glowing sphere land in middle of urban area, had confirmation from authorities.This took place in the summer of 1972, possibly mid-august, in Toronto Canada.  On summer visit to grandmother&apos;s house there, I and my best friend (teenagers at the time) noted that the dark kitchen was lit up like daylight at 1 a.m... but it was strange orange light... running to window, we saw enormous orange sphere more than six storeys tall landing in an open ravine area beyond local business district, which was visible from the window there. We watched for some time as the craft settled slowly into the clearing beyond apartment buildings 2 blocks away... no sound, but so bright it lit up the whole neighborhood. When it landed, one could still see the top of it over top of the apt blocks (hence estimation of more than 6 storeys tall when landed)... We had NO fear, wanted to go down there and see up close, but grandmother and aunt woke up in our commotion and forbid us to go. Grandmother (a retired school teacher) and Aunt (a CBC television costume designer) saw craft as well as us. Called my parents in California to get my Dad to aid in keeping us girls in the house, he remembers this call. Aunt suggested I call police. Police operator answered and I suddenly lost my voice, didn&apos;t know what to say... stammmered umm umm... she said &quot;you calling from Forest Hill?&quot;  I said I was.  &quot;You calling about the flying saucer&quot; I said I was.  (her words)   &quot;Can you see it now?&quot; I said I could. &quot;Can you see the hi rises from where you are?&quot; I said I could. She then said &quot;Everyone in those hi-rises has already called us.&quot;  She went on to tell me that they were telling people to stay in their houses, and that patrol cars were in the area to investigate. We watched for more than another hour, the craft still visible on the ground beyond the hi rises.  Eventually my aunt made us go to bed. We lay on the floor and listened to Toronto all night talk radio, and all the calls were about the sighting. Eventually we fell asleep on the floor in front of the radio, waking at daybreak, at which point we ran down to the area, and found NO signs of anything. No flattened grass, singed ground, nothing.  We tried to call talk radio and got told that  &quot;they were taking no more calls about flying saucers. Toronto is a busy city and there is lots more important stuff going on.&quot; There was nothing in either newspaper (telegram or star) and we called both newsrooms to be told that reputable papers didn&apos;t bother with silly nonsense like flying saucers. We called the police and were told that the night before there were some reports of some sort of prank in our area (Forest Hill Village - an upper class neighborhood in the middle of the city) but that investigating officers had found no signs of anything out of the ordinary. The Sphere was perfectly round, noiseless, and glowed with an amazing shade of pure clear orange light that entirely lit up the neighborhood bright as day.  It took about 20 minutes to land gently in the field beyond the aprtments. The field is still there 20 years later, between Spadina and Bathhurst, this took place just beyond the intersection of Lonsdale and Spadina in the middle of Forest Hill there... After it landed we could still see the top of it over the buildings between it and us, but with no movement and no sound, after a couple of hours we were almost bored, and frustrated that we were not being allowed out of the house for a closer look. The police operator told me that everyone in these hirises (also visible to us) had called them, she seemed to be caught up in it at the moment, I consider the police operator to have verified this sighting to me. I have filed reports of this sighting with a few other researchers and groups over the years, because I can&apos;t believe I&apos;m the only witness still around, it had to have been seen by many people, the police operator told me their lines were ringing off the hook... (remember in &apos;72 they didn&apos;t have caller ID even at the police station, she ASKED me if I was in Forest Hill) Today I am 41, mother of a teenager, work as the station manager of a local cable company community access television channel here in B.C.&apos;s gulf islands... am college educated, don&apos;t drink or smoke... I know what I saw, remember the entire incident vividly. The aunt and grandmother who saw this with me are dead now, but my father is here and alive and remembers the telephone call from my aunt when my friend (who is traceable) and I were so intent to go outside and get a closer look at this &quot;object&quot;", "While fishing off of the north coast of Kauai, Hawaii we saw a metalic sphere moving at a very high rate of speed in a North Westerly direction. The object stayed in view for about three minutes before going out of sight over the horizon.", "Explosion of a bright white very high flying &quot;Torroid&quot; shaped craft.Dear Sirs, Since I assume that you are the agency responsible for monitoring the airspace over North America I would like to report the following. On Sunday evening May 17, 1998 my wife and I and a friend and his wife wittnessed the explosion of what appeared to be a very high flying aircraft.  It was located in a N-NW direction from Belle Vernon, PA at about 70 degrees elevation. We watched the object, which was more of less stationary (we had no real reference), from 8:10 PM until 8:50 PM.  At that time I witnessed the object explode leaving a cloud of debris which consisted of many small fragments and one larger &quot;dark red ball&quot; which a few seconds later, split into two smaller fragments. The general apperance of the aircraft was that of a &quot;glowing torriod&quot; with the center being darker than the outside. If you have any information I would appreciate your letting me know what it was that we saw. Please feel free to E-mail me if you desire additional information regarding the event.", "Summary : Saw what I believe was a shooting star or space debris. It came down from North to South.

She explains it as a fire in the sky.  The object moved extremyly slow.Approximately @ 5:00pm, Two 10-year old Bremerton girls explained to their mother that there was fire in the sky.  The mother replied with out looking that it was the sun setting.  They kept insisting no.  So I and my signifigant other ran to the window to see a bright light in the sky.  In the south direction.  Possibly over the Lions Park or PSNS base.  I ran back to my bedroom and grabed my binoculars.  I ran out front and looked up into the sky.  I seen to bright yellowish-orangish lights.  They did not appear to be conneceted, but decseding together.  My first thought was meters, but they traveled in unison and extremly slow.  I then tried to get an even better view and at this time they just disappeared.  I have waited to hear of the sighting on the news, but no claims have been made.  Here in Bremerton wondering?! What?!  Although my signifagant other thinks it was meters.  Then why haven&apos;t they been reported??", "Flying Object came from the north heading southI took a Garbage bag to the alley when comming back I happend to be looking upward and saw an object comming toward me . It was very low and getting larger fast. It was about 500-800 ft a.g.l. moving from north to south at a very constant speed and heading. as it passed over me I could clearly see three cylinder shaped lights going into the craft with the light being very dull yellowish color. Also as it went over the stars disappered behind it, giving me an outline of its shape. This thing did not make a sound and it did not have any navigation lights. I estimate the size of the object being the same size as a four engine airliner. What really buged me was even if the engines were shut down it was close enough that I should have heard the air rushing around its frame. It went out of sight after about 10-15 seconds and the only thing I could do was verify the time it happend, 11:00 p.m.", "I was at my residence when I and two other subjects observed a green fireball proceed from the West to the East. The green fireball was observed to be &quot;very&quot; bright and was observed to have a long tail following the main part of the fireball. I have seen these green fireballs on other incidents but I have never reported any of these observations due to the fact that I thought that they were just meterors.There really is not much more information to say about this observation other than it was a bright green color. The observation was brief as it was moving at a high rate of speed from the West to the East. I&apos;m currently a police officer for a local city police department in St. Clair County, Michigan. I have been a police officer since 1991 and have witnessed one other strange observation way back on 1984 in Livonia Michigan which was also witnessed by two other subjects. The incident was reported in our local newspaper (Livonia Observer and the Detroit News). I can supply dates and times if you are interested. I became a member of Mufon several months ago and I&apos;m aware of several of the reports out there about &quot;Green Fireballs&quot;. I also listen to Art Bell and have heard Peter Davenport on the radio concerning these incidents. I decided to finally send you this report after hearing other people report similar  observations.", "perfect triangle, approx 10-15 metres big moving at approx 70 mphI was opening my front door when I just got back from a friends then i looked back and saw something in the sky. I then observed it better and saw that it was a triangular shaped craft with 3 red light (one on each tip of the triangle). It moved quite slowly, approx. at 70 miles an hour (the speed of those small prvate planes) at the height of approx. 30-40 metres above some of the houses. The sky was pretty clear, a few clouds high up in the sky (it was night time). This hasn&apos;t been my first sighting, I think in the last 3-4 years I have had about 20 sightings varying from triangle ones to saucer shaped ones, tho this is the first one I&apos;m reporting.", "I saw 3 bright, parallel red lightst 30 degrees above the horizon, lighting up one at a time from right to left. They covered a large portion of the sky.This is the second entry I have made to your sight.  I have been unable to find my previous entry listed and, being concerned that it somehow got lost, am transmitting a second.  This event occured October 30th, 1996.  I sighted the phenomenon alone ( I don&apos;t count my 2 year old son as a witness) but talked with 3 other people in the area who saw similar occurences.  The event was also broadcast on the local TV news and Wichita Eagle newspaper so you should be able to corroborate it.  According to the news, the majority of the sightings occured in Winfield Kansas which is about 20 miles south. At approximately 6:20 P.M. I was driving east on 47th street south, out of Wichita Kansas, about 3 miles west of Rose Hill road with my son.  I noticed three parallel bright red lights, east-south-east, about 30 degrees up from the horizon.  They covered a sizable portion of the night sky and if they were attached to the same craft, it would have been huge.  They lit up, one at a time, from right to left five to six times which took about 30 seconds.  I then noticed smaller, what appeared to be sparkling, red lights just to the right of the furthest southern (right) light.  They spread out and dissipated quickly.  The bright lights made one more sweep from right to left and then stopped.  I continued to monitor that section of the sky as I headed east but the lights did not return. Ten minutes later I arrived home, 4 1/2 miles east of Rose Hill on 180th street.  I got out of my car and started to go to the other side to get my son out.  As I did so I noticed very bright white lights straight east.  They appeared to be in a tight cluster and were oscillating.  As I watched they broke apart and dissipated.  I then noticed a line of multi-colored lights parallel to the horizon.  They were approximately 10 degrees above the horizon and slowly sank.  They then disappeared.  About two seconds later I observed more birght white, clustered lights that were above where the multi-colored line appeared at maybe 15 degrees above the horizon.  These disappeared only to light up again after about 5 seconds.  They appeared to sparkle for a few seconds and then dim down.  After another 5-10 seconds the wihite lights returned for another few seconds and died down as they had done previously.  I waited 15-20 seconds and then ran in the house to find another witness.  By the time we came back outside, the lights were gone and did not return.  I did however, see several airplane lights circling the area for atleast 15 minutes.  After 15 minutes I went back inside the house.  I called the Rose Hill police who said they had no other reports.  Shortly afterwards I heard about Winfield residents reporting strange lights on the nightly news. I called the Winfield police to report my sighting.  The dispatcher said that she had indeed received several similar reports that evening but did not take my report and did not seem concerned.  I attempted to call McConnell Air Force base, which is only 3-4 miles from my original sighting, but was unable to contact anyone. At the time of the sighting I was 35 years old.  I am divorced with a 3 year old son.  I have a college degree and am employed as a financial analyst with a large aircraft manufacturing company.", "2 triangle craft over OKC. 1 travled N to S. 2 traveled W to E. The craft were very high, could only see their shape with binoculars. Each had six lights down the side of the craft.I was out sky watching with binocular when I saw two lights very high and relativly close together in the sky.  It was a clear night and the visability was excellent.  I got my binoculars on the object traveling north to south first and as I was facing east the object was traveling from left to right in my field of view.  I quickly noticed approximatly 12 white or yellow lights, 6 running down each side of the craft in a V or triangular shape.  I almost could not believe what I was seeing.  There was this V shaped craft that had to be huge considering how high it was.  Without the binoculars I could have easily just passed the lights off as airline traffic.  But the craft were were large enough to easily make out the triangle shape with binoculars. Especially when I began to look at the other craft, which actually still closer to me than the one heading south. The second craft was heading east and was moving directly away from me, giving me a perfect view of the V shape.  And I would have to say that a V is a better discription of the craft than triangular because the craft seemed longer rather than wider.  Each craft proceeded in a slow steady manner and I remembered thinking how can these two ships be flying over OKC and there seemed to be no other planes up and interested in them.  I also thought that two identical craft passing each other the way they were was odd, almost like they were mapping something. I watched the two craft for 4-5 minutes before both were completly gone from view.  I wanted to call someone about the incident but never did.  I did report the sighting some months later to the local MUFON chapter but they never made a report either.", "I SAW  SOMTHING THAT WAS FLASHING RED BLUE AND GREEN LIGHTS.

We saw them from our car, and they hovered over the building in a tight triangular formation.  We tried to explain it away as an airplane, but airplanes don&apos;t hover in midair.  Thus, this 3-lighted-orb triangular formation still defies explanation.  The sighting lasted about 2 minutes.  We saw the same lights a couple of hours later (when we were leaving the church after a concert); these things were still hovering over it!The object consisted of a tight triangular formation of 3 white orbs of light. The lights hovered in their formation over a church building as we were approaching it in our car. There were three of us in the car heading to that church for a Christmas concert (12/14/97). Two of the observers (sister and mother) are skeptics who do not believe in the existence of UFOs.

Saw a blazing white light enter field of vision from east, moving to west.  A dead pine tree served as a reference point.  Object halted behind the tree.  The motion of falling leaf was observed briefly.  Object stayed in sky throughout sighting.  Feeling some compulsion to go outside, I watched it from the back yard for what I thought was only a few minutes.  The weather was cool and I was not fully clothed, so felt cold.  I noticed the object seeming to drift slightly westward, still looking like bright blazing star.  Suddenly it moved about 90 degrees to the west, without transiting.  Tired, cold, I went in, sleepy finally, and went to bed.  Told someone the next day at work about it, got laughed at and forgot it for three years.  The book Communion was published, the cover startling me and triggering a memory of that night.  For two more years I thought about it often, reading Communion and some other things on UFOs.  In 1989 I had a hypnotic regression to the night in question, remembering in detail being taken up through the air to the object, taken aboard, examined, having communication with the occupants, including some joking and prophecy.  The object appeared to have a considerable amount of detail on both the outside and inside.  The occupants were short, gray-brown in color, and wearing red suits with black trim and some sort of smooth, tight-fitting head gear that seemed to cover a part ot their faces. They stood away from the table I was placed on, behind a half-wall.  A scanning device examined me.  I got a very good look at it such that I can see it as I write this.  There were several instances of the occupants joking with me to relax me and quell my fear.  There was an instance of forced physical paralysis with total loss of muscle control.  I kept my eyes closed during much of the experience.  At the end, two of them floated me back to the yard between them.  I was unable to look closely at them out of fear, and had a screen memory of their appearance.  The content was bizarre, odd, and frightening.  I left the hypnotherapy session very upset.  For several years subsequently I had a hard time with the memory.  The session was taped.  I transcribed the tape and studied it carefully.  There was an internal coherency but the content was very unusual.  Later, I read that the things that the occupants discussed (telepathically) were not so unusual in abductions.  I saw another clinician, a published author and psychiatrist who studies paranormal events.  Two more abductions were uncovered, going back to childhood.  Another emerged spontaneously.  One of them explained a mysterious short term leg paralysis that I had as a child.  Many pieces fell into place about bad memories from childhood, fear of windows at night, always looking into the night sky, and three previous sightings I had had.  Of those, one was multiple witnessed by parents and their friends.  No subsequent UFO activit! y occurred to me.  My sense of the occupants was that they were insincere, though trying to appear to be genuine and helpful.  I did not like what happened, feeling violated.  I was 36 years old at the time of the last event.  The others occured at 12, 8 and 4 years of age.  I am a trained, State licensed psychotherapist and a trained, State certified hypnotherapist, practicing now for thirty years.  I do not, nor have I ever, talked about the UFO encounters or my interest in them, nor is there any visual cue in my office that would tip off a patient that I would be amenable to a discussion of same.  Since the event and the hypnotic regression, a patient came to me who subsequently requested hypnotherapy and was surprised to reveal a tremendous amount of encounters going back to her age of four years.  Multiple family members were also involved, three of whom (two sisters and mother)I was able to interview and study hypnotically.  The mother had a conscious waking memory of her experience, which happened also when the daughter was four.  A sister only could remember the screen memory of a wolf&apos;s face at the window.  Another sister remembered from childhood a screen memory of white horses with large, black, glassy eyes staring at her inside her bedroom, then chasing her across the house.  These sessions went on with this patient for over one year, often meeting three times a week for two to three hour hypnotherapy sessions.  Finally, I had to steer it to a close, as I had become drained and emotionally upset by it.  The woman&apos;s children were also being abducted, all of whom I saw in the office and who talked about their experiences.  This experience, of treating this patient who was such an active percipient, was exhausting personally, although did serve to relieve the patient of significant disabling symptoms.  My sense of the occupants of her objects was that they were not benevolent.  Such was also the impression held by the patient.  I will be happy to send the transcript of my experience with any other material requested by mail.  No phone calls or email, please.", "I went out to lock my car at 11:33 PM on September 2nd and saw a white disk shaped object streak across the northern sky.The sighting was about 11:33 p.m. Sept 2, 1998.  White luminous disk traverses 70% of the northern horizon from east to west in 1 to 2 seconds parallel to horizon.  It was too high to be a plane over the Portland Airport yet quit low and too parallel to the horizon to be a shooting star.  Within 10 seconds another (more faint) object was seen traveling at a high rate of speed (yet much slower) in a northerly direction over (what I would call) the coastline of Oregon.  This was too fast to be a plane but much slower than the east-west object.  Yet both objects had a similar destination west of the coastline of the Northwest U.S. and disappeared.", "brass/gold sparkling, no tail taveling east to west, rather slowly. tennis ball size at arms lenght in size, low in the horizon, no sound.

There was alot of activity around the base ,like spot lights moving around frantically.The car in front of me slowed down to observe so i passed and got away . Isaw enough of the object to know i didnt want to get any closer to it.", "A bright blue object that streaked across the southern sky from east to west.I was indoors and happened to catch it pass to the south of my location through a large picture wiindow. It was traveling from east to west at a high speed. The color of the object was blue and it had a tail behind it. My guess is that it was a large meteor that I witnessed. No sound since I was indoors at the time. And I couldn&apos;t see if it looked like it impacted on the ground either. Kind of unusual to see a large meteor like that this time of the year. Haven&apos;t heard of any scheduled showers to be seen. Could be like what was reported over Colorado recently. If you are interested in hearing about a sighting that occurred on 08/17/69 over the San Fernando Valley of California then pleaase let me know and I will post it here. That sighting of seven large orange colored objects in formation was definitely much closer and had some very strange aspects to it. I witnessed it along with about six other persons. At the time, we did report it to the Air Force and all they said was, &quot;We don&apos;t know what they are.&quot;", "A friend and I were driving and saw something odd in the sky coming towards us. We pulled over along with some other people to watch.A friend and I had left work in the valley to run up to the northside to pick something up and bring it back to our work. It was getting close to closing time so it was probably around 10:30pm when we were headed south on the old Argonne highway. I was driving and I happened to look out my window. I spotted what looked like headlights  shining thru the trees on top of a mountain. I said to my friend, &quot;look at that car on the mountain&quot;. I then realized that it couldn&apos;t be a car because if a car was up there we wouldn&apos;t have been able to see it&apos;s headlights.Then we quickly noticed that it was moving in the sky heading our way. We saw a couple of cars pulled off the road ahead and people were standing outside watching so we pulled over too. We were shivering by then, excited and scared at the same time cause we couldn&apos;t figure out what it was. The only thing I really remember is the lights. It had a center light big and round and two smaller lights one on each side of the middle light. They were bright white lights. It came right towards us moving very very slow and I heard a very very faint hum. It seemed so close, like if I craweled to the top of a tree I could have reached out and touched the bottom. I don&apos;t really remember seeing the actual craft, but in my mind I know it was like a round disk not flat but maybe with a slighly rounded belly to it, but the lights were so bright you couldn&apos;t see it anyway. It passed over us and continued on and we all stood there dumbfounded our hearts racing until we couldn&apos;t see it over the treetops anymore. All of us that were standing there just looked at each other and said wow, what was that. My friend and I got into the car and headed back to work, we had the creeps the rest of the night. I had no knowledge of any aircraft that could fly so low, quiet and slow. Before this incident I saw the same type craft when I slept over at a different friends house one summer. It must have been the summer of 77, I was fifteen at the time. We were in our sleeping bags in the backyard. It was late maybe 11:00 pm. We were laying there talking and staring at the stars. There were alot of trees in her neighborhood and in her yard. Anyway we were just laying there looking up at the beautiful stars and then we saw this craft pass over us so slow, virtually no sound and the same lights as I described before. We were so scared, we waited for it to pass over before we lept up and raced into the house screaming and freaking out. We jumped into her bed and pulled the covers over our heads. This one was also flying very low, seemed like treetop level. Too close for comfort! Of course we told everyone but no one believed us. I am now 36 years old and have not seen anything like this since, although I would like to. My grandmother lives in Newman Lake , Wa and she has watched crafts play what she calls war games over her house. I wish I could have been there to see that! Don&apos;t know how often it has happened but I know she&apos;s observed them several times. I think she said these were colorful lights and they would zoom through the sky doing quick turns and racing back in the opposite direction. This wasn&apos;t just a brief display, these war games lasted maybe 45 minutes or so.", "Was walking dog, noticed in eastern sky 2 crescent shaped objects. flying side by side , with the right one slightly ahead.I was walking my dog at 10:50 p.m. The sky was clear and I was watching out for shooting stars when I notice coming from the east ( if I were to point at them,  my arm would be at a 45 degree angle...NOTE; the angles are given as if straight up is 0 degrees) two objects. These objects were crescent shaped with the horns toward the back. Both had a soft whitish glow to them, and both wavered or wrippled like reflections off of a pond .They crossed over me so that my head was at a 10 - 15 degree angle. The objects where silent and left no trails behind them, the top object was slightly ahead of the other. They would drift toward each other with the two inner crescent horns over lapping .They did this 3 to 4 times. The objects disappeared heading west. They faded from view at the same 45 degree angle as when they came into view. There was a jet ( I believe passenger) flying close by. To me the jet and objects appeared no more than 1 to 2 inches apart. The objects gave me the impression of being lower than the jet..though they did not pass between me and the jet. It was at this time that they faded from view. I am a 27 year old honor roll graduate of Greenville High School.  My hobbies include art, astronomy, biology, geology and many of the other sciences as well.", "2 bright lights moving toward us one lower the other. One turns and disappears leaving an illuminated doughnut shaped fog.  Then the other light did the exact same thing.Two bright white lights were obeserved by my wife, niece, and myself.  It was March 7, 1998 at 6:45 P.M. The lights were moving in a westerly direction at the same speed, but different heights. The light on the right was slightly lower than the one on the left. No sounds were coming from the lights.  They looked as if they were shining a light in a downward glow.  Suddenly the lower light on the right pivoted  approx 180 degrees and disappeared, leaving an illuminated doughnut shaped glow, that lasted approximately 10-15 seconds and then dissapated. The other light never stopped moving. It continued going in  the same direction at the same speed. for at least 15 seconds after  the doughnut glow disappeared.  Then just like the other light, it turned away from us and disappeared, leaving the same doughnut glow, which as the first, lasted around 15 seconds and dissapated as well. No object observed just 2 distinct lights.  After the lights turned away from us they simply disappeared, they didn&apos;t seem to fly away, or go in any direction, they just disappeared, leaving the dought shaped signature, and our thoughts running wild.  Like nothing we have ever seen before. This was also witnessed by our neighbors who were having a party. 10 of their guests also witnessed the lights.((NUFORC:  Probable missile launch.))", "While elk hunting South of town I sighted a huge object which was shiny like mylar or a mirror but seemed metalic. It was shaped like a (vitamin capsule) not really cigar shape more full. The object rose over a hill where I was looking for elk and sat just above the horizon for about 10 mins then kind of faded away. The object was huge maybe 300 feet long and 100 feet high. I was looking from the north but the object was a shiny as if it was in full sun. It rose very slowly almost as if a cloud. I&apos;m curious if objects like this have been seen before all I seem to hear about are discs and lights. This was real!As I said above I was elk hunting in the late fall of 1978 about 4 miles south of Virginia City, Montana. It must have been about 1600 or 1630. I was sitting on a south facing slope looking across a small valley perhaps 500 yards across. I was scanning the sparce timber just below the horizon when a huge (vitamin capsule shaped) object perhaps 300 feet long and 100 feet high, it may have been larger but those proportions are pretty close, and I&apos;m sure it wasn&apos;t smaller. The object was more shiny than metal it looked like mylar, or a mirror, in reflectance but seemed hard surfaced. The side I was looking at was facing north with the sun behind and to the right of it, but not visible, yet the object was as shiny as if it were in full sunlight. It was the brightest thing in the sky, much more intense than the sky. It seemed to rise very slowly and as it was doing so didn&apos;t alarm me, it was as if I were a child watching a cloud rise over a hill. As it rose up from behind the hill slowly it rose to a point maybe 100 feet above the horizon then gradually decended until part of it was below the horizon meaning it was on the north side of the ridge I was looking at giving me a sense of the scale against the hillside. I had no emotional reaction just ho hum which when looking back seems really strange. Anyway I sat there and watched the object for what must have been 10 minutes and honestly I don&apos;t remember how it disappeared. I just remember thinking that I had better leave to get back to the car before dark because I still had a ways to drive on an unimproved road before getting home.  That is another strange thing I then remember being about 200 yards from the sighting place causually walking down the trail totally unconcerned, not looking over my shoulder to see if it re-appeared or anything. When I got home I don&apos;t even think I told my wife which really puzzles me in retrospect. Normally we talked about everything. I am very curious as to whether any other people have seen an object such as this as it seems ! like all I hear about is saucer shaped objects or lights.", "2 incoming spheres of light with cone shaped mist eminating from all around the spheres.Standing facing east,the spheres were moving from east to west. They were at the same altitude and were moving at a high rate of speed together. The spheres of bright light were traveling parallel to the ground at approx. 30 degrees above the horizen. At 55 seconds one of the spheres seemed to disintegrate into a puff of mist. 5 seconds later the second one disintegrated as well in the same manner. The 3 observers were father,69; son,45; grandson,14.Many other people in Ft. Myers observed this as well and reported the sightings to the Southwest Florida Regional Airport.((NUFORC:  Report caused by missile launch at sea by U. S. submarine.))", "A Large Brilliant green fireball was seen &quot;fall to earth&quot; in the direction of the Long beach airport.There was no fire or evidence of a crash, so I assume the &quot;craft/fireball&quot; went into one of the many hangars present directly in the line of path of descent.It was at approximately 05:11 in the morning that i was on the way to work, I had been driving north for about 45 minutes on the 405 FWY. The morning was dark and it was foggy, the general area was illuminated by the city lights and was not very bright. As i was passing the Sign indicating that the Lakewood blvd off ramp was coming up, I observed  a brilliant green/white fireball with tail about the size of a silver dollar in my windshield. the angle of descent was approximately 40 degrees from left to right from the corner of my windsheild to approximately 6 inches above the base of my windsheild to about 3/4 of the windsheild along the base. It then totally disappeared. I estimate the distance approximately at 1-1.5 miles in front of me from where i was on the freeway The fog gave the fireball a fuzzy appearance around its perimeter. I tried to see if other drivers on the freeway had seen it, but at 70mph and in the darkness it was impossible to make eye contact with other drivers. &gt;From the angle of descent and approximate distance, i judged that the Fireball must have gone in the direction of the many hangars that occupy that airport and also face the freeway. Note: the speed of descent was rapid as if it were falling at great speed. I was expecting a fire or crash in the area of  the projected collision, but as i passed by , there were NO fires or explosions.  I found out that there was no one in the tower at that time, so i could not verify my sighting with anyone. I checked radio news and newspapers at the time ,but no mention of a crash. MY guess is that it was no meteorite( it was too big and there would have been fire), is that it may have been one of  our craft which may have been in trouble and had to &quot;land&quot; in the city under extraordinary conditions. I have since heard of fireballs in seattle and i figured i  would finally report it to someone, I figured the police would not accept a report.", "Object observed coming from SE at twilight, sky very clear and not yet dark. Object was white with small white core moving towards us (direction NW) and a cone shaped haze behind it.  It moved steadily towards NW then suddenly seemed to disolve.There were about 10 people around me at the time - in Island Park in Sarasota on the bayfront, a popular place for taking walks.  The sky was perfectly clear and calm, the sun had set in the west and it was dusk but not dark in the east.  We all saw the object coming towards us -- others saw 2 objects, I just saw the one.  I realized it was not a plane.  The only other possiblity was a launch from Cape Canaveral which we can see from our coast when it is clear.  Except, CC is further north and object launched from it leave a clear vertical vapor trail.  This object was very white with a cone-shaped white haze behind it - could have been moving quickly, it was hard to say.  I observed it for about 20-30 seconds then it suddenly seemed to disolve and disappear.  The front (core) part of the object was very solid, very real, it was not a trick of light or anything else we could figure out.  Afterwards I discussed it with a few others who had seen it -- no one had any idea what it could be.((NUFORC:  Consistent with missile launch.))", "While at lunch and sitting in my car I noticed an object moving across the Southern Sky.

The object was seen with the naked eye and 7x35 binoculars.  It was a dull red, more of a glow than an actual color.  it had an apparent length of maybe .25-.5 inches.  The shape was like that of a disk seen almost edge on.  The object was symetrical, appearing fuzzy at the edges, and the center was more focused and somewhat brighter.  These details were seen only through the binoculars, not the naked eye.  It maintained the same color and shape and orientation in the sky (meaning the object&apos;s flat shape stayed flat relative to the earth&apos;s surface, horizontal, never vertical or whatever).  It moved towards the north slightly, maybe only a few degrees.  As seen through the binoculars, the object hovered at times and jiggled or moved only slightly.  Then around midnight the object abruptly moved to the southeast, almost 45 degrees, where it stayed for about a minute, then quickly moved back to where it was before in the south.  I had a difficult time following the object due to it moving so fast.  It stayed around 35-45 degrees above the horizon.  The stars in the background (in the binoculars) were very out of focus, meaning the object was close to us, how close, it&apos;s difficult to say, a few hundred feet or thousands of feet, I don&apos;t know.  The object moved out of focus twice, causing me to adjust the focus of the binoculars.  It appeared to move closer, slightly growing in size, then back, all within a minutes time.  Then around 0:20, it dissapeared. I was a physics major in college, and I do a little amateur astronomy as a hobby, so I know the difference b/w a star or an airplane or a meteor or whatever and what it was that I saw.  I really have no clue as to what it was, but by it&apos;s motion and shape, it was NOT man made or some natural phenomenon.  The weather conditions were good, a little haze around the horizon, but clear otherwise.  So we had no trouble seeing the thing.  I am nearsighted, that&apos;s why I could not see it without the binoculars, but my brother has better vision than I, and he could see it quite well w/o aid.  My brother is 15 and I am 21.  We live in a rural area, so there are no extranious lights or other sundry things around that could ever be mistaken for a ufo.  Airplanes do come over our area quite frequently, but at high altitudes.   Because we see planes as often as we do, we definately know the difference b/w one and what we saw.  Plus, the object didn&apos;t blink like the lights on a plane do.  Or move in a specific pattern, either.  Simply moved around and glowed the same shade of dull red the whole time, staying in the same general area, except when it moved over to the southeast.", "Object was hovering briefly, turned about a 45 degree angle, stayed there a moment then disappeared.It was a bright, clear late afternoon and my wife and myself were driving thru St. Mary&apos;s location.

It was on a Sunday 5:30 p.m. on 101 hwy south.  We saw this shiny greyish object about 30 to 40 feet in diameter next to the edge of SanFrancisco Bay.  The reason why we noticed it was the field had caught a fire.  Then the object took off almost in a 45 degree angle straight toward us which was west and it was moving at such a great speed that after a few moments it just got smaller and smaller until it dissapeared.  The saucer was totaly quiet.  It had no lights that we could see and it left the grass field totaly burning.  My Father was an opperating engineer all his life.  He always wanted me not to talk about it because people would think that we were crazy or something.  And for myself I am 56 years old and don&apos;t care what they say.  My Dad is passed away so there is no one else that could back me up except if anybody like fire departments, the farmers, or anyone else that had seen the fire, or the saucer itselt.

One such morning I looked to the north and saw a light sweeping across the sky with a very slight undulating path. I pointed it out and we all speculated what it might be. (this was a bunch of pretty smart guys due to our mission) We discounted inversion reflections, F-86D with afterburners (no satellites yet!) meteors. While speculating, here comes another one! Well for three nights in a row, we saw 4 to ten in one night. Although they were comeing from different parts of the norther horizon, they seemed to vanish pretty nearly the same place on the southern. (as determined by a fiducial point, an antenna)The path, when check on a map, was straight across the libyan desert crossing the Tbilsi Mountains.I did talk to an airman at the A C &amp; W squadron (radar) after hearing the F-86D&apos;s scramble obviously in response to these odd lights. He said, &quot;Oh, Yeah.

One was close to a cloud, and dissapeared behind the coud. The other just went out. We thought they were rocket boosters from the Cape, but there was no con or smoke trail.We were part of a group of German Folkmusik enthusiasts, in a tour bus, from Stylus Transportation, traveling from the Riand Continental Hotel to the Disney&apos;s Wide World of Sports Field house, to see an Austrian music show called The Musikantenstadl. I am sure of the time because we were about five minutes from the event, and we exited the bus at the event at 18:50. I looked out the window of the bus and saw the 2 fairly bright white lights, that looked to be about 30 feet in diameter in the sky to the left of the bus. I told my wife to look, and she asked what are those lights. The other people sitting on the left side of the bus also saw them. I thought as did other people on the bus, that they were rocket boosters from Cape Canaveral, although I made the comment that these are the first rockets I ever saw that have no propellant or con trail. It looked exactly like looking directly into the tail end of a rocket booster. We didn&apos;t give it any more thought until we returned to Los Angeles and saw a news report of the event on the Monday evening news and found out that there were no missiles fired from the cape. We saw both objects for about 2 minutes. The seemed to be about 300 yards apart, and one was next to a cloud, the other in the open sky.The light away from the cloud just went out about 5 seconds before the other light moved behind the cloud and disappeared.

They were going pretty slowly, and there were no windows or anything like that.  It made no noise. I had the distinct feeling that there was somebody(s) up there watching us--the street was full of children in costumes.

Had three flashing bluish/white lights that flashed in a counter-clockwise triangle.I, who was 13 at the time, and a friend who was 14 were camping out under the stars in my back yard. It was a mostly clear night with a full moon and some scattered high cirrus clouds. My friend saw the object first and immediately pointed it out to me. It was three strobe-like lights flashing in a counter-clockwise triangle. It was moving very fast across the sky from north to south. It passed over the scattered cirrus clouds, so I estimate it must have been above 50,000 feet in altitude. It would move irratically from side to side and diagonal while maintaining it&apos;s forward (southerly) course. It was as if it was actually jumping like a water bug. Since it was at least 50,000 feet in altitude, I estimate when it jumped it was jumping at least a couple of miles at a time. We observed the object until it cleared our horizon (until we could no longer see it). It was moving too fast for me to even run and get my telescope out of the house. It cleared our horizon in about 45 seconds time. A passenger jet at altitude takes nearly five minutes to clear our horizon. Taking that into consideration, this thing must have been moving at thousands of miles per hour. It didn&apos;t leave a contrail of any kind and it made no sound. I never actually seen the body of the object; all I could see was the lights, so I&apos;m assuming it was shaped like a triangle because of the pattern of the lights. The lights were not very bright -- they were like a strobe in the sense that they flashed similarly to a strobe but they were much softer then strobes. They were bright enough to see through the cirrus clouds when passing above them. I called the local Air National Guard and they refered me to a UFO reporting line, which I called and reported to. They seemed quite interested in my observation. I have never seen this object or anything similar since. It was a very exciting night for a couple of young teenagers.

I work at the saw mill, and she works for Safeway. Also, my mother and father were watching KCRA news on Channel 3. The luive &quot;sky cam&quot; was overlooking Sacramento on 06/04/98 at 12:20pm. Both of the also saw balls of lights in the clouds. They saw 2 sets of 2 balls emerge from the clouds together. They also saw a formation that appeared as the Big Dipper appears in the sky. Although they do have a VCR, the &quot;sky cam&quot; shots over Sacramento are very brief, allowing them to only observe the event. Haime Maussan has video of balls of light coming out of heavy cloud cover over Mexico City, some of them observing the planes closely. What are these things doing in the clouds? Thanks.", "Perfect disk with lights on edge; one side red, one side green: no sound No clouds, disk blocked out stars, moving S.to N.This happened in, or around, April of 1973.  I remember that it was close to my birthday.  The weather was mild and cloudless.  I think it was a Saturday night because my parents were out.  I was almost 12, a well read and responsible kid, with no more than a passing interest in the unknown. For some reason, I went out to my front yard (the house was in the 2500 block of Southgate Blvd, Houston,TX,77025)and looked straight up.  At that moment a large disk (red lights on one side, green lights on the other, not shiny, totally silent)passed directly overhead, blotting out the stars as it passed.  It moved in a straight line over my house towards the north and I watched it until it was out of sight:  total only about 30 seconds.  As it moved away it appeared to be completely flat, and not very thick: a true disk, like a discus or a coin.  Oddly, I wasn&apos;t alarmed.  I didn&apos;t tell my parents or anyone at school.  And I pretty much forgot about it until around 1981. I know this was not the Goodyear blimp; I had seen the blimp at night in our part of the city before.  The shape was wrong, and the blimp was far from silent at that altitude. The disk was well above tree height, in that neighborhood of tall pine trees.  My closest guess on the size and altitude would be 100&apos; across and 1000&apos; off the ground. I am hoping that others may have seen this.", "it came after me and my dog, i was walking him that nightHi my name is Jason and i&apos;am 16 years old.  Tonight 11:30pm. {3/27/98} I was walking my dog in my development {New York, in clifton park, 30 min north of Albany} when i noticed a bright yellow light.  At first iI thought it was a airplane but then it moved from side to side and then it got as small as a star then it got bigger again.  it started to move away so i walked down to the end of the street to get a better look at it.  The light started to get bigger and bigger and i started to make out the shape of what it looked like.  As it got closer to me i started to run away.  It was shining 4 or 5 spot lights around were i was but just for about 3 sec. then it was following me and then it crossed {behinde me which was the road i was standing on} it looked like a top hat but all the coners were cut of like if u take a square and off a coner of it, and it had just to lines for the door going from the bottom of it to the top.  It also had little windows around the whole thing.  As i looked at it as i was running it was coming down on a angle.  it was about a 100 feet from the tree tops. It had lights all around the whole ship and one on the top of the ship. As it got closer it had a mist of the color cyan around it.  As I ran back to my house with my dog i noticed i couldn&apos;t see it anymore because the trees were in the way.  When i got back to my house I told my dad what happened.  We went looking outside my dad saw the bright yellow light in the distance and it was heading north then dissapeared.  I have attached a picture that i have drawn of what i saw.  I would like to know if u had any pictures that looked like this one and if there was any other ufo sightings in that areaaround that time.  Thank you for your time", "5 Bright glowing balls with NO comet trail traveling at great speed from north to south over hawaian islandsWhile working as a security guard at puamana resot I was approaching the ocean pool to notify two guests that the pool area was closed. In front of me traveling north to south were 5 bright balls moving verryy fast andeqally spaced with no comet trail. I was stunned and amazed. The first thing i did was to ask th couple at the pool if they also saw this. They did and the three of us had a conversation . I let them stay in the pool...... I have never fogotton that night. I have spoken with many other people who have seen this . The hawaians call it THE FIREBALLS", "Brightly lighted craft hovering over us on Interstate 26.  Had lights shining down from the craft as well as lights shining up into the sky. It was quite low over our car and approximately the size of a large airplane.My two daughters (ages 17 and 10) and I were driving from West Virginia to Florida for vacation and at approximately 7:00p.m. March 10 we were east of Columbia, South Carolina, heading east toward I95.  In the distance, somewhat to the right of the highway we could see a very bright light in the sky.  At first we thought it was from a radio tower as its altitude seemed to be only about that high and it was stationary.  As we got closer we could see no tower, just this incredibly bright light hanging motionless. We kept driving toward it and the road somewhat curved to the right and the light was then right over the highway in front of us.  It looked at first like an airplane but when we were almost under it we could see the shape.  It had four distinct sides with the brightest lights on the points but with lights all along each side.  It was slightly elongated, like a diamond shape, with the ends pointing east/west.  There were lights similarly placed on the top of the craft which were shining straight up. We pulled off the road when we were directly under the craft so my daughter could get our binoculars and camera from the trunk.  When we stopped, the craft slowly started to move away, to the east, and before we could get the binoculars out, it picked up speed and moved away. We had a very good look at the craft when it was above us.  It was a clear night with no rain or fog and there was a nearly full moon.  The altitude of the craft was quite low...maybe 500 feet above us.  None of us had a clear look at the substance of the craft due to the intensity of the lights from it.  My younger daughter thought she could see the triangular &quot;wings&quot; but was not sure about that.", "Observed two shiny objects which resembled a child&apos;s top flying west to east in the twilight.I was standing on my front porch looking toward the north when I saw two glints moving along about 35 to 40 degrees above the horizon. I immediately ran into the hours and got a pair of 10 x 50 binoculars. Through the binoculars I could see that the objects were very shiny and shaped like a top, with the pointed portion down. They were moving at a steady rate of speed, but not especially fast. There were no signs of any sort of contrail or vapor coming from them.  My daughter, who was seven years old at the time, was outside and I hurriedly called her to come. I helped her hold the glasses and moved them around until she located the objects and her immediate comment confirmed my initial observation: &quot;They&apos;re tops, dad!&quot; she exlaimed. I watched these objects for three or four minutes until they faded from view. I would also note that shortly after I observed these objects, our pet dog--and every dog within earshot--began to howl and bark. I heard no sound whatsoever associated with the passages of these objects, although they were quite a distance away. I had the impression that they were perhaps two or three miles away at a minimum, which would have made them quite large. I should also note that I am a newspaper reporter and something of a trained observer and trained to give fairly accurate descriptions of events.", "in the backyard. I looked up and saw what I thought was a falling star.  It came to a stop and hovered.  Then it moved again. Then we noticed approximately 12-15 of these objects ( which looked like stars) moving across the sky.  We watched them for about two hours.It was mid-may, 1979.  I was in the backyard with my family, and I looked up to the sky.  I saw what appeared to be a falling star (meteor or meteorite) but contrary to the typical behavior of falling stars, this one came to a stop, and hovered.  It looked just like a star.  Then, to my surprise, another &quot;point of light&quot; moved across the path of the first object.  Altogether, my family and I watched 12-15 of these objects move around in the sky for approximately 2 hours.  We called my Aunt, who lived a couple of miles away, and told her to go outside and watch them.  She went outside, but was unable to see anything other than the normal night sky.  We called the police non-emergency number, and they said it was probably fireworks or airplanes. Please note: These objects were extremely high  in altitude and made no noise.  There were too many of them for them to be satellites. Later that summer, my mother was describing the incident to an old family friend ( a lutheran minister)  who lived in WIsconsin.  He told my mother that on that night he had been fishing on a lake in Wisconsin, and he had seen THE EXACT SAME THING.", "Observed 2 flickering white lights to the east 4 fingers above horizon moving erracticly.Light on left above right,right faded out fist then left disappeared.6 Adults sitting on a lanai in Port Charlotte Fl at about 7 pm and observed 2 white lights about 3 fingerbreaths apart moving erracticaly and skyward up.

We observed a target, unidentified, in Soviet airspace heading east at high speed. Our first thought was that it was some type of missile. We turned on the scope camera and notified the site commander. The object was estimated at 25000kt. The first contact was at about 200 miles, which would make it very high or very large.", "Sitting on the beach, a man yelled and told people to look at the sky.  many observed the craft. Material did not look like metalThe craft moved very quickly through the sky, it looked nothing like an airplane, and moved too quickly to be one.  Although it did move quickly, it was easy to see the craft in detail.  After about 15 min .  of following the craft it was gone.  The craft did not come close to land, it remained high in the sky.  The craft looked like a disk with three to four poles comming out of the top.  It did not look like it was made out of metal, but some other almost cloud like material. The craft was white. I was not able to see the material it was made of easily, as it was high in the sky on a very sunny day.  I know more people saw this.  The beach was crowded and many people were looking at the craft. I am a student at a nearby university", "Summary : I was watching TV in my brothers room when something in his window caught my eye.  At first it looked like a balloon in the far off distance, but then it just stopped and hovered.  I went downstairs to go outside and see it better.  I grabbed the binoculars and told my mom to come check it out. It started to move again to the  west, (coming from the north) in a straight line.  It then began to bob and weave in a way that no flying object I&apos;ve ever seen or heard of.  Through the binoculars it appeared to be very bright with a hint of a metallic, silver-type shade to it.  After about five minutes, we lost behind the clouds", "Headed north bound on Big Spring Street.35 to 40mph.

All we seemed to be able to do was watch, suddenly the light dimmed and the disk suddenly shot off to the north and two other lights joined the ffirst and all three shot off and disappeared. After that episode my sisters and I spent many nights in our sleeping bags watching for ufos. These were not weather balloones as we were told by the military and police.

We witnessed a VERY fast brilliant object moving across the sky behind the lights of Portsmouth, NH and head out to sea (the Atlantic). Within two or three minutes after the sighting, we witnessed a flight of four F-15&apos;s take off from Pease AFB on full AB. They proceeded in the same direction of the object. Thinking this was significant, we made a note in the topside log and notified Pease AFB operations that we could confirm the sighting. The next morning the ship&apos;s XO called us in and told us in no uncertain terms that we were not to play games with the Air Force and were then ordered to ammend our logbook entry. We were used to seeing F-15&apos;s take off from Pease during day and night. The object was many times faster than an F-15. It also did not in any way fit the profile of an F-15&apos;s afterburners. All we saw was a point of light moving very fast out to sea. This incident has remained a question in my mind because of the reverberations it caused in the Navy and Air Force chains of command.", "Summary : A  blue grayish kind of light.It was sometime in October when I spent the night at a friends house. Sometime in the early morning hours, I had awakened and looked out the window and saw this blue-gray light that had the apperance of drifting. (No unusual noise at all.) The diamater of this light looked to be the same as a pencil. I could not see a beam of anykind, but when  I started to get up to investigate, the light turned towards me (Clockwise looking down.) and shined in my right eye. The light was not like any I have seen before. It wasn&apos;t like a doctor&apos;s pen light, the light did not cause me to squint. The light didn&apos;t have to search for my eye, it went right to in a fraction of a second. Looking into the light, I could not see around the edges and in some way it reminded of chalk. The best I can remember, I only looked at the light about 1 second. Next thing I remembered, I didn&apos;t want to get up and go to the window anymore to investigate what was out there. That isn&apos;t like me, I am the type that would be the first one there, but after the light, I kept on  thinking to myself &quot;I can get up and look, but I don&apos;t want to.&quot; I didn&apos;t at that time felt that I was held back in any way. BTW, I didn&apos;t see any kind of craft.", "Unusual ights in distance. Approached until object overhead as wide as road and ditch. Bright lights, Turned head to find object in horizon. in horizon.On Labor Day, 1966 we were travelling to Saskatchewan for the holiday on Hwy 16 E about 30 miles out of town. My husband, myself, son almost two and I was pregnant.  Ahead we saw bright lights.  Since the road was straight, it was unusual.  We thought maybe a helecopter.  We slowed down and approached the lights.  As we got closer, we realized this object was very large and could not be anything we recognized.  We were going very slow as we approached this object.  It was very large.  It was as wide as a two lane highway with a curb and the ditch as well.  There were three rows of lights, the red being the most prominant.  We were calm and not frightned by this.  I was sitting up and looking up through the wind shield right under it and it was huge.  I told my husband to stop the car which he did.  I jumped out of the car, looked up and it was gone, and I could barely see it in the horizon.  The colors of the lights are vague, perhaps yellow or white, and green or blue.  The only sure color was red, for it seemed to be pulsing.  There were maybe 6 to 8 ports with lights in each color and 3 rows.  Less Rows on top to make the shape.  The lights were the only thing that gave it shape.  Like an upside down bowl. We continued on to Saskatchewan and mentioned it to my father and he had just read a book on UFO&apos;s and said it sounded like one.  I had never heard of such a thing.  Upon returning home to Alberta we ceased to talk about it, not to anyone, until one night a few months later, we had company, and we both realized that we had not told a sole.  So, we did.  Not long after this, both my husband and I were awoke in the middle of the night by a white light.  The house was light up like a flourescent light.  We lived by Half Moon Lake, and looked out to see what it could be.  There was a full moon that night, and the moon was reflecting on the lake.  The reflection of the moon was clear because it was a bit yellow, but there was another reflection, coming from where???  We phoned the Planitorium the next day to see if there had been a meterorite that night and they said no.  It was a frightning night!  After that, we basically left the experience alone.  I was due to have my baby in January, and while I was having her, I had a dream where I went some where.  It was so clear. There was someone talking to me and telling me why I had to go back. The doctors thought I may have had a near death experience, but I some- times wonder if it may have been from that experience.  I did go to a doctor and went under Hypnosis but nothing.  I always had the feeling that there had been more to this sighting that just seeing it. Myself and my two children all have Auto Immune diseases, myself, Multiple Sclerosis, My son, Chrones Disease and my Daughter a very serious Ulcerative Colitis. My daughter is a teacher, my son an Instrumentation Engineer and have done well academically.  I am unable to work.  This experience has never left my mind, and I am now living in the country and am always scared.  Jokingly I will say to my husband that I am sure in a good place for them to come at any time and check me out.  From my childhood, I have a good memory of an incident where I thought a &quot;Piece fell out of the Sky&quot; I wrote it down on a piece of paper and said I would retrieve it when I was a big girl and then people would believe me.  This is the first time I have told the Story and thought that it should be recorded some where.  I have since been divorced from the person driving the car, and have checked with him on different occasions to verify that it really did happen.  Another interesting thought was that at the time of the siting, we were not afraid at all. Also, when we were under it, I had my window opened, and there was not a sound.", "Seven narrow cylinders with tapered ends, flew in silent formation, from the south,due north. They appeared to have no single light. They glowed.On 3/11/98 at 10:03pm cst, my wife and myself were standing in our back(south-facing)yard, in the southwest side of Colorado Springs, Colorado. It was clear, moon nearly full, calm wind, 20 degrees. I looked to the west at about 30 degrees above the horizon at a group of stars to the north of Orion. As I turned back to face my wife something caught my attention inn the corner of my eye. I thought that it was a star cluster I had at first overlooked yet, there seemed to be movement. I turned to the west to squarely look at the object and discovered it to be moving at a steady rate of speed and altitude, from south to north. A path which came directly over Cheyenne Mountain and continued along the front range mountains until I could not see it any longer due to houses, etc.. When I first noticed that it was a moving object, I brought it to my wife&apos;s attention. She too percieved the same U.F.O.. At first sight it appeared to be a single chevron or delta winged configuration. However,the object consisted of seven cylindrical sections. Each cylinder tapered to nearly a point on each end. One in the lead with three others on each side. They were of a consistant grayish tone with perhaps a slight aura around each one. It was impossible to estimate the size or speed. First impressions were of a craft the size of a B-52 at about 5,000 feet, cruising at a speed consistant with approaching an airport for landing. Although, it easily could have been much larger and at considerably higher altitude. It was completely silent. There were no external lights. Preconceptions of aircraft flying with their wings perpendicular to the ground, at first, gave the impression that this was also true for this group of objects. Although it may have been a formation stacked vertically. I don&apos;t know. I&apos;m suggesting this because of the moon light at the time. The color of the objects were consistent with moon glow reflection. A reflection which seems unlikely if the craft were side by side with one another. The overall shape of the seven objects appeared to have little or no foreshortening, which I would expect from the angle,if they were flying horizontal, side by side. I don&apos;t know. The entire event was 10-15 seconds long. At about 6 seconds into the event, the upper or eastern three objects broke formation for about 1 to 2 seconds before regrouping as they origonally were. The break in formation was rather wave-like in it&apos;s movement. The first object from the middle, moved first, away from the center object and slightly forward. With the next two objects moving outward slightly. And the outer- most object moving slightly further apart still. Then they all reversed the sequence to resume the original formation. At this moment, the objects involved in the laterral motion, appeared to have their aura&apos;s glow intensify for less than a second, then return to the same overall color. Then they went out of sight, due to houses, trees, etc..", "Summary : no moon,observed colored blinking lights apox.     150&apos; up in southern sky.lights appeared to be from port holes, dark showded images peered out, moving about..was cigar shaped, 50&apos; long. objected hovered stationary for a few moments than moved very slowly to the west. i followed in my car(a 1960 Falcon). after 1/4 mile UFO hovered stationary again for a moment then shot straight up to the south. i never reported this, but i do remmber other sightings being reported in mid and late 60&apos;s.", "It flow over the woods north of my house, slowly came towards the house, that night there was a meteor shower , thats what I thought it was, until my father said someting about it, we watched it for about 10 seconds and at that point it was completely over us, it was all black and it was very large, about the size of two football fields, once it got past our house it spead up and flow to the right and disappeared.

We have spent many hours out there in the evenings observing the high altitude jets on their way to Seattle; and counting satellites as they orbit and the occasional metorite.  I mention this only to indicate that we are very familar with the normal nighttime sky activity. At approximately 9:10PM, I interrupted our conversation, pointed at the sky and said WHOA!.....WHOA!......WHOA!......WHOA! as I tracked the light across the sky.  It is my exclamations that now help me estimate the time duration of the event.  In this time it traveled from the east to the west in about a 60 degree arc until it passed behind a tree.  I also estimate the angle from the horizon was about 60 degrees to the south of our location in Cascade Park, Vancouver, WA. Some things I noticed most unusual:  The speed slowed and became brighter toward the end of my vision, glowing a bright greenish blue.  The size of the fireball seemed larger at the end, about the size of  a baseball in the air at 30 feet.  Also, even from the beginning of the arc the speed of this object was much slower than and metorite I have ever  observed and we did enjoy the recent summer meteor showers.", "IT WAS 12:00 MIDNIGHT JULY THE FOURTH AND WE WERE LOOKING AT THE FIREWORKS ME AND MY FRIENDS I LOOKED UP AND SAW A LIGHT NOT BLINKING BUT GOING AROUND AND AROUND A STAR THEN IT JUMPED TO ANOTHER THEN ANOTHER LIKE SURVEYING THEM IT FINALLY VANISHED INTO VENUS IT LASTED ABOUT 2 MINUTESTHE OBJECT WAS A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT JUMPING TO EACH ONE OF THE STARS IT FINALLY VANISHED INTO THE PLANET VENUS.", "I was riding parallel to downtown Louisville on the Indiana side of the Ohio river.

Floyds Knobs provides an optimum view of the city skyline and is a favored area for such viewing.I glanced skyward and observed a &quot;streaking&quot; object rapidly advancing West to East over the city. The object was of the intensity of an atypical star. perhaps indicative of its distance. Having taken astronomy in college it was certainly NOT a comet, incoming asteroid or other debris. The object when DIRECTLY over the city released an apparent projectile.  Both objects were white in color. the secondary object &quot;streaked&quot; On an apparent trajectory towards the city itself.

It was a little white but brilliant point. It moved fast great distances (about 2 kilometers) to the north, south and again to the original position, maintaining the altitude. Suddenly it exploded showing a lot of coloful lights (red, blue, yellow dots). Some minutes after that it was again only one object like at first. The sight was at night so the light were well seen. The distance between us and the object was maybe approx. 5 to 10 kilometers. At the end the object appeared to flight towards us, so all of us were exited and more or less frightened.

Airplane came and ufo streaked off .  Estimated to be 150ftx150ft. , this may be vast underestimation.  No reports.  No radar.  It was huge.  We had plenty of time to examine it.I am a believer and have had one other encounter of disconnected balls of lights examining the car I was in with 3 other people.  My mother on the other hand is a devout disbeliever.  My sanity is intact because she was with me.  The object appeared to be charcoal gray, square or diamond shaped with blinding white strobe lights at the points.  No other colors were observed.  There was a distinct writing or something underneath in circles that covered the bottom.  When we first saw it it was traveling east to west seemingly down a busy street.  It got off the street and turned north and just stopped as if to let us look at it.  It just hovered over a populated neighborhood not doing anything.  It seemed to be about 50 ft. above the houses, very low.  It was huge.  We discussed wondering how such a thing could fly.  From the direction of the airport (east) we saw a very fast flying airplane coming our way.  The thing took off at a high rate of speed north and we gave chase along with the airplane.  We kept it in sight for another 6 miles and then lost it.  I called the airport to ask if anything had been reported and they said no.  I have searched everywhere and cannot find a picture of this thing and wonder if anyone else has seen this particular one.  It took so long to report because I didn&apos;t know where and got my computer for Christmas.", "Unusually bright meteor/re-entry eventWhile travelling along a very dark and wooded road, I observed the flash of a meteor-like object in a clearing between some trees.  The object was bluish-white in color.  It gave the impression of being somewhat fuzzy and indistinct in shape - like a meteor but definately NOT an aircraft.

He did not witness the objects before us, even though he looked directly upon them. They were close enough that you could hit them with a tennis ball, just above normal tree top level. Direction of flight from East to West. Approximate speed; 10 miles per hour. Shape of crafts; As of two coffee saucers put together. Center rim, seamed seamless, otherwise, no other discernable features. Color; From a distance of approximately 5 car lengths, ships appeared gray. As they moved closer, one could see a sandy colored metallic appearence.

Truely intense. Mothers testimony;  was somewhat different from what I seen. She was behind me, by about 15 feet. She saw them as red and orange pill shaped objects. Older Brother; witnessed nothing, but shined flashlighht directly at them. Reason he did not see them is unknown to us. Missing time description; as I tried to get a better vantage point, missing time was experienced. The lapse only felt as of a second, but profoundly and deeply recognizeable. Objects floated of into the distance as far as I can recall. This phenomina was not experienced by Mom, though she appeared awe struck and stationary until I took her by the arm and went inside the house to ask her what she saw. I asked her &quot;what did you see?&quot;. Her reply; &quot;I saw what you saw.&quot; Personal reflection of incident; When being in closest proximity of said objects, I felt like a child again.

It moved rapidly a short distance and then stopped in the sky.  It did this approx. 3-4 times.  Movement too rapid for any known aircraft (to my knowledge).I was driving northbound on I-95 through Prince William Co. and almost in Fairfax Co., VA, at approx 2230 (no later than 2245).  Three blue lights in the sky ahead of me caught my attention.  I first thought it was a helicopter.  However, the blue was medium in shade (the most beautiful I&apos;ve ever seen).  The color was captivating.  They were too large for any aircraft of which I am familiar.  They were grapefruit-sized.  The three lights formed a perfect triangle.  This formation moved rapidly, a short distance and then came to an abrupt and complete stop.  It repeated this action 3 - 4 times within my field of vision.  During movement, the  lights never changed size (as if the line of sight distance made no effect) nor did the distance of the lights from each other vary.  It maintained the perfect triangular formation during all movement.  I could see no lights or craft between the blue lights; only an intense blackness filled the triangle.  It left my field of vision rapidly...it flew rapidly to the right, and was gone.  During the time I saw this I was driving, northbound, on interstate 95.  So I began at 75 mph and then when I saw it I slowed to approx. 60mph.  It was visable to me for approx. 45 secs.  I dismissed it as nothing.  It is highly unusual for me however, that i cannot forget it or dismiss it.  I remember it more clearly than anything I have ever seen.  I find it unusual that I frequently think of it and look now in the night skies as if I might see something.  I am not a UFO seeker/searcher.

One was not moving at all, the other wasmore or less rotating around it and seemed to be exploring something. This was also the one with the lightbeam coming out. The objects were both perfect triangular, with lights at the ends. There was no sound at all, If the objects were helicopters we sure would have heard them.

On second thought, no plane would produce this much light and this sustained intensity. I am an amateur astronomer and this *was not* a meteor breaking up mainly due to the sweeping up of light prior to the second and lesser burst of very bright light.

There were 2 very distinct white lights and one other less distinct white light that formed a triangle shape.  Counting the lights clockwise, with number one being the top:  !: bright white; 2: dim white light (barely visable); 3: bright white.  Between number 2 and 3, there was a small flashing red light.

However there was a stream of light between lights number 1 and 2 and a stream of light between lights number 1 and 3.  In other words, there was no line for the bottom of the triangle.

We had a lively correspondence and denials not on radar etc. When I sent a sketch the colonel himself phoned me and we had a very interesting discussion.there was no sound and no lights nor any call signs on the object. It went extremely fast and as it was rather high at the first sighting it was difficult to estimate size althiugh it looked much larger than a 747. The second sighting scared the heck out of me as it came without so much a swish over my backyard and the road at the other side of the fence. It could have been 30-50 feet across because I do not know how high up it was. It seemed to me that it cleared the street light by about 20-30ft. I really can not say with any certainty, all I know is that it totally unnerved me to the extent that I ran into the house and locked the door. I have never seen anything like this in my life and I am glad others saw it too. The object had none of the characteristics logged on your list. It was silent and looked like two backswept wings with scalloped edges,plus it had random protuberances on the under side. It scard me. It may have been an experimental aircraft althoiugh this was denied, nor had it,according to the airforce base, been recorded on radar. The base is 60 miles from and i am used to seeing aircraft flying about. They had been flying earlier that night too.I also phoned my local commercial airport about 12 miles away and they had no radar confirmaton of anything like I had seen. It was laughingly suggested that perhaps it was Alien. I did n! ot think it was funny. Incidentally about 60 miles north a crop circle was found the next day and many plants in my yard had mutations. The object I saw was travelling from east to north west. Both nights were very clear and cool.", "I was standing at my back door having a cigarete when I saw 3 bright orange lights in a perfect triangular fashion moving very slowly through the air,I only saw them for a short time as they dissapered behind a 3 storie block of flats,I tried to get a picture but when I reached the rear of the flats they had gone.it had generated no sound at al and was moving hap-hazardly.Only untill a week later did I discover from our local paper that other people witnessed the same thing.The dots were very bright like flares ,orange in color,and appeared to be a perfect triangle.There was no sound generated,accourding to the local airport(Hurn airport ,Bournemouth,South,England)there were no crafts in that area at that time,coastguard also reported nothing . The sky was very clear with no obstructions,i.e. trees lamposts etc. This ffor me was a truly moving experience I am very fascinated by UFO and unexplained phenomena,I was also quite scared! i DO HAVE A REPORT FROM THE LOCAL PAPER BUT MY ISP DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH ROOM FOR ME TO UPLOAD IT", "Bright, green fireballObject fell like a  typical meteor, but was bright and sharp like a welding arc.

Object paralleled us as we drove slowly, stopping when we stopped going when we started again.we drove about 5 miles slowly but took old Warm Springs Rd. instead of 4 lane into Columbus. As dusk was almost complete I got out and walked toward it and watched for some 10-15 minutes. Suddenly I had the feeling it was gone but the object simply faded slowly as if it left behind a mist. Within the haze red green and bluish lights could be seen moving but did not seem to be spot lights, more like flood lights. It was strange that it stayed with us for so long staying the same distance and height above the trees from us except when we turned off it crossed eaterly to the opposite side of the road. Although the timeframe was long neither my (now ex-)wife noticed any missing time. it was truly remarkable to us from when first seen it was so bright and moved rather rapidly but as it slowed and paralleled us through this little &quot;speed-trap&quot; town it got dimmer and changed from the bright full moon shape to the definite football shape. It seemed to us we were seeing it edge-on as it paralleled us. Numerous other cars behind us should have seen it also but noone stopped and watched but us. I had a camera with me but had used up the film. On a recent get together in Ga when my mother died, my ex-wife and I discussed this event and she seemed to remember it the same as I remember it.

Stopped to watch, for it emitted great light.Driving west bound away from mountains, but at an angle where mountains were seen from car.I had just dropped my daughter off at her Mother&apos;s house. Went to turn onto road, noticed bright light and thought a car had come around my side from blind spot. Slowed the vehicle and stopped only to realize that the lights were coming from over the hill. There were two of them and judging by the shape of the hills, these objects were fairly far apart, because they both sat over two seperate hilltops. They seemed to travel in an upward motion, building speed as they went. One broke away from its&apos; original coarse only to return to its&apos; original position in a split second. Both objects ran upward only to come back down right above the hilltop. they did this a few times before they went back down behind the hills. They changed colors as they went higher into the sky only to be more defining in shape. when close to the hilltop, the objects seemed more orange and yellow and where shaped like an ice cream cone, but as they got higher the color changed to a more blue and the shape was definitely oval and pulsed as it moved. My nephew thought it might be a military exercise, because we have a air force base right out of town, but I told him I did not think so, the military doesn&apos;t ever fly over housing areas, there were houses up on the hill, then we both were also confused because of the speed the objects were moving, then just coming to a dead stop after moving so fast so quickly&gt; They seemed to be defying normal gravity. I looked in the newspaper to see if any training was going on and nothing was found. I did see an articled in the paper about two weeks later , with reports of strange lights and sounds coming from the hilltop area with lots of people reporting similar things that I saw.", "Tight,straight-line formation hovering approx 1000&apos;. V-shape intense white light each. Cntr craft left,rest followed as observer stopped car below.I am curious what is done with this type of information, especially since it is after the fact of the incident. My mother, a stable, religious, and previously non-believing (in UFOs) person, related the following story to me this evening: At approximately 7 p.m she was driving home and saw a straight line of intense white V-shaped lights in a perfectly straight line ahead, about 1000&apos; in the sky.  She described them as looking light &quot;football stadium lights&quot; only v-shaped, that close together and straight.  She ended up driving 10 blocks until she was nearly underneath.  She slowed down the car and rolled down the window to observe and try to figure out what they were, and at that point the center object left the formation proceeding straight forward, and the remaining object followed, still in tight, straight formation, and all were quickly out of sight. The one thing she thought very odd was that there was no sound at all from the objects, unlike aircraft. She is not the type to embellish or fabricate such a story, and did not even feel anything more than a curious amusement about this topic, but now is shocked, certain of what she saw, and a believer that what she saw was not any craft that she has ever heard of.  She related this to me to ask if I knew of any military aircraft that was quiet and matched that description because I served with the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing and knew of most military aircraft in the world. This is quite a story, and has really shaken her belief system.  I think it is fascinating and was interested to see if there is any way to check on air traffic activity during that period of time.

No regular aircraft lights, not flying in a logan or greene or orham air lane.  Too high for civilian craft, and too erratic (and completely silent) for military.  Having been exposed to most types of aircraft (including missiles and experimental craft) in New Mexico (worked at White Sands and Holloman for some time), I can say that I have never seen anything like this.  The two lights apppeared like satellites, but moved too close, too erratic.  No flames, no missile contrails.  Overall, my estimate is 50,000 feet or more altitude, 2500 or more miles per hour nautical.  I cannot explain or rationalize, though they may be more missile testing, but were headed from land to land, not over an ocean.

As I turned a corner, they rotated diagnally and I took off, losing sight of themIt was April 5, 1998, approx 23:35.  It was sunday night.  I am a student and we had no school the next day.  I left my friends house to take another friend home.  After I dropped him off I headed towards my house, when I noticed three lights in the sky to the east by northeast of my direction of travel (east) I was observing this over a farm field.  As the road curved right, I lost sight of the object over a small wood.  when I cleared the trees the object was much, much closer.  over the initial hydrenaline rush I was able to tell the three lights were a perfect equalateral triangle.  The lights continued to expand outward, as the object appeared to come closer.  I slowed to see the object as it stopped and hovered beyond a neighborhood, nearby an old rock quary.  The lights rotated clockwise, then the lead light turned towards me as the object banked, as an aircraft would turn, I thouht it to resemble the B-2 stealth bomber.  The shape of the triangle was incorrect though.  The object was equal on all sides, as the stealth has a longer base at the tail than the shorther two wings (an isosolece triangle).  As the object moved towards me, sped down the winding road, only looking back as I could, to horrifyingly see that this object was moving parallel to my direction of travel. the road curved, and i lost sight of the object over more trees.  A few seconds later I stopped to turn left on US route 6 and saw that these lights were still there.  I sped around the cornder as the object tilted, while still rotating-so that the bottom of the object was facing me.  I drove really fast without looking back for about 15 seconds, bu that time I had lost sight of it.  I returned home, took out the binocculars and searched for the object, but I could not find it.

It appeared a dull copper from below and was shaped like a very thin, elongated boomerang.  I thought it might be gease flying at night since several lakes are nearby--but no tell-tale calling amongst members of the flight could be heard.  I blocked low level lighting as best I could and observed the object make a slight 15 degree banking turn slightly to the WSW.  I lost sight of it against the background of a streetlight.

There were 5 circular lights hovering over the house.  They were in perfect formation...Exactly like the lghts reported on TV on the Arizona event...The lights hovered in the air and then disappeared one by one slowly into the dark of the night as though the darkness just opened up and the lights just slipped inside.The time was approximately 1964 of 1965..I was only 17 or 18 years old, and I was standing outside with my boyfriend&apos;s little brother, who was only 5 yrs old at the time..The reason for reporting it now is because I was so impressed with the Arizona incident last year.  I was young at the time and didn&apos;t know to report this. I didn&apos;t think anyone would believe me. My boyfriend at the time lived on Kildare Ave. If I remember correctly, the address was 2202 (or close to it).  What I do remember is that he lived close to the corner, the 2 streets were Tripp Ave. and Kildare, in Chicago. The lights were white and very bright. Five lights across the sky and they were very low...there was absolutely no sound, moving ever so slowly...When I looked up, I was so excited, I told my Mikie to run in and get everyone to come outside to see...he was so frightened, he cried running up the stairs...well by the time anyone listened to him and they finally came out, the lights had disappeared into the sky as thou the sky opened up and the lights just slipped into the darkness one by one. On that morning of the announcement of the lights that appeared over Arizona, I went into shock, I didn&apos;t know who to call first....My best friend now, who is now my x-husband, I called. I was jumping up and down.  I couldn&apos;t believe that there it was again. And now the whole world was finding out...THOSE were the exact same lights... I wanted to tell someone...I don&apos;t remember the exact date and time...But I remember the incident, I have never forgotten that night...I wanted to know if anyone else had seen those lights around that time.....It was the summer and it was either 1964 or 65, it may have even been 1963. I was married in 1965 which leaves me to believe it may have been 1963 or 1964, because it was befor I was married, and I was married on Aug. 21, 1965.

(Official explanations unacceptable)I had a sighting about ten years ago and I never had the resources to check out what I had seen until I got on the net. Which brings me to the point as to why I am writing you. The official comments that were made about the sighting were unacceptable and I believe, would be to anyone who actually saw this object. Unfortunately, I can&apos;t pinpoint the exact date, which is a problem. However, there are other details that may help identify this sighting. That way, someone may be able to help me find more realistic explanations as to what I saw that  night. Below is an account of the events as I remember them. It was Oct. of 1988 (unsure of these dates) about eight o&apos;clock or a little later, when I was going to visit a friend, who lives in a rural part of Missouri. I pulled into his driveway, got out of the car and went to the door and knocked. My friend was not at home. I got ready to get back into the car and leave, when I noticed several  lights in the western sky. They were moving toward me at a slow but steady speed. I moved away from the car and into a field adjacent to my friend&apos;s house. I could not make out what it was. There was no discernible silhouette, just several lights coming my way. The object then got directly over head and seem to take up the entire night sky. I then noticed that the lights (There were at least three lights maybe more, I don&apos;t really recall.) seem to be attached to one large object. The lights seem to be facing toward the object instead of facing outward as you would expect. When I looked at the object, I got the impression that this is what a blimp would look like if it had been flying at night with the lights turned toward it. The object seem to be just above my head, about two hundred feet or so, I&apos;m just guessing. There was dead silence, I heard nothing that would explain its propulsion except the wind. Even though the object moved slowly, I think it would have moved even slower if governed by the wind alone. I  continued to watch the object until it disappeared in the eastern sky. This may have been a total of five to ten minutes. It never once slowed down or veered from a straight course and seem to stay the same distance from the ground the entire time. I got into the car trying to sort out what I had seen, debating on if  I should tell anyone else. I went to eat a late dinner and then decided I would go and tell another friend of mine about the experience. I got to his house right at ten o&apos;clock. The local news was just coming on. Just before I had the chance to tell him about my experience, the first line of the news cast said  &quot;If you saw it, you weren&apos;t the only one.&quot; They continued to say reports had come in by the hundreds and that it had been seen in at least seven different states that night. An investigation was under way. The next morning there was a small news segment about  scientists thinking it may have been a gaseous cloud that had ignited in the upper atmosphere but it was still being investigated. On the following day the official report stated, it was a Russian Rocket that was reentering the earth&apos;s atmosphere. I have problems with all the above explanations. For instance, Anything burning I believe would at least flicker. This was not consistent with what I had seen. The lights never blinked or seem to diminish in any way. It maintained a slow but direct course and stayed the same distance from the ground the entire time. I have never seen a falling star or meteors do anything like that. If they had said it was a low flying blimp, I would have believed this before any of the other explanations. That is, before I heard it had been reported in seven different states that night.  But after hearing this, I began to wonder if there may have been more than one object roaming the skies that night.  What I am looking for is any other credible explanations as to what this may have been. If you have any info on the sighting I am referring to or can lead me to others that may be able to help me.

We came home from my aunt and uncle and it was no other vehicle around. When I saw it, I told my parents to stop the car and shut the lights off. I felt instinctivily it was what we had to do. We wached the objects flowing over the small mountain range for maybe 3-4 minutes. It was absoluttelly silent. They were quite distant, but anyway, the winter night and cold had brought sound if there were any.

I wonder if there were more sightings in norway that time around that area, close to the Swedish border, about two hours drive from Oslo(pretty deserted at that time, forests). I do not believe in anything before I see it, and I saw it. The crafts moved from the right to the left at the nightsky, and all held the same tempo. They also vertically went straigh up in the same formation, but this time the first one at the first, and the next one , and the next, like a neckless. It looked like they took of upwards without changing the horizontal position of the crafts, like that modern airforce jet which can lift veritcal stright up. The crafts was never landing, just flying (flowing) and then svishh....I am sure no planes ever have been built to have that speed of accellaration in just less than a second, then or now. Well, this isn&apos;t ! a big record to remember, but I thought I just mention it. I am a sceptic so I really never speak much about such things, but I know we are not alone anyway. Any intelligent non arrogant person should understand that.

It was as big as a green bean at arm&apos;s length in the sky and I was stupified.  It went straight west and then North very quickly.

I am not sure of their speed or how high they were, but I did get a good, clear look at them for two or three seconds as they appeared over a roof and then disappeared behind some trees. It was a clear night and the moon was almost full.", "While building the CHP office in Movaje, Ca I observed a very small object @ 1 meter from me  hoovering.  I was on the roof of the building.  Alone, I watched it.  It was almost transparent.  I couldn&apos;t see throug it but it was as though it was liquid.  It was the size of a small orange.  Silver in color.  When I finally yelled to the others, who were on the other side of the building to check this thing out, it moved away.  Of course the others didn&apos;t see it.  It headed towards the Edwards AFB. It didn&apos;t make any noise or course changes.  It just moved towards Edwards. It didn&apos;t take long to disappear since it was so small.  I guess since it was so small and knowone else saw it, I dont get many believers.  Well any ways there it is.

At first I thought it was an airplane landing light but it was far too bright. The Object was about a quarter the size of the full moon. It appeared at about 45 degrees above the horizon and disappeared at about 10 degrees above the horizon. When I first saw it it looked like the tail was comming from the front end of it and then it formed into a ball then it formed a tail out of the back end like a normal metor. This all took place in just a few seconds. The object was a very very bright white. It looked like it was going toward the Northwest, it looked like it was about 10 degrees West of due North. I heard a caller on Art Bell&apos;s show describe the object as green but he also said that was through his visor, I am assuming this was the same object I saw. The object appeared to me as if it punched throught the atmosphere or something, thats why I saw the tail at the front first then turn to a ball then form a tail out the back.", "I saw a orange light slightly brighter and bigger than a star travelling in a direction of ESE.I could have been a plane but the light did not blink as one would on a plane. It could also have very well been a low orbit satelite. However, where I live there is enough light that I usually cannot see such things. It wasn&apos;t moving very fast nor did it do any spectacular stunts.

Objects hovered very close to ground and shined lights.My grade school friend and I witnessed these objects when we were 11 years old. We were at Fred&apos;s parents house (not his real name), planning to sleep in their front yard. I know this is a long time to go before reporting this to anyone, but I did not know where to till I saw this site on the Internet. We were on the front lawn about 2100 in our sleeping bags checking out the sky, valley ect. My friends house has a panoramic view of trhe Puyallup Valley, Orting Valley, and Mt. Rainier. We were startled to see a formation of lights (v shaped, 5 objects) moving from the direction of Auburn (to the north) to dontown Sumner. Te objects were orange in color with a sort of bluish aura or halo around them. They were silent. When they reached the city, they dimmed but were still visible and began to shine lights on the ground and houses. they were all spread out in the south east part of the city shining lights. Again, there was no sound. After about 10-15 minutes of this, they reformed their v shaped formation and flew directly over our heads (height was hard to judge) fairly slowly, then accelerated out of sight towards Tacoma. there are more storie from this period of time in the Puyallup Valley. I don&apos;t know if you or anyone else has investigated this period of time (1961-1970) in the south Puget Sound, but I have other stories from people who&apos;s neighborhoods were visited, where craft had landed (seen by officials) and other reports of &quot;craft&quot;.", "Something floated by me, no sound, no wind!Of course everyone asked what i was on, nothing iv&apos;e only told 4-5 people this. Warm summer night, clear skies no wind at all. I was bringing out the garbage out to the ally no one was around, dead quite. I lived on a corner lot at the time so I could see two blocks in either direction.  iwas looking up and around at the stars when standing east I caught something in the corner of my eye. About a block to my right five or ten feet over the tree tops which were around tweny five to thirty feet up was this thing.It floated in a absulute straight line past me vary slow 2-3 miles per hour, I was about five feet from the ally. It was lightly ulluminated in a yellowish color, with a black corner to corner stripe about 1.5-2 feet wide. The thing was about the size of a vw bug. There were no edges, seems or anything protruding from it.Ten or so feet long six or so feet wide. The closest thing I can come up with is the movie of Star Trek were they put spock into a cascate and sent him to some planet. Its shape was quit quite simular. I heard no sound from it, no trafic anyware at all, this was on a Sunday night.I watched it go past me straight down the ally and out of site. Istood the wondering what the hell was that, nothing can do that. I looked around to see if maybe someone else was around but nobody was there. I don&apos;t know what it was, I do remember I had An erie sense about it. Has anyone else seen this? I know it&apos;s weird but the more i&apos;ve thought of this thing for the past seven years, I have a strange feeling it was some sort of probe, crazy huh. Well thats about it thanks for listening.", "saw in sky made no noise lots of flashing lights observed with telescopeI saw the object coming from the south, from the direction of the gulf of mexico.  It was lighting up the whole sky, whole neighborhood.  Curiously no one seemed to notice but me.  I was outside with my telescope.  I trained telescope on the object and saw triangular shaped object sitting on platform on top of the trinagle was a light flashing gold and white.  Along the bottom of the platform was a row of blue and gren lights blinking in alternate succession.  I tcame to stop across the street from where I was standing, approximately 75 feet away and about 60 feet up in the air.  It was making no sound.  I saw it clearly with the telescope.  It left after about five minutes, shooting straight up into sky like rocket taking off and was gone in less than a second.  Later it came back, the whole house lit up in inside with this bright golden light like you saw in episode of X files where mulder&apos;s sister is taken.  Remember this was thirty years or more before the X files was even heard of.  I saw three figures in our house, the classical big eyed, slant eyed greyish white aliens.  But at that time I had never even heard of such a thing!    my father saw these figues too, up closae since they were in his bedroom.", "Summary : I think I was about 9yrs old, and my brother 5yrs old. We lived on farming land. We were out playing at the edge of the field one day when we heard a strange humming noise, we looked up and saw a small saucer shaped object with few lights around it approximatley 7 or 8 feet above our heads. We stood stunned as it only hoovered above us, it seemed as though we stood there for a long time. Finally, I do not know why, but we stated running from it, at least 150, or 200 ft away from it. It chased us, swooping down close to our heads. It then left. The strange thing is we were stunned and amazed, but we forgot about it, I mean we did not fear or think about it anymore, It was something that came into our minds once every couple of years. I have had one other experience since that time. I was sleeping on the couch, and was awakened by a bright light flowing through the window, it looked as if the moon had fallen right beside me. I pulled the covers over my head, it still shone through, but it did not really bother me, I went right back to sleep. I will never forget what happened when I was nine though, the older I get, the clearer the memory is.I did not see aliens, all I saw was this saucer shaped object, and heard the intense humming noise it was making. I guess at first we were not scared, just in shock, for it seemed that we stood there for hours. Then suddenely we were filled with fear and fled. It followed us, swooping down at us, I have never ran so hard in my life. And I still cannot understand why after this happened it seemed like it was no big deal, why we didn&apos;t think about it very much, I mean that should of been enough to make you go crazy, but afterwards, it did not even bother us. We have rarley even discussed it.", "pulsing light to north of kitt peakno actual object seen, just exhaust(?) flare. at almost exactly 20.00 hours travelling west on state rte 86 fro tucson towards ajo, arizona. looking straight at kitt peak in low angle full moon light, all three occupants of the vehicle saw a light just to the north (and possibly to the west of kitt peak) pulse four or five times with a space of perhaps two to three seconds between pulses. light was yellow to orange, the shape of the light was NOT like a jet exhaust (needle shape), but rather a spherical light. after the initial pulses, the light disappeared for perhaps eight to ten minutes. it was then seen again by all three people, much higher and farther from kitt peak...to the north. the light pulsed another two times, then was not seen again. sci fi writers have postulated a vacuum craft also designed for atmospheric flight. a pulsating propulsion system would both save fuel and keep atmospheric speed down, perhaps for greater stability. we believe that this is what we saw.", "Viewed a green &quot;fireball&quot; fall from the sky.I live in the hills above Hollywood and was sitting in front of our large floor-to-ceiling living room picture windows which faces south over Hollywood. I was minutes away from viewing Rivera Live on CNBC which starts at 21:00, that&apos;s how I took note of the time. I was looking out the picture window into the sky as I often do checking out the helicopters and airplane lights in the distance when all of a sudden what looked like a falling star fell about a 1/2 a mile in front of me falling from the North to the Southeast. It was green &quot;fireball&quot; emitting a gold haze with a gold tail. It fell for approx. 6 to 8 seconds and then just disappeared. I immediately yelled to my husband that I had just seen something that looked like a falling star except that it was green and big. I said it was something strange, something I&apos;d never seen before. The size of it: If I held my hand out at arms length and put my thumb and forefinger together and looked through them, it would be the size of a 1&quot; diameter marble.", "follow up on prior report4 June 1998 Follow up on the object spotted 29 May 1998. The object appeared as a bright star in the northeastern sky from Chandler AZ on the morning of 29 may 1998, 05:10 hours. Object remain stationary from first sighting until after 07:35 hours. Object was gone at 08:00 hours. Object was approximately 15 degrees above the horizon. One arm length and the width of the hand plus extended thumb. A ratio of approximately  1 to 4 (or .25).  This elevation remained unchanged even after I got to work where I easily spotted the object in what I assumed to be the same location. The line of sight distance to work is 7 miles to the southwest. This means, as the elevation was essentially unchanged, the object was at a considerable distance. At least 40 miles I&apos;d guess. The object appeared to displace about one eight inch. That is the gap between the index finger and the thumb at arms length. That would be about what you&apos;d get from a street light at about a 100 feet.  The object appeared elongated in the north south direction and I would guess was at least 1000 feet long.

It hovered for at least 10 minutes, then it faded quickly into black.At approximately 7:15 p.m. on the evening of January 21, 1997, I was driving toward my home in Blackwell, OK, when I glanced in the sky.  In the west/southwest sky, somewhere between 9-10 oclock I would estimate, I spotted an object.  Thinking it was a star at first, I looked back at the road.  Then, thinking to myself that it looked larger than a star, I looked again.  I couldn&apos;t get a really good look at it while I was driving, so I stopped in a church parking lot to watch it.  The object was larger than a star or planet.  I watched the object for just under 5 minutes, in which time it did not move.  It was a golden colored object with a red &quot;tail&quot; hanging to the left.  The red light at the end of the tail occasionally appeared to be flickering.  I went to my parents&apos; home and they both went outside.  Both viewed the object.  We do not believe that it was a helicopter, due to the fact that the lights were large enough that if it were, we would have heard the noise.  We heard no noise at all.  My mother and I returned to the house to gather a few things and get in the car to drive away from the town and view the object.  However, when we went back outside, the object was gone.  Another witness we spoke with said she was watching as it disappeared, and it just faded into black, as if it were traveling away from her at a high rate of speed.  It did not appear to move from that position, so if it was moving, it would have had to have moved away at the same angle that we were viewing it from.  It did not just disappear all of a sudden, it was very bright (brighter and a little larger than the average star)and then began to get smaller and fade into black.  We proceeded to drive into the country and we never got sight of the object again.  We have not gone public with this story, but we would like to know what it was.  If it has a simple explanation, we would love to know!", "I was waiting for the Bx32 bus with my wife; I looked up at the sky and saw two small triangular-shaped craft flying two-three hundred meters apart and moving approx. 10-15 mph..They were flying just below the clouds.

I met the witness, a Baraboo resident, on both March 31 and April 5, and we had sightings on both mornings, which were shared by one friend of mine on March 31 and two different friends on April 5. I will enter data on the more interesting April 5 incident in a separate posting to come. I have written about my experience in the forthcoming June issue of FATE, but wanted to place the information here since I am not getting a response from members of Wisconsin MUFON after three weeks since contacting them. This is apparently a _recurring_ incident. At 4:45 a.m. CST on March 31, I met the witness. I was training my binoculars on the southeastern horizon (an area known as the Baraboo Bluffs, in the vicinity of several radio and microwave towers) when I saw a orange-yellowish light soar a few degrees across the horizon. My friend, viewing with the naked eye, said she saw it zig-zag. I had the impression of an old-fashioned orange computer cursor that leaves a trail as it glides across a blank screen. It was bright, anomalous, very short-lived, and not easy to explain. We then runined any further opportunity to observe the light by driving off in the wrong direction, after which it was too bright and too foggy for us to see anything more. We concluded that the sighting may have been a UFO or other kind of anomalous ground-light activity. I returned to Baraboo on April 5 with two other friends. We discovered then that at least part of what our witness was describing, observing, and photographing was nothing more than good old planet Venus, in the southeastern sky. Disappointed, we waited around for a few hours and prepared to leave. But once again, while I was training my binoculars high in the southern sky on Venus (at 8:10 a.m. CDT), my friends and I had another strange sighting. This time, a bright white light seemed to emerge from behind the center of a thin cloud, a few degrees &quot;below&quot; Venus. It was tens of thousands of feet high. It &quot;swooped&quot; below the cloud (from our perspective) and seemed to leave a bright light impression or reflection before vanishing. I had the impression of the shape of a powerfully lit electric moth. Again, this was seen by myself, two friends, and the Baraboo witness. The whole thing seemed to resemble an extremely odd entrail from a plane, and I have not been able to look into this yet, but (1) we saw no physical craft, and (2) we agreed that it motion was far too anomalous, especially since it was 8 a.m. on a Sunday, and supposedly recurring. I believe there is some basis in truth for what the Baraboo witness has been reporting, but fact and fallacy have been difficult to separate. The Baraboo witness may report his extensive sightings soon by phone, but I personally can offer these two reports which were shared by a number of my friends, and seem to be consistent with most of the witness&apos;s claims. Since this is apparently a recurring event, I personally recommend that somebody with more resources investigates. I am available for more information.", "Streak of green light with small head and long tail, like meterorObserved through windshield of my vehicle while heading north on Meridian towards Hwy. 512 It was bright green and appeared like a meteror streak, but seemed to be much closer, approximately 10-20 miles away. It appeared, from north-east to south-west and disappeared abruptly. I was listening to Art Bell at the time and had just heard about green fier balls and such appearing all around the country. At the exact moment that I heard the guest say that  it was important to try and get an exact time of sighting I saw the object in the sky through my windshield. I noted the time on my vehicles digital clock and have since compared it to other clocks. My vehicle clock is one minute slow, so the exact time of my sighting is 10:49 pm on Wednesday, 1998. The object appeared stright ahead of me at about 80 degrees and disappeared to the left at about 50 degrees above the horizion.", "no crafts were seen, only a brilliant silver-blue light that moved north to south ....My friend and I were sitting in my car on 3/11/98 at the docks in northport, long island.  As we sat talking, a very bright light filled the car and appeared to move through the car from south to north. It lasted about 2 seconds.  We both looked around to see what kind of vehicle would have such brilliant headlights, but there were no other cars or trucks pulling in or out at that time.  We then discussed whether it may have been someone taking a picture.  Bu it was late, very cold out and no-one was appeared to be outside. At that moment, there were no planes overhead.  The light itself was silver-blue in colour and illuminated the interior of my car for those brief seconds.  Although we have no idea what the light may have been, my friend was able to relate the light back to two other events similar in nature.  So there you have it.", "Bright, fire-like object streaked from west to east in a level, horizonal attitude at a speed that took approximately 10 seconds to cover the sky from west to east before disappearing into some low cumulus clouds.At approximately 7:15 p.m. on Sept. 10, 1998, a group of Oceanside Chamber of Commerce members were just concluding a sundowner mixer when this object was observed. Appropriately enough, we were out at the Oceanside Municipal Airport and there were about 20 or so adults, including a couple of elected city councilmembers, standing around chatting, getting ready to leave the venue when I spotted what I thought at first was a cheap skyrocket. I thought this because of the sparks and firey trail coming out from behind. The object was moving at a high rate of speed, but maintaining a level flight in a direct westerly to east path. I had enough time to realize that this was not a meteor or a skyrocket and something unusual. I shouted to everyone, pointing up to the sky. Everyone was able to watch this object travel east into a bank of light clouds. It didn&apos;t look that high, but the next day I read in the San Diego Union that the same object had been observed by people as far away as north of Los Angeles. What makes me write this report nearly three weeks after the fact was hearing Peter on Art Bell&apos;s program tonight (09/24/98). At approximately 10:15 p.m., Peter played a tape recording of a woman reporting this exact same object that she saw as she traveled on State Highway 18 toward Lake Arrowhead in the San Bernardino Mountains. She claimed it flew directly over her...she said it was at 7:15 p.m. This definitely was not a meteor, as most so-called officials have explained. I am a 30-year veteran of journalism, a daily columnist for the North County Times, (circulation 96,000), which covers northern San Diego County. This makes the second time I have observed a UFO in the presence of community leaders.

The light from it was moving unaturally,too fast and in odd directions.... It didnt stay very long for about 1 minute. but we didnt see where it went either.", "Awakened by hovering disk over residential area.Many years ago, absolutely sober, I was awakened around midnight by a strange whirring sound outside my bedroom window.  I walked over to the window, opened the sheer curtains, and saw very clearly a disc-shaped UFO with 6-8 multi- colored lights hanging beneath the disk. The colored lights alternated their lighting pattern, as if spinning in a slow circle.  The sound matched the moving lights.  The ship wasn&apos;t doing anything other than hovering above the rooftops.  I tried to wake up my spouse verbally, to no avail.  I didn&apos;t dare leave the window.  After what seemed like an eternity, I finally did walk across the room to try again to rouse my spouse.  Unsuccessful, I returned to the window, only to find it was gone.  I watched the news reports for days for any similar reports, as sightings were common in the Texas Gulf Coast area.  But no one has ever confirmed this sighting to me.

While my daughter looked at the stars with the binoculars I was using a 1st generation NVD and looking at the southern horizon. I began tracking what I thought was a polar orbit satilite (from about 15 degrees above the S. horizon) I realized the object was traveling too fast for a satilite. (speed unknown but it covered from 15 degrees to 90 degrees in approx. one minute.) As the object reached the 90 degree position it was joined by 2 other objects that matched vector and speed from the SW using non-ballistic manuvering. The objects formed a triangular formation and traveled on for 10-20 seconds and then made a non-ballistic 90 degree turn to the west and accellerated until they were lost from view on the western horizon.

It reappeared a couple of times in same position, appeared couple times in different positions but close to original.  Lots of small aircraft in the area which is normal.Our house sits on a bluff and overlooks the front range of Colorado Springs. I was in bed watching TV.  Our bedroom has a big window looking out at the front range.  On this night, there was a lot of aircraft flying across the front range, probably from the USAF Academy and/or Co Springs Airport.  It was fairly clear with a few clouds.  I saw the object several times without paying too much attention to it, before it finally sunk in that there was something different about it--it didn&apos;t seem to be moving, just staying in the same spot.  At first I was trying to figure out what kind of airplane it was, but it had more lights than I&apos;ve ever seen.  It wasn&apos;t familiar. I thought it was strange---but again didn&apos;t think too much about it--doens&apos;t necessarily mean anything.  Afterall, I&apos;m not intimately familiar with all aircraft.  Then I also realized that it didn&apos;t seem to be moving.  Maybe it was a dirigible.  Don&apos;t know why one of them would be in the area, but who knows. Or maybe it&apos;s an aircraft with all lights on coming straight at me---but it didn&apos;t seem to get closer---but couldn&apos;t honestly really tell.  But then it completely disappeared (all the lights were gone). That&apos;s when it got my full attention, and I began searching for it.  A few seconds later(maybe 15?), it reappeared in the same spot.  I looked closer and it&apos;s not moving.  It disappeared again after a short time (again less than an minute).  It appeared and disappeared (I think) 2 more times within a short distance of the original spot, and then didn&apos;t reappear.  Each time it appeared, it didn&apos;t seem to move, just hovered.  It was the lack of movement that gave me the idea it might be a UFO.  It was hovering somewhere over the Academy Blvd business district.  Pikes Peak was to the right, the mountains in the background, and the object was a little more than half way between Pikes Peak and the end of the mountain range to the left.  It&apos;s impossible to say how far away from my house it was. I&apos;d guess the base of the mnts are approx. 5 miles a! way. Using that as a reference, I&apos;d say it was a mile from me and was about 6-8&quot; wide. Perhaps that can help give you some perspective of size. It was much larger than anything that normally flies in the area.  The Academy flies small Cessna type aircraft, and I&apos;ve never seen the larger aircraft from the airport fly this close--they have always much farther out next to the mountains. I just wish I&apos;d had a camera handy. I had hoped to see it on the news with an explanation or confirming that I wasn&apos;t crazy--but there wasn&apos;t anything. I have been associated with the AF for 29 years.  I was in the AF for 6 as an aircraft mechanic, my husband is AF, I&apos;ve lived on AF bases, and I currently work for the AF as a civilian.  In other words, I&apos;ve been around airplanes most of my adult life.  Also, I&apos;m not &quot;into&quot; the UFO craze.  I&apos;ve always been very skeptical--I have always thought their existance was possible, but since I hadn&apos;t had any personal experience, I reserved judgment.  My theory has always been that most sightings could be explained (including this one), the witness saw what they wanted to see or they were telling tales, or the sightings were just military test aircraft.  However, what I saw the other night, has gotten my attention.  There&apos;s probably a good explanation of what it was.  I&apos;m hoping your organization may have an explanation or reports from others.  I&apos;m reporting it to you in hopes that you may know of someone else who observed it.  Right now, I dont&apos;t feel like telling anyone (other than my husband) as they&apos;ll think I&apos;m nuts.  I wish I&apos;d had a camera that would have captured it. Have you received any other reports about it?", "bright light doing manuvers then chased by jetsSorry about all the unknowns but it was a long time ago. I was with my Cub Scout troop in our back yard when we all noticed a bright light in the sky. It was going very slow. It then began a loop manuver going at the same speed, much to slow for a conventional air craft to accomplish. We watched as 3-4 jets came in from the right as it came out of the loop. As the loop was finished and the jets got closer it took off vertically at a high speed. As I said it was a long time ago and I don&apos;t recall specifics like direction or time of year. As I talk to the rest of my family and get better info I&apos;ll add it.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "A slowly descending Blue-Green Fireball.  First Appeared at apx. 52 deg.

I&apos;ve found a second eye witness, I hope to talk to Tuesday night.  Maybe I can then triangulate and get a better idea of how far away it was. Because of the distance to the Condo&apos;s that it disappeared behind it could have been anywhere from 500 ft. to 5 miles away.", "Erratic movement not found in conventional aircraftUpon getting out of the car, I looked eastward toward the mountains directly east of Tucson. Some distance away, yet on the city side of the mountains, I witnessed a single white light ascending at an almost vertical angle. Upon reaching an altitude approximate to that of most private (Cessna type) aircraft, it flashed once as though reorienting and took off at an extremely high rate of speed at an approximately 40 degree angle toward orbit. It then winked out and disappeared.", "Black object moving slowly from North to South.I was laying in my dads backyard looking up at the stars.  Perfectly clear sky no moon.  Just to the north I saw a very thin white curved line appear, moving in a southern direction.  The line was so thin I could hardly see it.  It looked kind of like a curved bolt of lightning. Following the line was a object blacker than the night sky.  The line started to fade away until it was completly gone.  I could still see the black object moving slowly, against the stars that would disappear then reappear.  Just before it past over the trees the lights from the city reflected off of it.  It had a brown tint, and the front edge was almost white.  I saw no flashing lights or other elumination from the object, only the reflection of the city lights. The shape was triangular but closer to what the stealth bomber looks like.  I thought it might have been the stealth bomber but the speed seemed to be to slow for its altitude and size. There was no sound.  It was about 200 feet from the ground so, if it was a jetplane, I definatly would have heard some noise.", "HEARD LOUD, RUMBLING ROAR, SAW 3 BLUE-WHITE STROBING LIGHTS MOTIONLESS IN WESTEREN SKY,  LIGHTS AT LEAST 20 DEGREES FROM END TO END, NO SHAPE.oN 2-15-95,  21:30 hours,  we heard a loud, rumbling roaring overhead. This did not suprise us as an airport is nearby, and similar jet sounds are heard from time to time.  However, this sound continued well into three minutes, getting louder and louder, unlike any plane that passes by.  I looked out the westeren window of my family room and saw three blue-white strobing lights about 30 degrees above the horizon,  in a pattern which I will represent with an astrix and two periods:                  (     *    .                 .       )      The lower two lights would strobe together while the upper left light was off, then the upper left would strobe while the lower two were off, doing so within one second intervals. The sky was grey overcast, tempeture about 23 degrees.  I then noticed that the lights were stationary.  At arms length, the length of the formation was  approximatel;ly eight inches.  I called my wife in to view the lights. She agreed that they did not look li! ke any plane she ever saw before,  and why was it stationary?  I opened the window and noted that the roaring noise was comming directly from the object, but there were no visable exhust jets or any obvious source for the soise.  Through 7x35 binoculars,  the lights appeared similar to aircraft strobe lights, but very intense.  No shape or outline of any kind was detected.   As I watched,  the formation  seemed to be moving extremely slowly to the west, at a speed of perhaps only a few feet per second, barely noticable.  I watched for 9 minutes before it dissapeared behind the rooftops.  Just before it did, the light on the left moved or rotated towards the center light, almost merging, then returned to its original position.                                                                                                   I imimediately called the Cuyohoga county airport tower, (i had the number due to other problems) and asked if any military craft were in the area, or a blimp, or anything like that.  The reply was negitive.  I called Cleveland Hopkins airport and obtaind the same comment, but they recommended I contact the FAA the next day.  This I did, and the woman on the phone who took my report stated that a man had called in from Huron Ohio that same morning to report a jet that had been so low and loud, it brook several windows. Huron is due west from my home if you draw a line to it, and this was the direction the lights headed.  My mother also heard the roar, and, although hard of hearing, went from window to window looking for a truck or something, but never looked up.  She lives directly west of us on the same line.

There appeared to be a straight line (leg of some type) protruding from the lower left side near the bottom and from the lower right side near the bottom. A similar object was protruding straight down from the bottom of the object. I approached a wooded area and could no longer see the object. I rounded a curve and came back into a clearing and the object had completely disappeared. There was no trail of light and never a sound. I got a family member and we rode around the area that I thought the light was in, but we saw nothing unusual. Approximately one hour later, about 23:00, I went outside and looked toward the area where I had previously seen the object and there was a small red circular light and a small green circular light hovering in the same area. No noise could be heard and the object was not moving. I called for family members to come outside, and three other family members witnessed the red and green lights hovering in the sky. Suddenly the lights started moving forward toward the north and we then heard a noise like the engine of a plane and this object moved away to the north. We wondered then if perhaps the military or someone else had seen something in the sky and come to investigate the same bright orange light I saw.", "green fireball streaking across the ski in a southwesterly directionI was doing a winter contract at McMurdo Station in Antarctica.

I was down in a hole digging out a transformer when my partner exclaimed &quot;did you see that!&quot; Our helper said yes he did. I asked what happened and they told me a bright green light went streaking across the sky. It was still daylight at the time and clear sky since the sun hadn&apos;t set then. We figured that it was a meteor and had copper in it to give it the green color as it burned through the atmosphere. I was listening to you on Art Bell on the Sept 25 show and you mentioned no sonic boom. That brought to my mind about the above sighting... there was no sonic boom. We were basically out in the middle of nowhere... McMurdo being six miles away so the only noise being made was by us. Not sure now if what they saw was a meteor or not. It was seem by other people in the town too from what we heard when we got back. My partner and I are both electricians and our helper was just learning. Not sure what else you may need.

Two very bright white lights appeared to be coming toward me from northeast, like landing lights but in space. Both turned in formation and headed south, apparently entering ionosphere where a bright light blue aura appeared in front and broad badminton birdie shaped cone of blue appeared behind each. I shouted to others to come outside and bring videocamera. My thoughts were that these objects looked like Hale Bopp and might be comets; but, they slowed down upon apparently entering ionosphere and maneuvered in loose formation. Four other people came outside and observed the objects as I videotaped them moving south in the eastern sky and then turn to the east and apparently depart the ionosphere again. I zoomed video out to get exact ground reference point so that celestial geometry could be figured. The next morning I calibrated videocamera clock with GPS time. I later talked with observers 21 miles away and 50 miles away who saw similar objects around same time. The videotape is digital and quite good. Today I read your web page accounts and agree with most descriptions of objects orientation and behavior, except that the objects I observed definitely came from northeast, turned south, and then apparently left ionosphere heading east. This does not seem to be typical ICBM behavior. It is of note that the brightest aspect of the objects was on the leading edge, and illumination was much less in rear view. This is also not typical ICBM illumination pattern, which is brightest in stern view.

What IS it?&quot;  I don&apos;t know if I&apos;d recognize a UFO unless it landed in my yard. So, here it is.... If you look at a steel I-Beam from the end, it makes a capital I. This thing had that shape, which didn&apos;t change no matter how it turned, and it appeared to be black. The top and bottom of the I were quite thick in appearance. We thought it had to be a real quiet bi-plane style ultralight, as we see a lot of experimental aircraft flying up from the Arlington airport (some look to be little more than flying lawnmowers, to be honest, and make as much racket!). But this had No Tail and No Visible Pilot.  It was a bit larger than an ultralight, and moved faster, at about the same rate a small plane would but was pretty manuverable (sp?).  We could see it circling the water treatment holding ponds across from the Dairy Queen in Stanwood (in the Viking Village/Red Apple plaza).  It then moved a little east over some fields and checked those out, then swung down south toward the Warm Beach area.  It was still light out, but it didn&apos;t reflect any light.  I&apos;d have to say it was only 200 feet in the air.  If we had been coming down the hill from East Stanwood (which is about 200 feet higher than the downtown area), we would have been able to look down on it. (We do have biplanes in the area -- saw one today doing stunts over Pioneer Highway, but like I said earlier the whatsit had no tail and the top and bottom were very thick.  Too thick to be standard biplane wings.) My seven year old has much sharper eyes than I have, and she was going nuts trying to figure out what the devil it was, as it wasn&apos;t falling into any category of aircraft, powered or unpowered, that we had seen.  She&apos;s seen paragliders and hang gliders and she assured me it wasn&apos;t one of those.  I could make out the shape, but not the details, but she said there weren&apos;t any details for her little sharp eyes to see.  My 4 year old also saw this whatsit, but she is very speech delayed so she wasn&apos;t much help. Speaking of the four year old, coming back down from Mt. Vernon today at about 2:45 pm, she let out a squawk and pointed at the sky, saying something had burst out of a cloud.  I saw something streak back into the overcast, but didn&apos;t get a good enough look.  I figured it was just a jet.  Except within two minutes some jets from Whidbey Island shot by in the same direction as the streak.  Maybe they were just practicing.  They have been flying A LOT lately over Stanwood, fairly low too. Oh, you need a little about me.  I&apos;m a 40 year old stay at home mom who wears contacts - one is a toric lense to correct astigmatism.  You see why I rely on my daughter to pick up the details.

I was doin gjust tha twith a little girl ( to this day I can not remember who she was)  all I remember about her is that she had long dark hair.( none of my friends at the time match that description.)  I remember cli&#x5C;mbing to the top of the hill and once at the top I saw a large silver disk sitting in the pit.( yes the typical flying saucer)  It was a dull silvery color and was sitting on three &apos;legs&apos;.  I remember going closer to see it better.  I heard a kind of pop and one section of the disk began to lower to the ground.  The next thing I remember running across a field on the other side of the hill towards my house. And it was getting dark so I think several hours had elapsed.  Since then I have had several other unusual experiences.  I have seen a &apos;creature&apos; in my bedroom window and when I tried to screm no sound came out.  I have a small lump on my right shoulder that has been there for as long as I can remember.  I have seen several mysterious objects in the sky.  I have another episode of &apos;missing time&apos;.  I have been unuassauly interested in UFOs, space, etc... all my life.", "at approx. 3:30 a.m. est I was awaken by an intense wind tunnel like sound coming from outside my window.Upon looking out my window, I saw something that would change my life forever. Make me a believer in the u.f.o. phenomenon. A disk like object appeared hovering above the tree line outside my window. As it hovered above the trees there was a series of red lights circulating around the lower portion of the object.The top of the craft, I really couldn&apos;t make out that well being that there was a white hazy glow above the red lights. Below that there seemed to be 2 white lights blinking on and off. At first i thought it was a plane but after watching it descend lower and to my right, I realized it was not possible movement for an airplane. All of a sudden it instantly turned into a very bright red dot, something along the lines of a laser pen. It quickly made a figure 8-like shape before turnig back into the disk-like shape and slowly made its&apos; way below the tree line. Upon waking up the next morning, to my surprise i had found out that there was a problem with Airforce 1 not being picked up on radar approx. near the vicinity of LaGuardia Airport. This experience has definately made me a believer and will always feel close to the&quot;other&quot; side.

It was a very bright white light. The object suddenly reversed course and shot straight up at tremendious rate following the same path back up. When it went back up it went straight up and I could watch it get smaller and smaller until it disapeared.", "It was 4am and from our farm we could clearly see a bright, glowing object. I got out the video camera and zoomed right in on the object and to our amazement it showed a glowing sphere with symmetrical markings on it. It was like nothing we had seen before! But it&apos;s all on tape now!We live on a farm on the eastern side of Australia with a great, unobstructed view of the night sky. It was clear summer night with a full moon out. My brother and his girlfriend woke me to look at a large glowing object they had noticed looking out through their bedroom window in the lower eastern part of the night sky. It looked like a normal glowing star but much, much brighter and larger. I laughed saying it was a helicopter or something but they assured me that it had been there for a while. So I went and got my video camera and proceeded to film it. The object looked like a huge glowing ball but when I zoomed in on it you could see a huge sphere like object that was a light cream/grey color with symmetrical patterns on it. This instantly shocked us. You could not see the patterns with your naked eye or even with binoculers, as we tried, but using the zoom on the video camera (it&apos;s one of the latest model camera&apos;s with a great zoom) was totally amazing, you could see it very well. I kept filming the object and it would glow brightly (white) with green around the edges, then change to red around the edges, then the glowing would subside and the camera was able to pick up the sphere with the patterns on it again. The sphere also moved in and out on the camera screen getting larger and smaller as I stayed still on it. We don&apos;t know what it was, but were totally amazed by it! I filmed it for about 40 minutes and it was still there so we went back to bed as I acquired enough footage of it!", "Summary : It was dark and then lit up.

It was hard to make out but hade four blinking lights and was moving very slowly.  It had the shape of about an audio tape.", "Summary : I went to the door to put my dog out.  I saw red and green lights coming across Birch Run Rd toward my house through the trees. I watched as the lights got closer to me from the front door.  I stepped outside and as the craft went over my house I heard a quiet throttle of a engine.  The craft was low and just sort of gliding.  It came form the Northeast sky and continued moving North toward Saginaw MI.  I talked to a neighbor and was told that during a party in late October several witnesses saw the very same thing.   It hovered over the party moving in circles and then hovering.  The craft was V-shaped in front with 2 red lights and 1 green light in front of it.  The lights were very mezmerizing.The craft was v-shaped in front.  Dark in color.  Round in back.   It had 3 lights on it.  2 red and 1 green in front.   The back had no visible lights.  It just went over my house.  It was not very high.  It appeared to be gliding.   I could hear a faint throttle of an engine.  I could not hear any sound until it was over me.  I live in a rural area and I have alot of weeping willow trees in my yard outside my door.  I had been sleeping.  I woke up at 8:25 PM and went to the door to put my dog out.  When I saw the lights coming toward my house I just stood in the doorway to watch and see what it was.   I have never seen anything like that in my life.   I am 49 years old.   It was so weird.  I have been watching the skies ever since and I have seen a very bright light in the sky for months.   It looks like a very bright star.  It goes high and the light gets faint and then it comes low and the light gets very brilght again.    I have seen it just zoom off.   Sometime I don&apos;t see it for a couple of weeks and then it comes back again.   I went to Flint, MI one night and watched it all the way there (about 30 Min from my home).   As I sat in the Sams Parking Lot on Corunna Rd.  I could see activity coming from the light.   I saw a red lights come from it.  The light split into 2 red light and zoomed across the sky toward the other side of Flint.", "Daylight sighting while ice fishing on a lake in South Western Colorado.Sunday afternoon the weather at 9300 ft. was very comfortable. There were a few clouds but a lot of very blue sky. We were fishing on the SW side of the lake looking to the N. when Jim said look at the UFO. I very luckly look in the correct direction and saw the object quickly. It was falling parralell to a E facing slope that we were sitting beside. I thought it was going to crash. It then stopped for a second and then speed at about 2 oclock. It went into a cloud and never came out. This,what used to be a small cloud the began to enlarge and move directly over us like no other clouds around. I told Jim that something else was going to happen but it didn&apos;t. Not Yet anyhow. That evening because of warm temperatures the ice had become slushy and we had to abandon our snowmobile,ice fishing sled with all of my fishing gear, and 6 21&quot; Lake trout. Everything on the sled was very secure with four bungie cords. The next morning we drove out on another machine. We observed that there were not any tracks from birds or fopur legged animals. 4 out of 6 of our fish had vanished.

I have been searching all over the internet for information on &quot;cross-shaped&quot; UFOs. Sadly, my search has come up empty. I seriously hope you can help. I don&apos;t know where to report this or what resources to use. It was December 31, 1997, the time was between 9:05pm and 9:10pm. We were heading westward on  Rt22 Express De Diego and at the end of Avenida de Diego we witnessed a cross-shaped UFO (called an OVNI in PR). I noticed it initially and at first thought it a large jet at extremely low altitude. Unlike a jumbo jet, there was no engine noise and its position in the sky didn&apos;t change. It was hovering over what I could see in the dark was a large parking lot full of what appeared to be delivery vans. It was roughly cross-shaped with white lights at all 4 ends of the cross shape. These white lights were steady and did not blink. There appeared to be something in the center of the underside, however I cannot remember too much detail. My Fiancee said it was concave shaped in the middle, curving inwards. Also, off-center of the underside was a flashing red light, which at first led me to believe that it was a plane. If it was a plane, it was motionless. I considered it a helicopter, but it was twice as large as the building it was over. I&apos;ve seen Sikorsky Skycrane helos before, and this wasn&apos;t one of them. Besides, the make a terrible racket in low hover. We had stopped our van, and all five of us watched in awe...not quite believing what it could be. I am the type who is open minded but still requires proof. We returned to the salida (exit) where we saw the OVNI (UFO) the following day. We then observed that there were powerlines where we saw the OVNI hovering. The industrial park where we witnessed the OVNI, there are many high-tension wires. Not being a UFO-ologist, I have a few questions: are UFOs commonly seen near powerlines? Why? I would like very much to ask an expert if this type of UFO (cross-shaped) is common. When I usually think of UFOs, I think a saucer-shaped type craft. This was the strangest thing I&apos;ve ever seen, and the 4 other people present in the vehicle. All of the witnesses were college-educated and despite the date, New Year&apos;s eve, no one had been drinking. I would appreciate some resources to come forward and let me know where I may find (preferably on the web, otherwise in book-form) further information on this cross-shaped UFO, and if its type has ever been spotted before, whether in Puerto Rico or elsewhere. Thank youI am a database analyst for a ISP in Connecticut. While I&apos;ve no objections to the release of my story, I do NOT want my name appended to the story. I have never seen anything like this and I&apos;d rather not risk any harassment. I drew and scanned what we saw, that is everyone present in the vehicle agreed that the object I drew was what we saw. Unfortunately, this was left in a wor document in Puerto Rico with a relative. As soon as I receive the Word document I had scanned the image into, I will forward that onto you if you wish. Thank you", "Four extremely large bright yellow lights lined up horizontally relatively close together hovering at an equal distance apart from one another!My 11yr old daughter, her friend, and I were driving South on Michigan Ave. when my daughter&apos;s friend noticed the strange lights. The 4 lights were bright yellow and were in a straight horizontal line (each spaced the same distance from the other). The lights hovered for a few minutes and then two of them left. A few seconds later, another one departed. The last light remained for a couple more seconds and then left. My children said that one of the teachers at their school had seen the lights a few weeks ago and there were children at thier school who had seen the lights the same night we had.

We were on a houseboat on lake shasta viewing the north westerly star that flickers a lot and is one of the brighter stars when shooting up off the horizon was a star like object moving at an incredible speed. We both had binoculars and stated to each other wow what is that as we followed it. Once it became almost straight up from N/W heading S/E another object just as fast came from the east heading due west. My friend followed it and I removed my binoculars to see if the ob- ject heading S/E could be viewed with the naked eye which it could not so I captured it again with the binoculars until it went out of sight. According to the docudrama asteroids there are quite a few asteroids orbiting the earth so I wasn&apos;t to sure if I should even list this one.

Me, and another car behind me(I apologize for I never asked for his name) stopped and gawked for a few moments at this beautiful sight. It hovered silently for roughly five seconds, then, without warning, the ball suddenly zipped off into the night sky. It was the most beautiful thing I have ever witnessed in my life.

Solidad. I was mesmerized by the brightness of the lights, and the fact that aircraft lights appeared in the sky, but none like these crafts were emitting. I was so engrossed I missed the offramp for the 8 West frwy, I pulled off the freeway at the next availble exit and turned into a parks parking lot, I exited my car and noticed that one of the craft was going to fly directly over me. it was aprox. 800ft. up in the air and seemed to be at least 100yards long. it was T-shaped with the cross of the T at aft. it had Nav lights, however a blue and a yellow light were part of the configuration of Nav lights.

The first triangle emmited a beam or a streak of light from the side of the craft and aimed it toward the other craft.  This light was a blueish in color and seemed to change with the movement of the other craft.  All of a sudden the second craft emitted a beam of its own, at that moment there appeared to be another object in the sky coming in close to them.  I could identify that it was indeed an airplane of some sort because of the red,blue, and white lights in a cross configuration.  When the two triangle objects noticed the third, the two triangles shot strait up in the sky then zig-zagged until they met up with a bigger triangle object that seemed to be sitting in the ladle of the big dipper.  The bigger object shot straight up and just disappeared.  The airplane left to the south, toward the Peterson AFB in Colorado Springs.

Color of aircraft silver.Driving north on I69 just before exit 67 the craft first looked like a  dot reflecting in the sun (thought to my self, boy that airplane sure could be mistaken for a flying saucer). Then, as it neared it appeared to be a triangle rapidly desending directly toward me from the front of the car a little less then 10 oclock high. I could not believe my eyes. When it was about 2-1/2 inches wide at arms length it suddenly rotated 45 degrees counter clockwise in less the a second and kind of skidded or suddered in the air and changed direction so it was moving to my left and still desending. I think it was moving about 100-150 mph. At this time I could see there was a long pole about 2/3 the length of the craft sticking out the front of the craft with a small wing near it&apos;s end. A small ball a (1 to 3 feet) was at the end of the pole. I believe the small wing was used to rapidly change the direction of the craft when it &quot;skidded&quot; in the air. I believe this craft was a man made craft, NOT a flying saucer. The way it moved it must be a new design. I have never seen anything like it before. I think it was about the size of a fighter plane. It looked like it was made of aircraft metal. As it moved off to my left I was able to see it from my side window and its view was momentarily blocked by some trees I was passing. I then saw it for a few seconds before it became to low to view. Just after it passed from view I saw a light aircraft desending along the same path to my left so I guessed they both were headed for the Anderson Airport? I saw only the bottom and the rear of the craft. I saw no engine and no exchust and no landing gear. Please let me know if you have any infomation about this craft.

It blinked twice and the next time it blinked it was 12  inches further right and continued in that pattern as it headed toward Roswell.

The rough year was 1975/1976.UFS sighted over/around Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico. You will probably just say that this is junk, sorry I do not think so. Flying objects sighted for many days anad then they stopped. what proof do I have. very little. But here goes the old story(real), Cannon AFB had just installed floodlight poles around the flightline, it greatly assisted maintenance on the F-111D&apos;s at night. It lit up the flilghtline nicely for us, the ones who had to work in the dark to fix these jets. About that time the sightings started. I did not get to personnaly see them, dumb me, I didn&apos;t put out the effort to go out and see them, because they sounded so common of an experience, at that time. This is the main meat of the story, short and to the (dull) point. Additional information to assist in verification of my statement. I haven&apos;t dug into my old papers to prove this date to within one week. But the base paper &quot;Mach Meter&quot;  if you get an old copy carried the news about the lights being installed. next (if I remember as correct as possible) that the local news paper from Clovis New Mexico (near the Texas border, near lobbuck texas) ran a story about the UFS&apos;s seen in the night time sky. The rough year 1975-1976. My guess is that the visitors were interested in this big bright spot that reciently appeared on this planet. This is my guess. The base and town newspaper could be researched to verify the exact dates. Now to add some info that may seem to push the boundry some. Susposidely (I got from talking with others (crew chief-OMS)) that Blue section had launched a few sorties after the fly day had finished. I don&apos;t remember the quanity, about 3 to 6 jets, were launched LATE in the day/evening, or night if you wish, that is strange, ok, but another item being that at that particular time frame, blue section was the only jets that were capeable/fully functional (FMC) of firing their gun. ?? that is strange also.

Red lights and yellow lights.We were travelling on our usual route home from a practice at 9:30 pm. As we approached the Shell gas station on Rt. 22 in Bedford I noticed a row of red lights above the station. Hmm, I never noticed a bunch of wires or something with lights there before, I thought to myself. Suddenly I noticed the lights were moving. (The sky was very dark, so at this point all I saw were the lights.) &quot;What the hell is that?!&quot; I blurted out to my child.  We turned the corner at the Shell station onto route 172 and I opened my window and kept driving and asked my daughter to keep watching it as it was now still on the drivers side but sort of traveling with my car.  I dont recall any other cars around us.  I opened my window to try to see it better and hear it.  The next thing I said was, &quot;The thing is HUGE!&quot; It was more of a feeling because I couldnt see it clearly. (It must have been black.) The shape was more implied than seen--triangular or possibly boomerang shaped, but very straight lines. There was absolutely no sound at all. I couldn&apos;t believe something could fly and be that quiet.  I kept thinking of some kind of &quot;glider.&quot;  Anyway, we drove along and it passed overhead and now it was on my right hand side. I finally stopped the car because it kept going to the north and I wanted to get a look at it, but it disappeared (downwards) behind the tree or brushline just before the highway (Rt.684).  When I first saw it I thought about the fact  that the Westchester Co. airport was only about ten miles away in the direction it was coming from, but I&apos;ve never seen anything like that from an airport.  My daughter and I went home and drew pictures of it (separately) to show our family. I never reported it to anyone, but I have recently heard a couple people describe the exact same thing......We were not frightened, just interested, and when the thing was going out of our sight we could see yellow lights as well as red.  I remember back 15 yrs or so there was some kind of ufo sightings or hoax or something regarding the ai! rport at Stormville. I am not a UFO buff. This is the only one I have ever seen in my half-century of life. Sorry this is so old. Do you know what this could have been?", "Cigar shaped with distint window shapes the width of the object, wasn&apos;t moving, it was about 20 to 30 feet off the ground.  I saw no lights at first.  It was behind a stand of trees that had been planted for wind block.We left our friends house off 188th/116th in Renton at 1:00 Am.  I Checked the time before we left.  As we were traveling along 148th (Lake Youngs Road) southwards  we had just gone past 224th,   It was a cold clear night, moonless, I was leaning my head against the door glass watching the stars when I saw the object.  At first I thought it was a reflection on the glass because the image was faint.  I had my husband turn off the interrior lights and it was still there.  I couldn&apos;t hear anything so I had him turn off the radio. I rolled down the window.   It wasn&apos;t making any sound at all.  It was staying with us as we drove along.  My husband never saw it because of it&apos;s angle to the roof of the car.  I wouldn&apos;t have seen it myself if I hadn&apos;t been leaning against the window looking straight up.  When we came the stop sign where 148th crosses 240th street I watched the object go on over the hill.  In 1974 there were no houses up there.  I heaved a sigh of reliefe because this really spooked me.  Then as we were coming up on the stop sign at 256th a light caught my attention.  It was the object again.  This time coming at us head on about 30 feef off the ground.  We were stopped at the stop sign at this point and I paniced because at the nose of the object was what appeared a wide wind screen, with phosphorus green light emitting with the shape of a  humanoid in the middle.  I screamed at my husband to get us out of there.  He took off with tires screaming,  I lost my memory of the trip home from this point.  The next thing I remember is coming up on the stop sign at highway 18 on Wax Road.  I am completely calm, not worried or anxious.  We arrived home about 5 minutes later.  I took our baby son into his room and put him to bed and then took myself to our room.  The clock on the side of the bed said 3:18 A.M.  This trip we took from our friends home would take 20 minutes any day of the week, day or night.  We had lost 2 hours.  But I managed to convince myself that I must have read the clock wrong before! we left Renton.  I didn&apos;t know anything about UFO&apos;s or their characteristics at the time and it was easy to write off as just a strange incident in our lives.  After I filed my previous report (9/6/97 incident) I was just browsing your sight.  I read the report of the UFO Flap of 73, the Coyne Hellicopter Incident on 10/18 73 and  just freaked when I read the discription of the object.  It sounds so much like the object I saw on that cold January night.  I asked in my last report for someone to call me.  Now I really need to talk to someone.", "Shiny metal ship with row of blinking red lightsHeard helecopters and turned to look up. There were two helecopters. One higher.

Simultaneously at least 6-8 other dull yellow objects in sky in almost all directions. Partially cloudy skies during sighting. Direction--West and Northwest of Flagstaff. Red &amp; green object appeared to communicate with white object through flashes of light. Myself, wife, daughter, son and 3 next door neighbors witnessed this event.I am 51 and was outside looking in the sky to the West Northwest. I noticed a red and green flashing object about 25 degrees above the horizon. Turned away for a minute or two, object is still there in the same place. Simultaneously there is a very bright white object about 40 degrees to the West of this , I&apos;d say due West geographically. I thought this to be a planet (Jupiter?). This object was stationary the whole time. After observing for a few minutes I looked at my watch, it was 20:48 MST. My 15 yr old neighbor was visting my 14 yr old son, and came out of my house. I asked him to come take a look. We both watched for about 10 mins. Green and red object started moving at this time. I went in and got my 7x35 binoculars. We were then joined by the neighbor&apos;s Mom and 15 yr old sister. We all watched this red and green object move. A little zig-zag, some up and down motion. It shot off several times and winked out, only to reappear in the spot it winked out from. In the binoculars it looked like a red and green ring, like a wedding band with a yellow white spot like a diamond on a wedding ring. It was turning. I sent for my wife son and daughter to come out. Now there were 7 of us watching. The red and green object shot off beams of light several times. Keep in mind these are objects are miles away so everything looks pretty small, the beams were distinguisable, but not real intensely bright. About 21:15 we started looking in other areas in the sky and spotted 6-8 other moving objects. I looked at several through the binoculars. Looked like the edge of a ring. Dull yellow to tan color, not real bright. About 21:20 the bright white object I thought was Jupiter, suddenly shot to the North and winked out while in motion. It did not reappear. By 21:30 the sky was getting very cloudy, and observation was concluded. I have no fears about being contacted by you or answering further questions. I have not reported this to any Law Enforcement agencies, Military or Newspapers. Please advise proper course of action to follow.

Cassiopea was still very clearly visible on a pre-dawn blue as it is a bright constellation. Between the North Star and constellation Cassiopea, 2 round objects of apparent size of about a penny at 20 feet &apos;faded-in&apos; view as if coming from a higher altitude and coming down low enough not to be masked by the blue of the sky. The fade-in effect lasted about a second. It looked like something coming out af a fog. There seemed to be no self illumination. The color of the two UFOs could have been the reflection of the dawn Sun on a dull metallic surface. Hard to tell, apparent size was small. The color did not look even, sort of brighter in the center and brownish orange outside. Again this is more of an impression, as the size was too small for objective description of surface features. The formation appeared unmoving at first, one object was higher in altitude angle by about 2 moon diameters, azimuth North East, moved as a formation about 40 moon diameters east (towards the approaching rising Sun, which at that altitude was probably already up) and faded-out in exactly the same fashion they had come in, although they faded-out while moving rapidly east and were unmoving at fade-in. About 5-7 seconds. I am an experienced observer as an amateur astronomer for 30 years, a pilot for a few years in my teens and a general observer of nature. I don&apos;t have perfect vision anymore, I have a slight astigmatism and I was wearing my glasses. I used to be a software engineer (without a finished degree) and I now study Physics at the University of Montreal (back to school, got to get that degree). I am a skeptic. Still am, but I used to feel comfortable. My field now is astronomical optics, and I know what a sun-dog looks like, a comet, Venus, flocks of birds, nebulae, a meteorite, a galaxy, an aurora, a weather baloon, Jupiter, an airplane at high, low and medium altitude in foggy or clear conditions from up there looking down or from down here looking up. In winter and in summer. I&apos;ve watched satellites go by hundreds of times, once even Soyouz in full sunlight, not penumbra as we are used to see orbiting satellites in, but if full sunlight; it glared many times brighter than Venus, quite a sight for all of 2 or 3 seconds. My point is that I am an observer, a good one, and a skeptic. This week is the beginning of spring and I saw flocks of Canada Geese, big birds, flying high enough for the birds to be the same size as the two UFO&apos;s of this report, and they flap, you see more flapping than bird actually, and even at that altitude you can hear them yak like a chikcken coop. The UFOs I saw this morning didn&apos;t yak or flap. This I am sure of: it was not two birds or weather ballons, planes or speeding bullets, helicopters, gyrocopters or Venuses. It was not any known human machine or animal. Which leaves unknown natural phenomena, ETs and SDI style research. ETs being the most unlikely of course. This is important: the movements suggested very low mass. An eerie &apos;easyness&apos; about the movements which does not match the apparent size at all is what is most bizarre. Like inertia is for others. They seemed to go about the sky as droplets of water on a very hot surface. At least that&apos;s the best comparaison I can make.

We have a great view of Santa Cruz all the way to Monterey.  I noticed a small round object in the sky coming from the South.  It caught my attention because of the strange way it was darting from one side of my view to the other.  Their was a band of red lights circling the middle part of the saucer shaped object.  So I watched for a few minutes as it neared my house.  I expected that when it got nearer that I would hear a sound from the engine, believing at the time that it was a plane or helicopter. This strange object stopped just 100 feet short of my house and hovered there quietely.  At this point my sister came to see what I was yelling about.  She also saw this strange object and wondered what it was.  I quickly ran inside to get my telescope to get a clearer picture of what I was seeing.

I tried to follow it with my eyes running around the side of the house but it disappeared very quickly.

The object had three lights on top, two red lights on the perimeters and one white light centered.  I told my wife to look and we watched for about two minutes when the object flew straight at our car.  The object gave the feeling that it just suddenly was there next to us.  It had banked showing us the underside, hovering over the median, then swooped over the car, righted itself and speed off behind us.  At that time we lost sight of it.  The underside displayed three small, dull, lights in a triangular form with two dull concentric circles of light.  The shape of the craft was generally batwinged with a central payload area.

They moved slightly to the left in unison and blinked out. We stopped our vehicles and the lights suddenly reappeared  about 30 degrees to the left of their original location. Now the lights were closer together, more like two very bright auto headlights. Only they were yellowish orange. The color of sodium street lights. In fact that&apos;s what they reminded me of. We observed them in this position for several minutes then they began to dim then return to their original brightness. They went and reappared about a minute later about 30 degrees to the east. Then the left light slowly descended and went out. The other light remained in the sky for several minutes and then dimmed and went out. First observed at about 2150hrs. Last observed about 2215 hrs EST. Observed almost continuously for about one half hour. I worked at TRW for 11 years in their aerospace program. I have witnessed many launches from Cape Kennedy. These were not missles. They were very bright lights that moved independently,   were as bright as flares and the same color. Most of the time they were stationary in the sky.

Moved hoorizontally across the sky for about ten seconds just gliding horinzontally making no sound. Lasted 10 seconds, then just disaperred. Very good size craft.It was around 9:00pm. It was a mid July&apos;s night, cloudy out. I was laying on the hood of my car searching the heavens when a piece of light caught my eye. I looked to where it had come from, and it was between a house and a tree. I looked over there for couple seconds  not seeing anything when I saw a huge football shaped object moving fairly quickly between the tree and the house. It conceled it&apos;s self every time it went behind the house. It was a yellow whittish colour. It moved horizontaly across the sky. It lasted aboout 10 seconds doing the same pattern. Then it went behind the house and I didn&apos;t see it again.", "Long white light was stationary, then turned bright orange and moved like a comet, then became round and glowed orange while remaining stationaryWe were driving down a country road. Ilooked up and saw a long vertical white glowing light. I thought it was just a sliver of the moon peeking through or even the tail of an aircraft. Then it began to move slowly and suddenly turned bright orange and began moving through the sky like a comet not really too fast though. I had my Mom pull over so I could take some video. As we stopped the object became stationary again but still glowed bright orange. I was able to get this on video. Then it just seemed to move further away until we could no longer see it. I am a very rational person, I also work in the aviation business and I know this was no type of aircraft.  I want to know if anyone else saw this object. I also want to know if anyone would be interested in the video I took since it is actually a very clear view of the object.

We were traveling north on Hwy 63 and observed the lights to our left or west at treetop level. We first observed two sets of orange in color lights. They then joined together as one and then spit into four horizontial lights. Then they slowly turned in the sky untill they were vertical. We heard no sound in conjuction with this event.

I remember the object was hovering over the bride which if its the 16ht street bridge it would have been due north. I was at a friend&apos;s house at the time.

I notice it made no noise and was staying exactly still. After about 10 min. it moved directly over us and sat another 5 min.

In full view.. above the high rise buildings in Downtown L.A. suddenly leaving a trail as if breaking up.. and then it completely disappeared as if it vaporized.About this time last week (Sunday, November 8).. as I was sitting on my balcony enjoying my pipe &apos;n quiet time.. that a most unusual event took place. (By the way.. it&apos;s good Black Cavendish tobacco.. not pot! I work as a Counselor for one of the comprehensive LAUSD high schools. And unlike Bill.. I truly never have inhaled! My brothers smoked enough for all of us.) Anyway.. I live in the heart of the city of Los Angeles with the high rise buildings framing my living room view in an exquiste panoramic style. Having lived in Downtown for several years, now.. I have grown accostumed to the several single and twin engine airplanes as well as police, News media.. and corporate helicopters that often circle round both day and night.. the several city blocks that make up Downtown. Suddenly.. and speeding through the night sky from a southern horizontal direction.. (I would say whizzing.. but it was absolutely noiseless.. there was no sound..) came a ball of fire.. approximately 2 stories high and perfectly round.. as I compared this irregular sight with the high rise buildings. This object was heading somewhat north (northeast). It definitely was NOT not a shooting star nor comet.. heading in even the slightest downward vertical direction. It was not the Moon. It was not birds. It wasn&apos;t even Superman. My first, startled.. and only impression was: &quot;Lord God?!&quot; thinking that it could have crashed into any of these buildings just as in any of those recent blockbuster movies. This fireball appeared no further than 3/4th of a mile away.. and traveled not much more than a mile from my home. The entire event was always visable. Perfectly framed by two tall buildings.. the event ended seconds later.. perhaps, directly above the Union Station (I was a MetroLink communter to Chatsworth for an entire year.. and am aware of nearby locations).  And though my estimation of height is terribly inaccurate.. I would guess.. it was the typical and same altitude that all small aircraft fly.. here in the Downtown area.  Within split seconds.. this enormously silent ball was leaving a &quot;skid mark&quot; in its wake.. before it fully vaporized and disappeared. It was moving with the silence and speed of a missle.. but there was no explosion. Well, I sat for perhaps twenty minutes to a half hour in amazement and complete disbelief as I struggled to reconstruct and understand the all too brief and all too unusual sight. In addition, I was hoping to see if some police helicopter or airplane would be in the air.. checking out the strange anomaly. Beyond that.. I saw nothing.. and heard nothing reported in the News this entire week.", "It looked like the saucer on the USS Enterprise from Star Trek.  It had two disks, one on top of the other.  Also, it had a flashing white light on top and bottom.It flew over my house.  Then it proceeded to fly straight, and gradually swerved off to the right, heading east.  I looked at it through binoculars and would have taken a picture, if I had a camera.  Two of the observers are 13 yr. olds, two others  (myself included)  are 14, and there was one 45 yr. old.  The UFO was illuminated in what seemed to be a white light.  It had two flashing white lights: one on top, the other on bottom.  It had a faint red light in the side, also flashing.

But the object stayed in almost the same place for over 50 minutes moving only slightly.  It was white with a beautiful red center.  The red was a steady light just like the white.At 12:15am I was in the house putting a fan in a window. I saw what I thought was a plane just turning on it&apos;s landing lights.  We have an airport nearby that supports planes up to executive jets.  As I finished putting the fan in the window, I looked up again and the object was still in the same place.  I thought that was strange so I continued to watch it and it stayed in the same place.  I then went outside to get a better look.  It continued to stay in approximately the same place.  As I kept looking, I thought I saw red as well as white.  The only binoculars I have are a small folding pair, but I got them out.  I saw an irregular bright, white light.  In the center was the most beautiful red I have ever seen in my life--like deep crimson crushed velvet.  I don&apos;t know why but I couln&apos;t take my eyes off that red.  I was just totally fascinated by it.  The red was an irregular shape too.  I watched it for about 50 minutes.  After a while, I realized that it was moving at about the same rate that the stars were moving.  But it was not a star.  It was at least 10 times brighter than any star I have seen and bigger.  It was a larger than Hale-Bopp looked with the naked eye.  Also, I have checked every night since and there is nothing in that area of the sky that even resembles what I saw.  It was at about a 45 degree angle.  I stopped watching when it went behind the trees in back of my house. I understand that sometimes you can see satellites with the naked eye.  I have never seen one.  I suppose this could be one, but I have never heard anyone say they could see a satellite from inside their house with all the lights on.  And I have never heard anyone mistaking a satellite for a plane preparing to land.", "at first looked to be a very bright star,it began to get brighter and brighter and coming closer and larger.Then turned at high speed then went outMy wife and I where out in our hottub thrus night.

Never Reported.I was 15 years old at the time. My two younger brothers and I were viewing stars with a new telescope we had received as a Christmas gift a month before. My mother worked late at night ,as she was divorced, and was due to return home soon. We were up on the roof and decided to go back in the house so as not to be caught out so late at night. We packed up our equiptment and started heading down when we were startled by a very large &quot;cigar&quot; shaped metalic craft hovering about 100 yards away from us. (The craft appeared to be cigar-shaped but could have been a disc seen side-ways.) The craft looked like it was made of un-painted metal with no markings of any kind. It actually looked like a medium sized submarine hovering in the sky with no wings, fins or propellars. It had redish and blue-green lights that went on and off in rotating motion. What startled us most about it is that it was completely silent; made no noise except for a faint metalic clanging noise. My youngest brother began to cry. It moved along slowly at about 3-5 miles per hour for several minutes and then shot straight up into space and disappeared in a split second (Speed was definately more than 100 miles per hour!). I remembered looking at my watch and it was 2:30AM when we first sighted the object. The event seemed to last only 3-5 minutes, but when it was over, I looked at my watch again and it was 4:00AM. To this day I&apos;m not sure whether we experienced lost time or whether the object caused my watch to move ahead. Every night after that, we ventured back up on the roof of our house to try to see the object again. On the second night after that, (which would be the 12th), as we were climbing the house to the roof-top, we saw two V-formations of about 6 or 7 objects in each formation shoot from horizon to horizon in what can only be described as &quot;a blink of an eye&quot;. They were traveling at such a tremendous speed we could not make out their shape or exact number. We alll cried out, &quot;Woww!! Did you see that??!!&quot; These sightings were never! reported because we felt no one would believe a bunch of kids. I am 41 years old now, but have never seen another UFO since that time.", "I observed craft cruising over ocean.I was sitting on the beach [John U. Lloyd State Park] at 10:00 a.m., looking out over the ocean, when I noticed a metallic object occasionally glittering from the sun&apos;s rays. It was about 2 miles off the coast, and about 500 to 1000 feet high. I had my binoculars in my beach bag, and got a closer look. It definitely wasn&apos;t a conventional aircraft of any kind. It was very large and had no wings or markings, and was very smooth and oval/disk shaped. The object moved North slowly for a couple of minutes, passing in front of a small cloud for a good silhouette view, then stopped and reversed course, maintaining the same speed, and continued, as though it was looking at [or searching for] something. It then quickly &quot;faded&quot; away. The length of my observation was about 5 minutes. The beach was pretty empty, and there were no boats around, so I was probably the only witness.", "streaking blue/green fireball lit up sky. fireball going east to west and appeared to disintergrate after 3-4 secondsI am vice pres. of a real estate mgt company here in charleston and was walking on the Isle of Palms beach at approximately 2100 hours on sunday, october 4. Very , very suddenly the sky lit up extremely bright. I looked up thinking someone had launched a fireworks rocket and saw a streaking object that appeared to be a &quot;giant&quot; meteor racing across the sky from the ocean (east) towards the land (west to northwest).  It appeared to have a large head with an extremely long tail that was glowing a blue-green color. although the sky was already well lit from the full moon, the brilliance was magnificent. It was over in a few seconds. Many witnesses walking on the beach that night yelled at me and we all were in a state of awe.", "Standing in driveway, saw a strange craft; weird altitude for airplane. It made no sound, and moved with speed of the clouds...as if hiding?I was standing in my driveway, talking on a cordless phone to a buddy in Houston, BS-ing and having a smoke, and here we go again; more odd flying objects in the sky.  I was facing the house, looking up at the more or less cloudy sky, when I spotted a weird light.  At first glance it appeared as another plane...or a star?  No, look again.  It was at a wierd altitude for a standard aircraft, and at a closer look, it sort of looked like two bright stars stuck together...but it was moving.  Object had no traditional aircraft lights,(i.e. blinkers, reds, blues), just plain white light.  What really perplexed me was the movement.  The object was gliding, moving along with the clouds; same speed and same direction.  I know it sounds dimpy, but I got the feeling that it was trying to hide.  Craft made no noises.", "A bright object was seen from a far distance. It gave off a bright white light, sometimes turning gold, the it would turn red and green. The object would me still, then begin to vibrate and then go into orbital like movement.My mother and I watched this object for three hours it came from the north and remained on the western horizon for approximately three hours. I first noticed it because of the bright white light it gave off and seemed to get bigger. After a while it seemed to get small, and began to give off red, green and white light. Sometimes all at once or just red or white. The object would remain still and then begin to vibrate very rapidly. Sometimes it would just stop vibrating or it would go into parabolic type orbits. (small range orbitals.). Sometimes it would move in a linear fashion when vibrating. It would then stop all movement and remain still. Then movement would start up again. The object seemed to remain at the same level off of the horizon, but moving south over the time we watched it. We reported this to the NY State Police (Name deleted) at the time we were observing it. The next day I reported it to the Cornell Astronomy Dept. (I was an Cornell employee and student at the time). The irony of this event is that a few weeks before witnessing this event, this same time of UFO sighting was broadcast on Unsolved Mysteries. The show also featured video tapes. These sightings occured that same year most of which happened down south. I think the show focused on the crafts that were sighted in one of the southern states. I could be wrong about the year, it could have been 1993 that we saw this, but you can verify the year by contacting the TV show Unsolved Mysteries or your own archives have probably cataloged those same sightings. I am sure this happened in fall, a few weeks after that particular show was run.  The following night both my parents and I observed the same object in the same area. I know this is outdated material but it may help.", "Facing East, clear sky, characterized by bright light blinking at very cadence from one to five.  Movement pattern was up, down, then to my right.  after 5-10 minutes objject was gone.

It was a white light, very bright, partially illuminating the rest of the craft.  it blinked in a cadence varying from one to five beats.  There was no noticable pattern to the cadence.The cadence seemed to speed up when the craft was moving.  The craft moved from up to down then to the right, not very far, and repeated the process.  I was waliking my dogs.  They pulled me out of view of the object for a minute; when I returned to my original sight, it was gone.", "Apparent cross shaped object seen in sky near Madison, Wisconsin.I&apos;m not exactly sure on the date of this &apos;encounter,&apos; as many years have past and my memory is not as presice as it once was.  But to the best of my knowledge, it was an early summer night, probably April-June of 1995, I was on my way to a store, on the back roads of Sun Prairie.  I was at stop sign with a road to the left, HWY C, and my road continuing straight to HWY 151.  I saw an object hovering towards me, off to my left, very slowly with no sound.  As it got closer, it almost seemed to hover above the telephone lines, how high, I&apos;m not sure.  It had a cross-like appearance, I can only say this because of the 4 directional lights I saw in a cross shape, it was too dark to see an actual outline of the object itself.  I also believe there to be a circular red light on the bottom - center of the object.  To my immediate left was a corn field.  After observing the object for a short time, perhaps a minute or two, I turned left and slowly started to leave, as I began moving, the object did as well.  It moved off in a NW direction, I believe, away from me and into the cornfield, apparently getting higher as it went.  Before I knew it, it was gone.  I didn&apos;t see any fast take off or anything of the sort it just sort of..  slowly disappeared into the night.

Large number of police saw 3 objects within an hour of our sighting but on the other side of mountain that they disappeared over.  Intercepter aircraft attempted to engage.  See below.Sometime around this time,  (1966-1969)...It may very well have been Labor Day Weekend in Sep 1967, I was camping near Crestone, Colorado with several cousins.  It is 40 miles north of Alamosa.  We had just watched the sunset and could just see the other side of the valley to the west.  We all saw the same thing.  I saw it first.  It looked like a very large meteor was about to hit the other side of the valley.  I got everyone&apos;s attention as the object got closer.  It was a ball of fire coming down from space.  At around 30,000 feet, it split into three balls of fire.  At that point our mutual reaction was that it was a mirved missile hitting the western range of mountains surrounding the valley.  We started to take cover behind a very large boulder when the three objects made a 90 degree turn and came across the valley straight at us.  Our thoughts later were that they were intelligent and had detected us watching and decided to buzz us.  They took approximately 5 seconds to cross the 40 mile wide valley flying perfectly horizontal and in a 3 abreast formation with one slightly ahead of the one on either side.  We were at about 9000 feet on the side of the 14,000 foot Crestone Mountain range.  The three objects were trailing several thousand feet of sparks (?) and looked like they would pass just overhead and hit the mountains behind us.  We rushed to the other side of the boulder and took cover, but the three objects disappeared over the mountains peaks to the east.  We stood around in silence for a few moments and then started asking each other what we saw.  We were all recent college graduates.  I  was leaving for Air Force Officer&apos;s Training School on the 13th of September and then going to Pilot school, so it very well could have been September 1967 right before I left. We decided that it could not have been UFO&apos;s or anything in the Human inventory, but we still were thinking (hoping) meteors.  We had all expected a huge impact explosion and minor earthquakes when they surely hit on the other side of the mountain range, but felt and saw nothing.  The three objects had made a roaring noise that had drowned out attempts to yell at each other until the silence after the passage. The next day we went down to the Crestone trading post to buy a newspaper, but there was nothing in the paper.  We telephoned the Alamosa Sheriff&apos;s office and asked about large meteor impacts or UFO reports...nothing.  The next morning, we bought another paper and discovered that less than an hour after our sighting the Colorado Prison on the east side of the Crestone Mountains had seen three lights hovering around the prison.  The Colorado Highway Patrol and local police had chased the lights around for over two hours while the off duty guards were recalled to duty in case of a helicopter prison break.  Nearly 300 police saw the lights that night.  Finally, the Colorado Highway Patrol called Petersen AFB to check for radar images and the base reported positively and at the request of the Colorado Highway Patrol launched two F106 intercepters.  The Air Force thought they were police helicopters patroling around the prison or looking for escapees and didn&apos;t know the lights were being chased by the police for two hours.  The pilots had the images on radar shortly after takeoff and were closing fast.  The lead pilot asked for permission to fire weapons and while waiting, the radar images and the 3 lights went straight up accelerating far faster than an air to air missile could have flown.  The weapons release was never given to the pilots who had attempted to follow them until their F106&apos;s could climb no higher and the objects went out of sight straight up into space.  We all purchased copies of the newspaper to keep forever, but none of us have ever been able to find those newspapers or any other record of the incident.  One of these days after I retire and have lots of time, I would like to find the old newspaper files. None of us have ever taken drugs or had enough alcohol to impact our judgement even though we are all over 50 now.  In fact one of the cousins does not even drink coffee because it is a stimulant.  If you have any records of the incident I would gladly pay for copies.    It would be nice to have the hard copy documentation for my own satisfaction.  I&apos;m sure my cousins that were there would also like to have copies of their own.  I have a security clearance and still work for the US Air Force, one of the cousins is now a lawyer, and the other is an emergency inhalation therapist and ex-Green Beret.  This should be well documented because of the number of people that saw the lights near the prison and the newspaper article.((Number deleted))", "As I looked to the northern sky as I stepped from my car, I looked up into a constellation of stars.  Soon thereafter, it was if one of the stars picked  up and travelled southward and then pulled a &apos;J&apos; hook towards the East.  The object was as tiny and appeared reddish in color.  The object moved at a steady pace across the sky.  It did not make a sound, nor leave any trail like a shooting star.  It travelled slower than a shooting star, and faster than a plane or helicopter, without any noise.The evening began with me discussing certain unexplained philosphical phenomena with two other people.  I took the angle of the scientific observer.  I wanted proof of the &apos;religious&apos; nature of the universe as the people I was talking to exclaimed to exist.  I have always had a week spot in me for the unexplained, but yet, I have never really experienced anything that strayed me from the scientific and the provable.  Yet tonight, as I came home, parked my car in the driveway, I looked up to a remarkably clear sky.  I focused on a constellation, I&apos;m not sure which, and, all of a sudden, a star like object began to move across the sky, starting in this constellation.  I watched it travel in my direction, although it was completely at a great distance.  It was if one of the stars just picked up and decided to move.  I watched it move across the sky at a fairly rapic pace without changing course.  Then it pulled a &apos;J&apos; manoever in the sky.  It began moving to the southeast and then the east and then partially toward the north.  It did not leave a trail in the evening sky nor did it make a sound as it travelled.  It did not blink like an airplane wing light.  It did not shoot across the sky like a shooting star, of which I&apos;ve seen thousands.  It was very deliberate yet quick across the sky.  I&apos;ve seen satellites which moved slower and continued on a straight line.  This object curved in a &apos;J&apos; motion.  I was cradled in my driveway by trees towards the southern end and it eventually disappeared behind the trees.  I wish I could say that I was under the influence but I wasn&apos;t.  The thing appeared and travelled like nothing I have ever seen in the sky before, and I spend a lot of time looking at the sky in Maine, where you receive more than the fair share of night time entertainment.  This wasn&apos;t what is ordinarily in my sky.", "I saw a pair of strange lights in the early morning sky that disappeared in a strange fashion.I was on my way home from work a few minutes before 4:00 a.m. on 6/28/1998.  As I drove up the street towards my driveway I noticed  2 &quot;lights&quot; about halfway up the east-southeast sky (they were located near the brightest early morning star), they were about twice the size of an average star (each light) and were very close together.  They were stationary for a few seconds, then dropped down maybe 10 degrees and then straight up and disappeared into the sky.  This all happened in a time span of less than 5 seconds.  I pulled into my driveway and jumped out but could not see any indications of where the lights went.  These lights moved very quickly and smoothly.", "I was taking out the trash at 8:55 pm monday night the 5 th of october.after dumping the trash I was observing the sky,and the inter-mittent cloud cover that was rolling through our area.And looking up to my right hand side which would have been looking to the west I saw 4 oblects moving in A tetrahedril pattern, with A fourth object directly behind it, right in perfect line with the other three objects.and directly to the east of where I was standing there was another formation exactly the same as the formation I had just observed.I was taking out the trash on 10/05/98 at approxamitely 8:55 pm after dumping the trash,I was observing,the very fast moving inter-mittent cloud cover when I observed the first 4 objects to the west of my position,they were in A very tight formation, with the lead craft lit up like A florescent light just as white as you could get.with the fourth,object directly behind it, but the way it was behind these other craft it was perfectly center&apos;d that the way it looked from my position that you could of drawn A straight line through the middle of the formation, not only that but directly to the east of where I was standing there was another group of 4 U.F.O.&apos;S. In exactly the same formation as the first group.Now to the weird part of the sighting, in both group&apos;s the lead object was the only one that was illuminated,but there was A full moon tonight wich to me should of lit them up A little bit but they were as dark as the night sky including the trailer on both group&apos;s. I observed the two group&apos;s for about 5 to 8 minutes cloud cover permitting.the location of my sighting was on the north side of the town 1/4 mile west of I-45 north and the airtex exit.", "A very bright light, small red glow on top.  Off to the top left a blue/green ray of light.  Every 30 seconds (Aprrox) two white lights from the sides went off.  The location of the whit lights was quite a distance from the bright light.  A much smaller green/red light came off this main light and flew off toward Lena Point.  The green/red light came back, flew under the bright light and flew iradically over the airport area.  I watched this from 11:00PM to 12:30AM with my two children and we finally fell asleep.  At 11:30 I called my friend and she went down to a store called Deharts and watched this with some other people that were standing there. The bright light would bob around, go straight up, left, right and eventually went much higher.  I will mail a map and try to draw for you what I saw.  I did not see an outline of this object as the light was so bright.  Juneau does not usually have clear skies and this night was very clear.", "There was a full moon this night, so the shapes were very easy to make out. Circular, rectangle,,and diamond were the smaller ones. The  3 smaller crafts remained in their positions,hovering.  The 4th one, shaped &amp; the size  like the Stealth flew very low, tree top level.  It moved at a very high rate of speed, stop, and hover, make a 90* turn and move again.  Very bright flashes occured when it would stop, like a camera flash.  It flew over our car 2 times, but seemed most interested in the farmland and stock.  Arriving home we saw the same occurrance taking place over the western section of Jonesboro.  The smaller craft were moving this time. They would move straight up into sky, stop, turn, and fly back toward the ground.  This lasted approx. 45 mins.  Then a large light, like a giant headlight appeared in the sky and the smaller craft flew to it and disappeared.  The large light went out and 2 rows of lights could be seen. They were blinking without a pattern.  Then the large craft shot straight up into the sky and disappeared.  Several people reported seeing the &quot;light&quot; show in the sky the next day.  I have seen things in the sky before that were unexplainable, but it was by far the most interesting and by far the most conviencingI have ever witnessed.Smaller crafts:  We could see their shapes due to the full moon.  One was like a ball shaped, had steady lights on the top, bottom and around the mid section.  The rectangle one, appeared to be the size of refrigater box, 1 blinking light on one end, it was the farest away from us.  The diamond or hexagon shaped one was closet, it was hovering, would spin in place, and had steady lights on several points and had one larger blinking light on the what we called the top.  They were in an area of approx. 3 acres of land.  We laughed at first sight, thinking the National Guard from Little Rock, AR probably were out with infra red camera trying to search out the pot crops, because the objects were hovering.  Then the larger one appeared out of no where!  It &apos;s shape was like the stealth bomber, almost bird like.  Flashing lights on the nose, tip of each wing, and 3 lights on the tail.  It flew faster than anything I have ever seen, stop on a dime, hover, turn, and take off again.  A very bright flash occurred each time it stopped.  This was in a rural area just off the Hwy. 63 in Trumann, AR.  My friend thought I was kidding at first, she then stopped the car and watched.  She couldn&apos;t believe what she was seeing.  We watched for approx. 20 mins.  We then started getting spooked and drove on to Jonesboro, AR, where I live.  This is approx. 15 miles away from the first sighting.  Upon arrival I told my husband what we saw.  Of course he laughed at us.  But after seeing our faces, he stopped.  We then went outside and we saw a very large light in the western sky, looked like a headlight on a train engine, very bright. It was approx. 2 miles west of my home and it hovered above the tree line for approx. 30 mins.  Then 4 sets of blinking lights appeared in the sky and one at a time flew to the large light.  Upon the arrival of the last one the large light turned off.  Then 2 rows of blinking lights appeared.  The lights were amber, white, red, blue, and blinked in no pattern, just ramdon.  Then boom, it shot staight up in the air to the heavens and disappeared.  I check through out the night and never did see anything else.  The next day and even all the next week several people stated they saw the light show in the sky that Friday night.", "My friend and I witnessed strange lights over my back yard.

We live next to an air port, but planes do not hover over or around my house. Especially with those strange lights. All of the sudden, the craft just zoomed across the sky leaving a bright trail of light behind it.   My friend and I concluded that the crafte left because of an incoming airplane.", "my son and i witnessed an orange light fly above the lake shore five different times in about a 20-25 min span. it made no sound and the light didn&apos;t wavermy son and i witnessed an orange light in the sky. we were camped on the western shore line of the lake. it was about 0430 when i noticed what i first thought was a falling star, but there was no tail and it didn&apos;t burn out and it dipped below a range of hills to the sse of the lake. about 5 min later i saw the same color light flying from the south to the north . it was about the size of a dime at this time. i flashed my flashlight at it for several seconds when i woke my 9 yr old son. i pointed to the northern sky to show him the light when it was gone. i told him i seen this light flying from this direction (i pointed to the southern sky and there it was again. it was a little closer this time. my son was very excited and we watched it fly the same direction. it didn&apos;t seem to fly off into the distance it just was gone a some point. my son then got out of the camper shell and he was looking in the sky and he said&quot; there it is again.&quot; this time it was almost above us slightly to the north. it then flew with no sound to the south. at this time it was about the size of a quarter on your ceiling. and we could see that every few seconds it appeared to zig-zag. there was no moon out at this time and the were a few clouds in the sky. the light was flying below these scattered clouds, but it then flew over a cloud and into another. at this time we couldn&apos;t see it any longer . we both turned our heads back to where he first seen it , and there it was again. this time it stayed below the clouds and flew in a big semi-circle to the south. we still don&apos;t know if it was one or two objects flying above us, but we never saw more than one light at a time. i live in albuquerque n.m and work in a semiconductor fab. my son and i often fish this lake at night for catfish. i do know there is an army weapons depot just west of the lake ft wingate.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

What it look like:It was round like a frisby .Take take the outer edge of a frisby it is inch to inch and one half wide. The craft outer edge was 3 to 4 feet wide.

However, the red ball appeared to shoot white sparks that produced three white lights that formed a vertical formation under red light.  Then thought that my wife and I were seeing things and assumed the lights were a radio tower in the distance, but the formation started to move.  At that time our neighbors came out of the house and witnessed the object in the sky.  At that time the white lights disappeared and the red light moved about the sky unlike any conventional aircraft I have ever seen.

After closer observation we realized it had a definate shape, ability to change direction and altitude at will, and was indescribable in any common description.My wife and I were sitting in the hot tub on the roof of our 26 floor condominium building in downtown Salt Lake City.  From this location there is a complete view of the Salt Lake valley.  I had noticed a small fire burning several miles to the west of the city.  Shortly thereafter, as I was looking to the south from our location,  I noticed what appeared to be a small cloud of smoke floating from west to east and about 3 blocks to the south at the same level as our position.  Initially I assumed it to be from the fire I had noticed earlier, until I realize the wind direction was the opposite of the direction of travel of what I assumed was smoke and also the fire was too small and too distant for the smoke to remain together for that distance.  I immediately directed my wifes attention to what I was witnessing, and we watched in total amazement for several minutes as the object navigated within an approximate 2 mile area.  The only way to describe the object is through relating it to other known objects.  When we first started observing it, the object seemed to be just an undulating mass, but as we watched it, we realized that it did in fact have a shape that remained consistent throughout the entire episode.  This shape and movement would relate perfectly to movies we have seen of large stingrays as they move through the water with their outstretched fins waving, similar to birds wings in slow motion  The strangest part of the episode was that the object was almost entirely invisible, and the only recognition that it was even there was that it distorted everything behind it so that you could in fact make out the shape by observing these distortions.  Again, to relate it to something familiar, it resembled the creature in the movie &quot;The Predator&quot;.  As we watched the object, it navigated in a very definate path, changing directions at will and traveling first from west to east, then to the south, then back to the west, then lowering in altitude close to a baseball stadium about a mile from our location,! then hovering at that spot for several minutes, then again rising in altitude and moving back to the west at a phenomonal speed until it totally disappeared.  This was all done with total disregard to wind speed or direction, which ruled out the cloud theory or the fact that it could be caused by a pocket of hot air which could have caused a mirage affect.  After it&apos;s disappearance, my wife and I remained stunned for several minutes just watching for it&apos;s return.  We then tryed to figure out what we had seen, since neither of us had said anything while we were watching it. Our descriptions to eachother afterwards confirmed that we had both seen the exact same phenomena and that it was nothing we had ever witnessed before or probably would ever again.  One of the things that we did realize was that it was our location that had made it possible to see it in the first place.  Had someone on the ground tryed to see it they  would not have been able to do so since it was only the distortions of the background objects that even made it possible to distinguish, and looking up against a blue sky would have made that impossible.  Whatever it was, I know it was not a heat distortion, or a cloud and that it was definately under some sort of guidance or control.  This event was very special to me since I have always been a believer in the possibility of many activities beyond our comprehension, but my wife has always thought that to be a rather ludicrous idea, until this event, which she still cannot explain or justify.", "FAST MOVING SINGLE LIGHT IN NIGHT SKY HEADING SOUTH SUDDENLY STOPS PAUSES AND SHOOTS AWAY IN NORTH EAST HEADING.

What we did see however was a circular light in an orangish color pulsing.  It was like several strong and bright orange colored flashlights being directed at the ground.  I have no idea how large the circle was because I didn&apos;t go outside to see it.  As abruptly as it had started it was gone.

My wife and I were traveling west bound on I-90 where the Wyoming and Montana border meet at approximately midnight.  We decided to set a goal of getting into Montana before stopping for the night, finding a motel room in a small town.  There were loads of deer crossing signs and we nearly hit one crossing the road.  Because of the lack of cars on the road we were able to switch to high beams so I was tunnel visioned, while driving,  to watch for deer on the road.  It was then that we noticed the solar flare stuff that was lighting up the sky that has been in the news lately.  We pulled over to the side of the road to look at the brilliant illuminating effect.  We totally shut the lights off and stood looking up at it amazed.  We got back in the car and I wanted to continue looking at the shimmer of white light.  The only place I could do that was behind me over my left shoulder.  It was then that I noticed a quarter sized perfect circle cutting out one of the shimmering flare areas in the sky.  I looked at it several times.  Then I looked forward and noticed in the upper right hand corner of the wind shield a dark well defined disk shaped object.  I said to my wife &quot;You will think I am crazy if I tell you what I see&quot; and she joked that it must be a UFO.  I said I  think so and asked her if she saw the object.  She said she did and she continued to watch it.  She said it was moving and I meantime was looking at two and sometimes three directly ahead of us.  The third of those objects kept collapsing in on itself.  There were no lights on any of them.  They were not clouds, as the sky was perfectly clear.  The quarter sized circle thing had vanished but directly out my driver side window was a long very large cigar shaped object - dark but very clearly defined.  Sometimes it was rectangular and sometimes triangular.  Very clearly defined but dark.  Then that object became more abstract in shape. In the upper left hand corner of the windshield appeared a large object saucer shaped with a raised area in the middle.  It appeared to have at least one porthole type feature.  It stayed in that position for what seemd like 10-15 minutes as we drove along.  We were both scared crazy but kept driving at 65 mph.  The object stayed in what seemd a fixed position in the upper left hand corner of the windshield and the shimmering light quality of the flare effect revealed sort of a greyish color to the object.  All at once a long line of blackish linked wing like things, seemingly all linked together, moved closer and closer and seemed like they were almost at the end of the car hood and then vanished.  Then everything was gone. The next day I woke up and my eyes were burning and very, very bloodshot.", "Was driving home and saw a black triangle craft in the air.

It was a black triangle craft that had a very strange yellowish haze around it that seemed to be hipmotizing.  A plane was flying overhead and the craft seemed to be approximately 3,000 feet above the plane. It moved in a very odd way. It bobbed up and down like an eagle which is what I thought it was at first. Then the craft stopped very suddenly and just hovered over a mountain.

I did&apos;t think much of it until I turned the TV set off and with the room being darker, I saw a flash myself.  I didn&apos;t see it directly, because a building next door was blocking it.  I kept looking and seconds later, there were many flashes across the eastern portion of the sky, but they were colored!  I had never seen anything like it.  The display was so remarkable, that I was literally shaking with fear.  I called my wife back to the window and she observed several flashes with me.  Some were low enough that they silhouetted the I-5 bridge before us.  It had the appearance of fireworks being obscured by clouds, except for the fact that it covered a far too great portion of the sky. From our vantage point, we can see directly to the east, and a bit to the north, with limited views to the south due to buildings close by.  At least one flash appeared to have structure to it, almost like a laser beam.  But again, this display covered a VERY large portion of the sky.  After about ten minutes the flashes stopped.  I spoke with my neighbor and he and his housemate saw them as well.  I was so taken by the experience that I called the police to report it as it was happening.  They reported some transformers were exploding, but nothing that matched what I saw.  I work at NOAA, and spoke to a meteorologist about it, and he could not offer an explanation either.  I&apos;ll never forget what I saw.  It was spectacular. Thank you.", "I was looking at the clouds and trying to guess if there was a storm brewing over the lake, when just for perhaps 30 seconds, I saw a bell shaped large silver object appear. It was stationary for the few seconds that I saw it. The vanished into thin air.I was on my way to pick up my children and was watching the clouds as we live near the lake and I had left the windows open and was worried it would begin to storm. As I was driving I just looked up and was also watching the car in front of me on I-90 and suddenly I saw  this object that appeared in the clouds and it was very shiney and bright and it looked like a giant bell. It was only in the clouds for a matter of 30 seconds maybe a little longer and then when I went to make sure I was not getting too close to the car in front of me, it vanished. I saw no trails and I know that it was not the blimp nor was it an aircraft as it was stationary.I picked up my children and we looked again in the clouds on the way home but the clouds were starting to clear and we didn&apos;t see anything.", "viewed saucer manuveurs and air force search for extended period of time from close rangeMy friend and I were attending a drive-in movie in central Phoenix, AZ around the bicentennial time. We saw a disk-shaped object come quite close to us. It was noiseless and hovered off to my left (I was on the passenger side of the car). At one point it started to descend and that is when the shape became apparent. It had a row of very bright white lights that revolved (or the ship did, this was unclear) which it turned on an off a few times. There was a (either blue or green, I believe green) stationary light on the top which stayed on at all times. After descending it went back to approximately its original position.This viewing lasted around 15-20 minutes. Then the craft moved off to the south very fast and stopped. I could only see the lights at this point. An air force jet came from west toward the craft and turned and went back. Then a jet came from the east and did the same. The two more jets came from other sides, one at a time, and turned away. Then a jet came from the west side again only it came closer to the craft than the others had. Immediately the craft moved incredibly fast to the east side of Phoenix. The jet followed, at a slower speed. Then the craft turned to the south slowly with the jet in pursuit. At this point all the white lights on the craft went out. Immediately the lights on the jet went out. They moved to the south . I could only see the blinking of the light on the top of the craft. When they got to south Phoenix the craft was no longer visible to me. I believe the jets lost it also. For the remainder of the movie (which was around 2 hours long the jets combed the south area. The sky was clear. The weather nice. I am bad with measurements but I believe the craft was about two blocks away and approximately 100 feet in diameter. The craft could hover, move incredibly fast, was noiseless, revolved (I believe), and the white lights were very bright. I am unsure of the color of the object as the lights were very bright but it also didn&apos;t seem to have a color as such. My friend saw it and was afraid it was going to land and didn&apos;t watch much of it. At one point I got out of the car to not only get a better look but hoped to attract attention to it. I mentioned to a couple in the next car but they did not seem interested. There were no reports in the paper or news. I did hear of a man (through friends) who saw it also across town but did not know him or get a name. I was 19 years old at the time and did not know the correct way to report this. Also my memory has faded to exact date and color of light on top of craft. But the rest is quite clear. I remember the movie name and hoped to check the running dates for the movie but I am sure the drive-in is closed by now. I am interested in finding more information about this sighting, if possible. I cannot be contacted collect by phone, as I do not have long distance service but would appreciate any info on this.", "On the above date and time, myself and two others were camping on my property 5 miles east of Craig, Mt. in the Big Belt Mts. The sky was clear, temp in the low 60&apos;s. We were sitting around the campfire star gazing, and had spotted a few falling stars. But this was no falling star. I looked towards the SSW direction and noticed a bright pinpoint of light in a straight line heading NNW above the Big Dipper, which was plain to see. At first I thought it was a satellite, but after 5 seconds of watching it, as were my nephew and friend... it became extremly bright &quot;white&quot; with a corona around the outside almost as of a burning light completelyt round, almost 10-20 times brighter and it accellerated when it did... for a burst of 3 seconds then it became the small pinlight as in the beginning of the sighting. The other two gents I was with made a commment of satellite, but I have seen thousands of them, and this did not act as if it was one.

I was laying on a cot flat on my back inside a built up commercial/residential area with high background light level.  Very faint cumulus clouds, widely dispersed were present, but not in the section directly overhead where the objects were observed.  Sky was otherwise clear and stars particularly bright this evening.  I observed 12-15 objects travelling at a constant velocity and direction, very nearly due south. Their luminosity was equal among them and remained constant until obscured by tall trees nearby. Color was dim orange/gold. Objects were no more than points of light.  I would estimate the arc they traversed in approximately 6 seconds was no more than 35-40 degrees.  Objects were in a roughly U-shaped formation with the closed end leading.

We were watching a metorite shower since this is one of the best times to view one all year long, (being usually the first week in August of every year).  Anyway, we live near the U.S. Army&apos;s traing base of Ft. Rucker and that night and many other nights had witnessed numerous rotary wing and fixed winged crafts.  We had seen what we though that night to even be a satellite or two ,--  but anyway back to the story we knew what we were looking at and the Northeast corner of the sky is where our attention was that particular night. My Son , 12 years old at the time was the first to see &quot;it&quot;, he said &quot;look at that - pointed to almost the same place of the meteor shower, and what we saw was a perfectly round dark/black object with maybe some sort of illumnination shing up above the craft.  It was moving basically North to South and we witnessed it for maybe five seconds.  The size of the object was approximately the size of a silver dollar or say maybe if you make the O.K. size with you your hand the circle your create is close to the size. We noticed no noise and after it left our field of view we all felt like we had witnessed something very unusual.  My 13 year old Daughter was witness to this also. What makes this very unusual, if that is the correct word, is that I was talking to a coworker - was was also out looking at the metorite showers that week and I was telling him about what we saw on Tuesday night of that week and he said his Son had said to him on Thursday Night of that week &quot;Dad you will not believe what I just saw ? It looked like a Dark Circle going East to West&quot;.

The sighting lasted for about a minute.A friend and I were traveling back to college from her home in Gainsville Georgia, we were talking on the carphone.  We both saw the green light come from the northeastern part of the sky and move to the southwestern part of the sky.  She hung-up on the person we were talking to and we looked at each other and asked &quot;did you see that?&quot;.  The light was traveling fast, but not as fast as a falling star.  It had a more &apos;determined&apos; movement to it.  It was green in color and just looked like a ball of light.  It had not really a tail, but the color made a streak in the sky, like when you take a bright light and wave it in front of your eyes.  It leaves kind of an imprint.

All of a sudden a bright ball of white light lit up the sky in front of us. It was approximately 100 feet over tree-top level. Comparitively, the UFO was about the size of a baseball in the sky. It then travelled quickly from a west to east direction at high speed, leaving a tail of light behind it like a comet. It made no audible sound. It was a wooded area we were in, so it was out of sight quickly -- we only witnessed it for a matter of seconds.

Both my friend and myself were startled and commented to each other that we had never seen anything like that before.

About this time, a row of lights appeared to the side of the first two ones. they lit up in rapid sequence and then went back out. When this happened, I could see a very large shape behind them, disk or saucer and dull gray, silver. If I were to hazard a guess, the lights dissected the craft in the middle. The craft then made several strange moves, very rapidly diagonally and laterally, unlike anything I&apos;ve ever seen. As I driving, I told my son to follow it with his eyes. As our car passed it, he reported whirling lights on the top which swirled around fast in the opposite direction they had been, and the craft shot out of sight, extremely fast, headed north- northeast. It might be of note that there was a light fog when I first saw the object. As the trip progressed, it became worse. But at the time, it wasn&apos;t so dense as to cloud our vision.

Within 3-5 minutes I heard a sound out the open window toward the road that sounded like a cross between a semi-truck idling and a tank.  After about 15 seconds and seeing nothing go by on the dirt road the sound stopped as abruptly as it had started.  I then suddenly saw the upper half (the lower half was hidden by bushes between me and the driveway) of a disc-shaped craft silently glide by, it&apos;s surface reflecting in the light from the carport.  I saw no lights as it passed by quickly, but there were no windows at all like there would have been if it were a car, and it was made out of what looked like &quot;brushed aluminum&quot;. I watched to see if it would come back around the bend of the U-shaped driveway, but it didn&apos;t.  It didn&apos;t back up because my eyes were glued (and heart nearly pumping out of my chest) to the driveway from where I was sitting at the dining room table.  It couldn&apos;t go straight because it would&apos;ve crashed into the carport.  It couldn&apos;t have gone left because of the orange grove and the porch.  It DIDN&apos;T go right because I would&apos;ve seen it come around the driveway.  I went out after about 5-15 minutes (I lost track of time then because I was so nervous and was trying to convince myself I was hallucinating... after all, I was wondering why God had answered my prayer so quickly!).  But I just kept saying to myself, &quot;But I know that I know I saw what I saw and I heard what I heard!&quot;. I checked it all out and looked for marks on the ground in the one place that was my &quot;blind spot&quot;; the place after where I saw it pass the window, but BEFORE where it would&apos;ve hit the carport if it had continued to go straight.  Looking around and seeing only trees with their giant branches overhanging the driveway, and porches, and carports, I stood in the &quot;blind spot&quot; and discovered that the only way out from that spot was UP!  A break in the tree branches was just large enough to allow a car-sized (or disc-sized) object to go through.  There were no other options period!  Then I knew it was the real thing.

Actual footage was shown on the area.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "My wife and I saw four lights (not including a red flashing beacon) that appeared to be &quot;attached&quot; to a solid object.  It was moving at a slow speed and appeared to have descended from a hight of approx 500ft to approx 50ft.  There wasn&apos;t any noise from the environment, wind, or the flying structure.  It continued to move at about 3-5 mph without any dipping, tilting, banking, or pitching of any kind.  The closest it came to us was about 150 meters as we were perpendicular to its movement. Then we left.While leaving a friend&apos;s house in Emporia, my wife, two kids, and I headed back to Topeka, via Interstate 35.  I was driving.  We were heading in a North-Northeasterly direction and it was approximately 02:30 hrs and the sky was clear (possible small clouds but stars were visible). While my kids were sleeping, I noticed a bright light in the sky to my 12:30-1:00 position as a pilot would verse.  Initially, it looked like an airplane with landing lights on that gave the appearance of being approximately five miles away and an altitude of about 1,500 feet.  So, I didn&apos;t pay it much attention. Later, maybe 5-10 minutes, I noticed the light was still in the same position, yet a little closer.  There now appeared to be two lights rather than one.  Now, it looked more like a stationary obstacle; perhaps the light to a communications or broadcasting tower.  Later still, maybe 3 minutes, I continue to drive at a speed of about 65 mph.  Humerously, the two lights now appeared to be a car&apos;s headlights.  A car was slowly flying towards us at about 200 feet.  At this point I gave the lights my wife&apos;s attention.  It was now approx &lt; 2 miles away and still appeared to be 150-200 feet off the ground.  As we got closer, I slowed down and eventually stopped the car on the shoulder.  There were no other cars in sight on the highway.  At this time the lights were about 1 mile out and closing towards us.  Its altitude appeared to be 100 feet.  I aske my wife if she had any idea what it was.  She guessed an airplane.  I recalled some friends earlier stating that a blimp had been in Emporia that day; the", "It was approx. 10:30 PM when my mother did her usual routine of walking the dogs before going to bed.

After 5 minutes it was gone!It also made no sound! ", "A bright flourescent green light hovered between 2 houses then swiftly moved to left and then moved directly over us while we sat in car.My friend and I sat in a parked vehicle one night (after a rain storm) and as we spoke, I witnessed a bright flourescent ball of light (like the color of a glo-stick) hovering between my house and the neighbor&apos;s house to the left.  When I realized that the ball of light seemed to be suspended there for a few seconds it caught my full attention.  The &quot;ball&quot; moved quickly to the left, and for a brief moment &quot;sat&quot; in the center above the neighbor&apos;s roof.  I was trying to make sense of the unknown light and look for the source from where it could have been shining from.  When I did this, I moved my body so I could have a better view out of the windshield.  I believe I caught the attention of the &quot;ball&quot; and then it *immediately* made a bee-line for what seemed to be my face.  The &quot;ball&quot; came at me diagonally from the neighbor&apos;s roof area.  I screamed aloud.  Just then, the light came upon the top of the car.  It seemed to spread itself out atop the hood of the car.  It moved from the grill area all the way up over the windshield. The shape was almost that of something gelatinous or vaporous when it came onto the car.  In other words, it didnt move as light would move. It seemed to fill the car in a white light with a green tinge to it.  It was *extremely* bright at this period.  I recall feeling very warm and somewhat disoriented. It felt like the light consumed the space around my body; that I was no longer in a car; that I was now by myself in the light.  Then all of a sudden it was gone.  Now, to go back to the point where I screamed--at that time, my friend also screamed for he was reacting to my scream.  He did not see the light in the ball form, nor did he see the light on the hood, nor in the car. In fact, he was not sure why I had screamed. However, he did see the light move down the back window of the car and then vanish.  I did not see the light in the back window nor did I see the light vanish. I wanted to mention that my house is on the east side of the street.  Our vehicle was parked inbetween my house and the neighbors house to the left.  My friend was seated in the drivers seat and I was laying across the passengers seat and my head was on his lap--and yes, I was facing upwards looking at him as we spoke.  We were quite still in movement and I dont think that this &quot;ball&quot; of light knew we were there until I made movement to look closer at it out of the windshield.  I wanted to mention that the radio was turned on at a very low volume.  After the green &quot;ball&quot; of light left, it increased in volume.  This could have been because my friends knee hit the radio knob, yet I am still uncertain.  I will also mention that I did check the time when I went into the house and was quite surprised to learn that it was *much* later than I had anticipated, although the experience seemed to only last seconds. The entire event felt draining and exhaustive.  After six months or so had passed, I began to notice that I had a marked increase in my ability to learn and my ability to understand analytical issues.  I had wanted to report this experience when it had happened, yet I was too shy or perhaps still questioning what had &quot;really&quot; happened that night.  I have since witnessed another &quot;green ball light&quot; experience in the same city at a different location with a different witness.  This time, there were 3 balls of light and much further off in the distance.  The experience this time included only the sighting.  This sighting was approx. 11/10/97.  I will be happy to give you the details should you be interested in that experience.  Now it seems to me that I know what I experienced the first time was &quot;real&quot; so I have decided to finally report the incident. I will be more than happy to supply my background information to you upon request.  I am uncertain as to what you would like to know in that regard.  Thank you.", "Red dot split in two pieces - shot in different directionsRed sphere in sky, hovered in air for about 2-3 minutes, split in two parts, shot in two different directions, then disappeared, then a white dot appeared behind each of the two pieces that split apart.

At the 11:00 position, I first saw the clouds flash blue/green, then flash again just a second later a little lower and to the right. Then the ball appeared as it passed through the clouds, and disappeared at about the 4:00 position, I think behind some trees. The flashes were clearly the ball falling through the clouds.

As I traveled closer to it I saw a round white light in the center of the object and a silver sphere on either side.  I could barely see that these were fixed to an oval-shaped structure that was just longer than the width of the median.  I could not get my daughter&apos;s attention to look at the object. This did not look like an airplane or helicopter.  The round light was approximately 5 ft. in diameter, as were the silver spheres.", "Object moved through sky slowlyI live in the northeastern part of the city, and the craft appeared just west of my position. I was in my room at the time. My mom was in her bedroom, laying down at the time. The craft had 6 lights on it, grouped together in a formation that made up a filled-in circle of sorts. much like 5 lights on the edges and a 6th one in the middle. They were white. The craft moved in a northerly direction, much too slowly for any airplane to travel. I would say maybe about 15 MPH at the most, but most likely around 5 or 4. They moved in a straight path along the sky. There&apos;s an antena about 2 miles west of here on the horizon, and it appeared to move &quot;over&quot; it. The object did not rotate. It moved north for about 5-7 minutes, and then suddenly it went straight upward into the few clouds that were in the area. There was no angle to it. It just moved upward at a 100% vertical direction. It kept moving until I nor my mother could no longer see it. We live in Massillon, Ohio, just south and west of the northeast corner of the state. If it helps, we live near the tuscarawas (sp?) river.

It was very hard to distinguish the border around the object, even though it was very low, and large. There were lights on each corner, or what looked to be the corners. and it was a bigger light like the color of the moon, and there was another light within the light that moved in a circle inside the big light.

I could clearly make out detail on the outside of the object, which was more or less cylindrical in shape, though jointed. (The closest known shape I could describe would be a fire hydrant-like shape). It hovered soundlessly for a short time, and then took off straight up, very fast.", "While standing outside with my wife, I looked up and to the north and saw a triangle craft or formation at about 5000 feet. There were at least 10 white spotlight type lights on the leading edges of the craft and at least one of the lights seemed to move in a random manner inside the craft itself. This was all viewed by my wife and my self from the rear of the craft and the bottom.The whole event seemed to take place rather quickly. To be honest, my wife and I do describe the object itself in slightly different ways. My first impression of the object was that it looked impossibly large, yet somehow &quot;faked&quot; - in the sense that It reminded me of a projection or a hologram. My wife also thought it looked unreal, but her impression was that it was like an orgami shape. We both agree that it was VERY large and had at least ten bright round white lights on it. These were like spotlights except they thru down no beams, for lack of a better description. I estimate that we were no more than a mile or so away from the craft upon initially seeing it. It moved rather quickly to the north or north east and became progressively harder to see because of the cloudcover in the area at that time. 10 seconds or so after spotting it - I thought to run inside and grab my camcorder, but I had no sooner made it thru the front door, when my wife said (in a very non-plussed way) &quot;it&apos;s gone&quot;. in the interim, as I ran into the house she says that it looked like it was turning hard to the east, as if it was standing on it&apos;s edge, and then &quot;changed shape&quot; and became more spherical right before it dissapeared. When it vanished it did not speed off in any one direction - rather it simply dissapeared. As far as I&apos;m concerned, that backs up my projection theory, at least in some respects. However, that would be one heck of a powerfull projector, to put an image on cloudcover at 5000 or so feet. Now, some background. I am 29 years old and I work in Provisioning for AT&amp;T. To be honest, I have always enjoyed stargazing and have always said that I have an open mind about UFO&apos;s and would like to see one, but seeing this really blew my mind. Having said that, let me also restate the seeming &quot;unreality&quot; of the whole event in both my wifes and my own perceptions of it. By the way, my wife is 33 and she is a stay at home mom. We have a 8 month old daughter that was sleeping on the couch at the time of the sighting. Our main reason for reporting this is absolutely NOT for gain or publicity, but out of a simple curiosity...

It was quite large, about 3 inches wide b/n fingers held at arm&apos;s length. Over the next 35 minutes about 6 more went over towards the East.

It almost had a cloaking effect, something you would see on Star Trek. At about 2405 CST about 10-12 points of light went over in the Northern sky and halfway across the sky, they did a zigzag through weachother at tremendous speed.

I could barely make out the outline of a V shaped vehicle which looked like a carpenters square ruler. It was the night before the phoenix lights sighting occured.This sighting happened after I went through a most incredible series of events. I went to the Justice Department anti-trust division in San Francisco and provided a letter detailing my discovery of a non-detectable computer virus which was extremely destructive. I characterized this virus a Planned Osbolescence/Monopolization virus. I provided the Justice Department with a list of symptoms and a technique I discovered to resolve this problem.I got no assistance from them nor the FBI nor the police, as I was experiencing coersion in the harassment of my computer repair company by affluent people in the East Bay of California, Phone tapping and other manipulation, price fixing, and threats which made me fear for my life. My harassers were connected to the computer industry and large financial institutions. I was never formally interviewed by anyone and told my brother on the phone that &quot;They&apos;re only hope is to turn me into a Jesus freak or something, cause otherwise I&apos;m going to the supreme court about this.&quot; The next day I started hearing out of place voices on my TV and Radio which were of a religious nature. It was very convincing and I had started reading the bible because I was all alone as my family couldn&apos;t help and my friends didn&apos;t understand. I started having visions of things I read in the bible. These voices and visions went on for four months. I had to move as my business went from $5000 per month to about $100 per month once I announced this virus to lawyer customers who were trying to prove that I wrote it to increase my business when in actuality, I had no idea what was behind the harassment I was experiencing.

Two very different formations. On the second sighting saw about 5 military jets that flew extremely close to I-10 vehicles.We were taveling westbound on I-10 on September 1, 1998, approximately 8:30pm, between Desert Center and Indio, California.  The first sighting was about 10-15 miles west of Ironwood Prison on the south side of the road.  We saw four huge, round orbs of very bright, intense yellow-amber light.  One orb was higher than the other three, which were all level just below the mountin tops.  They were all very close, about 1-2 miles from the road.  We watched at length as we traveled.  The orb of light on the left, although the same size as the other three, clearly was hovering much higher above the mountain range. The others were all in one level line, seemingly intentionally just below the crest of the mountain range.  Suddenly the higher orb simply vanished.  It did not fly away.  It did not leave a trail (the moon was very bright and made it possible to see the outline of items in the area.)  It vanished so quickly and suddenly, followed almost immediately by two of the other three, and then the third, in the btween the remaing three.  Although we could see the entire surroundings, including trees, poles, and mountain outlines, we saw no evidence of the four orbs once they were gone.  About 10-15 miles further west, just past that mountain range, they suddenly appeared again.  This time much brighter, closer and larger, about 1 mile away from us.  The formation was now more like a &quot;v&quot;, with the left appearing higher, the second from left even with the fourth, which was on the right, and the third from left at the base of the &quot;V&quot;.  THe groun was illuminated completely by the light from the objects.  At that time we spotted the first two of what we believe were five military jets.  One jet came so very, very close above the traffic that it startled us.  We watched the orbs and the jets for another five minutes, and then needed to continue toward our destination. We did not see them disappear, and we could still see the glow long after our view was obscured by the mountains, but traffic obviously was slowing g! reatly behind us, perhaps to watch.", "I observed a bright pulsing(red, green, and white)light with several smaller white lights around it, while riding in the car with my sister.

One of the small lights came within 20ft. of us just above the treeline. It was very small, the size of a headlight, no sound, no rays of light coming from it. When it came to the closest point to us we felt a rush of fear come over us then it was gone.

The light varied in altitudes, the lowest point being approximatly 400ft agl.The red light became stationary and a smaller green light emerged from it and moved in an almost grid like pattern,moving quite fast. The red light remained stationary while the green light moved in all directions around it. This lasted for 40 mins. The green light then dissapeared in what appeared to be in the red light.

I&apos;m guessing that it was within a 1000 feet because of the doppler effect that I&apos;m used to from other craft fly by while approaching the airport.  I saw a car chasing it down the street like a bat out of hell.  The sound was traveling from east to west and the craft appeared to hover in a stationary manner over the lake for the better part of a minute and was was giving off an intense gold light that was dispersed by the fog above the water.  The engine sound was very smooth and almost sounded musical with just a hint of a regular pulse.  The tone could be likened to a number of square waves all tuned to different spectrums that would modulate independently of one another by just +/- 5 or 12 Hz.  The regular pulse was occuring at the rate of about 120 beats per second was was very faint.  This thing didn&apos;t have the slightest hint of a jet engine, prop or blade.

Could not tell how high it was; if it was within 50 yards of the roof, it was about 30-50 feet long; if it was higher, it was much bigger. My background: college graduate, never have done any drugs, never smoked anything, very light drinker. Always have been interested in aviation/ aerospace. At the time I was in my mid 30s with a husband and two young children. My son, also always interested in aviation/ aerospace, is now a pilot for a regional airline.", "A faily bright green light appeared to be falling straight down at high speed. Dissapeared somewhere in the distance at ground level. There was no tail, no sound, and no other colors. Just green.I was East bound on a Springfield street named MtVernon when a rapidly moving light straight ahead above in the sky caught my attention. My first thought was a shooting star then I noticed the bright green color. I then thought that it was an aircraft that was going to crash because of it&apos;s rapid descent but the light was not flashing like on aircraft. It was on solid. As I followed it to the horizen I expected there to be a flash or explosion as it hit the ground but there was none. I can only guess as to where the location of where it came down at. It looked like somewhere near the center of the city or East of there. I have seen metiors and planes before, this was not either of those. It was very unusual. When it came into my field of view I would say it was somewhere between a thousand to five hundred feet up in the air. And it also did not look like any kind of fireworks either. It had weight and moved to fast for that. And there were no sparks. I can&apos;t add much more except perhaps to say that it was coming down so fast that it startled me. It appeared to go all the way to the ground whether it landed or crashed I don&apos;t know.", "A flying ball of light with no structure, no sound, and no strobes or anticolision, navigational lights. Moved too fast for a STOL.At about 5:00 a.m. July 15 1998, I was walking my babbysiter home to her condo( we live in the same complex ), I noticed that there were two bright stars out, and recognised them as planets ( witch ones they were, I don&apos;t know, but am sure one was venus! ), also a half to almost three quarter moon. I showed them to my sitter, and we awed at how bright they all were even though the sun was starting to come up behind them. We were about three houses from the sitters when I looked up and saw another bright light that looked like another star, I told my sitter to look up, and immediatly she said &quot; hey look another big star! &quot; , I asked her if she noticed that it was moving in a jerking motion, and she said something silly about how ofcourse it was because everything is moving and orbiting.( ? whatever ) I told her to stop walking so we could get a closer look because even though there are two airports within a 10 mile radius, March A.B., and ofcourse Edwards not too far away that have aircraft flying over our community many times a day, and myself being an Air Force vetran who has worked on several types of aircraft, and familliar with many forigne ones to as part of that then profession, I could not recognize what I was seeing. At first I thought it was a civillian 747 type coming in for a landing with its landing gear lights on because it was so low, but it was going too fast to make a safe landing anywhere. Then I considerd it may be a jet fighter from one of the nearby bases with its lantern on, but yet the light was too bright, and other things came to mind why it couldn&apos;t be that. When it got just about over us I asked my sitter to look for any blinking lights, and to listen for the engine. As it quickly flew over us we did not detect any form of navigational, anticolision, beacon, or strobe light on it, and no noise came from it either. As it passed us  overhead we also looked for any kind of structure ( wings, tail etc. )it had none, just a big ball of light. Also when it got over us we could only se! e light, and at every position it was only light, for when a aircraft flys over you with any kind of light on, eventualy when it passes, the light is no longer that visable and you will see the back of the aircraft, this never happened. It maintained a complete light source at all angles. Well we didn&apos;t dottle around to see where it went because my sitter began to panic and wanted to go home quickly. I got her home, she went inside her house, and as I turned to leave for home it came back over, only this time it was much higher and faster. I considered that I was misstaken, that what I saw was realy just an airliner, and the second sighting was a sattelite, but it still seems way too odd. I mean the way it moved, the speed and alltitude were way off from the norm of any man made aircraft. I replay it in my mind, and talk to my sitter to confirm what had happened. I also find myself watching the ussual parade of aircraft flying over at different times of day trying to reenact what I saw, and still nothing comes close to it. I&apos;m sure there is probably an explaination for it, but I doubt I&apos;ll ever know what exactly it was. I just thought it was real weird, and it went against my years of knowledge in aircraft flight. It may just have been experimental goings on. Who knows? I&apos;ve never realy been a big believer in E.T UFOs in any case.", "Gentlemen I have always been someone who relies on experiential knowledge. I have always felt that the likelyhood of other intelligence was a probability. Last night it became a reality to me. The sighting is as follows: Approximately 10:30 PM last evening [Sunday] while outside here in Corpus Christi and simply looking at the stars because the sky was clear, except for a few scattered clouds, I made what I know was a UFO sighting. Moving in a direction from south to north were three objects that CLEARLY were not conventional aircraft. [ Both my brothers are airline flight instructors and I have been around pilots all my life. I have a fairly good knowledge of aircraft and their characteristics.] The size of the objects is best explained by saying if you held a TYLENOL capsule [ the oval/cylindrical variety] at arms length to your vision, that would represent the size these objects were to my field of vision. They were a pale LUMINESCENT orange/pink in color. Flying/moving in formation. One behind another in a straight line. As they moved over me, the one in the rear of this formation, broke and passed the others, as an auto would on the highway and taking the lead position. Their speed was much faster than conventional aircraft. But as the one in the rear passed the others, and took it&apos;s place in the lead their speed all of a sudden intensified as they flashed completely out of my vision. I was most impressed with the impact this had on my consciousness. While observing them I seemed to be in an almost altered state of consciousness. As though time slowed down to allow me to make their observance in remarkable detail. There is not even a slight amount of doubt in my mind that these were not of this world. I am still awed by this experience. Regards K((Name &amp; address deleted))", "Town of Fuquay, NC had power blackout -10PM - 06/22/98. Hwy 55,north of town, saw BRIGHT white light-southern horizon.

It struck me as particularly unusual because their brightness and color belied the usual stars or planets that might be seen there. Their position was so low, the city&apos;s glare mkes it all but impossible that they could have been stars. And besides, their positions were drifting. &gt;From my vantage point, they appeared to be at least 10-15 miles away from me, but certainly it could have been much further than that. I was too far away to see a whole lot more than what I told you, but I certainly would be happy to confirm any other possible, more close up viewings of what was seen. These were NOT flares. From my vantage point, one of the lights was clearly moving upwards, and often times appeared to draw very close to the most upper of the three lights. Also, the lights did not blink and they&apos;re movements were not the movements of any conventional aircraft. i.e. helicoptor or plane. I wish I had been closer, and I&apos;ll be interested to see what the papers say I was looking at in the morning. I was returning home from work when I saw the lights, so I have no idea how long they may have been there before I saw them, or where they may have been. I only know I first picked them up at about 9:50, and lost sight of them at about 10:10. From where I was, they appeared to be drifting off further to the N/W, and I lost them below the tree line at that point.", "White circular fireball with slight blue halo around edges seen south of Steilacoom towards known military airfield.

I woke up and saw a large craft outside the upstairs window of an A frame structure located in a wooded around.  My husband saw it too.  For some reason I fainted or went out.  I heard a voice with a thick middle eastern accent tell me to open my eyes.  I thought to myself, &quot;why would Mark, my husband, tell me to open my eyes. I said no.  The voice said you must.  I finally did after the voice spoke firmly.  What I saw I had never before seen.  It looked like an insect. It was thin and white wearing a dark suite, more like a robe.  It spoke without moving its lips.  I couldn&apos;t tell who was talking to me because there was more than one.  The others were wearing jumpsuits. He kept telling me to look at him, but I didn&apos;t want to and I kept shutting my eyes.  He said I must not fear him but I kept screaming and hyperventilating.  He kept saying he would not harm me and I must believe that.  He kept looking closely in my eyes or at my pupils.  I asked him what he was .  Was he a snake ?  He said no, I am not a reptile.  Then I asked if he were a insect.  He told me to look at his arms and said something about his joints and were they like an insect?  I asked him if he were going to kill me or eat me.  He said,  Why? do you think you would taste good?  This may sound like I am joking, but truly I am not. I kept screaming and shutting my eyes.  I was on some sort of table, I know, your classic alien experience.  The others around me starting backing away. The taller alien, the one in the robe told them That is the fear, that is the fear you smell.  It was awful.  I kept going in and out and I was afraid for my baby.  They of course, took a long needle and stuck it in my belly button.  It hurt worse than anything I had ever felt.  It told them it hurt and one of the little mean things put his hand over my eyes.  I must have fainted because the pain went away.  When I awoke or whatever again I saw the one in the robe talking to another one.  Their backs were turned to me so I figured what have I got to lose.  I made fun of the back of their heads and told them they looked like basket balls.  ONe said, You are making fun of us?  I said Yes.  I want to go. He said not yet.  There was much more but this is hard to talk about and I need to stop now.  There were helicopters around the ship when I first saw them before I was awakened.

I shared a 3rd floor apartment with ((Name deleted)), his wife ((Name deleted)), and their son ((Deleted)). On a hot summer Friday evening in July, we were sitting watching Johnny Carson having put ((Deleted)) to bed at 10 pm. It was very hot so we had all the windows open. The bedroom window had no screen and led to a fire escape. The TV started to go to a snow.  We heard ((Deleted)) crying around 11:45 and ((Deleted)) went white.

When we got to the window, the thing had flown away and was about 150-200 feet up and several hundred feet south of us. It was going toward an object in the sky that was ruby red in color. In seconds the thing was a silver dot and it merged with the object along with 3 or 4 other dots. The object then  rose to 1000 ft. and went southwest at high speed. The thing was about 4 feet tall with large eyes and fang-like teeth. The arms were disproportioinately long, like a chimpanzee&apos;s arms. He had a silvery colored suit and his feet didn&apos;t appear to touch the ground. He rather floated across the room and out the open window. I am not exactly sure about the date but I am definite about the time. The details of the encounter are still rather vivid in my mind as the experience we shared was very traumatic.

The land over which it moved was flat delta, barren of trees and homes.  The object emitted bright pulsating light, flashing on and off every second or two.I (age 47, professional) was driving north on highway 49 having crossed the Mississippi River into Arkansas from Missouri.  My father (age 77) sat in the right passenger seat.  My mother (age 74) sat behind him.  It was a dark, clear night.  Stars were visible.  On either side of the road were flat delta rice fields.  I don&apos;t believe there were any trees.  No homes were in sight.  The road ahead was straight and flat.  I had a clear view ahead as far as the eye could see at night.  There were no headlights ahead.  Behind me I saw the distant headlights from a car far behind.  I noticed bright white flashing lights a few hundred yards ahead, up and to my right, somewhat higher than I might expect to find the tallest treetop.  My first thought, as I recollect, was that I was seeing a light tower.  I was really rather paying scant attention to it at the time.  At about the same time I first saw the object, my mother asked, &quot;What is that?&quot;  I then noticed that the object was moving in the opposite direction in which we were headed.  I remember thinking that it must be a plane.  Again, my attention was not full; I was not particularly interested.  I watched as it flew by and out of sight.  I again directed my attention to the road ahead.  Then in the seconds that followed, for the first time I began to focus more intently on what I had just seen.  I turned back to see if I could catch sight of the object but I did not see it.  I thought then that my inability to see the object was due to the restricted view, limited to the back window and rear-view mirror.  As I gazed at the road ahead of me, the image of what I had seen sharpened.  I realized I had seen a large circular object with a panel of bright white light spaced evenly along its side.  The lights pulsated every second or two.  The object seemed to have a shell of bronze/silver metal.  This was the first time I had the thought that I had seen a &quot;UFO.&quot;  I turned toward my mother and asked, &quot;What did you just see?&quot;  She, too, described a large circular ob! ject with bright white lights around it.  My mother had a somewhat longer look at the object.  She watched the object move from the window to her right.  As she described it, she turned to her right to follow the object&apos;s flight when it suddenly disappeared.  Neither of us had heard sound.  What made this sighting especially intriguing to me is that my mother had seen this object.  Although I&apos;d never before laid claim to observing a UFO, I do maintain an interest in the phenomenon.  My mother, on the other hand, has no interest in such things and would not believe in the possibility of UFOs and visitations (of course I realize that a UFO would not necessarily imply otherwordly objects).  My mother remains convinced that she did not see an airplane or other aircraft she might identify.  She was rather stunned in fact.  At home, later that evening, my mother and I drew what we had seen.  The drawings were essentially similar, the slight difference likely accountable to the different perspective in viewing.  I might add that my father did not observe anything unusual.  I attempted to account for that.  He said that he was neither asleep nor had his eyes closed, but I&apos;m not certain of that.  I know, sadly, that my father has lost his sharpness of mind over the last several years (early stage dementia is suspected).  I also know that there was not any fuss as the event unfolded.  Other than my mother&apos;s simple question, &quot;What is that?&quot; no other words were spoken.

They turned clock wise to the north and I spotted a metalic shinney object out the corner of my left eye.  I turned to look at the object and it was semi circle(kind of oval) it looked like a dule chrome and not a constant color, a hazziness to it.  It looked like a circle with a portion of it flat on one side.  It was there for about 1 full second+, not very long at all, then I see this weird flash of that was silverish in color but going vertical on the side of the objects flat side, followed with a small mirror type flash.

Then we looked back to where the original object had been.  Now it was higher in the sky, still flashing and moving generally downward.  It seemed much farther away now as the lights were much less distinct.  Finally, it disappeared or became obscured behind the trees that were in that direction. I don&apos;t know what this was.  My feeling is that it was not a normal aircraft, because of the overall movement-- low in the sky, then high, up, down, etc.  Also, the flashing didn&apos;t seem to be the usual wing lights of an airplane.  My hope is that this report may coincide with others who perhaps got a better look. If you have any questions, call us.", "saw something in the airI was driving East on Illinois 58 in Hoffman Estates, IL. I came to a stop at an intersection, when I happen to look up in the air. At that exact moment, a green streak went from the west to the east, high in the air, and then make a sharp 90 degree turn to the south, and then dissapeared. I had 2 other passengers in the car, and neither one of them saw the event. I pulled into a parking lot to get out and keep looking, and did not see anything except regular airplanes in the sky. I know those were airplanes since being within 10 miles of Chicago O&apos;Hare Airport.", "Two cylinder objects as if they were clouds at first.  One seemed to &quot;land&quot; or fly VERY low, stop and wasn&apos;t to be seen agian.  4 other &quot;bubbly&quot; type objects followed after the object appearing to land.  I say land because it was moving slowy.  Numerous jets quickly appeared in this precise area for a long period.I got a call from my mother this morning about 7:25 asking me to come over and look at what she was seeing.  I live in Bothell, just blocks from her place so I went over right away.  She lives high on a wide open hillside overlooking all of the Cascade mountains from about the Carnation foothills going out to the east and from about the Darrington foothills further north going out and over to the east.  The view goes well over the Cascade mountain pass encompassing the Eastern Washinton areas of Whenatchee, Chelan and Brewster areas.  I got to her place about 7:40.  I did not see the objects that my mother said were so unlike anything she had ever seen (she will write out her personal discription in a message to you after she gets off work as a computer programmer today).  What I was clearly seeing though were many jet contrail lines in and out of the precise spot she saw these UFO&apos;s.  What seemed curious where the amount of these contrails.  After 15 destinctly seperate trails within 1 hour of arriving I just stoped counting.  It was as if I were at an air show watching the those plans that leave those patterns of smoke trails except these planes were fast.  From the best I can position them, they were flying in a tight area that seemed to be right over the Whenatchee area.  The jets seemed to be coming in from the south. &quot;Well, I certainly have never seen such a force of jets at work like this before&quot;.  I would like to hear what people in the Wenatchee area know or saw. We did take some later pictures, only of the contrails, if they are clear enough we can scan and send them latter if wanted.

It was moving at a very fast pace at a downward-slanted position. Disappeared behind the mountains, but seemed to be headed towards Edwards Air Base in Lancaster.

The light seemed to appear suddenly over the airport, or maybe just north of it, sort of rising up.  It was a VERY bright white light, and appeared to be about half the diameter of the moon.  It then proceeded at a rapid rate, faster than conventional aircraft, taking only about 2-3 seconds to complete its northward journey. Then, it stopped and simultaneously turned red.  Then, it proceeded much more slowly back toward the airport at a slightly lower elevation.  It proceeded past the airport and that is when I stopped looking for it, as it was being lost behind trees.  Total sighting was a minute or more.I and two brothers who live nearby were on what is known as the West Mesa of Albuquerque, NM, about one to one and a half blocks west of New Coors and a little less than one block south of Sage.  The time was between (my guess) 02:30 and 03:30, Sunday morning 10/04/98.  I was facing east, the brothers west.  I saw it first, a very bright white light, similar in appearance to aircraft landing lights, but, it was a single light and much too bright to be aircraft landing lights.  It reminded me of an extremely powerful quart-halogen light.  It appeared over the airport or maybe just a little north of the airport, and then moved north, seeming, from our vantage point, to be just above the nearby Sandia Mountains.  Albuquerque is at about 5,000 feet above sea level, and the tallest peaks of the Sandias are about 10,000 feet.  Its travel time from north to south was only about 2-3 seconds.  I have watched aircraft circle and land at the airport here countless times.  The light&apos;s speed was at least 10 times that of the aircraft when they are approaching from the north before landing. From our vantage point, the light seemed to stop at about the same place as a couple of red marker lights on the nearby Sandias.  I was now facing slightly north, perhaps about 30 degrees north of east.  As soon as it stopped, the light became red.  The red was not as bright, but, it was far brighter than the aforementioned red marker lights.  Then, it reversed course and headed back toward the airport, but, now it was moving much more slowly.  It actually went past the airport when I stopped watching for it.  On its reverse course, it was at a slightly lower altitude and was disappearing and reappearing behind trees. Total sighting was a minute plus. There is a nearby trailer court that the light passed over (or seemed to pass over). The street lights in the trailer court went out when it passed over, both on its northward journey and its southward journey.", "we were driving E. on I-90.The night was very clear. the moon was very large and low.

The object flew across the sky so fast, that it looked like a meteorite. But it had red, orange, green and blue colored lights flashing rapidly around it. Then another similar object appeared. The two objects flew back and forth across the sky all night. They did not get close enough to make out a shape but sometimes they zipped away so rapidly that it was like a streak. Activity continued all night long. The deck hands reported to me that once during the night a craft without lights flew low over the boat. The next morning our boat passed by the Abraham Lincoln air craft carrier. Note that often UFO activity is reported in conjunction with military activity. Upon arriving home, in Astoria Oregon in October, my neighbor, who works in a local cafe told me that she overheard a conversation with people who said they had seen a UFO while out on a boat.

Strobe-like flash accompanied at point of near-impact.I was driving 55-60 mph on the highway south of Pleasanton, NE, when I saw a small, orange, fluorescent object ahead in the distance. I dismissed it as a powerline reflector usually seen near small, rural airports, forgetting that there is no airport (to my knowledge) in that area.  It was just dusk and darkening into night, and the object seemed to get dimmer as I drove south, eventually fading out of sight, so I assume it was travelling in a southerly direction along the highway, perhaps a little faster than I was driving. A few minutes later, as I was passing a familiar farm site with house and grain elevator in the yard, a white/silver spherical object, about 9 inches in diameter, came down out of the night sky and rushed directly at my car. Its path was over the hood and up the windshield, a few inches above the vehicle.  I felt a rush of wind and heard a loud swooshing sound as it passed over.  My reaction was to duck and swerve the car slightly to the left, but my reaction occurred after this quick event.  There was a bright, strobe-like flash as it reached the top of my windshield and flew up over my car. The flash enabled me to see several feet from the vehicle, over to a power pole in the ditch, and a power line extending over the highway from the pole, so the object had to go beneath this line.  I tried to see it in my rear view mirror, but sited nothing, and sped on south to Kearney, NE. I wondered about the incident on my way home, but was really too scared and confused to come to any conclusions, so I promptly forgot about it, until I saw my family at Christmas.  We were telling stories, and I remembered my experience.  I told my sister-in-law, but got frightened as I told her, and told her I thought it was an owl that swooped in front of my car.

The object travelled at a good rate of speed from Southeast to Northwest. I estimate it covered approximately 120 degrees of arc in something under two minutes. There were two aspects of this light that were odd. It was constantly illuminated, but appeared to flicker rapidly, changing colors as it did so from red to blue. The flicker rate was very rapid, changing at least 30-40 times per second. The object&apos;s direction of travel was not in a straight line.

It was only a 737 making a downleg approach to Logan Airport in Boston.  As I looked up to identify the aircraft I saw a sphere shaped object above the 737.  The object was stationary because the 737 passed under it.  There were broken cumulus clouds at 3,000 to 5,000 feet.  The object appeared metallic as it reflected sunlight.  The bottom of the sphere appeared darker.  It may have been the reflection of the moisture laden clouds.  I thought I might have been a Mylar party balloon but the wind was approximately 8 to 10 knots from the Southwest and it would blown a 2 foot diameter balloon rather briskly.  A Mylar balloon would also shimmer as it bounced along.  This object retained a constant reflective shine from the sunlight.

She said,&quot;What the $%^&amp; is that?&quot; I turned and looked up to see this formation of 5, white, lights.  Flying from West to East at a couple thousand feet.  At first glance I thought it was a bunch of ultralights flying in formation.  There are a bunch of pilots in Santa Monica that have these planes and they often fly them in formation, but I&apos;ve never seen them fly at night.  But as they passed over I realized these weren&apos;t aircraft lights (not conventional aircraft at least).  The lights themselves were sort of diamond shaped and not real bright and one of them seemed to be jockeying for position in the rear.  As the passed overhead I realized they made no sound -- which was the eeriest part. My neighborhood is quiet and my spa wasn&apos;t turned on. I lost sight of them over Hollywood.  My wife said she saw the formation &apos;flip&apos; as it reached the ocean and start heading back toward the East.  I didn&apos;t see it &apos;flip&apos; but from the time she saw it to the time I lost sight of it towards Hollywood was only a matter of about 5 seconds.

There were no lights or windows visable.", "We where on the road when we saw 2 long lights flying hirizontaly flashing alternatly.

They flew this way for abaut 4 sec. and then started descending diagonaly until they came out of sight behind the trees.

The lights were bright, but they weren&apos;t luminating the trees or ground.  I stopped the car and we observed the lights. Then before I realized it we were drive down the road toward my friends house.  We never really discussed what we saw that night, but when we do (three years later)my friend gets alittle defensive and denies seeing anything. After a few days of the incident I told my girlfriend at the time about what we saw, she told me not to discuss this in public(in fear that I would be considered crazy).

This was no meteor.  It looked like a giant seagull, or two chevrons joined ( ^^ ) [that&rsquo;s the closest my computer will match its shape, but more elongated side to side]  It was moving slowly and deliberately NE-to-SW and had a dozen or so lights on the underside.  Had it been standing still, it would have blended perfectly into the night sky, they looked just like stars, only they moved together.  I detected no colored lights.  The shape could have been one unit, two chevrons tip to tip, or multiple in formation, but appeared to move together.  The lights did not blink at all, and I heard no sound.  The impression I had was of a single unit, probably low altitude compared to planes in the area, which were easily differentiated by their lights.  At first I thought perhaps it was just a flock of geese, but I followed it for maybe a 30-second period or longer until it was too far away and too dim to see.  Geese in our area are common, but do not remain visible for long, nor do they fly that uniformly, and they invariably honk.  They (geese) do not look like lights.  It was not an airplane.

It was very long and appeared to be very far away.  The anomaly would become very bright and would pulsate periodically.  The light seemed to be brighter at the top and would somewhat fade near the bottom.  An example of what it looked like would be if you looked at the profile of a spiral galaxy with what appeared to be visible stars in it.  There were 3 lights, one at the top, the middle and the bottom, the one in the middle was the brightest, they were difficult to see.  At this time I called a local TV station to report what was going on, they did not answer and I left a message, it was channel 11 KHOU, Houston.  Once I called the station the light disappeared and did not return, I went inside and approx. 8 to 10 minutes later I came back outside and my wife ask me to focus in on a craft in the sky, it was diamond in shape and had 5 white lights on it.

I saw a bright object out of the corner of my eye, and looked in time to see an orange disk fly across the sky in front of my car.  The disk appeared to be flaming, was traveling north, and moved over the horizon very quickly.  A rushing sound accompanied the moving object.  It was traveling at  about tree level and was larger than a car.

I will try and send a drawing - I&apos;m not sure how well that description will be understood. They were both of a light red colour and I&apos;ve never seen anything move as smoothly as they seemed to. As I said they were orbiting around each other - first one would spin in a small circle while the other orbited around it and then they would switch places. They traded places every minute or so. The larger orbit was being made more slowly and the smaller being made more quickly, as is true of all orbits I think. After about ten minutes they stopped fairly rapidly, pausing for a moment and then flew away in one direction at a rather surprisingly slow speed.

I knew it was not the Moon, however, because I could see the Moon in another part of the sky.  The object, which I would estimate was a half mile to one mile away, did not move while I watched it for several minutes.  Since I was only about a half mile from my house, I hopped in my car and drove as fast as I could to my house, because I wanted to point out the object to my Mother &amp; Brother.  By the time I got to my house the object was no longer visible.  I never saw anything in the newspapers, or other media, about this event, and I have never seen any other anomalous objects in the sky, either before, or after this event.

Seconds after it disappered, a darker object appeared at the same level, in the same cloud, but heading in the opposite direction at a slower rate of speed.

It moved slowly, and never changed speed or direction. It seemed to be about 1000 feet in altitude and moved over me traveling toward the South East around 8PM. I watched for more than a minute and it appeared larger than a traffic red light but smaller than a golf ball at arms length.  It had no wings or fins.  It was saucer shaped and somewhat rounded or spherical.  One side was very dark, perhaps black.  The other side was brightly lit.  The sun had set but it was still very light out.  The sky was clear, no clouds.  There was nothing hazy or fuzzy about the sighting.  The ship was very plain to see and it looked like a solid object just like a house or car or any other object. It might have been as large as a house. I am not sure of the size.  The UFO rotated so the bright side and the dark side became visible during each rotation.  Each rotation was about 2 seconds.  It did not rotate on any axis you might normally think of.  It just tumbled along.  The light it gave off was very bright but not as bright as looking at a 75 watt light bulb.  The light was white but as it rotated, sometimes I could see a bit of red. I was alone.  I called the local police and the Asbury Park Press to see if anyone else reported it and the answers were negative. This was a very unusual object.  I called the small local airports, nothing. Last summer, I and a neighbor, saw a blinking object go from horizon to horizon in 3 to 5 seconds.  Since then, he said he saw it 3 more times.  I thought the blinking might be a strobe, at that time.  The blinks were elongated into streaks.  Now I am wondering if these sightings were of the same object.  The July object if traveling fast could have appeared to streak because the light was rotating and sometimes faced me and sometimes did not, like a rotating beacon.  As I watched the July object, I became aware of many many little spots in my vision dancing around. I looked away and saw from the object into the clear sky and little spots were dancing all over my eyes.  I continued to watch the object until it was out of sight.  A short time later, I realized that the little spots were all gone.  I had never seen spots or little dots before or since. I am a 55 year old Electrical Engineer and I work for the Government.  This object just defied gravity as it floated along, slowly rotating.  I wonder who it belongs to and what it is doing.  Our Government knows a lot more than me and I know what I saw so I am wondering what the Government knows. I am wondering why they are so quite on this subject. I am inclined to think what I saw was not part of a black project.  I just want to know what the Government knows about this.  I want to know if our Government has any knowledge of these objects or if ETs are working with us.  I got a good look at this thing and it was a solid object.

It was almost midnight.  Out of the corner of my eye I saw something coming diagonally over us from behind.  I alerted ((Name deleted)), and we both got a good long look.  It was approximately the shape of a minivan, and about twice as big.  It was dark grey or black in color, and we approximated that it was between 40 and 60 feet above us, and traveling away from between 30 and 60 miles per hour.  It was virtually silent, except for a slight hum, possibly displaced air. It had no markings that we could see.  The most amazing thing was how it moved, completely steady.  It never sped up, slowed down or wavered in it&apos;s course, it was as if it was on a track.  It was so unusual seeing something as large as it was traveling so smoothly, quietly, and slowly in the air without wings.  It was truly defying gravity. It passed over our heads, over the golf course, and then into the desert heading east. Shawn and I have always been bothered by the fact that the description of our sighting does not match any others that we have heard or read.

They were a dull gray, and were extremely smooth moving and fast. The 2 craft were in sync; moving quickly across the sky. The air around the front of the disk seemed to be a reddish-black, as if it were at a very high temperature. There was a building to the right of them, so I could tell they were high up.

I had just stepped out of my truck after arriving in Bend at my girlfriend&apos;s parent&apos;s house and the brightness of these lights caught my eye because I hadn&apos;t recalled ever seeing a constellation in that area of the sky before. There had been snow showers in the vicinity and the skys were in a broken condition with cirrus clouds also in the vicinity. Objects were first observed almost stationary. Then, after a few seconds, I noticed they started moving in a straight line towards an approximate 330deg direction.  The speed they were traveling was about twice as fast as a satellite would be observed moving but much slower than a meteor entering the atmosphere. All objects remained equi-distant from one another, approximately 1 finger-width between each. They were all white in appearance, the same as the surrounding stars. No sound, fire trail, strobe lights, running lights, flaring, or fragmentation was observed.  The front 3 objects were as bright as the surrounding stars. The 4th object in line was a little brighter, and the 5th object was approximately the same brilliance as Jupiter. I had time to call my girlfriend over to my side of the truck to also observe this event. We watched the few remaining seconds as they seemed to fade out of sight at approximately 40deg of arc due possibly to the high cloud obscuration. I am 50 years old, a Vietnam Era Air Force veteran.

Shere color was either black or dark grey, and appeared to rotate. It also appeared that it emitted some type of light or reflected the morning light. Object appeared to be 1 to 2 miles away and travelling a little faster than normal aircraft.I was working the night shift at an area marina as night security. The night was nice with no weather to report that night or morning. The skies were clear and it was a beautiful sunrise. I was standing on the easternmost part of the marina (a large beach type of area strewn with large and small pieces of broken concrete). I looked up to the west, north west and observed what appeared to be a rather large sphere shaped object travelling from south to the north, maybe northeast about 1 to 2 miles away. It was possibly black or dark grey in color and possibly rotating. I say possibly rotating because as it flew on there was some type of either light or streak on it that appeared to rotate around the object end over end. The object was travelling somewhat faster than any aircraft in the area that morning. There was a small private plane that was approximately 5 to 10 miles away to the south travelling west, at what speed I do not know. I looked back to the object and noticed there were no smoke or vapor trails which would have been noticeable in the morning sky. I looked around the sky to see if I could see any type of military aircraft following or attempting to intercept, since Selfridge Air National Guard Base is approximately 5 to 7 miles north of the marina I was at. I saw nothing else in the sky. When I looked back to the object, it had disappeared. I contacted the CoastGaurd about 2 minutes later when I returned to the Gatehouse and asked if they had recieved any type of reports of unusual things in the air and they replied &quot;NO&quot;. After this I did not attempt any other reporting for fear of being completely criticized and also possibly losing my job which, at that time, I could not afford to do.", "We saw five lights in the southwest sky that changed formation and disappeared.  All within a matter of about 5-10 seconds.There were five lights that had an orange hue in a straight parrallel line at approximately the 2:00 position in the southwest sky. The second and fourth light dropped down below the line and formed a W...then the third light dropped down to form a U. And then they were gone.  Vanished. We were driving down the road when we saw this.  Passenger spotted these lights out the passenger window with the window rolled down.  Passenger asked driver what those lights were.  Driver looked out window and saw same.  Driver pulled off road.  Trees obstructed view for a second.  We looked back up when we were off the road away from the trees. They were gone.

A booming sound was heard, but it was muffled. The fireball started out as yellow, then turned orange, with a green tail spreading out about the width of a full moon. The green color dissapated slowly and appeared to phosphoresce as it faded. Total time streaking across the sky was about 6 seconds. The phosphorescence lasted an additonal 4-5 seconds. I tried to get the attention of the other boater before it faded, but, insofar as he was turned northward, and the object was at about 60 degrees up in the Southern sky, he did not turn and focus in time to see the whole thing.The boat engine did sputter and almost quit when the object crossed the sky, but ran o.k. thereafter.", "Driving on a back road in rural Wayne county, we had been driving along a stretch of woodland when we entered some cleared farmland.  As we passed this area, a harvested hay field; we saw 5 or 6 small craft sitting in the field at the back of the clearing near the woods.  They were approximatly 500 or 600 feet from the road.  About the size of a volkswagon bug with a red light at each corner of a triangle.  As we passed thru the area they each rose from the field and flew over the field and the road behind us.  I saw nothing else as I was busy getting the hell out of there.  My friend and I told no-one at the time even though there had been articles in &quot;The Daily Record&quot;, the local paper; discribing a much larger triagular craft being seen around the county.  I&apos;ve always wondered if the several smaller craft assembled into the larger one.  Wayne county had several sightings of a large trianglar craft again in 1975.  Many saw it, myself included.  Many years later I read the book about the Hudson Valley sightings and it was identical to the craft I and another friend saw in 1975.  The local paper covered both sightings very well, giving them front page exposure.", "Large Blue Fireball with a tail flying in a northern direction.  This object was not a typical falling star. The object than disappeared .My wife and I were driving in our Mini-Van traveling northbound on I-5.  We were about 25 miles just south of Tumwater traveling about 60-65 MPH.  We both noticed a large blue fireball appeared flying overhead     (Note: the object came into view through our windshield passing our vechicle in the sky heading in a northern direction.)  The fireball was in sight for both of us to witness before disappearing.  At approx 18:45 we also observed 4 flashes of blue light as if a storm was of in the distance. The flashes of light were about 2-3 minutes apart.  No clouds were in the sky and no storm conditions present    These blue flashes were in the northern sky.  At this point we were were still driving on I-5 inroute to Seattle.", "Red Light traveling N/E along the Hardy Tollway. While the light was red, a blue light, then green was visible next to the red lightFor approximately 1 to 2 minutes, a red light was traveling N/E along the Hardy tollway. In the distance, red warning lights are visible on radio towers. Because I could see the distant red warning lights, this red light caught my attention. I was surprised to see the blue light appear next to the red light, which was constant, and even more surprised to see the green light appear next to the red light.", "I had gone to visit with a friend at about 30 ave. and just north of northern, I arrived at his home and noticed his car was gone, he had told me he had to go to the store so I just sat in front of his house in my car waiting for him to return. While I was sitting there I happened to look to the northwest where I saw what looked like four large, very bright white lights in the sky at about 30 degrees. It appeared that they were about one or two miles away from where I was, probably somewhere around 43 ave. or 51 ave. and Olive. These lights appeared to me to be in the shape of a very large diamond they were as bright as and maybe even brighter than those you would see on a commerical jet airliner. When I first saw them they were coming straight down out of the sky in a verical direction. I thought at first that they were the nose, wing, and tail lights of a large jet crashing into the ground, but what was really strange about this was that they were moving downward very slowly. As the lights came down closer to the ground they began to disappear behind the houses in the area, I was thinking to myself that very soon I would be seeing a large fireball in the sky from the crash, but it never happened. As I sat there thinking about what I had seen I decided that it was not a jet crashing because it was moving to slowly. I also decided that it was not helecopters because all of the lights moved downward at exactly the same speed, it did not look like flares because all of the lights were of the same intensity and were a bright white color more like you would see on a jet for it&apos;s landing lights, except much bigger and brighter. I could not see the body of any craft partly because the lights were so bright but also because it was so far away from me. I do remember that as I was looking at it thinking it was a jet crashing, I thought that it looked to big to be a jet, at that distance it would have been at least 10 times larger than a jet. A couple of days after this happened I was talking to my mother and told! her what I had seen, after I told her about it she told me that she had just seen on the local TV news a story about the &quot;Phoenix Lights&quot; that so many people all over the valley had seen on that same night. I was not going to post this at first until I read on here how many people had seen something like I had. This is the first time I have ever seen anything like this and I know what I saw was something out of the ordinary, I will never forget it and it has made me much more aware of the skys around me.", "A green fireball appeared suddenly and lit the ground all around the neighborhood, scaring my son and our dogs, then disappeared.My 20-year-old son was walking the dogs at 1:30 AM before retiring when the ground in our residential neighborhood took on an eerie green glow.

He looked up and saw a low-flying, moving &quot;fireball with a long tail.&quot;  He held his arms out in front of him and said the tail, at arm&apos;s length, was about 9-10 inches long behind it.  He said it was silent and so odd that he came immediately home.

My husband pulled off the road and when we looked the object had changed to a huge triangle shape that hovered in a field no more than  50 feet away. It was dark so all we could see were the 3 big white lights, one in each corner.

Right after I observed it, it sped up, as if it knew I noticed it. I jumped out of the car, never taking my eyes off of it, and watched it speed off due south, maintaining the same altitude, and traveling in a straight line, until it faded into the distance.

I attempted to follow its path with my eyes on the other side of the trees, only a brief distance, especially at the rate at which the object seemed to be traveling, but did not see any trace.  The light seemed to be quite far away, perhaps 2-5 miles directly south of my view, at about 45 degrees above the horizon from my vantage point.  Its size appeared to be larger than the brightest star, but not much bigger.  The narrow tail appeared briefly as it was visible before the trees, but disappeared almost instantly.  I thought about what it may have been, as I was incredulous, never having had a sighting in the Denver area. I thought about it being possibly a reflection of tail lights in my windshield, but I was traveling on a one-way street on one side of a river (the other direction is on the other side of the South Platte River, and is not visible much of the time from my side of the road) after having passed through an intersection where a traffic light halted any perpendicular traffic.  Additionally, the light had just turned green and I was one of the first cars to pass through the inter- section.  Finally, I have traveled this route many, many times before, and had never seen anything of this sort.  One more thing, there may have been light clouds that evening, but I do not specifically recall (sorry).  The sun was well-down by this time--not dusk at all. As mentioned above, I had never seen a sighting in the Denver area, but have had 2 separate sightings in the Caribbean in February of this year.

This craft produced no sound.  The only reasons we could identify the shape was the light produced from the lights of a baseball game in the park we were at and the stars it was passing under, it was a clear night.On the night of this occurrence, my girlfriend and I were sitting in this particular park.  After proposing to my girlfriend and drinking hot cocoa, we layed on our backs and relaxed just looking at the night sky, when we noticed a black triangle craft pass directly overhead going N.W. to S.E. this craft was definitely within hearing range.  It was at a pretty low altitude. This craft made no noise! The only lights we noticed were very faint almost non-visual dots down the front bottom sides. This craft was flush w/ the night sky, meaning, this thing could have definitely been cruising over the city all night long with very few if any people noticing it.  My biggest suprise overall was definitely the fact that there was no noise coming from this craft at its altitude. Any human craft I know of would definitely have been heard at this position in the air above us.", "Appeared to be space-plane re-entering atmosphere.  Eventually flew directly overhead without ever making a sound.  First appeared to be leaving trail of light that did not dissipate.I walked outside the front door at 10:30 PM.  It was a clear night, and I had my exterior flood lights on as well as the rest of my neighbors usually do at this time of night.  Looking to the west, just over the treetops, I noticed a white ball with a tinge of yellow and red.  This light&apos;s flight pattern was basically perpendicular to me in a north to south direction.  As it travelled, it produced a large, long illuminated trail.  The characteristic of it was incredible.  The trail did not dissipate and appeared to move along with the front being the ball of light.  I can&apos;t tell you what the trailing was . . . if it was flying on a beam of light . . . if the trail was actually part of it&apos;s structure . . . or if its hull was superheated from atmospheric braking. I&apos;m guessing that it turned from a north-south direction to an ENE direction.  The reason why I say that is that it went from an elongated shape to a round ball shape with no trail.  I called my friend out to observe this.  It seemed to have stabalized which leads me to believe that it was traveling quite a distance directly toward me.  The brightness started to fade like turning out a camping lantern.  At that time regular red, green, and white aircraft strobes appeared to turn on. I cannot be sure that the ball of light and the stobes were from the same vehicle, but the vehicle proceeded toward me and over me at a leisurely speed similar to other aircraft I would watch leave the local airport. As it passed overhead it was just out of clear visular range, but appeared to be triangular or at least flat-backed.  We listened very hard, and we heard a whisper of some sound which really did not keep pace in any way with the craft.  If I had to make a conjecture, I would say it was a military space plane . . . but most definitely highly visible and unusual.", "A bright Flash of something in the sky leaving a long trail lasting approx. 60 secs. and a long greenish hume to the tail.I was on my way to work this mornig, 11-16-98  at about 0445 ( I was almost to work and had to start at 0500) when I noticed a bright flash that had seemed to illuminate the entire area.

I turned to ask my wife if she saw them when I turned back to the sky they were gone.

I was driving about 65 mph. It was big and it was close. It was traveling from the northwest to the southeast. Most astounding was the bright apple-green color, the closeness, and the long tail.I am a 47-year-old married woman with one teenage son. I publish a national, monthly trade magazine by profession and was on my way to a quarterly operations meeting in Auburn, CA, with my business partners. About one hour into my drive, directly in front of me at about a 45 degree angle, a large, very bright ball of fire streaked across the sky moving from northwest to southeast. I was driving about 65mph on CA Interstate 680 North on the southern outskirts of the City of Dublin. I was shocked at how close the fireball was. It&apos;s very difficult for me to judge but I would guess it was just two football fields away from me at a 45 degree angle. The center of the ball was the brightest white I&apos;ve ever seen but the most remarkable aspect was the bright flourescent apple-green color around the ball and surrounding the long tail. After about five (5) long seconds it simply disappeared. I was stunned and looked at the car to my right in the lane next to me. A woman was looking at the very spot where the fireball had disappeared. For a brief second we just stared at each other. I shook my head and she made a gesture to indicate she saw it also. Though I didn&apos;t need confirmation as to what I had just seen, I was glad to be able to tell others that there was another witness. (I have seen one other object that was unusual but that was in June of 1971 in Estees Park in the Colorado Rocky Moutains. That ball of light moved at rapid speed, changing angles quickly, once shooting straight up into the air. I will reserve my following comments only to the object I saw most recently.)", "My son and I saw a bright, white colored object in the sky right near the moon, but lower about a half hour ago.My son came inside and said there was something by the moon. I went outside and what I saw was a white colored object moving west slowly. It seemed to be fairly high up-I don&apos;t know how high, but lower than what a commercial airliner flies at. This object was getting brighter and dimmer while moving west. There was no sound associated with it. It was going slow-not even as fast as a slow plane. There was a smoky looking circle of haze around this object, but as we have had forest fires around here maybe it was just leftover pollution, although the rest of the sky is clear today.The object moved west for about three to four minutes, then appeared to gain altitude and began going south. I watched it until it was very hard to see, then came inside. I thought, initially that maybe it was a helium balloon, but I have seen those in the sky before and this did not seem to be one. I have never seen helium balloons reflect sunlight like this object did. It definitely was NOT any aircraft that I have ever seen, and it was moving too slow to be a weather satellite. Last week, at about eleven thirty pm, my fiance and I saw a strange object in this area, and about fifteen minutes after we saw it there was a very fast moving jet that flew overhead(airforce?).

Observed changes in heading altitude and speed both normal and dramatic. no visible means of propulsion.AT ABOUT 1400 HOURS, APPROXIMATELY ON THE DATE MENTIONED, TWO POLICE OFFICERS AND A CIVILIAN PILOT WERE IN A 182 CESSNA AIRCRAFT ABOUT 10 MILES SOUTH OF A MAJOR NORTHWEST AIRPORT, OPERATING IN THE ARSA UNDER APPROACH CONTROL. THE AIRCRAFT WAS IN A RACE TRACK HOLDING PATTERN ORIENTED NORTH AND SOUTH ABOUT ONE MILE BY TWO MILES, AT ABOUT THREE THOUSAND FEET MSL OVER A FREEWAY. THE WEATHER WAS CLEAR WITH BRIGHT OVERHEAD SUN, AND NO WIND, SMOKE IN THE AREA WAS RISING ALMOST VERTICALLY. VISIBILITY AND CIELING WERE UNLIMITED. THE TEMPERATURE WAS MILD TO WARM. OTHER AIRCRAFT WERE IN THE AREA BUT NONE WERE IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY. AS THE TWO PILOTS WERE INVOLVED WITH FLYING THE AIRCRAFT, THE OBSERVER IN THE BACK SEAT WAS SPOTTING VEHICLES ON THE GROUND PRACTICING TECHNIQUES TO ACQUIRE AND MAINTAIN VISUAL CONTACT WITH TARGETS ON THE GROUND. ON THE SOUTH BOUND LEG, ON THE EASTERN MOST TRACK, THE OBSERVER SAW A ROUND BALL LIKE OBJECT ABOUT TWO TO THREE FEET IN DIAMETER WITH A SEAMLESS, MIRROR LIKE SURFACE TUCKED INTO THE FOUR O&apos;CLOCK POSITION, RELATIVE TO , AND KEEPING PACE WITH, THE AIRCRAFT, ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FEET OUT AND ABOUT THREE TO FIVE HUNDRED FEET BELOW. THERE WAS NO VISIBLE MEANS OF PROPULSION, AND NO LIGHT SOURCES. THE ONLY REASON IT WAS VISIBLE WAS THE CONTRAST OF THE SHINY OBJECT TO THE DARK GROUND. THE OBJECT WAS SEEN TO FOLLOW THE AIRCRAFT THROUGH A NINETY DEGREE TURN TO THE WEST, THEN A NINETY DEGREE TURN TO THE NORTH. IT CONTINUED IN IT&apos;S RELATIVE POSITION, FLYING FORMATION WITH THE AIRCRAFT, ON AROUND TO THE SOUTHBOUND LEG. THIS PERIOD OF OBSERVATION WAS MADE BY THE OBSERVER ALONE WHO DID NOT NOTIFY THE PILOTS, NOT WANTING TO BE RIDICULED. TOWARDS THE END OF THE SOUTHBOUND LEG THE RIGHT SEAT PILOT OBSERVED THE OBJECT IDEPENDENTLY AND WITHOUT BEING ADVISED BY THE OBSERVER. UPON BEING ASKED THE OBSERVER THEN ADVISED THAT HE TOO SAW THE OBJECT. THE LEFT SEAT PILOT COULD NOT SEE THE OBJECT AS IT WAS TUCKED IN TOO CLOSE TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT. AS THE SCHEDULED TURN TO THE WEST WAS MADE THE LEFT SEAT PILOT MADE AN UNUSUALLY STEEP BANK AND IT WAS AT THAT TIME HE TOO SAW THE OBJECT. THE OBSERVER ASKED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE OBJECT WAS A MYLAR TYPE SILVER BALLON. IT WAS POINTED OUT THAT IT WAS A VIRTUALLY WINDLESS DAY AND FURTHER THAT THE INDICATED AIRSPEED WAS ABOUT 75 KNOTS AND THE OBJECT WAS MAINTAINING IT&apos;S POSITION AND TURNING WITH THE AIRCRAFT. APPROACH CONTROL WAS QUIRIED AS TO THE PRESENCE OF ANY POSSIBLE RADAR CONTACTS IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY. THE REPLY WAS NEGATIVE. ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO DIRECT QUESTION AS TO WHAT WAS BEING OBSERVED THE CONTROLLER ASKED THE APROXIMATE RANGE FROM OUR AIRCRAFT TO THE CONTACT AND WAS ADVISED WITHIN ONE QUARTER MILE. THERE WAS A STANDY ORDER THEN AN ADVISORY THAT THERE WERE NO CONTACTS IN THE AREA, AND THEN , &quot;DID WE WISH TO MAKE A REPORT&quot;. THE LEFT SEAT PILOT DID NOT THINK ANYONE WOULD BELIEVE THE INCIDENT, AND THAT IT WOULD NOT BE WORTH THE TROUBLE. THE RIGHT SEAT PILOT WAS A LOW TIME PILOT AND WAS CONCERNED ABOUT POSSIBLE SANCTIONS AGAINST HIS LICENSE TO FLY. THE OBSERVER WENT ALONG WITH BOTH PILOTS WHO DECISION WAS MADE NOT TO REPORT. THE OBSERVATION CONTINUED AND AN INQUIRY WAS MADE TO THE GROUND UNITS BY THE OBSERVER IF THEY COULD SEE ANYTHING IN THE PROXIMITY OF THE AIRCRAFT. THE REPLY WAS NEGATIVE, AND WHEN ASKED BY GROUND UNITS IF WE WERE WATCHING A UFO THE REPLY WAS, &quot;AS A MATTER OF FACT YES WE ARE&quot;. THERE WAS NO CONFIRMATION FROM THE GROUND. THEN AS THE AIRCRAFT TURNED ONTO THE NORTHBOUND LEG THE OBJECT SUDDENLY, AND VERY SMOOTHLY ACCELERATED OUT IN FRONT OF THE AIRCAFT AT ABOUT THE SAME ALTITUDE. IT COVERED THE DISTANCE OF ABOUT TWO MILES IN ABOUT TWO TO THREE SECONDS ACCELERATING FROM ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE KNOTS. THE OBJECT THE EXECUTED A NINETY DEGREE RIGHT TURN TO THE EAST, AFTER A RADICAL DECELERATION AS THE TURN WAS MADE. THIS MANEUVER CAN BE BEST DESCRIBED AS THE OBJECT DISPLAYING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A 50 CAL. TRACER ROUND FIRED FROM THE AIRCRAFT. AS THE TURN TO THE EAST WAS COMPLETED THERE WAS AGAIN A DISPLAY OF ACCELERATION THAT WAS ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE. AGAIN THE ANALOGY OF A 50 CAL. TRACER ROUND IS CONSISTANT WITH THE FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS OF THE OBJECT. THE ACCELERATION, A BALLISTIC CURVE, AND THE SPEED WERE ALL ABOUT WHAT ONE COULD EXPECT WHEN OBSERVING A PROJECTILE BEING FIRED FROM THAT TYPE OF WEAPON. THE OBJECT WAS SEEN TO ENTER THE TREES ON THE NORTHWEST SHOULDER OF A MOUNTAIN TO THE EAST, APPEARING TO HAVE CRASHED. THAT OBSERVATION WAS MADE BY ONE OF THE PILOTS. THE OBSERVER WAS INSTRUCTED TO FIX THE EXACT LOCATION OF POSSIBLE IMPACT WHILE THE PILOTS FLEW A NORTH, NORTHWESTERLY COURSE FROM THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF THE PATTERN INTENDING TO OVERFLY AND POSITIVELY FIX THE LOCATION FOR GROUND INVESTIGATION. AS THE AIRCRAFT APPROACHED TO WITHIN ABOUT A MILE TO A MILE AND HALF OF THE POSSIBLE POINT OF IMPACT, THE OBJECT FLEW UPWARDS OUT OF THE TREES AT ABOUT A TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY DEGREE ANGLE TO AN APPROXIMATE ALTITUDE OF FIVE THOUSAND MSL. THE ACCELLERATION AGAIN WAS EXTREMELY FAST AND SMOOTH, BUT AS THE OBJECT LEVELED OUT ON A SOUTHERLY COURSE IT, AS RAPIDLY, DECELERATED TO A MORE LIESURELY PACE, ABOUT ONE OR TWO HUNDRED KNOTS. THE OBJECT CONTINUED ON THIS COURSE FOR ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS TO A MINUTE WHEN IT EXECUTED A LEFT TURN, ABOUT FORTY FIVR DEGREES TO THE SOUTH SOUTHEAST AND ACCELERATED AWAY AT AN ASTONISHING RATE DISSAPPEARING FROM SIGHT IN A VERY SHORT TIME. A SIMILAR OBJECT WAS SEEN AT A LATER TIME IN AN AREA TO THE SOUTHWEST OF THE ORIGINAL INCIDENT DISPLAYING SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS, SUCH AS ALTITUDE, SPEED, AND LAST KNOW DIRECTION OF TRAVEL, TO THE SOUTH SOUTHEAST AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. THIS INFORMATION CAME ABOUT AS A TELEVISION SHOW OF VIDEO RECORDED SIGHTINGS WAS ON. THE WIFE POINTED OUT ONE OF THE OBJECTS, A SILVER BALL, AND MENTIONED HER OBSERVATIONS.

It looked like it was maybe 10 miles away, and from where I was, looked about the size of a small car (think yugo). It took me about a second to register what I was seeing. I watched it for about 5 seconds. It went from a green ball of fire to your run of the mill orange, and then started to dim a bit. Then it was out of sight. It was falling at a slight arch. I&apos;ve seen meteors falling before, and this was nothing like it. Also, there was a cop that had a car pulled over on the main road about 30 seconds before the fireball. After the event, I looked over toward the main road, saw his lights were no longer flashing, and then he was on the sideroad moving at a rather high rate of speed, Heading in the direction of where the ball &quot;fell&quot;. Im almost certain he saw it as well.Thats pretty much all the detail I have. Im 17 and a college student.", "Two brighter than star objects first observed at zenith; appeared that one was &quot;chasing&quot; or following the second which was, at times,zig-zagging until they went in slightly different directions and disappeared over my field of view.Location of objects: almost due southeast and high in the sky Direction travelled:  from southeast to northwest Description of objects:  two objects that looked like very bright stars at first glance.  I knew they were not stars when I saw they were moving.  They were brighter than any of the stars but did not appear larger than any of the stars. Appearance of sky:  a perfectly clear night Movement of objects:  I watched the two &quot;lights&quot; move across the sky. It looked to me as if one was chasing the other.  The leading &quot;light&quot; would manuever and the following &quot;light&quot; would make the same manuever.  Similar to playing &quot;follow the leader&quot;.  I observed them in a zig-zag pattern.  When they were almost out of my view, the two &quot;lights&quot; parted and took slightly different directions. Time sequence:  the whole observation lasted about ten seconds Distance:  they appeared at my zenith and disappeared from my vision over houses making and arc of about 45 degrees in ten seconds. I am calculating this arc by holding my arm straight up, rotating my arm, and stopping where I lost view. Unfortunately there was no clear view of any objects, just two bright lights.  I did not hear any noises nor did I see any colors, beams, etc.  Please contact me if you think it is necessary.  Thanks!", "A Trinangular shape with a slightly concave back edge flew acroos the sky. It was glowing gold.I was lying on my back looking at the stars peacefully. I do this often as I am interested in cosmology, astrology, ufology etc... I then saw a triangle come into my vision in the east centre of the sky. It was glowing gold all over. The object, while essentially triangular had a back edge that came into the craft, Concave, with the back edge actually being two sides that came into a point about one sixth of the way from the furthest back edge to the front point. The object then flew silenty and very fast right across the sky in a straight line as if it were travelling past earth and this seemed more likely as when the object went west it stopped moving across the sky but rather started to just get more distant. The light got fainter and then it disappeared into space.", "A strange light was seen heading east.  I followed it.  I thought that I had lost it.  I looked over to the left side of the road, and hoovering back over the filed was this weird yelowsih flashing object. It was 3 lights. I pulled off onto the left side of the road, and it headed west. I follwed it until I reached a stop sign.  It was overhead of me, floating above a MAIN Highway. It turned around and headed the other direction.I went to the store and on my way back I noticed an unusual bright object heading east on the left side of the road.  Behind it was a smaller light, following it. I noticed it because it was flying so low over top some trees and then like that it accelerated its speed.  I followed it on the main road, route 33 east.  I lost sight of it for a second, but on insticnt I turned down Angling road heading north east.  I got to a clearing on a top of a hill.  I looked over to the left side where I thought I could see the object moving, and instead I saw 3 bright yellwosih lights blinking in a very unusal non- pattern formation hoovering over a field.  I cant say how far away it was, but pretty far back.  I turned onto the left side of the road and watched it.  The it started moving west, slowly at first, then faster. I went back onto Rt 33 and follwed it.  I thought I could maybe beat it to the next road on the left, where it appeared it would fly over.  Instead, the object made a 90 degree turn, crossed over Rt 33 and headed south.Luckily it turned where I could take a road to follow it, Colby road.As I follwed it, it appeeared to be further and further.  I kept following it anyways.  Finally I saw it move to the south east.  I turned down Sharrick road and followed it some more.  When I reached the next road, the object was on the left side of me, approaching an intersection.  When I got to the intersection of Rt 20, the object turned around right over the intersection! It was triangular.  A light was at each vertex.  Each time the craft changed directions, a red and green light went on.  Of course I did an illegle u-turn and speed to keep up with the object, now heading north west.  Finally I lost it and I gave up.  I know I have seen tis particular object before.  When it was over the field, there were two lights on top, and one in between the two on the bottom.  It made no noise and for some reason, it didn&apos;t really try to get away from me.  It could&apos;ve becasue I was going about 110 miles per hour trying t! o follow it.  It knew I was folowing it. And for some other strange reason, it followed the roads, why didn&apos;t it go where I couldn&apos;t follow?  The are I saw it in was a pretty populated area.", "I saw a green irredesent ball in the skyit was approx. 2:00 am and I was going to work..I was at the intersection of Youngs Rd. and Hwy #1 . When you stop at the intersection you have a good view of the sky above a gas station and some trees.Something caught my eye above the station at 45 degrees . It was a green irradesent ball about the size of a street light,it came straight down, I was facing west at the intersection.It lasted 2-3 sec. and then it just went out. The way it went out was the strange thing , it seemed like it was sucked back is the best way I can discribe it , not like a light being shut off. I told my wife about it and a friend in work a few weeks later he related a similar experience. Then I heard about it on Art Bell and other peoples experiences and learned about this web site", "Long streike across the sky at high rate of speed over Lake Houston.", "While gazing up at the stars, I witnessed a large formation of lights heading southbound accross the sky.I was laying on my hammock in the backyard, admiring the stars, when  I  noticed what looked like a formation of birds (but birds dont have headlights, nor fly at night)..either it was one object with about 100 lights or 100 objects flyng close together.in the shape of a right handed bracket }  .....To put perspective on the size, each light was as big as the size of what a plane looks like flying above...but there were so many flying all at the same speed in formation, or......it could have bee one huge craft with many lights in front...I am a 44 year old SOBER professional  woman, who would never call in something like this unless I was absolutely sure I saw what I saw.....There could very well be a logical  expanation..If so, I  would love to hear it.

I didn&apos;t have headlamps turned on.On Sept.28,1998 at approx. 7:25 pm I was driving eastward on 2nd Ave. in Vancouver approaching Main Street. From the corner of my eye to the left of the steering wheel I spotted a flash of light. As I focussed I saw a orange fireball descending into the atmosphere or speeding east in the early evening sky. The object was quite large, slightly smaller then the full moon from the city vantage. The centre of the object was orange and it was glowing white/orange. The fireball disappeared at the height of the buildings or treeline. At this time it was early dusk and quite light in the sky. I could only see one bright star visable and was light enough I did not have my headlamps turned on. There was plenty of traffic. This is downtown Vancouver. I had one passenger with me. I asked him if he saw it! He described the same thing I witnessed.

Visible beyond normal sattelite viewing at sunset, Only explanation I have is the space shuttle, is it up now?Coming from the north I can make out a high traveling object usually there sattelites, But this object quite a few stops on its north to south trail, there was no atmospheric turbulance or cloud coverage, when the object reached just about to the zenith, it made a dramatic turn toward the east, I was able to watch the object travel east, then again turn to the south, the sun was down enough that it should not have been a reflection, regardless I have witnessed many Sattelites, and a few unexplaind ones and this is one of them. the object seemed to twinkle a bluish to orange color.", "Father and I saw lg round object, looked like a setting sun in the East over a mountain.

", "small red fireball with long white tail, moving West at a very high speed parallel to the groundWalking my dogs as I do every night, I saw this fireball coming from the East directly overhead.  It seemed to me at the time to look something like a missle, because of its long tail and immense speed.  Also, it did not seem to be as high an altitude as I have seen meteors in the past.  Listening to the Art Bell discussion about this subject, I decided to response.", "Heard on AM 630 WPRO art bell,ufos were spotted.Went out w/ portable radio saw a big bright light an what appeared to be a comet.I first looked out my window after hearing on art bell lights were spotted,went to the side of my house to look at it,saw a bright light that turned out to be a star. I then went to my backyard becuase there are less trees,and looked up and saw nothing.I then went back to the front of my house,(same route),and once i arrived at my driveway,near my deck,almost ready to enter my door,i saw a very bright white light. (I did not see it when i was leaving my house,becuase it was in back of me.)I then went inside to get my binoculars and zoomed in the light was steady and did not blink,the shape did not change.  I then looked above my roof to see if there were any other objects near it,and i saw what at first i thought was a comet.(Some haze)I zoomed in and i saw 5 white circles,with steady non blinking light,the objects did not move,all the circles were the same size.(The circles were much smaller and farther away than the other object to the right.) The circles were arranged one behind another equally spaced in a arrangement that looks like a hook. I was pretty convinced this was a comet,as soon as I looked at it becuase one circle in the middle had a little haze around it.But that would not explain how the much bigger circle and much closer circle did not have haze around it also.  It was very cold out and i went inside for about 15-20 min then went back out to see if the objects moved,and they did not.I then zoomed in on both objects again and there shape did not change and they did not move.I went back inside after 5 min,then i went back outside after my dog started barking (he does this alot i doubt it had anything to do with the light).But I did find it strange and i was a bit scared becuase he stayed outside for about a hour,and i thought the weather got to him,or he got to a fight with another animal. I yelled out his name a couple times 4 or 5 and he came in. I then went back outside with my binoculars for a final look and the objects did not change. I went back inside.  I assume the objects may have stayed out there all night until the early morning,but i was to cold and not very impressed by it,(i thought it was a comet),but know think otherwise.(After hearing all the reports. The report of this object sounds very similar to mine! : http://www.ufocenter.com/S3913.html   Except that it did not move fast.

Ended up slightly 30 degrees up. The departure angle was close to 45 degrees. It departed into the west and up.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m a reliable judge of speed. This thing was smoking and accelerating! Speed 400 to 500 knots, with a behind-the-trees dash at Mach 1 (600 knots), easy.&quot; &quot;It was the brilliance that brought my eye to it. If I had done a slow blink, I would have missed it completely. This was truly an amazing sight.&quot; He described the UFO as &quot;oval, like if you put your thumb and index finger together to make the OK sign. No blinking lights.

It could be dismissed as a flare of some type, but it seemed to move much faster and was larger. It was at about a 70 degrees in the sky... nearly directly above me but still withing my field of vision through my windshield. I do not beleive it was a flare or firework because the fireball was much wider than a flare and seemd to move southward and downward...whereas flares and fireworks would not go down. I was driving through Camp Pendleton on the freeway. It is a very dark area along the freeway, which was relatively empty for Southern California.

I was laying on the grass looking up.  My 15 year old son saw everything I did.  It was tan and wing shaped and seemed to go in and out of vision when looked at directly.  Merely a curiosity at this point - it flew with some of the characteristics of a hawk, but was much too high and rigid.    I observed it for about fifteen minutes in this holding pattern before it disappeared completely.    I left the park and drove towards town.

It was about 100 yards away at this time.  I pulled off the road to get a better look because it was very unique looking.  It looked kind of like a flying wing, with no tail and no propeller, with a slightly raised fuselage in the center.  Golden tan on the bottom and off white on the top, dull with no reflection in the clear desert sun.  No markings that I could see.  I don&apos;t remember seeing any windows, but have an impression of a darker area near the front where you would expect windows.  It was somewhat larger than a piper aircraft, and had pronounced fins on the wing tips.    When I got out of my truck it was not readily in sight.  From the slowness of it I expected to see it right above me.  My son pointed it out traveling East above Twentynine Palms and climbing, already about 3 miles away.  Very fast.

I assumed one on each wing tip, one at the center where the leading edge of the wings would intersect (if they did),and a golden yellow light on the nose. The speed seemed so slow that I wondered how it could remain aloft. The object traveled left to right (south to north). As it came directly in front of me, it seemed to make a 90 degree bank and stop. I could only see what would be the center light and one wing tip light(now vertical). The lights also changed color from red to golden yellow. The vertical wing tip light was now strobing. It remained stationary and very stable. I could only guess as to the distance, possibly 100-150 yards. I watched the lights for roughly 30 minutes, then the objected rolled back 90 degrees to a straight and level orientation.

I noticed that the object i had seen a few days earlier was back. It was sitting adjacent to the towers again in almost the same exact location as it was previous.The Object appeared to be very large but distant.It kinda reminded me of a small sun or moon glowing a yellowish glow.

The tail was a deep blue. Within it were diamond aquamarine shapes which fluctuated in color and position. There had been clouds in the sky prior to the event. The sky was completely clear. There was a noisy fountain behind us. Throughout the entire event we heard nothing. All sound stopped. The obeject slowly flew over us about 500 feet up in relation to tree tops. Both myself and the witness felt completely at peace. We both had an out of body experience. As it flew over the object stayed a perfect circle. It did not elipse. In total the event seemed to take about five minutes. Later we discovered it had been about 20 minutes. The object came to the tree line and disapeared. It never sped up.

It was simply no longer there.We rushed inside to tell two other friends. They did not witness the light. They came outside with us and we all looked around. The four of us saw two planes flying by.

Then, in the southern hemisphere, near the satellite path, we saw a very fast moving light, moving about 30 times faster than the satellite, although we could not judge the actual distance of the light from us.  The light was far away.  It would zig, and zag, then stop and hover, then zig and zag again at diagonal, horizontal and vertical angles at extremely fast speeds. It almost appeared to &quot;jump&quot; from place to place, it was so fast. Our elevation was over 4,000 feet and there were no lights nearby.  If it had not been such a clear and dark night, I doubt that we would have seen it.  We saw the light for about an hour until we left and went to sleep. Neither of us had ever seen a UFO before.

What distinguishes it from a star is that it bobs and moves periodically; it exhibits an purposely changeing radiance (decidedly more ray-like than eminance) and there is a blinking white light apart from the main star body. Positioned at about 11 o&apos;clock is a single blue green ray; fixed in position and length. The rest of the rays once again, seem to shift and change. To the casual observer it would appear as a bright star. The other 4 objects are also star like though not as bright (possibly due to being further away) and display an artificial  &quot;wagon wheel&quot;- like radiance. This experience is available to anyone in the bay area all night, every night. They are clearly wanting to appear as fixed stars even while waivering some. The one bluegreen ray and the periodiodically blinking light just off to the upper right and the waivering just won&apos;t allow for real star status. I am quite frankly surprised that there haven&apos;t been a rash of reports on this. It is once again quite astounding in that the entire Bay area has regular nightly access to a genuine sighting every night. One need only venture out and take a close look at the brightest &quot;star&quot; in the lower western sky to find that it is in fact an altogether wondrous non-star.", "Was parked on the side of a highway surounding farm fields.  Looked up in the distance and noticed a large light.  It was at a standstill for a minute or so.  Then it start to move quickly back and forth and then suddenly disappered.Was parked on the side of highway 99 in Brantford, ON Canada.  It was about 23:00 hours on 09/22/98.  It was dark and there was little traffic.  In the distance I and the person I was with noticed this odd light.  It was too big to be a star and definitely not a plane.  It was at a standstill and suddenly began to move back and forth very quickly, then suddenly disappeared. ", "Possible shperical object in northern sky.  Colors were green over yellow over red.  Disappeard, then reappeared west of original location.  Flashing at some points.First sighting was at 20:30 central time.  Object was located in north eastern sky line.  Description of object:  Possible shpere shaped; top section first appeared green, center is yellow, lower section glowed red.  After watching the object with binoculars, it had &quot;drifted&quot; to the east.  Then it seemed to have disappeared.  Reappeared (possibly even another craft, unlikely) west of the original position.  Approximately 30 minutes later the object rotated clockwise.  The red glowing section pointed northwest, while the green section seemed to have vanished.  The majority of the object seemed to be yellow at this point.  The yellow pointed south east towards the ground.  Eventually it rotated back.  It then seemd to have &quot;drifted&quot; back to its original sighting position.  Rotated a 90 degree angle clockwise, then went straight up higher into the atmosphere.  It went back to the original colors green on yellow on red (rotated back).  Watching it longer, I noticed something was &quot;dropped&quot; suddenly from it.  I saw it fall for not even a second and then it disappeared.  The object has sat in that one position for several hours now.  It is currently 03:31 on 10/12/98.", "SAW light outside window went to look saw saucer shape blinding light next memory on bed five feet away from window pain in side scar there now wrote down detailes had strange object in leg for 5 yearsAT a sleep over me and a friend of mine saw a light coming in from my window at 22:00.

I then checked the time it was 3:55  almost 5 hours since sighting.  OBJECT was no where to be found.  SINCE then have had a strange fear of small ponds at one time so bad would not go near one.  Have strange dreams of EYES FOLLOWING me.  THIs has frightened me and I have been too scared to tell any one about this before. I don&apos;t want to be laughed at. AND I may have just been dreaming.

Cant rember month but there was no leaves on trees.  I saw a &quot;kite shaped object&quot; about the size of a two story house descending at a 60 degree angle. It was moving slowly and silently. It disappered behind the trees in the distance and I just kept driving but I remember thinking it was a really odd looking thing. descending at about a 60 degree angleI say it was diamond shape but it was not equal on all sides. It was a grey-black color with no lights. ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1985 is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date in October so that the report sorts to 1985.  PD))", "Was at a hotel on the southern coast of Ireland, just enjoying the night air, when a light appeared about 30 degrees off the horizon, it shifted quickly to the left then got closer, I&apos;d say about a mile or so then banked right and headed into the ocean.  My friend thought that it might have droped behind the horizon but we both agreed that the horizon (Curve of the earth), was well above the point of entry.Much like above, except the thing seemed to have a &quot;V&quot; like shape almost like a delta wing, but white green.  It was to dark at the point of impact to see if there was much spray coming off the ocean, but it must have done something.  There was a strong wind that followed shortly afterward and we both felt it.  Then nothing, now we are used to ocean breezes but this was much more and only lasted a second or two. I have never seened anything like this before.", "Craft looked like a triangle in cind of a pivet so that what I think was the back.

Object appeared and disappeared in approximate 10 second time frame, moving swiftly.  Object left slight trail.", "I witnessed a reddish ball hover for about 10 minutes after witnessing it streak across the sky like a shooting star.  Then it appeared to have dropped a red light to the ground.  Then it simply was gone.I was frequenting one of my favorite hilltop locations as I very often did on evinings such as this one.  I must admit the thought of UFO&apos;s never really crossed my mind.  As a matter of fact I generally considered people who claimed to have seen a UFO to be some sort of weirdo starved for attention.  However on this night it became quite clear to me that I too was now one of those &quot;weirdo&apos;s&quot;.  As I gazed across the beautiful night sky I saw what appeared to be a shooting star only it stopped &quot;on a dime&quot; at what appeared to be about three feet above the mountain top from the distance I was observing.  In all actually the object which seemed to have grown from a white streak into a stationary reddish ball was probably about a half mile above the ground.  I immediately excused the strange object as my own confusion between a shooting star that apparantly had brought my attention to  a large planet mars perhaps.  However the thought that I was witnessing something very strange quickly crept into my mind.  There was no sound and absolutely no movement from the object for about 10 minutes.  Then the reddish quarter of an inch ball seemed to blink releasing a sort of red light down to the ground.  The light fell very slowly then dissappeared behind the horizon.  I again focused on the red object only to see it dissappear as if the  light was turned off leaving nothing behind.  It did not exit in the same manner as it entered and the bright moon provided ample light to see an unlight object from where I was.  I truly hope someone believes what I am saying or even has experienced something similar because I am quite disturbed by what I have witnessed.  I dont believe any of the logical explanations I myself have come up with up to this point.  I truly hope some of you can.  The speed at which it entered, the precision of its stopping, the duration of motionless hovering, the lack of any audible sound, the lack of any recognizable aircraft-llike features( blinking lights, movement, etc. ), the strange light lowere! d from it, the strange reddish glow that seemed to make up the object and the immediate absence of its presence are all a mystery to me.  I like to believe that I am rather intelligent but this is far beyond anything I can comprehind.  Thank you for allowing me to share my experience with you.  I am too afraid of computers to give you any personal information so please understand.", "I noticed an object approx. the size of the full moon moving slowly towards the West. All of the sudden it made a sharp turn towards the South-S.E. and then shot straight up and disappeared from sight. I noticed, as this object turned towards the South-S.E., I could hear the loud thunder of jets comming.At approximatly 12:45 A.M. July 10, I was upstairs opening the skylight, facing an Eastern direction, and I noticed a luminated object almost the size of the full moon moving slowly toward the West. I immediatly ran downstairs and out the back door to the patio. There, I saw the object directly above me still moving in a Westerly direction. All of the sudden it made a sharp turn towards the South-S.E. and then shot straight up and disappeared from sight. I noticed, as this object turned towards the South-S.E., I could hear the loud thunder of jets comming. This object was rounded on one part, from where I was I suppose you could say the back end, and taperd to a blunt almost squared off part in the front. As far as I could tell, it was virtually silent. The illumination was somewhat the color of flourescent lighting. This is a first for me. I have never actually seen anything like this before first hand. I&apos;m located in South Prairie, which is 35 miles or so East of Tacoma close to Mt. Rainier.", "A large rectangular ship making a humming sound was sighted over my house late in 1994.Late in 1994, I stepped outside at around 9:00 at night to take my dog out in the yard. I stepped out walked around for a bit then we came back to the door, and something caught my eye. I live by a lake and over the lake I saw some lights blinking in the distance. I watched for a few moments and they started coming closer. The lights were white and orangish. Well, it disappeared for a few seconds then it came right up to my house. It was just sitting there in the sky and it was huge. It made a low humming or vibrating sound. The UFO was a rectangular shape. My dog started growling and hissing and I was getting a little freaked out. It was really magnifcient. Then it slowly started to sail away back behind the trees and soon it ascended and disappeared.", "Spherical.  Red, yellow, and green lights.  Below clouds, yet very high up.The craft appears spherical in shape seen through binoculars.  In the northern sky high, yet below the clouds.  Green on top mostly down to the middle, glowing red on the bottom, and seems a bit of yellow in the center.  Stayed in one place the whole time.  Is still there currently.  Now it is 23:57.  Lights appeared to be flashing at one point.  It is not any known air craft, helicoptor, or tower of any sort.  It is too high, remembering that it is below the clouds.  The could cover is thin yet quite high in the atmosphere.", "At approx. 10:00 Pm, we were sitting on the porch off an upstairs bedroom facing the eastern sky.  I was standing looking at the stars when I saw what I thought were twin shooting starts far in the eastern sky.  But the &quot;stars&quot; stopped their decent and then came heading toward us in a slow manner.  As they continued heading west...I was amazed.  I told my husband that he had to come and see this. They seem to float through the sky...oval in shape or like two flat bowls glued together...they were a glowing orange, almost seemed translucent.  No sound was heard and they continue into the west.  I moved to the front of the porch so I could watch them further.  They headed into the the western sky and mountains.As we were enjoying the evening at a local bed and breakfast on the corner of 1st street and 5th avenue in Tucson, I was standing watching the stars.  I observed what I though were two shooting stars in the eastern sky.  I thought that was quite strange to have two shooting stars, following the same decent.  Before they reached the horizon they came toward the west. As they came closer...I told my husband the come here...he needed to see this.  We watched as they continued on toward the west.  There were two oval (like two flat bowls glued together) and flying side by side with slight movement from side to side.  They seemd to be glowing orange from the inside. There were no lights to be seen on them. Since we observed lots of airplanes from the Tucson Airport and the Air Force base and helicopters during our stay...we can say objectively they were not commercial aircraft.  It is hard to judge the distance and heighth they were, but they didn&apos;t seem to be extremely distant.  They continued into the the western sky and into the mountains. My husband and I were visiting our daughter in Tucson and we reside in Malaysia.  We are American citizens.  My husband is ex-navy and I am an artist.  I am 49 and my husband is 52.  I have always been interested in the UFO phenomenom, but have never observed one.  And my husband is a skeptic.  His comment was &quot; I don&apos;t know what they were, but I have never seen anything like it before.&quot;  The next day I was relating the story to our daughter.  Her comment was &quot; Mom, we see them all the time in the night skies here.  We don&apos;t pay any attention anymore because it is so common!&quot; I didn&apos;t know there was a national reporting center until I did some research on the net.", "While listening to Radio Station 96.5 (Seattle Station) at 2218, many people, including a Police Officer - called to report 4 objects in the northeast sky.  The Radio Station was being flooded with calls.  They said &quot;Deltas&quot; were sent to investigate the objects and the jets were &quot;appeared to be played with, by the 4 objects.  The radio station reported that KING 5 News was sending their News Reporters to the scene.

It was oval with a lot of small lights and a red blinking light at the bottom.We tried to follow it but lost sight when we took a road turn off", "I was standing outside on Sunset Blvd. at Vine and looked straight up which I normally do not do. I saw three bright white lights in a perfect triangle moving slowly to the south east, following Sunset Blvd.  At first I thought it was a low airliner but there was no sound and no landing lights.  I called to the security guard to have another witness.  We both saw the lights, then they split up with two moving slowly to the east and the other to the west.  Then they appeared to stop and very slowly fade from sight (about 4 minutes)  I kept my eyes on them (the two that turned east) as long as I could and they just faded to nothing.The triangle of bright white lights that I saw appeared to be very low in comparison to an airliner flying over head.  The triangle appeared to be an equilateral triangle.  The brightness of each light was about that of the planet Venus. The size was of each was about 3 times the size of Venus.  When I first saw it,  the triangle appeared to be just to the right over another highrise that is across the street.  That highrise has about 20 floors and the triangle was easily as big as the top of the building from my perspective.  I was standing next to the highrise I work in and felt a tingling on my neck and a thought popped into my head to look up.  So I looked straight up the side of the building with my head all the way back and just at that moment the lights came into view.  I thought &quot;that plane looks low&quot; then I realized that a plane would have flashing lights and a more elongated triangle with the front point farther away than the back two.  But this thing had all the lights equally spaced like a formation.  I slowly moved from left to right and passed the top of the building across the street in about 20 seconds. I then called to the security guard who came out in time to see the triangle and then a few seconds later the lights on the triangle separated with two lights going left and one going right.  The lights that went left stayed the same distance apart and rotated slightly.  The security guard said &quot;Thats wierd&quot; and went back inside as I watched the lights that went left slowly fade to nothing.", "Lights in shape of &quot;radio tower&quot; flew northThree of us, former Marine NCO&apos;s, were varmint hunting in the grasslands north of Douglas, Wyoming. We had gone into town to eat and upon our return to camp we noticed a radio tower (rather the lights) east of the road, two of us were quite familiar with the area and unaware of the tower. We stopped and commented on the tower which was just over a hill from us. As we drove on a taller hill occluded the tower. When we rounded the hill we looked back to try and triangulate the position of the tower. We found the tower had moved! It was still due east of us and much too close to be parallax. It was a warm evening, the windows were open, there was no sound. I shut off the engine, the &quot;tower&quot; began to move, it moved due north at an increasing speed. One of my friends aimed his varmint rifle at the &quot;tower&quot; and watched it until it disappeared from view without any course deviation, this was perhaps a minute after it was lost to naked eye view. There was never a change in color or configuration while I watched. The lights were in the shape of a pyramidal type TV or radio tower all lights were white in color, and about as bright as the marker lights on such a tower, much brighter than any stars. My friend stated that through the 20x rifle scope he could see no features or shape only the lights. He stated there was nothing between the lights, he could see the stars through the formation. The speed of the objects could not be estimated, but appeared to move at a constant acceleration, probably at about mach 2-3 before dwindling from sight, alternatively the lights dimmed and the formation closed at a constant rate. Discerning the difference would require a range finder or triangulation neither of which was available.", "Me and my friend were playing soccer and then we saw a big diamond shape with 3 huge lights.Then the shape flashed into the sky.It had 3 big lights. It was not actully shaped like a diamond but close and it was outlinded blue.", "I walked up a hill and saw 4 lights come from the sky I ran got my camera and started to film.  The battrey ran out  then the UFO&apos;s disappeared.I walked up on the hill behind my friend&apos;s house and looked towards Mt. Diablo and saw four lights fly from the sky onto to the ground.  The lights were larger than five houses put together.  And two of them moved apart alittle.  It was an amazing sight.", "There was an extremely bright white light - in a very cloudy sky.

It was skipping about in the sky very fast, couldn&apos;t keep track of it. It had a quick pulsating action. When it reappeared in a different spot the second time, it flew behind a mass of trees. I never saw anything like it... There is also a very strange occurrence in Lunenburg, the next town over. Over Lake Whalom, every evening.,there is a huge bright white light that hovers in the same position of the sky evening. It pulses very, very brightly. After about 5 minutes it slowly moves to the left and it abruptly disappears. It will reappear shortly after and do it again - all night long. The locals have been seeing this for years, and it very dependable. It is not a plane, for it is there every evening. It stays in the same place until it shifts to the left and disappears. It is not a planet - for it is there yearround and it moves. I guess you just have to see it. I am a webmaster in West Boylston, MA.

It was during the third quarter and the Redskins were scoring a touchdown so everyone&apos;s attention was focused on the field. I noticed an object out of the corner of my eye and looked up. I saw an object briefly cross upper rim of the stadium. It was dark and diamond shaped with definite edges, but seemed flexible. I had the impression I was looking at a manta ray. On each corner of the object was a very dim light. Object made no noise at all and moved in a manner that could not have been a balloon.

It could of been falling star but I&apos;ve never seen one last as long or appear to waver a bit as it went. If you have an explanation as to what this might have been I would like to hear from you. It covered an arc from my chair to when it went out of about 125 degrees if you were to follow with your arm in about 7 seconds, not like a falling star as there usually much quicker and don&apos;t waver like this did.As above three witnesses, all wondering what we saw I didn&apos;t count my characters above so I hope you got it all.", "followed these lights down a dirt road from a distance of about a half mile. they went around a small foothill,as we came around the hill we saw the last one go into what we thought was the side of the hill. we think it did just that due to ground vibrations we felt. also a smell of something like ozone was all around us . we kept feeling thumps and hearing sounds for at least 15 min. latrobe road &amp; michigan bar road.as stated above.......", "observed firey light green ball long tail changed colorwhile driving south on route 100 I saw a light green fire ball streaking across the sky going north to south displaying avery long glimering tail that lasted 2 or 3 seconds after the object changed from green to red and then vanished only lasted 4 to 5 sec.", "from centre of Orion, a seemingly far off single point of light, brightness of a star, moved downward to horizon, side to side (about 2 finger widths) apx 30-45s total duration 2:17amI was the first out my friends house, and immediately my eyes were drawn to what i thought was a satellite right in the middle of Orion.  I turned to point it out to my friends.  Turning back we noticed that the light was moving, not like a satellite.  It at first went down and to the right from Orion, then began moving down towards the horizon, but in a side to side swaying motion.  Possibly it was moving in a helix pattern downward (or away?).  My friend was excited and ran back in the house to get two others, but by the time they came back out it was gone.  3 of us saw it, 2 missed it.  It seemed to be quite far away, and was no brighter than an average star.  Synchronistically, it did happen after i&apos;d been telling them all about ufo&apos;s and other strange phenomena.  At the time Orion was perhaps 15 degrees above the horizon.  the event lasted about 30 to 45 s.  (our first sighting :) i would like to hear other reports of the same object.  thank you", "It was a round/disk shaped object that reflected the sunlight. It was hovering at an angle. I say hovering cause it moved like that, not like it was something flying in a straight line like an airplane. It hovered for a few seconds and then disappeared. It reappeared 3 more times in completely different spots in the sky, but in the same area. I was driving at the time watching this happen.I was driving out to my brother&apos;s Hockey Game to give him an envelope he forgot at home. I was getting off of the 270east freeway exit ramp at Easton and was watching an airplane (commercial, passenger jet) The sun was setting so I watched the sunset and there were white jet trails in the sky. There is an airport East of there so the Commercial Jet, was just at an upwards climb, and low in the sky. Out by the closest white jet stream, actually below it to the right, was a round/saucer shaped object that was hovering in the sky at an angle. It reflected the sunlight underneath it and was dark on top. It hovered for a few seconds, but long enough that I got a good look at it. I kept looking and it reappeared in a different spot to the right and above where it was before in the sky. It acted the same way and disappeared again. It was definitely the same object. It reappeared a third time below the second spot and to the right sort of making a triangle of appearances. It acted the same way again and disappeared, and I had to turn the corner. It didnt act the exact same way each time, but hovered and was at a slant. I parked at the Easton Ice Rink where my brother plays hockey and went inside to give him his envelope. I went back outside and watched the sky for a few minutes. I didnt see the object again. I drove down the bottom of the hill and across to a newly built parking lot  and turned around and watched the sky for a moment. The two jet trails were still visible, well obviously because there were jets attached ot the trails. I was about to drive away, and saw the object again. There was a black helicopter flying above a neighborhood near there, and the object was farther out in the sky about the same distance it was before, and acted in the same manner and finally disappeared. It was probably not as far away as the jet trails in the sky, but it was close enough I could see it clearly. I had to get back to my store, so I after it disappeared the fourth time, I didnt see it for a few minutes, I left and drove back. This might have been one of the same objects or four different ones, but they were all the same, all four times. My opinion is it was one object. I happened to not see it outside of the car, only when I was inside the car. But, it was definitely, something in the sky and not something like a reflection in my windshield. The car was not moving when I saw it the fourth time. I am 21 years old, and I run my own business in Westerville, Ohio. Which is where I drove from this day. I have seen many documented videos on recent UFO and/or flying saucer footage, and I didnt think I would ever see something to look and act quite that close to what I have witnessed on those documents. I would have never even noticed it if I hadnt been watching the airplanes, and the sunset like I was.", "Two of my children and a friend were out on the trampoline, and saw a disc like structure flying very fast and stoped and dropped what they called &quot;gold dust&quot;, and took off.

I  felt stupid to call the police, and they wanted me to report this.", "What looked like a bright green ball entering the atmosphere.My girlfriend and I were just pulling up to our house when we both saw a large glowing green ball fly across the sky in front of us.

There was only one object that we could see.", "The sky lit light heat lightening then the a ball of light was shooting across the sky.  My thought was it looked like a Roman candle because fire sparked from it in all directions before it just disappeared. It was similar to a shooting star but much brighter and closer than any I have ever seen.", "This was like a green colored light, like a star.  It was lower than any other aircraft would be.  It was decending, in an easterly direction, then moved west.  As it moved west it turned white, then it went out, disappeared.  No tail or explosion.I was traveling south on I-5, just passing the Del Mar Race Track. My friend was in the car with me.  I saw a green light floating above the area where the race track is, near the coast.  It moved east while decending, then it moved west.  It was the green color that caught my eye, I had heard on Art Bell&apos;s show of people having sightings of green flashes.  I grew up on the coast and the only green flashes I had heard of were the ones that appeared at the time of an intense sunset, but I knew that those were optical illusions.  So I was interested in this ob- ject in the sky that was green.  It was star like in size, but too low to be celestial.  And it wasn&apos;t flashing like any aircraft would be. By the time it caught my friend&apos;s attention it had turned white.  We both watched it travel west a little further then it just went out. The sky wasn&apos;t too dark that we wouldn&apos;t have seen something even with- out a light on it.  So we both searched for something but were amazed that nothing was there. Shortly after that you were on the radio announcing all those calls you received.  I finally found some spare time to submit my report.  I didn&apos;t find any other posts of sightings at the same time or place we had seen the light, but I&apos;m hoping this will help you in your research.", "3 Lights not as egg shaped but close, thumb nail.

I was amazed.  We were freaking out.  I am 19 years old and go to the University.  Anyway it came over the top of us and we followed it allthe way across the sky.  When it was at an angle about 45deg it innerchanged.  The triangel was swithched up.  They all stopped completely and the first dropped to the rear right. and the back left went to the front after circling the other. So did the other one it went from rear right to rear left.  In perfect order and symmetry.  Then shifted to the left without going forward and then went at an angle to the right and then slowly vaded out. There was three of us.

I&apos;ve watched satellites and meteor showers. This moved MUCH faster. It was a constant white light with a brightness greater than any star or planet. It moved from the WSW horizon to the NE horizon in a straight line(arc). Like the gentleman in Longmont, I thought I was imagining it. I couldn&apos;t believe its speed, and replayed it in my mind several times to get a grasp on the speed at which it must have moved.I still think it&apos;s possible it might have been a low orit satellite since sunset was only a couple of hours before the event. I took a photograph of star trails that night in a 2 hour exposure. Unfortunately the shutter was not open during this event.", "Witnessing bright lights, mostly white with green and red, in the sky at every point on the compass, starting at 7:00PM and lasting until around 2:30-3:00AM.  Different heights and distances from my position. NOT stars, planets or aircraft.I have been witnessing a recurring sighting of something in the sky over Redding since the 21st of September.  The object(s) are still appearing as of tonight, the 12th of October.  These objects have been witnessed by three of my neighbors as well as my Grandmother, my Nephew and another friend.  The first object appears in the western sky at around 7:10 PM.  It slowly, almost imperceptibly, traverses the sky in a diagonal, downward track until it reaches the crest of a mountain called Boley Mountain which is roughly 6 miles from my location. It then disappears on the other side of the mountain.  Within three minutes, the object, or another identical object, appears in the northern sky, roughly 30 degree&apos;s above the horizon.  From this position, it tracks opposite from its path in the west until by 12:30 AM, it is very high in the northeast.  The object does not get much higher and does not move east or west.  The latest I have watched it is 2:30 AM.  At that time it had moved slightly south.  I got up at 4:30 AM about four nights ago and saw nothing but stars, the moon and planets.  I noticed on the 28th that another, seemingly identical object would appear in the eastern sky at the same time this object moved.  The eastern object must be either over or just east of Redding Municipal Airport.  On October 4th I started finding more of these objects in different positions around my location or encircling Redding.  On the 5th, I counted 16 that I could see.  These objects can only be identified as bright white, green and/or blue and red lights with the red light appearing to pulse or rotate around something.  Very reminisent of the old police &quot;bubble gum&quot; lights or maybe lights reflecting off of one of those aluminum christmas trees.  None of the witnesses, including myself, have been able to see a discernable shape.  I am using a fairly new pair of 20X50 Tasco binoculars to view this.  Not the best but I all I have available.  My neighbor, who was actually the first to see this, has tried to view the object through his 35mm camera using a 300mm telephoto lens.  Still could not make out what it is.  He took some time-lapse photographs of the first object but is not confident of the outcome since all he had was 200 speed film.  I have snapped several photos using a Kodak Max one-time use camera.  I know these will either be blank pictures or of poor quality but they are at least pictures.  Since I am now dealing with so many of these things it is difficult for me to list every objects position and behaviour.  Some of the new ones to the southwest actually appeared very close to the ground. However, being night time and not knowing the distance of my binoculars yet, they could have been thousands of feet in the air.  I think they were close to the ground because of my location and knowing the area they appeared to be over.  I have sensitivity to bright car lights so could not investigate even though I wanted to. I am a white male, 47 years old and have spent the last 17 years working with computers, 14 of those with Tandy Corporation in Texas. I am currently a private consultant.  I do take medications but none would cause this level of hallucination.", "Object was a saucer shaped cloud glowing white heading north to south about 700 feet up.This object crossed the highway moving faster than a normal cloud and was the shape of a saucer. This object followed a straight line.  I had the cruse control on at 70mph and the cloud was infront of us but by the time we got to the spot where the object crossed the object was not  disapearing over the trees.  I kept on driving and about 10 seconds later we came to a clearing where we should have been able to see the cloud on our right but it was gone.", "multi-colored circle of lights moving slowly in northerly direction above mountains.This one necklace shaped object moved from left to right, or to the north.  Distance:  about 15 miles.  Length:  800-1500 yards.  The same blue light could be seen around the object and through the circle of lights, the blue light of the sunset.  All lights in the circle moved in unison and the circle of lights was not rotating.  I looked at the object through my 10x50 hunting binoculars.  The event occured at the end of an afternoon of elk hunting.  The object was visible clearly for about 40-60 seconds.  The object disappeared as if the lights were shut off, with no resulting afterimage, only the blue light of the sunset remaining.  There was no sound, no exhaust, no blinking lights.  Within five minutes after the sighting, six to seven military jets shot across the valley in the direction of the object sighted a few minutes before.", "While driving northwest on Totem Beach Road, north of 64th NW, my housemate saw an electric blue triangular shapes fireball light with pink on the right side descending in a northwest to southeast direction at about a 60 degree angle of descent, seen over the tree tops as she looked to the northeast.It appeared so close that she stopped the car to see if there was going to be a fire.", "Three objects..bright white lights on front, alt. red/white on rear..no sounds..travelling from west to east in tri-angular or v formationWhen first observed objects, thought were hot-air balloons...when closer clearly saw they weren&apos;t...watched objects for 45 minutes...no sounds heard at all...nearly passed directly over me...hard to tell how fast or how high because had no size reference...but believed objects to be about 100 ft or less and speed of 50 to 100 knots or so...after losing objects to the east, called office on radio and asked dispactcher to &quot;step out of the office, turn to the north and look up...which he did...and saw objects fly over head...talked to Mich State Police Trooper...he told me several troopers chased objects but was too far away to get back to observe them himself...

We were in his VW Wagon driving home from work at RAF Bentwaters (we lived at RAF Weathersfield base housing) anyway we saw this very bright light near what we throught was RAF Mildenhall (Military Air Command Transport Base) in the U.K. We could see the lights from the base near a hill we had to drive over before entering close to our neareat village (Weathersfield). We both noticed how bright it was, we had never seen anything like this! Next think we knew the light was right over Mikes vehicle, we stopped and tried to look up at it but it was far to bright to get any lind of identification. There was &quot;no sound&quot; coming from it at all! We watched it for a few moments when we all of a suden heard jet engine noise&apos;s (we were both aircraft maintenance) so we knew the sounds but it wasn&apos;t coming from the light, it came from to British fighters shooting out &quot;photo flash cartridges&quot; to light up the sky for taking photo&apos;s. These were &quot;Recon&quot; birds but this light shoot across the sky like somethinmg out of &quot;Star Wars&quot; with the same type of light as the &quot;light saber&quot; would make! In a flash it was headed towards London (you could see the lights of London from this hill). The aircraft tried to &quot;chase it&quot;, they kicked into &quot;burner&quot; (full throttle - afterburner)but couldn&apos;t even catch up. While we watched this chase, the aircraft seemed almost half way to the city (London) when the light streaked back over us (it was like in the wink of an eye). It hit us with the light and then shot straight up and vanished! The fighters flew back towards our area and kept going! I raced back and woke my wife out of her sleep, also the security policeman at the gate (gate-guard) saw the light and asked if &quot;we&quot; saw what was going on! I turned on the radio ( 0200 ) and the radio said that London was buzing with reports of &quot;UFO Sightings&quot;. I called the OSI (Office of Special Investications) next day and filled out a rep! ort and that was the end of it. ((Name deleted.)) didn&apos;t want to talk about it to anyone!

My husband and I were driving down Florin Rd parallel Florin mall.  Are car was the first to stop at a red light.  As we waited for the light to change my husband told me to look out the drivers side window.  Both of us saw what appeared to be a World war 2 military cargo plane.  It was huvering  about 15 feet above the top of our car and slightly to the left.  The plane was a metallic army green color with no jets or propellers on the large wings.  As I started to panic, thinking that it was an air craft about to crash, my husband rolled down his window and told me to listen.  The craft made absolutly no sound.  I looked up at the cockpit window to see if there was a pilot, but the sun was reflecting of the window, and I couldn&apos;t see anyone.  The light turned green and we drove a block and a half to a Dennys restaurant, where my husband parked the car.  I got out and ran into the restaurant grabbing the first person in sight.  An elderly man exiting Dennys.  I asked if he could come with me out side.  I pointed the plane out to him, which had moved about a block away from where I first saw it, towards JC Pennys, at the Florin mall.  By this time it was about 30 feet higher than when I first saw it. It huverd there for a short time befor it slowly decended behind Pennys.  The man saw the plane making its decent.  I said to him &quot;What is that?&quot; as I pointed to the craft.  He stared at it for a few seconds, and replied &quot;I do not know!&quot; He turned and quickly ran to his car. When I first saw the plane it was huvering in one spot it then moved to the side gradually gaining altitude, huvering there for a few seconds, then slowly decended down like a helocopter would land.

After calling my 15 yr old daughter and getting a pair of binoculars, we took turns looking at the craft in the sky as it floated or slowly moved along the tree tops.  Then, before it came to a larger group of trees it seemed to turn south, still at the tree tops, and away from our view.

It was decending at approximately 45 degrees angle east to west, it was huge and around the circumference was seeming low flames with a fiery trail.  It reminded me of the huge special effects of the meteor that carried the space craft in the original &quot;War  of the Worlds&quot; movie.  It was eerie looking,  I was so excited I shouted for my wife to come a see.  By the time she awoke and got to the window it passed from sight.  I called the Ft. Lauderdale International Airport Control Tower and asked if they saw the object.  The person that answered said &quot;No&quot;.  I the called Channel 7 news room and a guy answered, I told him what I saw, he replied that he had not heard of anything.  I asked him if he did would he call me back and I gave him my telephone number.  I thought he was just humoring me when he said he would, but when the phone rang about 15 minutes later it was this fellow at the TV station telling me that the report was coming over the AP wire and that the object had been spotted as far north as Gainsville. He asked me to descibe what I saw again, I did, he thanked me and we hung up.  I could hardly sleep and stayed up most of the night.  The next day I was impatiently waiting for the news reports to come out about the sighting, but I personally never heard anything about it. Someone said something about a falling satelite or some other nonsense. That vision will never leave me.  This evening I discovered your Reporting center and curiosity drove me to find the report which had to be one in the sighting.  I was stunned to finally see a report by someone else that seemingly corroborates what I saw.  That report was posted 6/2/98 and the location was Hamton, Virginia Beach Amusment Park, VA.

It was in one of these areas in Tioga County, PA that I was sitting in a lawn chair next to my van watching the sky.  It was extremely dark, yet despite some encroaching haze from the west, the stars were very clear overhead and to the south and east.  I got up to put something in the van, and as I set the object inside,  a light from above and behind me illuminated the area, enough to cause my arm to cast a shadow on the floor of the van.  I turned around in time to see a very bright light, I would estimate at a magnitude of brightness ten times that of Jupiter, located high in the southeast sky.  Suddenly, the light began to fade, made no noise, and before it went completely out, a dim, pale blue light tracked northward away from the source of the brilliant light.  The blue light travelled at roughly the same speed as any high altitude airliner for about 20 seconds, until it too faded out of sight.  I perceived it to be a re-entry of some kind, and, given the troubles with Mir, feared the worst.  The initial brilliant light never moved.  I spent many years in the Air Force.

Smell of ozone shortly after.I was standing outside at approx. 7:25 pm when I saw a bright green fireball silently fall behind some trees to the NNE.  It appeared to go down somewhere between my location and the town of Curlew, WA.  I am just south and slightly east of Bodi Mt.. (17 miles south of Canadian Border) A few minutes passed and a light breeze came up from the N. and I smelled a *very* strong smell like just before a rain storm. I think this is the smell of ozone.  This may or may not be associated with the phenomena. There was only a faint wisp of cloud cover and the 1/2 moon was nearly at appex. The fireball reminded me of a flare but there was no sound or scent of explosives. By about 8pm there was considerable airtraffic in the area.  Again this may not be associated with the fireball either but just something I noted. This is the thrid fireball I&apos;ve seen since mid summer.

It was high in the sky and very dark in color and moved about the speed of an airplane or slower. At first it appeared to be an airplane, but then it emitted a bright reddish glow that lit up the entire craft. My friend had seen it &quot;flare up&quot; a moment before. The light was not like that of an airplane&apos;s because it gradually brightened and slowly faded, and lit up the entire craft and some of the sky around it. We both ruled out reflection of sunlight because the reddish glow would have been constant. My friend saw the first flash and both of us witnessed 3 more (total of 4 flashes seen). The first flash was a very bright one, seen by my friend. It was followed by 2 less intense flashes. The final one was very bright and dark reddish color. The object then disappeared behind the distant treeline. Note that the flashes were slow, gradual, and varied in intensity and length. Each flash occurred at non-consistent time and remained lit for about 1-2 (long) seconds. The lighting was totally unlike that of an airplane. The object remained in view for around 15-20 seconds. We hope these facts may help you in theorizing explanations about what the object may have been: -The sky was completely cloudless -It was just beginning to get dark(8:30) -Other airplanes were in our view so we could compare their appearance to that of the object we were watching Note that both of us have contributed to and agreed with this report.

I was standing outside in my driveway when I saw them coming from the Monterey Bay/ocean area and heading in a northwest direction.I believe it was the same craft reported on your site seen in San Jose that night.  It came from the southeast (Monterey Bay) and was heading northwest.  I also thought it was a plane going to the San Jose or SFO Airport until it flew over me. At that point I noticed it was going too slow to be an airplane, although my friend said &quot;wow a stealth bomber!&quot;. There was no sound, it was very low, very large and moved slowly over us, over my house toward the Santa Cruz Mountains. Once over the mountains it would be in the San Jose area. There were very large unblinking lights on each tip that showed the shape of the craft as it flew overhead as a triangle. I wish I spent more time observing it but since my friend said &quot;stealth bomber&quot; that&apos;s what I thought it was.  It was only later I realized a stealth bomber would probably be going much faster, be flying much higher, and make noise.  As I noticed, the lights were so bright that they clearly revealed the shape as triangular. Time on this report is approximate.", "A small bright object accross the sky and disappeared. No glamorous close up sighting, but extremely high for an airplane, much, much to fast, no flashing or red lights. Deffinately not a shooting star. We know what these look like.

Seriously can not be convinced this was an airplane.At around 22:40 (EST)  on 06/27/98 in the Eastern horizon, heading North to South I observed a circular lighted object (white) that caught my attention in the night sky that appeared to be at a height that is extremely high for an airplane, and at a speed much too fast, no red or flashing lights could be seen as you usually see with airplanes.  After it traveled what seemed a great distance in a short time it disappeared. Deffinately not a shooting star which seems to burn brighter and lasts maybe a second. Witnesses: I am 38, wife 34, son 10, and daughter 9. I am still sort of a skeptic about UFO&apos;s in the sence of from other planets, so could there be a logical explanation for what we saw. It was a clear night, is it possible to see a satalite that we have orbiting around the earth, or don&apos;t these light up like what we witnessed?

I even went to a shrink in the mid 70&apos;s just to tell this, and never went back due to being in law enforcement and my need to just tell someone and maybe get an answer.I believe it was summer 1965-1967, I don&apos;t remember having to attend school. We were leaving our house on FT Ord to drive to a store in Seaside, when we observed a large shiney metallic object hovering over MontereyBay. My brothers and I watched it out of the car window until we returned from the store and then sat in the yard watching as other neighbors watched also.  After hovering over the bay for awhile, it slowly moved over to the rifle range and I guess it hovered for approx 10 minutes, a row of colored lites appeared around the bottom of it (the sun had not quite set) and then it disappeared.  My brother had called the TV station (channel 4 or 8) but they didn&apos;t know anything. I know that with the Monterey Airport being nearby, FT Ord and the Navy Language Institute being based on the Monterey Peninsula; some of those people had to see it too.

I&apos;d get ear ringing an then paralized, but my mind was very much aware. They materialized out of thin air and then I was some place else.  I seem to have been the only one in my family who has been abducted.  One of my brothers who is now 42, had an experience as a toddler, that I&apos;ll never forget.  He was standing in his crib screaming that the big eyed dogs were afer him, my parents had to rush him to Walter Reed Army Hosp. in Wash.DC (my dad was stationed in Va.) he was hysterical and couldnt be put down on the floor.

Mosinee is approximately 10 miles south of Wausau and the regional airport resides there.  As I passed the airport and got away from the lights of Mosinee I noticed what appeared to be a set of automotive high-beams floating above the treeline about 3 miles ahead.  I assumed it was an airplane, but as I drew nearer I realized that I was the only one in motion.  When I was finally only a mile or so away I saw 2 blue lights on either side blinking in unison, and one light blue flash on top that comes only after the side lights flash.  I slowed from 65mph to approximately 30mph and noticed that it had a saucer-like base but it had 2 C shaped pieces sticking out of either side and almost meeting in the center.  It hadn&apos;t moved since I first saw it and when I was closest I measured it&apos;s altitude with my thumb, and it sat one thumbnail or about 25 feet above the treeline.  It was also right next to a road that overpasses the highway and winds into the countryside.  There are no homes or farms in the immediate vicinity of the sighting.  The second witness was not with me in the vehicle, but rather a truck driver who came up behind me.  I was in the right slow lane,(51 is a 2 lane freeway), he was in the passing lane.  He slowed his rig down to about my speed of 30 mph and I noticed that his attention was fixed on the object to the left of both him and I.

I noticed that this craft was moving at a very slow rate of speed. Upon closer observation we both noticed that is was only about 150 yards up. The craft we were looking at was a triangular shape with three seperate lights. We atributed these lights to being wing and nose lights. As it neared us we realized that we were wrong about the lights and the origin of this craft. What we were seeing was lights that were more towards the center bottom of the object.

Had direct communication with sphere.In October 1961, I awoke from a sound sleep with a feeling the something was in my room.  I was 7 years old.  My older brother (11 yrs) was already awake and he pointed towards a light behind the metal venetian blinds of our first floor bedroom window. I felt compelled to look behind the blind slats.  When I did I was face-to-face with a dull silver  metalic sphere approximately 18-24 inches in diameter.  The sphere was hovering silently and motionless right next to the window glass (single-pane glass with a metal frame).  The sphere had a recessed rectangular panel (approx 10 inches across by 3-4 inches high). There were red dots (unkonwn numer and pattern) and there was a very bright white light at the right and left sides of the panel.  (Two lights total).  The lights were the color and intensity of examiination lights in a dentist&apos;s office or in an operating room.  (At the time I had never seen either type of medical lights before).  The sphere hovered motionless and I was in direct communication with the sphere.  It was a very strange sense of consciousness that I never experienced before the event.  I was paralyzed and was in a one-way communication with the sphere.  It was telling me things in my head without audible words.  I was unable to understand specifically what was being said, but it was very important that I listen to the messages.  I believe there were at least four simulataneous &quot;voices&quot; talking at the same time in Engilish as I starred into the sphere.  It was a multi-voice message.  My brother was not involved in this contact.  The sphere slowly began to rotate silently  away from me to my right.  As it rotated, the lights went off.  The sphere&apos;s motion was very smooth and silent.  It rose more rapid;ly and disappeared into the sky.  My brother did not look out the window as far as I know.  I still look out the window evey night before I go to bed and whenever I wake up during the night to check for something.  I am now 44 years old.  Has anyone else seen a sphere such as this?", "was watching kit of pigeons fly, saw out the corner of eye, noticed it and it was gone within a couple of secondsI had put my kit of birmingham roller pigeons out at about 4:30 pm, they were getting chased around by a hawk and decided to go up fairly high, normal when predators chase them.  I wanted to watch them as they were rolling around but I couldn&apos;t see the colors very were, up about 1500 feet I&apos;d guess.  I put down the bino&apos;s as it was hard to follow them, sore neck. They turned and went northern flying in a counter clockwise turn.  I saw a shinney object out the corner of my left eye.  I turned to look and it was a semi oval object just sitting there, not moving.  It was like a dule chrome color, but kind of hazy like when you see a jet airline flying by. It might have looked hazy from the reflectivness of the object but not sure? It was only there for a little over a full second then a bright silverish vertical flash appeared(reminded me of something like on star trek, when they transport), followed by a flash similar to a &quot;mirror&quot; flash and it was just gone. I pulled up my bino&apos;s to see if I could see anything in the vicinity and there was absolutely nothing. the object like I said was kind a oval, but more like a circle with one flattened side to it, the flash appeared from this flattened side while it vanished. a guy I work with said his sister had seen a &quot;UFO&quot; the day before i did, this was after I had mentioned to him that I had seen one that he said his sister had mentioned to him a day earlier that she&apos;d seen one.  I haven&apos;t learned the details of her sighting yet. That&apos;s it.", "Bright Light in distance over mountains moves in very quickly, then moves slowly over suburban commercial district (Kmart).The object was initially a pinpoint in the distance. Within 20 seconds it moved into our area and slowed down to a low speed. It was dark and we could see only the lights but I estimate it to have been 300 feet in diameter (a perfectly round disk or squat cylinder with slightly domed top) and perhaps 50 feet tall.  It had a band of lights around the perimeter through which lights pulsated in a teardrop pattern (a band of teardrops moving head to tail around the perimeter of the object).  The faster the ship moved, the faster the light pattern went around the perimeter.  The lights were white.  The reason I surmise it had a domed top is because there was a blue light on top that moved around in a semi-spherical motion.  The object was utterly silent and incredibly swift.  If you did not look, you would not have known it was there.  There were other witnesses but no one spoke of it.  The object disappeared over a hill behind us and did not reappear.((NUFORC Note:  The following message is submitted on July 10, 2001, by the individual who submitted the report above.))I am one of the two people who have reported the disk in Hickory NC in June 1966.  The other reported sighting corroborates exactly what I saw but they reported seeing it about 2 days after I saw it, ...it has been a long time... I have also seen a report elsewhere on a very similar craft around the same time in Venice, California.  It could also be the craft of Hingham, Mass., sighting of 4/1/66.  There was also a similar craft illustrated on a UFO documentary a few years ago (it looked like the craft I saw, with the teardrop shaped lights rotating in a band around the perimeter but was much smaller than the craft I saw). My question is, how best can I research this particular craft at that time?  It was quite large, probably 300&apos; diameter and 50&apos; thick.  It had a pattern of large white teardrop shaped lights rotating in a band around the perimeter of the disk.  There was a blue light either above or below.  Other than that there were no visible features, except that it blocked out the! stars as it flew over.Thanks,((name deleted))  ph 678-((number deleted))((NUFORC Response to July 10, 2001, message))Dear Mr. ((name deleted)),Thank you very much for the message, and for the information.With regard to researching the events, there is probably no better way than going to local newspapers.  If even just a small group of people witnessed the object, newspaper reports might have been generated in the local publications.  Since UFO materials usually get front page coverage in local papers, you can usually scan just the front page of every issue, and that will tell you whether you are looking at the correct edition.If you have had sightings that you have not submitted to our Online Report Form, I would welcome such reports.  If you could take just a few minutes to generate a description of each sighting and submit it, using that form, that will preserve the sighting, and make it available to others to read.Also, if you would like to submit an illustration of the objects you have witnessed, we will scan them, and post them with your report in the future.Thank you very much for sharing the information with our Center!Cordially,Peter Davenport((END JULY 10, 2001, REPLY))((SECOND CORRESPONDENCE FROM THE ORIGINAL SOURCE OF REPORT))This is a correction for a sighting that I posted several years ago.

No jet or helecopter sound whatsoever.I was driving S. on I-90 about 30 miles SW of Spokane WA, when off in the distance I spotted a bright light.  I assumed that it was a satalite.  It got brighter and brighter, so I began to watch it closely.  We seemed to be coming up on the object, and I then thought that it was a jet plane with its light on.  It did not seem to be approaching us however, as we saw the light for at least ten minutes. As we approached the object, it was evident that it was NOT moving, but hovering directly over the freeway.  Its light was lighting up the freeway and the surrounding fields, as a plane light would, but it was not moving!  It was light like a search light it guess?  About that bright.   My assumption was that of a Harrier Jumpjet, but as we drove under the object, the was absolutely NO jet sound, and we did not notice a tail. The object was boomerag shaped, with green and red lights on the end of the &quot;wings&quot; I did not stop, as we were in a line of cars traveling together home to Portland OR, and as that my wife was petrified of the object, but everyone we were traveling with saw it, and could not explain it. I was not going to report it, as I thought that it was military considering the red and green lights on the ends, but there is no military base that I know of out there, and after hearing the womans report from Portland OR, on the Art Bell show of a triangular object in the sky with no sound, it sounded awfully familiar, and I though it was my duty to give the info I had, valid or not.", "Bright Orange Fireball appeared in SW sky.

My girlfriend and I are police officers and both work the night shift.  We both are very enthusiastic about the night sky and were about to use my telescope on this date. It was an unusual night right from the beginning.  At about 2400 hrs. we both observed a spectacular display of the Northern Lights all along the length of the Lake.  That is unusual here. It lasted approximately 20 minutes.  Shortly thereafter, we went back to the telescope and were observing Jupiter and Saturn.  At approx. 0130 hrs. we were both startled by a Large Orange Fireball that appeared in the SW sky.  It traveled very slowly in a straight path at approx. 30 degrees to the southern horizon toward the SE.  The object had a very long tail which was also Bright Orange.  We did witness any sound.  It is very quiet here also.  It was difficult to say how far away it was. Although, it didn&apos;t appear to be very far away.  we viewed it until we lost it in the horizon....it didn&apos;t appear to burn up. We both have seen many things in the night sky before from many types of meteorites to having seen sattelites return to earth.  but have not seen anything like this. I probably would not have reported this if I hadn&apos;t heard of so many similiar sights on your appearance on the Art Bell Program the other night. Another funny thing happened that morning.  I had to appear in court that morning and drove my truck.  It is newer with the digital compass in the rearview mirror.

I was facing south down the Intracoastal Waterway. Over my left shoulder I saw a double blue flash out the corner of my eye.  I thought it was lightning and turned around very quickly to my left to see. I saw a ball about the size of a soccer ball. The sphere  was glowing yellow and faded  red glow around the ball.  It had an extremely long tail about 10 times the size of the ball.  The tail faded from red to blue. I could see all the colors of the spectrum .  the red was directly behind the ball and went to orange, yellow, green then blue. the tail also tapered out to a point at the end. The ball &amp; tail was above Isle of Palms when I first saw it. It moved horizontal (parallel to Earth) for about 4 full seconds.

Soon another light appeared floating nearby the first.  We watched them for awhile until we began to lose sight of them so we ran down the road to a park to watch more.

The first jet went after the first light and as the jet got near to it, it seemed like the light paused for a moment and suddenly shot across the sky leaving the jet behind like it was standing still. The second jet followed the second light until it got too close and suddenly the second light made a DEAD stop in the air and made a complete reverse of direction passing the jet and soon after disappearing in the same fashion as the first.

I saw no &quot;shape&quot;, just these flashes, and the flame.  The night was rather clear, with no clouds.  The object appeared to be flying in a downward motion.  I recall thinking that if it continued to fly in this manner, it appeared as if it would land in Hidden Acres Campgrounds.  I observed this phenomenon 5 times before turning onto Twp. Rd. 810, and immediately onto the private drive.  I was still watching this through the trees, and saw it flash and fire 3 more times.  I parked my car, and got out to see if I could see it better.  When I did so, it was gone. If comparing these yellow lights, if a star would appear as a . (period), then these lights appeared to be o (a lower case o).  There appeared to be 4 seperate lights, but all flashed together. The &quot;fire&quot; from the end of it was even larger. I would compare the width of it from a small &quot;o&quot; to a capital &quot;O&quot;. And the length of it was 4 times more.

Before the object disapeared, it shot out a bright orange/red flame from the back of its flight line. The flame did not extend that far from the object. The object was in view for around 5 seconds, then just disapeared. My guitar player also saw this event. When I told our manager, he said it most likely was the rocket boosters from the space shuttle reentering the earths atmosphere. The only problem with this is that the shuttle lifted off 10 hours earlier.", "Very large and very bright light in the SSE sky over the Mountain Range.I was driving home around 11:15pm from Missoula to Florence, as I turned onto Old HWY 93 I noticed a very large bright light in the sky.  The direction was roughly SSE of Florence and I would guess about eleven miles from HWY 93.  It was bright yellow and hovering over the first saddle of the Mountian range when I saw it.  I know that there isn&apos;t a radio tower that has that strong of a light, and I can&apos;t say that I have ever seen a radio tower over that direction.  The light stayed stationary until I reached the county line and then it was lost behind some trees.  When I past the trees the light was gone...not a trace.", "On vacation in Sedona, I was sitting waiting for a tour trolley to start about 9:20 in the morning when I looked up between two buttes to the northeast and saw an object like a white fireball, with a short tail, hovering between them.  It looked like a comet, only it was stationary for a long time.  I watched for about 5 minutes and took a couple of pictures.  Then it started moving, accelerated and moved from the upper right to the lower left and disappeared behind the &quot;saddle&quot; of the buttes.  A couple of minutes later I saw a jet.  It had a much longer tail. I am a supervisor with a state agency, have a college degree , and  consider myself to be a stable person.", "Looked towards a thunderstorm approaching from the west.

It was not the sun this craft had a definite shape that was not a plane.The object looked more like a half frisbee. It disappeared into the clouds and then reappeared in a different location.  It did not have blinking lights like a plane would have had.  The light was not from the sun, I do not know what I saw yet I know that I saw what I did.  The second time it appeared it disappeared just as quickly back into the clouds.  Talk about strange. I guess I can now say that I am one of those crazy people who has seen a UFO.

It was being followed my some type of minitary jet, close behind.While driving home from Las Vegas, myself, my wife and son saw an object in the sky. This was south of Wickiup, Az., about one mile north of the bridge that crosses the Upper Burro Campgrounds. The shape was a paralagram, with green lights on the corners. It flew from the east-southeast toward the west-northwest, at a high rate of speed. It made no sound as it passed, and it looked to be less that 1000 feet off the ground. The road is hilly and twisty with no place to stop, so I&apos;m not sure where it went after we saw it. From the time we first saw it until it disappeared couldn&apos;t have been more than a few seconds. It was being followed by a military jet. It was also less that 1000 feet up, and clearly following the objest. The plane was close enough so we could hear the jets roar, and this was with the car windows rolled up and the radio on.

There was absolutely no tail assoicated with this craft.  In addition the size was that of a pea.  It traveled slightly slower than a speed of a meteor, but faster than a satelite.  The two of us observed the object.  It was so bright you could even see it pass in front of a vivid northern light display.See above.  That is all I can tell you at this time.", "I viewed an object that looked like a star initially but when viewed standing still it moved slightly. It looked like lights were flashing all around the objectThe first fifteen minutes the object stayed in one place with small, quick movements. The object had flashing white lights that blinked often. I was able to capture several pictures on 35mm film. It also emitted a small beam of light similar in shape to a lighthouse&apos;s light with a circular rotation around the aircraft. After the fifteen minutes, I decided to check out UFO websites for reporting. When I came inside to do this the object was in the same place as I originally saw it. I had to go back outside to see if it was still there when the form asked for a duration period. The object had changed its position. It had moved farther away to the northwest by approximately 7 degrees. As of 0100 hours I can no longer see the object. I only observed 1 object. I am employed by a construction supply company.

They all illuminated bright white lights that would light up the surrounding sky. There were airplanes flying all around them so we ruled out aircraft. They weren&apos;t planets or stars because they kept illuminating a bright light that got brighter then dimmer.  After about ten minutes, the larger one shone a bright, bright, white light, dimmed and streaked across the entire horizon in less then a second. It was awesome. The other three hovered, then moved back and forth from east to west for about a minute then two took off west while the third took off east. My son and I witnessed this and was able to videotape about 2 minutes worth.

Just curious if anyone else has reported anything or has an explanation.", "Large, bright green fireballMy sister reported to me that she saw a large bright green fireball in the northwestern sky.  The fireball was about the size of a ping pong ball held at arm&apos;s length.  It was a very bright green color and fell quickly straight down.

Jet was right on planes tail a plane was twisting back and forth in an evasive manner. Plane fuselage was skinney almost non-existant. Both vanished in clear blue sky in 10-15 seconds getting smaller as thay went off in the distance.My wife,2 children and I were on our way to visit relatives in Lancaster, PA. heading west on Route 30(Coatsville-Downington By-pass)about 7-10 miles east of Octorara Trail (Hwy 10)when I saw a very dark black jet chasing what at first appeared to be a propeller powered plane with an extremely long wing span. Both planes were heading almost due north from the south side of Hwy 30. I first caught sight of them when they were slightly off to the left and about 30 degrees above the horizon. They were about 1000-2000 feet away(and maybe at an altitude of 800-1200 feet) and moving extremely fast( I would guess at between 1000-1500 mph. My guess is based on seeing passenger jets go over at about 3000 feet and knowing their speed to be about 650 mph. However I am not too confident of my air speed estimates, but they were moving much faster than what I&apos;m used to seeing. The black jet was right on the tail of the other craft( if my previous guess of their distance from us was correct at 1000-2000 feet then these craft were no more than 100-200 feet apart and maintained that distance thruout the sighting. The jet appeared to be chasing the plane. The plane&apos;s wings were rocking back and forth(twisting)giving me the impression that the plane was trying to evade the jet, however the twisting seemed not to effect the direction that the plane was heading. The twisting motion was as though its very thin fuselage was rotating on its axis which caused the wings to pivot up and down.Howver, that this did not effect its flight path! In fact the entire apparent pursuit was virtually a straight line from left(south) to right(north)where the 2 craft quickly receded into the distance. From the time I first saw them until thay disappeared 10-15 seconds had elapsed. They disappeared from sight to the right of my first sight of them and they had traversed about 45 degrees of arc(based on 360 degrees)during the 10-15 seconds.As soon as I saw the craft I called them to the attention of my family, my wife(43), daughter(11), and son (! 7). My wife and daughter saw it within a few seconds but my son didn&apos;t(he wasn&apos;t wearing his glasses and didn&apos;t immediately start looking when I called out to them.)I was driving and had to look forward several times during the sighting to make sure we were still on the road. Therefore I did not get to take in as much detail as I would have liked. My daughter watched from the time I called out until the craft disappeared. She atarted watching about 3-4 seconds after I did. I called out almost immediately after I saw the craft because they looked so odd. In fact when I first saw them I thought they might be models- but their speed and the distance they were covering ruled that out right away. Halfway through the sighting I started to doubt that the plane was a plane with extra long wings and a very thin fuselage but might be a long flat rectangle flying sideways! That seemed almost as absurd as a prop plane being chased at high speed by a jet! My wife had little to say about the event when we later were discussing the sightings later that afternoon. Her main comment was that the black jet was a shadow of the first craft. My daughter and I took her to task over that as planes don&apos;t cast shadows on the sky! I am a construction Project Manager with both feet firmly on the ground. I do have an avid interest in things scientific and paranormal-including UFO&apos;s. My wife does not share my interests even a little bit and the sighting left  a little desperate for an answer-thus the shadow.

It was January and it was cold, so I was sitting in my car letting it warm up.  Incidently, there was no frost, snow, or anything else on my windshield that would impair my vision, or any sight seen through that windshield.  I was just staring straight aheadand noticed movement in the sky.  A point of very bright light that was about the size that a large planet would appear in the night sky, moved quickly and deliberatly in a perfectly straight, horizontal line from the point it had been sitting at to a point an unknown distance away (it may have moved about a foot if a ruler could be held to the sky).  Upon abruptly stopping, it disappeared.  I was unsettled as I had never seen anything like this before. It was a point of light in the sky that suddenly and unexpectedly moved.  I had watched it remain inanimate for approximately 1 minute before it just took off.  It was not a meteorite or shooting star, as these don&apos;t move horizontally in such a perfect line, or with such deliberate manner.  A plane (of the kind that are seen around here, namely commercial jets) cannot possibly move that quickly.  The episode took place in the Eastern sky, the light moved from north to south, and lasted approximately five minutes....", "Very large and bright blue-green fireball witnessed while driving North-bound on I-495 (The Beltway).The fireball was witnessed by myself while driving on the 8 lane I-495 about a quarter mile from Tyson&apos;s conrer.  I noticed the object as it was heading directly towards the horizon at a perpindicular angle.  The object was at about 40 degrees above the horizon when I noticed it.  The fireball was about 4 times the size of Jupiter currently in the Southern sky and brighter than a full winter moon.  The inner core of the object was a very bright white and the larger corona was a very intense blue-green color.  The tail was seperated from the object and was also blue-green with shades of yellow and red.  I-495 is the mega-highway that encircles the Washington D.C. metropolitan area and is extremely well lit.  Usually, no object in the night sky can be ascertained from the beltway due to the overhead lights.  I was very surprised to see a fireball in such a highly populated area.

We lived in what was called Riedels trailer park in Schertz, TX, off of highway 78. My dad was stationed at Randolph AFB and it was only 1.5 miles down the road. This one afternoon I went outside to check if my siblings were coming down the road home and glanced up in the sky between the trees that were on each side of our road and approx 150 FT in the air was a whitish disk sailing through the air with no sound. It was tilted on its axis toward me like it was making a turn. I froze and followed it through the air which was about 15 secs when it became obstucted from my view by the old Starlite theater screen we lived directly behind. i have told a few people in my liftime and the best i always described it was like it was made out of concrete, the color description it looked like. It was approx i&apos;d say 50 ft in diameter and approx 8 to 10 feet thick. it was like a giant nickel but whitish color. there were not any markings on it i could see and no windows.

Unconvinced, my mother told him to look again, which he did and upon second inspection, was unsettled by the nature of what he and my mother were seeing.

The sound then appeared to calm down for a portion of a minute.  Next the sound began to move rapidly in my direction and passed almost directly overhead.  Neither my son nor I could see anything, but I judged by the level of the noise that the source of the noise was either very low in altitude (500-1000 Ft.) or the object was very large and moving air like an object larger than several barns.  The sound continued in a SSW direction for about 30-40 seconds and then appeared to travel beyond audible range.  I estimate the distance traveled to be about 40 miles in under a minute.  On a map this would have been approx. 10 miles SSW of Corvallis, OR. to the vicinity of Springfield, OR..  For the entire duration of this event, I could not see any flashes of metal, nor could I see a con-trail or any other evidence of a common aircraft.  After I thought about this event for five or ten minutes, I decided to call air traffic control at the Eugene airport to see if they had noticed anything or had phone calls about an unusual event.  Their reply was negative. I am reporting this event 3 months after the actual occurance, so the exact date and time are approximations.  I would assume that the Eugene Airport should have record of my call.", "Visiting the capital and city, did not see object at all while taking the pictures, object was unseen at the time.   Took two pictures, object in first picture but not the second,We were visiting Washington DC.  After visiting a couple of the museums we were walking across the mall.   While in front of the capitol  building I asked the kids to turn and face me.  The daughter grinned at me and I told them that I am going to take the picture again, thats when I shot the second picture.  However the object is not in the picture, but everything else is, the clouds are the same, the people in the background were there, however slightly moved.  The time between the two pictures was about two seconds.  Since our son moved his arm in the second picture, I told them to forget it, and we moved on.  The interesting thing about this and why I remember the date, is that we happened to have been in the Air and Space Museum during the shooting at the Capitol building.   We are interested in knowing what this.  Sun was to my daughters left side", "Round Ball, Diameter the Sun would appear near sunset, perhaps a tad smaller. Silvery to almost translucent, pulsating between visible and near invisible.I was driving west on Route 9 in Westborough MA at 1359 23 Sep 98 when a truck in front of me let out a puff of smoke.  The visible smoke did not disipate as I expected. My eyes were then drawn to what was really happening in the sky. What I saw was what appeared to be a funnel cloud rotating and shifting while changing density dark to light. Then this appearant funnel formed into a more roundish but not perfect round object that moved from right to left and then back left to right. Again this movement was accompanied by darkish to near translucent appearance. After just a few seconds the object appeared to me perfectly round, and pulsating between silver and near translucent.  It was if the object was trying to be invisible but not able to achive it totally. I am a very creditable person, a simple software sales person. I can&apos;t believe something like this has happened to me. There are no drugs involved here. I am a former member of the Air Force Intelligence Command who was in the right place at the right time on my way back to the office from a simple lunch meal.", "Flash on moonI was out watching the Geminid meteor shower.  At about 5:50 AM, the moon was rising, almost new (only a thin crescent), and while looking over at it, I observed a a very brief but very clear and brite flash of white light near the center of its umbra.  It looked like a strobe going off. It was almost definitely not a meteor (there was no tail, and definitely did not &quot;cross&quot; the moon&apos;s disk).", "Oval object streaking through sky, high rate of speed, trailing yellow and orange smoke, or dust particles behind it.Was out swimming in pool, when I looked up and noticed a large oval object streaking through the sky, trailing it was a bright orange and yellow light or smoke. Watched it for about a minute and then got out of the pool and ran to the house to grab our video camera. We I came back out, the object was gone.", "we saw a sphere of light move steadily across the sky. Then it zig-zagged. It changed from whit to faint blue and flashed. It then ping-ponged inside a cloud. Then disappeared.", "Same night as green fireball seen from Eugene to Seattle, and a report of sivlery UFO seen in Vancouver (heard on Art Bell) an unusual number of high flying aircraft traveled from south to north towards seattle, leaving con trails.At approx. 18:35 when leaving work for dinner, I saw at least 6 con trails in formation very high directly above Portland headed generally towards Seattle.  The last was still being created as I watched.  I live in view of Portland Int. airport and a military air strip near by, and have not in the decades I&apos;ved lived here seen that many con trails at once. I also noted it because while they did appear to be very high, I could see the craft better than I thought I should be able to, as though they were unusally large, they seemed longer than they should be, but they were so high I could not hear any sound from them at all. I noted it in the back of my mind and went on about my business, until Art Bell came on and I heard about the large sighting in Seattle a couple of hours later.   Wondered then to myself if someone may have known what was about to happen, and was on their way to take a look. Then later when the caller from vancouver said he&apos;d seed that unusally moving &apos;craft&apos; at about 14:00 that afternoon I really became convinced I should report this, just in case anyone else noted unusal military looking activity that night.", "It really just appeared, it was only a few feet above me, I an not sure but I think I touched it.  It was a silverish metallic color, I don&apos;t remember if this one had lights or not.  There was no noise or humming, it just sat in air, I do not remember it leaving.I do not wish for my name to be used, my husband would never believe me.  My grandfather, a minister in Chocowinity, suggessted that I contact you about this.  This incident is not the first one I have encountered, I remember at least four more.  However this one was different in the fact that it was much larger, it made no noise, and most of all, this time I was not afraid.  I felt a since of familiarity with them or it.  I remember reaching up to touch it ( I think I did touch it, but I could not bet my life on it), and thinking it was bigger than the last, and actually admiring it.  I am a very stable and sane person, I have never really believed in them, even after the first encounter, I just kind of blocked it out.  The first one came when I was about 11 years old, my brother was about five.  We were standing at the edge of our field playing when a small saucer shaped object flew down and hoovered above our heads only about two to three feet from us.  It made a hypnotizing humming noise.  We stood frozen with fear and awe,(I don&apos;t know how long we stood there) then we started running as it chased us about a hundred yards then dissappeared.  The strangest thing was we hardly ever talked about it.  You would think as kids, we would of tried to tell the whole world.  We just did not have much to say about it to anyone, not even each other.  It was very small though, I don&apos;t think any &quot;being&quot; could ride in it.  It was about the size of a a teachers desk.  The one I saw on Monday was much larger though, about the size of a car.  I know that someone out there knows what these things are, and I want to know.  I am not afraid anymore, in fact, I actually now look forward to the next time.  Can anyone tell me why it would pick me?  Oh, and I don&apos;t know if this will help, but every incedent has occurred between June and September.  I do not wish to go public with this, I know people would think I am crazy, but I think anyone that does not believe it is possible is crazy and ignorant.  How can people even thin! k that out of all the stars and space that we would be the only planet with life on it?  I do not think these &quot;things&quot; or beings mean us any harm; I got more of a &quot;motherly&quot; feeling from this &quot;ship&quot; the other night.  I felt protected and loved.  I know this all sounds crazy, even as I write this I know I would probably think someone was crazy if I heard them saying it.  Please read this with an open mind.  I am also open to any other explanations. One other thing, my husband and I saw fighter aircraft in the air a few hours before this.  Though at the time, there were none in sight, that I remember.", "I saw 4 different aircrafts within a period of 15 min, all were square, low flying, had 3 round lights, and fast flashing red lights.On Monday night, November 16, 1998, driving home to Penn Hills, down Butler St. heading towards Allegheny River Blvd.  I saw 3 round bright lights rather low in the sky going towards Pittsburgh.  They were flying in line with the river on my left side.  At first thought it was a low flying airplane headed for an approach for the Pittsburgh airport.  As I looked up again, and the plane seemed to be sitting still.  Then it seemed to move again towards Pittsburgh.  That&apos;s when I noticed the second one further to my left.  They had the same 3 lights and small twinkling red lights.  I pulled over three times to watch these objects. As we passed by in the night I went further on down the road, not looking back, but wondering what could stand still.  I then  decided to call the local TV station to ask if they could find out if there was anything unusual flying to the airport, but they didn&apos;t seem to care.  Then I called 911, they didn&apos;t seem to care.  I then called information to get the airport&apos;s number to see if they had anything on radar unusual, that might put my mind at ease.  I then saw a third and forth objects, both with 3 brighth round lights, and flashing red ones.  When I called the TV station back, they suggested I saw a helicopter.  These were not moving like helicopters and I heard no engine noises at all.  The third and forth moved theh same way as the first two.  I looked up and saw a square outline with the three bright lights, and red lights at the corners.  The forth object then hoovered close to me.  Then it left. This all took place between 10-15 min.", "Taveling south about 3 times faster than an aircraft Light blue glow about 10000ft Size of 737 eastern sky 45deg travelling due southOne object Very light blue glow about as long as a 737 but twice as high.

Slowly lost luminosity and disapeared.I was watching the Leonid Meteor Shower from Joshua Tree not far from interstate 10 freeway (i could see freeway in the distance). Facing the freeway (North) at approximately 4:00 am, my attention was drawn to a rather bright star-like object in motion. I would guestimate the magnitude of this object was a -1 or about the brightness of Sirius. It was slowly descending towards the mountains in the distance. Now I have seen many objects in the night sky that I could easily explain such as Meteors, planets, artificiall satellites, airplanes, etc.. But this object did not &apos;act&apos; like any of these. It was moving side to side as it descended, reminding me of a falling feather. As it descended it also seemed to be loosing some brightness but basically dissapeared very unexpectedly. The duration of this sighting was less than a minute. Conditions were mostly clear with some clouds moving in from the West. Interestingly, as I saw this object, meteors simultaneously streaked by it but my attention was focused on this strange light.", "It  was at night and dark, I had just completed coaching a flag football game.

I remember one night being floated against my will down the stairs of our house. I was terrified , and my feet were about a foot off the ground .there was a short figure (even seemed shorte than me )which I took to be a which and it was beside me the whole time. I tried to grab the wall and the bannister but could not get a firm hold. My next memmory, can&apos;t say wether or not it was the same night, occured in my driveway. this one happened repeatedly. I would find myselfe being floated down my driveway towards the road by little grey men . that they conformed so accurately to the modern stereo-type is the reason that I am reporting these events.  thes e guys seemed very real to me. after the first time I seemed to recognise them and them me . like with the witch, my feet were about a foot,maybe two feet off the ground and I would keep trying to find the ground so i could run, with my legs moving in a cycling motion below me ,but i never found it. This hpenned about three or for times and at least one of the times one of my little sisters was there with me. At the time I thought these were morethan dreams and wondered if maybe they were real but in another dimension or something that shared the smame space that I normally lived in but was normally not accesible. I also remember finding myselfe in my next door nighboors back yard in the middle of the night and having to climb up the hill back to my house. I moved to Scotland when i was therteen and didn&apos;t have anymore of these dreams. But I did have another strange dream when I moved back to connecticut for university I was staying at a freinds house in New Canaan durring the summer when I had this dream where I was on my back on like a hospital bed , being steered through a huge well lit place by two people. there were many other people , in groups but I didn&apos;t take much mote of them.when i was left olone on the bed I tried to run but my feet had some kind of glass sandles or something crudely stuck to the soles. as I ran back the way they had brouht me these sandles slid arround on the mettalic floor.  I ended up in some kind of smaller darker room with some people who were doing a project and were very calm and made me feel more relaxed. this could have just been a dream,I really dont know ,but I mention it just in case anyone else has had a similar one I am 27 years of age and fairly well educated and work as a deck -hand in Miami by the way- about a month ago I saw a green/blue fireball looking north west from my balcony .It was bigger and slower than a shooting star and move more horizontal than virtically. it dissapeared after lees than two seconds. it was almost the sise if the moon.", "ten (10) white cylinder shaped objects flying in standard formattion, for appox. 5 minutes.Ten (10) white cylinder shaped objects sighted at approx. 13:30 pm, flying in a standard formattion for approx., 5 minutes and then completely  vanished. no sounds or special effects.

The objects didn&apos;t appear to be balloons and were definitely not aircraft.The objects seemed to move independent of each other but at times did move together. They appeared to hover (or hang) in the sky, which led the observers to believe that the objects weren&apos;t aircraft. Balloons were ruled out because no one in our area has a hot air balloon and we&apos;ve never heard of 7 weather balloons being launched at the same time. The objects eventually moved due east, heading out over the ocean. One of the observers managed to videotape the sighting and when he asked his neighbors for their thoughts (they witnessed it as well), they had no idea as to its origin either. Although the observers watched the object by eye and with binoculars for close to 30 minutes, it was nearly impossible to detect any specific features on the objects. For what it&apos;s worth, we typically do not have a lot of helicopter activity in our area. But strangely enough, three days later, one twin-rotor (apparently military-green) and one black high-tech-looking Huey-shaped helicopter circled the same area most of the afternoon until dark.", "Bright shiny object splits in two and disappears above horizon.Visiting my first cousin, we were looking up at his vinyl siding.  I noticed what looked exactly like sunlight reflecting off a shiny airplane, except that it was moving way too fast.  If it were an airplane, it was at a VERY high altitude, judging from the relative size.  It appeared to split in two, attempted to rejoin, and grew fainter as it neared the horizon and vanished.  It was moving almost perfectly due East.  All this occured in ten seconds or less. It was a clear sunny day, with no major fronts moving through."]
