I was 10 years old at the time and was playing with my basketball when I looked down my street only to see what I just described. All six (6) crafts were only about 20 yards away, and only 30 feet above the ground, just above the tall pines. I stood motionless counting each craft (6 in all ) as they passed over and across the road. I will never forget that afternoon aaround dusk, as they were all such a brilliant radiant RED color that did not glow outwardly but instead was contained and with absolutly no noise. The whole incident lasted only about 30 - 45 seconds as they flew &amp; disapeared over the top of the tall pines. I immediatly ran into my house to tell my Mother who was intertaining a guest at the time. My Mother played it off as a hoaks and comainded me to leave the house while she intertained her guest.

The row of lights were of difference colors and were not quite horizonal to the ground. The lights appeared to be some distance, we could not judge distance or the size of the object. I appeared to be large. We had a high powered telescope, but could not get it work properly. We also had binoculers which worked fine. We observed a red light break away from the row of lights. We also saw a faint whitish beam come off now and then from the end of the lowest part of the object.Our house is near the flight path of SeaTac Airport and commercial planes came between us and the object.The weather conditions were terrable.

Most likely it was a meteor or space junk.", "Update for report of sighting on 12/02/93This is an update to a previous report.  The main change is the date.  Please revise date from 12/20/93 to 12/23/93.&lt;---- Updated Report (not many changes besides the date) I also emailed photos ----&gt; Date of sighting: Thursday, December 23, 1993 - approximately noon Location of sighting: Valencia, CA @ hilltop near I-5 and 126 interchange (34&deg; 26&apos; 50N&quot; Latitude 118&deg; 36&apos; 10W&quot; Longitude) I only have one sighting to share but it has kept me thinking for many years now. I think a sighting can be very informative if the observer notes not only what was seen but also the circumstances under which it was seen. I used to work for an amusement park in Valencia, California called Six Flags Magic Mountain. I was a senior in high school at the time and worked the summers, weekends, and holidays. This week the forecast called for thunderstorms and a high probability showers. It was only a few more days before Christmas and one of those days when I knew the park would be empty.That day I was on my lunch break when I sat in my usual quiet spot not far from where Batman the Ride would later be built. It overlooked our employee facilities in the foreground and the intersection of the I-5 freeway (north/south) and the 126 (east/west) in the distance. My view was to the east and toward a small range of mountains on the other side of the I-5. The mtn peak is about 200 feet above the I-5 freeway. At its base now sits an extension to the Valencia Industrial Center and the northbound I-5 to 126 off-ramp. On the other side of this mtn range is a field of gas wells in what is called the Honor Rancho Plant (owned and operated by Southern California Gas Company).At lunchtime there was a thunderstorm moving from north to south. It had already passed where I was but I could still see the lightning in the distance and the sky was entirely overcast. About 15 minutes after I sat down I had finished what I was eating and looked out at the freeway, at the range beyond, and then to the clouds. I was just passing the time I had away from my work when I saw something moving in the lower layer of the cloud formations. It was situated across the freeway and just above the mtn range (about 100 ft above the hill&apos;s peak). At first I thought it was a shadow. As it came into clearer view I thought maybe it was a helicopter even though I didn&apos;t see a tail and its shape wasn&apos;t quite the same. It was in nearly zero visibility because of the clouds and was inching southward (left to right), much slower than the clouds around it. This is probably why it caught my eye. It was a grayish tone (maybe metallic), elliptical in shape with the long axis parallel to the horizon line, about 25ft in width, 12ft in height, and had no distinguishing extrusions. If it had any markings on its surface I couldn&apos;t see them from this distance (1.4 miles). Patches of cloud would make it appear and disappear over what was to be 2-3 minutes. I watched almost unblinking at what I couldn&apos;t identify. I might add that the only sounds I heard included a light thundering to the south and the hum of the traffic on the I-5. I would normally have also heard the occasional yell from someone on a ride some distance away, but because today was a few days before Christmas the park was virtually empty. Then at one point clouds passed in front of it, obscuring it completely. I thought I&apos;d lost it, but I kept watching. 15-20 seconds later it reappeared the cloud having passed it. Now it was clearer than ever and it hadn&apos;t hardly moved. I still couldn&apos;t see any detail and my mind was a blank as to what this object could possibly be. It was kind of small to be a blimp and kind of big to be a balloon but I guess it could ha! ve been one or the other. Then it did something no blimp or balloon I&apos;ve ever seen could do.After 2-3 minutes, the object shot up into the clouds instantaneously, like it had been attached to some long extended rubber band that I couldn&apos;t see. The speed was so fast (and the fact that the object was already nearly engulfed by the clouds surrounding it) that, had I blinked, I would have certainly missed this last maneuver. There was no deformation in the object that I noticed in the 2-3 minutes that I watched it. What I did see however was the deformation of the misty cloud as the movement of air suddenly displaced it. This was the one key piece of information that convinced me what I saw was actually there. A fraction of a second before the object lurched upward I also saw it drop ever so slightly like it was &quot;changing gears&quot; or transitioning from one mode of operation to another. The speed of the final maneuver convinced me that what I was dealing with was not a object of any kind I had ever seen and I thought this maneuver was the last of this sighting and that I&apos;d never see anything this unusual again. I was wrong.I immediately looked at my watch hoping to record the exact date and time of the sighting, but all I could manage to remember was the placement of the second hand and only for a moment at that. This is why. I continued to look in awe over the freeway for some hope of an answer. Then, about 10-15 seconds after the object had shot into the clouds, a small bolt of lightning that I couldn&apos;t hear at that distance struck EXACTLY where the object (above the hill&apos;s peak) had been situated. I was sure this was no coincidence and I&apos;ve thought about this sighting (the only sighting I&apos;ve ever had) for years.((NUFORC Note:  We have no prior report for Castaic Junction for December 1993, or a report from the same witness.

We had gone out there looking at agave roasting rings, and just checking out the country. The date is approx. It could have been any time between 1988 and 1992. The sun had just gone down but it was still light out. We were on the north end of a small valley, having followed a jeep trail up an aluvial fan untill it ended. We had stopped to take a leak and, while looking south toward Las Vegas, we saw a very bright light rise from behind the hills on the other end of the valley and stop. We were a couple of valleys north of Vegas, so it appeared to have risen from a valley between us and Las Vegas. It sat perfectly still for so long that I began to think that I hadn&apos;t seen it rise, and that it was venus or something. But then it slowly dropped back behind the hill. After awhile, it rose back up and then started to move around. The way it moved was amazing. It would go from stopped to moving very fast with no acceleration or deceleration time. It would do geometric patterns with 90 degree angles without slowing down. It would get very bright and then get so dim we could hardly see it. Then it dropped behind the hill. Shortly after it rose the next time, another one came up. They sat perfectly still for just a moment and then they instantly started moving fast, flying in a chaotic pattern all around each other... like gnats, or humming birds. Then, they both darted out of sight. Shortly after they were gone (it was then completly dark) several helicoptors came over the hill from the  southeast (the dirrection of nellis AFB). They seemed to be combing the area. So my friend and I headded back. On the way down out of the park there was an area where we could briefly see the road further down, before a turn in the road obscured our view. In that brief time we saw a white truck with a shell. Looked like a government truck. By the time we could see the road again it was gone, and I&apos;m pretty sure there was no other road.

Its distance from me was approximately less than a mile. I took my headphones off and got out of my room and continued to observe the object which seemed to be a goldish copper.

None of these applied to this object.

It turned &amp; moved toward us &amp; as it came overhead she realized it was IMMENSE, HUGE, it covered the sky, &amp; created such a shadow that the breeze ceased in the trees &amp; even the birds fell silent. She said it was 1000 feet above us, the size of three football fields from our perspective &amp; that this was no blimp!

Apparently she told me to run home with the cocker spaniel &amp; she tried to run also, but being very pregnant could not move very quickly.

It took the form of one on one interviews and I&apos;m bringing it to your attention because the people of Broken Hill have withdrawn from the spotlight and you will not see the city which is a copper mine town, I think the largest in australia, on any ufo map. But its stories are the most rivetting I have ever come across in the past ten years.The craft were described as common in the area, but not talked about because the people do not wish to be thought of as crazy. They are generally recognized as being massive by all witnesses including a world famous and respected artist who lives in the city, Pro Hart, and I quote , &quot;about the size of sixteen football fields&quot; ie each one or &quot;about a mile long&quot;. And on a regular basis. This story might be old and the craft have probably moved on . Why stay near a desert town like Broken Hill forever, but I think it deserves to be put on the record. I believe these craft are Intergalactic ,  which would explain their great size. I was again reminded of them by your Rense show with a similar sized craft (or three) in Arizona.These craft obviously know everything about us , see my earlier post about the searchlight phenomenon and continuous presence over Sydney Australia for several weeks with nothing in the media ,they have been studying us with superior technology for so long ,and are probably just waiting for us to grow up.Finally like my mother used to say &quot;there is good and bad everywhere&quot; and no doubt this applies to these extaterrestrials as well. In which case maybe some of THEM should grow up. I was just wondering, do these craft need copper? it doesn&apos;t hurt to take the discussion beyond &apos;Did you see that.It was..etc!&apos; Finally I believe that maybe every star in the Universe may support life at some time.

We counted at least 50 small discs surrounding the mothership. I was in total disbelief at what followed. During the next 45 minutes, we witnessed how the smaller discs entered the mothership, one by one until they were all inside! Then the mothership started to move slowly towards the south. I looked around again and spotted a second mothership coming into the picture, and they both took off so fast that I could not follow them.

My friends were just as astonished as I was and now they started to believe my story. What was an american AWAC plane doing in Cuernavaca, Mexico? Then, two other things happened. It just kept getting better and better. Two military jets flew right over our heads! They were so fast and so loud that I couldn&acute;t identify them but I could swear that they were two american F-16&acute;s. Either way, Mexico does not have that type of aircraft. I know that this story sounds completely like it was from a patient out of an insane assylum, but I swear it is true. About ten minutes later (dusk) my friends became total believers when we saw a light coming over the mountains. It&acute;s flight patterns were erratic and changed quickly. Not an airplane. As it got closer we could see it through the binoculars. It was a huge sphere, deep bright orange, I don&acute;t know if it was the reflection from the sunset but that&acute;s what it looked like. It seemed to be landing towards the east. I got on the phone and called a friend in the small town of Tepoztlan and told her about it, that it was coming her way. While on the phone, she described it to me as it landed somewhere over the mountaintop. So now we all knew we weren&acute;t seeing things. Needless to say, we spent most of the night on that roof, without any further sightings. The next day, I got a call from another friend who related to me, that he had seen what looked like two F-16&acute;s flying over northern Cuernavaca! Then I told him my story. We all got together that weekend to share our experience. No one else that we&acute;ve told about this believes us, so, since then we have just kept it to ourselves, but one thing for sure, no matter what we have seen out there through the years, now I know for a FACT, that they truly do EXIST and they are HERE!!! I have heard of motherships before, ! but now I&acute;ve seen them with my own eyes.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I moved about as fast as a jet. I video taped, cut a photo from the video and enlarged the photo. A white cylinder cigar shaped object. There was no trail.An hour later that day I saw another object in the sky in the same place but this time I heard a jet engine. This second object was just a jet. This was when I realized the first object was not normal.", "On two occasions I saw a craft that everyone tells me doesn&apos;t exist.I work at a coal fired power plant, I was outside (smoking a ciggarette) looking toward the coal pile and noticed two bright lights heading toward me. The craft was moving very slowly, it took about 1 1/2 -2 minutes to cover the distance of the coal pile kitty corner. This is ruffly the distance of 2 football fields I guess. I watched it, trying to figure out why a plane would fly so low or close to the buildings. As it reached the coal belt tubes I could see it had two huge flood lights on the front. It then banked off to the west and I could see the shape. It reminded me of the stealth bombers. It also had three smaller white lights underneath it. I later described the craft to a co-worker who has military experience and asked him what sort of craft it was. One other thing that is probably important. I never heard any sound from the craft except possibly a very soft high pitched whine at he edge of my hearing but I wasn&apos;t sure if it was from the craft or the plant behind me. I thought the craft. in a blink it was gone. Anyway, my co-worker said no such craft exist as we know it. A stealth bomber is niether slow nor quiet. A hareier (?) jet would be the only thing that could fly that slow and they are not quiet either. He said either I had good drugs, which I don&apos;t, or it was a UFO. I don&apos;t know. Only know I saw but didn&apos;t hear. This was not the first time I saw this craft or one just like it. On sept 11, 2001, yes, the day the towers were hit, thats why I remember, I went to the store in the evening, probably around 21:00 hrs and on my way home saw the same type of craft coming toward me just above the trees. It too, was moving very slow and not making any noise. I put my head out the window and looked up the craft. it was almost directly above me, I felt I could have reached out and touched it. I watched it for a while, it continued as it was for a few minutes then took off. As it was heading in the general direction of Mitchel field where there is an air force base, I assumed it was a stealth bombe! r called out because of the events of the day. Until I talked to my co-worker about the latest episode I was unaware of the actual flight limitations of the stealth and that &apos;stealth&apos; does not mean slow and quite but un-detectable by radar.

Maybe you do.((ADDENDUM TO REPORT ABOVE))correction to previously filed report.I was able to determine the correct date for a report filed for 11/06/02, The correct date is 11/11/02.

I thought that it was probably some of the local military boys on a night jump so I pulled over to watch. The formation was approximately 5 lights about one inch apart. They appeared to be several hundred feet in the air. The strange thing was that I saw no vapor trail from the flares I thought were burning. I watched about 30 minutes or so, but the lights never got closer or further from the ground (they appeared as if they were over the water). After about 30 minutes, I got bored and went home, never to think about it until I saw a show on tv last night about the lights that were seen over phoenix several years ago ( a cigar shape that was widely reported).

There was an incredibly bright center light with large illuminated panels or windows in a disk or saucer shape.  It appeared that ther was also something going on on the ground for at least the first 15 minutes.  A beam of light went from the object to the ground.

Reading one of your past reports from July 31, 2000 at 9:24 am jogged my memory and I thought I&apos;d add this to your database.Back when I was in high school, my father and I were out in the yard one evening around 9:30, using a telescope I had recently gotten.  My dad was looking down at the the telescope, trying to adjust it, but I was looking nearly due west and about 75 degrees up from horizontal, over the top of our house.  Suddenly a very large, spherical fireball, about twice the size of a full moon, seemed to drop into the sky and roll to the west across an invisible shperical dome, then vanish as if had burned out.  That was the most amazing sight.  There was no sound, no enormous amount of light (just a soft orange color), no blast.  It seemed to all take place at extremely high altitude.  The event lasted about 1 second, but was burned into my mind.  My father never saw anything.  In my own mental analysis, it seemed to me that something had entered the atmosphere and exploded at extremely high altitude.  I figured the invisible dome I mentioned, to be the curve of the atmosphere and that the fireball just rolled off of it.  One detail I clearly recall is that the fireball had a &quot;firey&quot; texture to it, much the same as the texture seen on close-up photos of the sun.  There was no residual contrail, etc. left behind by the event.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I had just turned west on I-70 at Crecent Junction, Utah and had traveled just a few miles past the town of Thomson Utah when I glanced over to my left and saw way off on the horizon a straight line formation of five different colored flashing lights. I was with my partner and I exclaimed that I thought that there were five helecopters hovering out there with different colored strobe lights attached to them. As he continued to stare at them he told me to pull over because something was strange. He noticed that the lights were flashing in sequence from left to right and were very stationary in the sky. I said that they must be radio towers and he said that radio towers have lights all the way up the tower not just one light at the top. Then we noticed that the lights weren&apos;t really the type of light that we were accustomed to seeing. They had a funny little glow that didn&apos;t quite look normal. Then we realized that they were in the same color sequence as a rainbow, from infra red to ultra violet and in five different colors.I decided to turn on my amber yellow strobe for some unknown reason and when I did that the flashing sequence started to speed up. They started flashing in sequence from left to right very fast and they started to grow together very quickly which means this thing started to speed off in the opposite directing very vast. It&apos;s really hard to judge distance or size the way they sat out on the dark horizon but I would guess the formation to be about two hundred feet between the unfra red light and the ultra violet light, but I really don&apos;t know for sure. There was no sound that we could hear. We couldn&apos;t see any other shape attached to the lights. We saw only the five lights. My partner looked over at me after it disappeared an asked me &quot;How long do you think we sat and watched those lights?&quot; I replied, &quot;About five minutes.&quot; I retired right after that so I haven&apos;t seen him since then but I&apos;m sure I can find him and he will have no problem cooberating my story.This is the second report that I&apos;m sending and I&apos;ve now reported all of the ufos that I&apos;ve seen in my lifetime.", "V shaped Morphed gliding object over the Bellagio Hotel in VegasDriving on 15 South coming from The Las Vegas racetrack next to Nellis AFB. There was low clouds that day( by low I mean they were about 400 yds above the tip of the Bellagio tower in the center of the building) As we were heading to our hotel on I15 my nephew noticed a strange object gliding next to the freeway at the same level of the clouds going about 30 or 40 mph (or at least that what it seemed like), this made it difficult to see the complete craft, but we could certainly see the V shaped and ballon like lights that morphed and changed shapes. First it was a v shape then it would morphed into a semi straight pattern and then back to V shape. As we approched traffic we saw how the craft made a turn towards the Bellagio Hotel and went right over the tower in the center of the building and that is when we lost track of it as we were blocked by the building. By compraing the size next to the bellagio hotel and the distance from the building, I would estimate the size to be the entire span or larger than the length of the Bellagio hotel.

It was a frosted light as if lit from inside and had no markings on its uniform surface. The color was a pink-orange. At first I thought it was a hot air balloon (about the same size)but a second or two after seeing it, it turned off like a light switch and could no longer be seen in the dark. There are hot air balloons around Del Mar some miles to the South, but none fly low over houses in the dark, nor do they fly that far North.

Light sped up slightly, turned to the northwest and sped up again.  At that point it was blocked from our view by the house to the north of us.  My husband observed the light for two or three minutes before he told me about it.  At first, it appeared to be about 1/2 to 1 mile away; we opened the door and could not hear any sound.  The sky condition at the time was overcast with low clouds.  It had been raining a few minutes earlier.  Did not observe any stars at that time.  During the sighting, I had time to get my camera with telephoto lens; by the time I got back to the door, the light had moved farther north and I was unable to see any structure.

My girlfriend and I where looking foward for this &quot;escape&quot; from our every day urban life, little did we know this trip was going to change our views about this world tremendously, and will rise so many questions no one could possibly answer.We decided to go camping, we had bought our gear at cosco about a year before this event, but work was always on the way because to get days off these days you have to be really polite in asking your boss, because some corporations have a hard time understanding &quot;time off&quot;. So we finally did it was on august 2001, just a week after my birthday. We took along my father in law and his little son, my brother-in-law, and ofcourse my girlfriend.We arrived at sequoia national park at about three p.m. and we arrived at our camping site I dont remember the exact name it was something with &quot;creek&quot;. The reception lady was an older female really friendly looking and whit great spirits, like those kind of persons that just make you feel welcome and confortable around. she gave us advice on how to avoid disturbing the natural life around us, because is so beatiful all those trees, rivers, and humidity made the place like heaven on earth.So we pulled out our tent only to find out that it was the small two person tent and we were three adults and one child, but we where ready to sleep like sardines it didn&apos;t bother us at all in such a wonderful place things like that are easily overlooked. the &quot;neighboars&quot; next to us welcomed us and where inviting us close to their fire place since we did not have wood at the time to burn our own fire, and we politely declined since they where so many and we wanted them to enjoy themselves.To this point everything was perfect The moon was bright only the natural light of the stars along with the burnig wood from our neighbors was the source of light which was beautiful.so at about ten thirty there where no more noices of the chattery of all the campers and the burning wood started smelling a little stronger since it wasnt burning anymore only smoke was coming out and so we decided to take our place in the tent because the day after would be full of activities. at about eleven (at least thats what time it felt like) we all kind of woke up, but didnt relly talk it was a feeling like if something was calling for our attention. but didnt know quite what it was, first thing that came to my mind was that really nice old lady at the entrance that warn us about wild life specially the bears, so I thought well we might get to see a bear close hopefully everything is ok I thought.I asked my father-in-law wether he heard any noise &quot;no&quot; he replied. hmm.. I mumbled; well is it just me or is someone&apos;s light pointing this way, at this moment we couldn&apos;t see the source of the light because the tent from the inside is covered, but it definately got brighter almost as to where you could feel the warmth from it, and my father-in-law said &quot;yeah it&apos;s brighter&quot;, &quot;perhaps is the rangers scaring away a bear&quot; he said. After he said this the most peculiar feeling went through my body I felt heat coming from the outside, it wasnt uncomfortable heat, it fell like an actual lamp got close to my body and I told father-in-law Im gonna open the zipper from the tent to see whats going on with the light since its been here for a while. then I aproached the zipper and started to open it at that moment my girlfriend said &quot;what are you doing&quot;she said, &quot;Well dont you see the light&quot; i replied &quot;yeah I havent been able to sleep either, i feel like there is a bear or something outside. So I knew I wasn&apos;t the only one experiencing this.then I proceeded opening the zipper. At that moment whe where facing eastward opposed to the moon&apos;s position and indeed we saw a light; there was this bright light right behind some big trees right in front of us. only It seem too close to be a bright star. and too big to be a light bulb of some kind, there picking thru our tent we stared at it I would say for two minutes, then after that the most unexpected thing happen the light moved its focus from the neighbors tent to their extinct fire, I was puzzled by this light then I asked my father in law &quot;Do you think it&apos;s the ranger?&quot; &quot;Idont think so&quot; he said. and ther this bright intense light it seemed ideal for that light to be in a football field only no football field around sequoia that I knew of. So this light just I could say &quot;staired&quot; at the extinct fire smoke, It was hypnotising to see the light and at the same time the smoke I never payed attention to smoke before but the way it extinguishes is beautiful, you can actually create patterns of &quot;s&quot; shapes and rolling into the thin air, and then in a split second my eyes where flashed by an intense flash. I dont remember exactly how it happen or when, but the light was now directly in our face, my father in law said it&apos;s an ufo. I was speechless. although I was speechless though I asked him have you ever seen an ufo? &quot;no&quot; he replied, but thats not a normal light, I agreed as well the moment it looked at us because in fact the light was looking at us. I felt so diminished I wasn&apos;t scared I just felt really diminished, Im not sure why I felt this way. As the light made that movement from the fire to our tent it felt like in a way the light was aware of our precence and it felt we have seen it as well. so in kind of a friendly way it focused back on the smoke. after that we got reall tired the light was still there thought but neither my father in law or my girlfriend wanted to coment about it, I guess we all were so confused there was nothing to talk about.Next morning we woke up around eight a.m. the wood still smoking and then a ranger passsed by in truck and my fahter in law stopped her and asked &quot;hey were you guys the ones with the really bright light&quot; he asked. &quot;hu? what light?&quot; ranger replied. then my fahter in law explained what we experienced the night before, then she said &quot;well we dont have any lights that strong besides where are we gonna stand the light from the direction you are pointing beyond the little hill is a big drop my friend, so to even bring a light up to that hight would take a lot of long tubes to hold the light&quot; So me and my father in law glanced at each other and we knew we had to go see what was beyond that little hill, as we climbed it we  looke and those trees are about 100 feet thats why there were visible but the drop ws tremendous! no way it could of being a ranger with a lamp, that light was floating right by the tree branches and the thing that still amazes me the most is the fact that it was about twenty feet away from us!. From that day we have a more sencitive aspect as far as when people say they experience thing like that before we just assumed they were on drugs or something, but ever since that happened I am stil exited, anxious, scared, and puzzled by that event, yet I want to know...", "4 lights,in formation,changing directions and formations,then leaving.There were 4 orange balls of light flying in a line formation,For a few seconds.Then the formation changed to a square,Also with the new formation came a new direction,Towards me for a few seconds then changing direction again and also back to the same formation and direction then faded into the distance.Although i never beileved in that sort of thing i was shocked and looking on in ore.", "I saw a bright blue light slowly decend from the sky, a lot bigger, brighter, and slower than a shooting star.The only reason I decided to report this sighting is that someone else reported seeing the same thing on the same date.

The light from this was considerably more bright than the others, however movment from this one was limited. Additionally there seemed to be secondary lights of much higher elevation than all the others which had a redish hue to them, these lights seemed to be comparable in size and intensity to ambient stars and little movment was noticed of these.I called some local friends over to my house who observed these with me into the early morning and sun rise.After a time of observing - still durring the nite, a got a flash light from my house and flashed at the closest object as well as the others in math matical pratterns and progressions; 1, 2, 3 flashes etc, also in series of square roots, and prime numbers, etc. After i had flashed for somtime movment from the objects slowed considerably and eventually haulted compleatly.

I live in Glen Ellen, in the Sonoma Valley of California, and that would put the light in the direction of Oakville (over the mountains in Napa Valley).What I thought odd about the light was that it was particularly bright, a combination of blue and red lights that bled one into the other.  It was fairly low on the horizon, about at 20 degrees, which would put it along the ridge line of the mountains east of here (The Mayacamas).  There are no airports or private airfields around here, so it&apos;s unusual to see lights like this.I opened the window to see if there was any sound, and it was dead quiet.  I live in the country so it can get pretty still at night around here and sound travels well.  I should add at this point that it was pitch black with no cloud cover at all and the stars were very prominent in the sky tonight.The movement of the lights was unusual in that they glided on a path from NE to SSW, and the movement was slower than a plane would make.  I got my binoculars and went outside to investigate.  I couldn&apos;t make out any form other than the lights appeared to outline a wing-shape, sort of like the flying wing, but not as elongated.  I&apos;m not clear on this because the shape was vague and I could only make it out for a few seconds - the brightness of the red and blue lights bled one into the other and made it hard to tell what they were attached to, even with the binoculars.Then it did something strange - it just stopped.  For about two minutes it didn&apos;t move at all.  At this point, it was in the direction of the town of Sonoma, to the SE of my location.  It was much higher in elevation now than when I first saw it.  There was no reference point to compare it to, but I&apos;m sure it was at around 10,000 feet at the very least by now (whereas it looked to be at around 3-4000 feet when I first noticed it).After not moving for a few minutes, it began heading southward, deviating slightly from its previous SW motion, and the lights began getting very small as if the object was gaining altitude.  Finally I lost track of it as it kept going south and getting dimmer.  Again, it was very quiet outside and I didn&apos;t hear any engine noises that would make me think it was a plane.It&apos;s probably nothing like I said, but still, there was something very strange about the movement of the lights.  When it stopped like it did, I found it to be very odd, not natural at all.  It wasn&apos;t circling or hovering, which would cause the lights the move back and forth somewhat.  This thing just flat out stopped moving.Anyway, for what it&apos;s worth, that&apos;s what I saw.", "A momentary sighting of a large bright circular object flying through the sky.I was leaving home for work, going from unincorporated community of East Dailey, Randolph County, to Elkins.

I thought I have to get to the drivers seat and get out of here and all the time I was thinking if I move something might happen but I got into the drivers seat when I started the engine the saucer went up in the sky within a fraction of a second and I could see it way up in the sky.  I saw this one airplane come across the sky towards it and the saucer went down and then another plane came from the other way and the saucer went up in between both planes, one plane above it and the other plane below it.  Then I started to go and the saucer seemed to move along with the car.  We went to get someone to bring them back to show them because no one would believe us.  We went to her house but no one was home and then we went to a store were I hung out with friends and no one was there and then to my house and no one was there.  My house was about a quarter mile from it so all I had to do was drive straight down my street which was next to the Delaware River across from Philadelphia the south part of Philadelphia.  A couple miles to the north was the main part of Philadelphia and south was the Phil. National Airport.  Across the river was industrial and docks and the Eagles football stadium.  As I drove down my street I would pass the town park and then onto another street there were about 10 oil tanks and then the industrial park were I saw the saucer.  I kept going down the street (ALL THIS WAS DURING NIGHT TIME) and I got half way past the oil tanks, which were along the river to my right, and just before the water tower I got scared and said to my friend that I can not go back there and I turned left onto this street and all of a sudden three of the brightist lights I ever saw came shinning in the back window.  It seemed as if the or what ever it was came from behind the oil tanks and from the river and it seemed as if it was in the air and shinning the lights down from up in the sky.  I put the gas peddle to the floor and took off as fast as the car would go.  I was about to come up to a cross street which was a major road and this intersection was one of the worst in town for accidents but I did not care I went through the stop sign and went right across the street and when I got to houses were people lived I felt safer and slamed on my brakes and got out to look and that fast there was no more lights.  I asked my girlfriend what happen and she said when I put the brakes on it went off to the right of us.Well, I have never seen another saucer but a lot of times I can hear that swirling sound out side in the sky when I am in the house and it is quite.  I asked the girl I was with at that time if she had ever seen one before and she said yes.  Its been over thirty years but I have never seen her again but I hope I run into her to ask her if she had seen anymore. jAlso my science teacher said it was probably a weather baloon and the lights we saw was from an airplane but an airplane could not fly that low.Everyone said were seeing things and never believed us but I believe there was something to back my story up to be true.  Like I said this happened in 1968 and around the early 1980&apos;s the government attack force of the USA, and they never told anyone the Mayor or Police Chief or anyone that the were going to do this, attacked the industrial building behind the water tower and next to the oil tanks.

The governments answer was that they were just practicing.The building they attacked was a place called GAF which is strang because I read a group that deals with UFO&apos;s and the organization name is GAF. Also I read somewere that tin or alluminum was used for spacecrafts, which I do not know is true or not, but this building made alluminum siding and they said that there was contamination in the building which closed in the mid 1970&apos;s.Well, thats all I have to say.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The speed at which this &quot;vehicle&quot; was moving at would have made it impossible for any human being to stand against the velocity of force required.

The Aurora project comes to mind.2) There truly are beings in which God has created that have the ability to extend past their worlds. After all, it would be rather arrogant for us to believe that God wouldn&apos;t create life other than our own here on earth.3) There is the possibility that time is being manipulated here. We&apos;ve proven that time can be slowed as one approaches light speed so why could it not be stepped out of.

It beamed down onto the lake.  It went down and right back up.  It came back at this point toward the house.  About 50ft away it stopped. Came a little closer and then stopped.  He was standing on the railing of the deck on the front of the house.  It was about even with me in height.  Then it moved straight up and quickly passed.  At one point my sister started to watch it from the window My nephew went in to tell my mom.  My sister saw several lights hovering over the bushes near the house across the street. Then it headed towards the house and then over.  My mom came and looked out the window.  She described it as very large, and she could see greenish lights on the bottom. She saw it over the lake and it just hovered there then started coming back towards the house. She called her neighbors who live across the street and the women said her daughter said she was watching a strange plane out the window.  My other nephew who is 6 also saw it.  My nephew said the was no noise from the object. My nephew said it look like a dome shape on top.No one has had a chance to talk to the neighbors sense the incident.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the party who submitted the report, and she sounded quite credible to us.  We have requested that other reports be submitted by the actual witnesses.  PD))", "Large egg shaped object motionless in skyI was driving down the 43rd street extension to go food shopping when I saw a very large,dark, egg shaped (eliptical) object with a shiny spot on each side (lights?). It was not moving at all, not high like an airplane, not a helicopter, not microwave dish.  I was trying to make sense of it because it didn&apos;t move.  After 30-40 seconds, I rounded a curve with trees which blocked my view and when I passed the curve the object was gone- no where to be seen. This frightened me very much and I called 911 to see if anyone else had seen this.  I gave my name and cell phone number.  About 45 minutes later my two children started yelling that there was a rainbow.  I looked out the car window and to the left of the sun (quite a way) there was a light shining in the sky with a vertical rainbow in front of it.  I don&apos;t know if this had anything to do with the other object I saw.", "Please dont think I&apos;m crazy. The year was approx. 1983 or 1984.I was about 8 years old. I was living in Garden City Michigan with my parents.I dont remember a date: I can tell you that is was warm outside. at approx 11:30 pm or so.My father was a truck driver and was out of the state. I was staying with my mother.I had a friend spending the night who went to get us some Toco Bell on his bike.I remember that helter skelter was playing on TV and there were a bunch or Regan and Bush election comercials on. My friend was taking a long time to come back and my mother and I went outside to see if he was comming down the rode.We spotted the boy driving his bike down the rode holding a toco bell bag..He looked up in the sky with his mouth hanging open, dropped the bag and fell off his bike. We looked in the sky and seen; &quot;Your going to think I&apos;m crazy&quot; A HUGE round craft with lights all around it and a a bright light comming out of a big hole in the center. It was kinda like a doughnut...there was a hole in the center but the light was blurred or hazy so we couldnt see beyond the hole..The craft was made from some metallic material. &quot;Looked like grey metal. The craft was turning at a medium pace in a circle hovering right above us. The craft was so big it looked like it was a lid to a cookie jar that we were inside. I started running in circles crying...my mother was grabbing me trying to get me in the house...As soon as she got into the house she called my grandmother up on the phone. My grandpa and grandma looked outside and seen the same craft. They said it looked like it was right above them  object. My mother left the phone to go see if it was still there. My mother and I went outside and it was still there. A second later it took off slowily in a diagonal direction upwards then come to a complete stop..then it Zoomed off with a flash in the opposite direction leaving our site. My grandpa seen 1 other small craft leaving with the main one...But I only seen one. Concerned, my mother called The GC Police dept. And said &quot; Please listen. this is not a prank. There was something over our house about 5 minutes ago&quot; The police said. MAMM, we havent had any reportings of any objects in the sky today.It was probably just a plane. My mom got pissed and hung up.The next day I seen something on TV about sightings of a Bush election plane flying around..&quot;Sounds like they were trying to justify something&quot; I would like to see this object again. My memory is slightly clouded due to the time passed. I can say that this was a FLYING SAUCER without a doubt. It wasnt little flying lights or a falling star ...It was a Huge grey metal disk that must have been over a mile in diameter &quot; I forgot to mention, my grandma lived 1 mile away from us.&quot; I seen what appeared to be windows with light comming out of them..The funny thing was.This thing had alot of light comming from it, but the groung wasnt lit up nor were the houses in the general area...I find it hard to believe nobody else seen the same thing even thought it was 11:300 or later.Oops almost forgot..There wasnt any sound from the object that I could hear.((e-address deleted))((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was bored so I was stargazing and noticed a star and it looked strange along the bottom.  It was pretty far away but the light it was giving off looked like a beard along the bottom.  I asked my son to look at the star and tell me what he saw and he said, &quot;It&apos;s moving&quot;.  I thought he was just playing or seeing things but when I took a closer look, it was in fact moving.  It would go rapidly to the left, then the right, and sometimes up and down.  Then it started fluttering in small circles like a butterfly.  I said to my son, who was amazed at what he was seeing, I wonder if this is the only one.  As I started focusing on what looked like stars, I noticed that they were moving too.  I counted more than 20 of them all around.  The closest ones were in the eastern sky and they would get really close and bright and then pull back and fade away and disappear completely, only to reappear a few seconds later.  Some gentleman stopped to try and help us and I asked them if they saw the light moving and they did, but I don&apos;t know who they were.  I snapped a picture of it with my camera.  It had black and white film and I&apos;m not sure how it turned out.  When I develop the film, I will mail it in if it turns out.((NUFORC Note:  We note that the sighting may have been the result of looking at celestial bodies, possibly twinkling stars.

The object noiselessly covered a distance of 30 miles in a period of about 10 minutes, passing over the cities of Chandler, South Phoenix &amp; Scottsdale, AZ. It was moving parallel &amp; nearly directly above the Interstate 10 Freeway. The object was observed from the parking lot of the 3 observers place of employment. The object had an irregular flight path, constantly, if only slightly, changing altitude &amp; direction, but moving in a northerly direction. It was observed from a distance of roughly 1 to 3 miles. Due to the clear daylight conditions and close proximity of its observers, as well as the object&apos;s omnidirectional movements, it&apos;s shape was clearly discernable &amp; was not that of any aircraft known to the observers. There was no tail, wings, fuselage or propellers visible. As it maneuvered perpendicular to the earth, its underside was seen to be black. When horizontal, it appeared the have a highly reflective metal surface. There was an intermittent orange glow about it. When 1st sighted (at a distance of 3 to 5 miles, it had a diffused look, reminiscent of a gigantic piece of Saran Wrap, but quickly &amp; unexpectedly assumed a much smaller solid &amp; more circular appearance as it quickly moved closer to the initial observer. At its closest point, relative to the observers, its somewhat bell shaped outline became apparent.", "This is the fourth time my family and I have seen this object within the last 12 months. The object was a brilliant orange color. The object was moving very slowly...slower than a plane. The object would move slowly from the southeast to the northwest.The object would occasionally hover and the intensity of the glowing orange would change from very bright to a very faint and very dim glow. After 10 minutes the object just winked out and it was not seen again.", "Saw cylinder shaped object with lights that disappeared  abruptly.I was inside looking out at the evening sky when I noticed a bright &quot;cylinder&quot; shaped object moving slowly from east to west coming in the direction of my house.At first I thought it was a chopper, as we have many flying over our house on Lake Travis. As I watched it come closer, I noticed that it seemed to have many lights in a &quot;clump&quot;, with other lights below it; a little hard to explain. I also noticed that it was moving in a starting and stopping pattern, rather than smooth.  It did stay on the same course.  I turned my head to knock on the window,so that my husband could come out and seeit; when I looked back up, it was gone.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at some length, and we found her to be quite credible.

Afterwards the light just disappeared ( from our position looking like it went &apos;really fast&apos; in the opposite direction we were looking)  We both waited and watched for another 15 minutes in case it was an aircraft, and it would just appear again not far from were it was.

Distance indeterminate.  Objects were about the size of a B-B held at arm&apos;s length.  At first I thought they were a group of approaching aircraft as just 5 minutes earlier three bi-planes (flying in echelon formation)had approached from the same direction and area of the sky heading north.   However, the six dark objects seemed to stop and hover at about 45 to 50 degrees above the horizon and then assumed (while hovering) a U-shaped fromation.  They held that formation and postion for ten to fifteen minutes remaining completely stationary.  Then one-by-one the objects moved slowly away from the group to the west about 10 or 15 degrees when they seemed to be obsured by clouds.

Dry weather.", "Three super bright craft emitting triangular light array.I was driving with two friends across Bob Sikes (3-Mile) bridge going South from Pensacola to Gulf Breeze.  Halfway across, at the crest of the bridge, we were startled to notice an immensely bright light approximately 200 yards away from us at roughly eye level (about 100 ft. off the water).  It was disc shaped and was emitting pulses of light, much like tracer fire, in a triangular array of about 30 degrees, and only traveling perhaps 4 diameters out away from the craft before the pulses stopped.  The effect was visually as if a dotted triangle was temporarily attached to a brightly glowing sphere.  This emission would go on for 10-15 seconds at a time, after which, it would stop and then recur anywhere from 30 seconds to 2 minutes later.  I stopped immediately upon exiting the bridge and went to the edge of the bay to be able to watch with as little light pollution as possible.  When the lights were not emitting from the craft, it would fade to a dull, almost black, shade of red.  As it traveled East away from us, it would become difficutlt to track it visually while it was not in its&apos; bright phase.  When it was approximately 5 miles from us, we noticed another craft, also pulsing identical light emissions, approaching the first from about 45 degrees to the the North.  The two never got closer than a couple of miles from each other.  Approximately 10 minutes had gone by at this time.  Immediately after noticing the second craft, we noticed a third approaching the first from about about 30 degrees from the South.  At this point, the emissions were coming less frequently, and we could only be sure of the exact location of all three craft when they would emit, which they did not do in unison.  When they reached roughly the current location of the Garcon Point bridge (approximately 10 miles from our vantage point, they all three dissapeared at the same time.I am a college graduate, do not drink or use drugs, and am an avid fisherman in the area, so I am very confidnent of my distance estimates.((NUFORC Note:  This report replaces a report NUFORC posted in 1997.

If it was daylight and they were not illuminated I would guess it was a flock of geese. It appeared like a typical formation of birds, but the shape changed as it moved across the sky. At times it looked more like a string of illuminated pearls. Maybe it was just geese catching the lights from Manhattan. I&apos;d never seen anything like it before. I watched it for about a minute.

Our position was approximately 78 degrees 44&apos; longitude, 38 degrees 07&apos; latitude. I was using a digital camera to take photos of the kids and scenery and did not notice any object in sky while on site.  On Saturday evening I was reviewing images on the computer and noticed a distant object in one scenic shot of mountains due west.The dome-shaped/triangular/??? object appears in only one shot taken at 11:51.  The other shots I took were probably spaced 30 seconds to several minutes apart, most of which were in the same general direction as the shot with object.  My first thought was debris on the CCD sensor (highly unlikely, sealed housing and all other shots clean) but I do not believe this to be the case. If this is indeed an object and not some kind of digital &quot;noise&quot;, I estimate that its position places it somewhere over the National Park or beyond. Obviously, I have no information on possible movements, velocity, etc., however, I think object is slightly blurred, which would indicate very high rate of speed given distance to object and sunny conditions  If object is real I probably did not detect it on site because I was taking pictures with CCD camera through low res. LCD viewfinder I have absolutely opinion either way about the existence of UFOs but do feel that there is no reason to suspect other than an earthbound explanation for such events - whether or not such an explanation can be readily obtained in all cases.  There is a county airport some distance away and hot air ballons are very popular this time of year in the county.  If it were a balloon, however, I would have likely imaged it in one or more photos I took before and after the one that recorded the object.

The red flashes mostly happen in the same locations . Looking out the window the red flashes occur within a 45degree angle on the horizontal plane from my perspective.  I know the surrounding area very well and tracking the source of these flashes eludes me.  I look through binoculars at times and looking at the direction where the red flashes occur the  sky seems to shimmer like looking across heat of a fire.

This thinking puzzels me, very frustrating.", "Nothing on Earth glows brightly, hovers and pitches directly upwards at that speedThis report is many years late, but I now have added interest in this subject.Well at last I have the opportunity to sit and write to you. Please accept my apologies for the delay in contacting you.This sighting lasted only moments but it was an unforgettable occurrence.The time was 10.15 pm in London, the conditions were excellent, the sky was crystal clear. Stars of every magnitude could be seen, it was literally a picture of heavenly beauty. It was a mild night and the temperature was comfortable. I was in my ground level kitchen washing some dinner plates, my kitchen window is situated above my sink so i had a view of the night sky where i stood.I went to the garden to throw some scraps for the birds to feed on the following morning and saw what a beautiful night sky it was. i thought to enjoy it for a few moments and realised after a moment or two that there was a fairly low star with a piercing white light in a position that was unusual for a star even for a planet. It was small enough to be mistook for a star but, the glow was not a natural starlit glow, it was also bobbing about slightly, like a top that has been spun and cannot stay completely, still but has slight movement. Of course this movement is easily detectable because all the stars in the sky are perfectly still and anything that moves is easily detected.I remember audibly saying to myself ,&quot;Is that star moving.&quot; I concentrated on this &apos;star&apos; to try to detect movement and sure enough it was definately hovering. I watched it for at least 10 further seconds  as it humg in the sky emitting its very unusually brilliant white light.The &apos;star&apos; was about pea-sized, if you held an outstretched hand and brought your thumb and index finger together without touching.It was probably at about 55 degrees.  The object then glowed brightly and moved foreward in a straight line very slowly for about 5 seconds then stopped I staggered backwards in disbelief. Then the object stood stationary and continued glowing for about another 5 seconds. Can you imagine my surprise. Then the object glowed really bright this time, imagine looking directly into a lightbulb. Then as if someone had lit a firework the object pitched directly upwards.When I say directly upwards, it was as if someone had used a ruler and drawn a straight line in the sky and asked this object to run along it as if on rails. But the glow disappeared almost immediately as it took off upwards at the most incredibly awesome speed i cannot find the superlatives to describe the speed, nothing that we know of here on Earth. The object then became a complete circle like a coin of light with a pinkish hue getting smaller and smaller as it disappeared DIRECTLY and vertically upwards. It was then that I realised that we were visited by a craft from outside our understanding.I thought of running into the house for my binoculars and then realised that the speed of the object would foil my attempt to observe it closer and I was pleased that i did not. I just watched it as it went higher and higher and became a tiny speck of light. If the sky was not so clear i would have lost it, thanks to a crystal clear night.The object (speck) made a slight change in direction as it got way up, I would say about 10 times past the moon&apos;s distance as we know it.The object now a pinhole of light headed towards a reddish star way way up. This may not be significant but it did, it finally disappeared from view but kept on travelling I&apos;m sure. I felt that whatever it was, it certainly had no intention of returning to earth that night. But who knows.My feelings as the object moved forward in a straight line before pitching upwards, was that it was looking at something on the ground. I may be wrong but it&apos;s mannerisms were that of a bird of prey hovering over and stalking a slow moving prey on the ground. I have no choice but to use my imagination in this instance.I cannot say how far the object was from my vantage point, I had no point of reference,  the moon was not in view, even so the whole incident lasted only about 1.5 minutes maximum from start to finish.I was lucky to see what I saw. I believe it was a probe of some sort, nothing alive could survive the G-forces in the escape from our space.Almost every year I stand at the same spot in my garden, at 10.15pm and run the whole thing through my mind. I remember the stars that were in that area of sky at the time, thats easy because the same stars are there every year in April.I felt a change in my attitude after this. I felt as if I knew what millions af people did not. I felt that all we are doing here on earth don&apos;t mean one damn thing, because if they came to stay or showed themselves seriously we would be shocked into submission. We have no chance against the demonstration of raw power that I saw.I told a few friends and my girlfriend at the time, but I only told people who knew my character and would not treat me like a looney.Now I hardly mention it. I believe more people would have sightings of their own, but it&apos;s amazing how many people never look up in the sky especially at night. By the way with all the raw power and energy expelled in that instance, there was no sound at all.The following day which was bright and sunny I went to the garden and saw an airliner about ten times higher than the object the previous night and I still heard it&apos;s engines&apos; noise as it dragged across the sky. We do not have the technology to do what was done on that night.", "freaky mann...........................................saw 4 balls of bluish- green light hovening over the big bend dam located on the missiour river near ft. thompson, sd.   they proceeded to move east towards highway 50.......      when they where over head you could see light moving in cicle and you could make out a disk shape object........there was no sound, of anykind and the shot striat up in to the air.......the others followed and then they dissappeared.........talked to local law enforcement.....they had many silmiar reports dating back to early 70&apos;s.............", "Bright, almost glowing irridecently, tadpole shaped object (oval with a tail) travelling West to East at a high rate of speed crossed above us over S.C.

PD))Large Glowing Orange Ball &amp; Meteor ShowerFirst let me say that I would have bet my life on the fact that I would never be reporting a sighting or anything resembling a UFO. It&apos;s taken me 4 days to get enough courage to even begin to explain what all I saw in the early morning hours of Nov. 19, 2002, approx 13 miles Southeast of Stover, Mo. First let me say that on this date, it is also Deer hunting season in Mo. At approx 1:30 AM my neighbor &amp; I set out for a neighboring field where we usually hunt. We had left early so we could have a good view of the Leonid Meteor Shower and not have to venture far afterwards for hunting. We parked my truck at the west end of the field facing West as we were trying to get the light of the full moon behind us as the &quot;showers&quot; were to be best viewed from the East. We got in the bed of the truck with heavy sleeping bags that would hopefully keep us warm as I wanted the best view possible and boy did I get it. The beginning of the unusual sightings were not that impressive but changed quickly so now I&apos;ll try &amp; explain what I saw. At approx 3:00-3:30 we saw what we first thought to be a plane rise from the tree tops on the west side of the field,(It had a milkly like appearance &amp; was kind of pear shaped with what looked like 2 legs at the bottom) but there was no sound. This was approx 150-200 yds away. We both looked at each other like what is that!! It hovered there for about 30 seconds and then slowly rose straight up &amp; very slowly headed South until out of site. Then every once in awhile you could see faint white objects resembling kind of the same shape just going back &amp; forth accross the sky at different speeds &amp; with no set pattern. At approx 4:15 at the southeast end of the field at ground level I saw what looked like a porch light or headlights through the trees. This area is completely wooded with no homes or buildings nearby. In maybe a 5 min span it flickered on &amp; off 4-5 times then this HUGE GLOWING ORANGE BALL rose right out of the trees &amp; stayed right at the tree tops swaying just a little back &amp; ! forth an d never any sound at all. I wish I could accurately tell you how big it was but all I can save was it was unbelievable. I looked back over my shoulder once at the moon and this ball appeared to be maybe 1/3 the size BUT the Moon was a long way off and this ball was only about 800 yds away. Anyway this stayed in same position for about 10 minutes then rose up slowly about 80-100 ft or so &amp; then just changed to a BRIGHT WHITE still in a ball shape. During the next 30 min it rose maybe 30-40 feet &amp; then gradually changed its shape into kind of a rounded triangle or pear shaped with a pulsating light (only visible at times)from what looked to be a small protruding area on the center bottom. At 3 different times when this light would come on &amp; back off it would then make the easterly sky appear as if daylight was approaching but just lasting a few seconds. The figure gradually rose straight up with a Very slight drift to the Southeast. This was a very bright &amp; clear night and at 7:15 AM you could still see the object high in the sky but appeared to be a ball shape again. Also at about the same time the ball turned from orange to white a jet appeared from the west flying fairly low &amp; at slower than normal speed, and what I thought to be an irregular pattern of the normal blinking lights that planes have when flying. Then it appeared to be stationary for 2-3 seconds &amp; then at a high rate of speed it shot straight up &amp; then immediately veered right &amp; headed down directly towards the ball &amp; then flew right around the back of it. Then went back east with a jet stream behind it as if nothing was unusual but within 5 minutes there was 5 or 6 jets in the air but none went as close as the first one had. They all had jet streams behind them &amp; just kept flying randomly overhead until the object was just barely visible. The following morning at about daybreak 2 neighbors went within a mile of there &amp; said they just saw a solid looking white ball fairly high in the sky.UPDATE: 11/24/02  I finally got up enough nerve to go back to the same spot to see if I might be to see this again &amp; maybe take a few pictures. At 4:35 I saw the orange ball again &amp; it appeared to be low but at a much farther distance. It immediately started rising up &amp; went white &amp; within 30 minutes or so it was so far up it almost looked like a bright star but was much bolder &amp; solid looking than a star. It almost looked like it changed shape &amp; also appeared to get brighter at times, but it was to far away to be certain of this. I took 4 pictures with my old 35 mm but as far away as it was I doubt if it shows much as it was hard to even detect it thru the lens. I&apos;m sure this all sounds very weird but I give you my word this is the Gods truth. I was absolutely scared to death when the jet headed towards the ball as I had no idea what was going to happen.

Hovering very slowly. heading east, then west.Near dusk, but the sky was still bright blue. I saw two black, triangles hovering in a very slow flight pattern. They did not fly like our planes or birds. I watched for 10 minutes as they headed from the east to the west and then slowly, back toward the west again. They moved closer together, progressively and appeared to be about 45,000 feet, or possibly higher. Several jumbo jets passed by at maybe 15-20,000 feet during my observation, and these objects were clearly not flying like the planes, nor did they look anything like any kinds of planes I have ever seen. I am a private pilot and am familiar with flight patterns through the skies in this area.  I have also observed many birds of prey (hawks,and others, in this area and these objects were not like this animals. This is the first time I have ever observed anything like this.

These two lights seemed to play tag, one passing the other in a seemingly perfectcircle. We observed this phenomenon for about 20 minutes as we were travelling.  A CalTrans flagger and a bystander that we passed were also engrossed in the lights as we passed them.  I thought that it was a search light on clouds, but I could see no beam, and there were only spotty clouds.

Tha craft seemed to rotate,as it flew across the sky, and was almost transparent in nature.  It seemed as if you could see right through it, but definitely had a shape and lights around it. From the way it was moving, it seemed to leave some sort of trail,it almost reminded me of when you see a ship re-entering the atmosphere and there are vapor streams from friction or something. We all saw it zoom across for about 10 seconds or so and then disappeared.  It did not make any noise whatsover. We were all at awe of this insident.

The light moved smoothly and in a manner similar to how I&apos;ve seen a meteor travel through the sky.  It seemed like a point source, and had absolutely no trail whatsoever, ruling out, in my mind, it being a meteor.  The location of the light as it moved was to the east of my vantage point, and I would estimate it&apos;s location, based on where I was and where it was, as being perhaps somewhere over the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay.  I heard no sound, although I was in a moving car travelling approximately 55mph to the South.  It was of very short duration, visible for no more than a couple of seconds.  My wife was unable to see it from her location in the passenger seat.I know this entry is late, but I feel it&apos;s worthwhile to do so as I recently found this site, and when I checked its archives to see if there were any other reports of what I saw, I was very suprised (and relieved) to see many other sightings that clearly were of what I saw that night.((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes self as professional, with considerable technical experience.

I saw three landing lights (believed to be a heavy aircraft) approx. 3 miles away and wondered what airport was in the area. After a moment of thought I realized there was no controlled airport close enough to facilitate a landing. My next educated guess was that it might be a military aircraft flying a low level mission. I pulled my vehicle to the side of the rode and stood at the side watching the lights become three separate objects flying in a wedge formation.

The bright light or lights gave the appearance of a large zig zag or Z shape.  I suggested to our sons that it might be some sort of aircraft, and they didn&apos;t think that made sense and had been observing it a good while as it approached, before we were called outside into the open patio.

In a few seconds it appeared again off in the distance at an even lower altitude. At the same time another craft with a very bright light and two red flashing lights appeared behind the same group of trees and just seemed to hover there!

I looked away thinking it was nothing. Something strange about the object must have registered in my head because I did a double-take to reinvestigate.

I also slipped on my glasses for a clearer view. The object made no sound whatsoever which was particularly note-worthy as the craft was clearly metallic and what appeared to be quite substantial in weight. This was no ball! oon. The craft moved north while following a perfectly parallel synchronicity with the telephone poles and the ground.It was moving no faster than 15-20 miles per hour so I had a perfectly clear view.

I was ten years old and I believe it was early March/late February when this all occurred.My mom is a fairly hokey person who believes she sees things all the time (spirits etc.) so when she woke me up in the middle of the night to look at spaceships my first reaction was &quot;go away.&quot;  My dad and sibling wouldn&apos;t get up either.  So she came back to me.  I felt bad at this point and out of sympathy got up to go to her room and look out her window.  She handed me bi-oculars and pointed south of our house over the cornfield.  &quot;There,&quot; she said, pointing in the east.  I saw nothing for a minute or two, but she insisted that I stay.  Believe it or not I saw it zip across the sky and stop suddenly, as quiet as a mouse.  It was like it was playing a game.  I saw it zip back and forth between it&apos;s starting and ending points a few times.We where looking south from northern most part New Lenox which at the time was pretty rural.I tried to wake my dad up.  &quot;If they&apos;re out there I don&apos;t want to know,&quot; he said and rolled over to try to sleep.My mom and I came to realize that there where two ships.  The one in the eastern part of the sky started to &apos;eject&apos; small &apos;ship like&apos; things to the west of it.  I have more detailed records of all of the &apos;ship like&apos; things and am going to send in the orginal record of this event as soon as possible.  In the west sat another ship across from the eastern ship.At this point the Eastern and Western ships started to &quot;do&quot; geometrical patterns. This is hard to explain- but we definately saw geometerial patterns in the sky- moving and changing color. It was eerily silent and beautiful. As it started to become light they seemed to stop.The next day we made records of these patterns and everything we had seen.  I got on the school bus and looked to the east for the main ship and it was there! I wasn&apos;t a very social child at the time and besides who would believe me so I watched it as long as I could in awe of its sleek silver oval shape.On the bus ride home I saw it again in the Eastern sky.  A plane (a regular plane- not a jet or anything) started to approach it from the Northwest and I became fearful that someone would find it- but instead the UFO seemed to &quot;turn&quot; from the bottom up and blended in with the sky.  The plane passed as if the UFO had never been there.I got off the bus and walked to my house backwards keeping my eyes on the UFO which had reappeared.I entered the house and told my mom they where still out there.  We tried to talk my sibling and my dad into watching them with us that night- but they refused.  They didn&apos;t believe or want to see.So my mom and I watched the ships for two more nights.  I never saw the Eastern ship in the daytime again.  But I always look there when I drive through town- just incase.We haven&apos;t seemed one since, but I find my self looking at the stars hoping to see a dash across the sky and a sudden quiet stop by a silvery ship.As I said earlier I will try to find the orginal documents and send them to you ASAP.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I saw the trail of many objects headed from North to South above the Eastern horizon", "I was headed North on I-5 when I saw a glowing green object streaking across the night sky and descending towards Tualatin.I was headed north on I-5, and had just passed the North Wilsonville exit.  I was travelling at approx. 70 mph.  Just past the exit, the highway inclines for a ways, then flattens, and then descends down into a valley.  The Tualatin exit is at the bottom of the valley.  As I began to level out after the incline, I noticed a greenish glowing object streaking across the sky.  The object was also headed north, but was travelling faster than me, and appeared to be on a downward path.  I don&apos;t know how high up in the sky it was...maybe 200-300 feet?  I don&apos;t really have any reference point to provide a good estimate.  It was fairly large, however, and for a moment (because of the whole terrorist scares around the world) wondered if this were a missile about to hit.  It was somewhat spherical, or ovular, almost reminiscent of a comet, but I didn&apos;t think to pay very close attention to the shape.  The object&apos;s speed was constant, and it descended down into the valley (mentioned above).  I fully expected to see/hear an explosion of some sort, as it was descending very quickly, but nothing happened.  I was still too far back to see down into the valley, so I lost sight of it once it went below the top of the hill.  When I began heading down towards the Tualatin exit, I couldn&apos;t find the object anywhere in the sky.  And there didn&apos;t appear to be a crash of some sort (no burning buildings, etc.).  So, I have no idea what happened to it, or what it was.  The duration of time wasn&apos;t any longer than 5 seconds or so from the time I noticed it and the time it vanished.  I didn&apos;t see anything mentioned on the late night news, nor in the newspaper this morning, so I searched the web to see if something was posted about it .  I couldn&apos;t find anything, but I found this site.

When we first noticed the &quot;cloud,&quot; it looked to be only a hundred meters off the ground and less than one hundred fifty meters from our position, in the car.I stopped the car and got out of the vehicle to take a photo of whatever the black object was and by the time I snapped the photo (twelve seconds after our initial look at the thing) the black anomaly was approximately four hundred meters away.I then re-entered the car and looked to see where this black object had gone. It was nowhere to be seen! (Only six seconds had elapsed since I had taken the photo.) It really didn&apos;t look like a real cloud, at all. It looked more like a beginner&apos;s attempt at making a digital cloud. It moved toward the Northeast, even though the direction a nearby flag was blowing indicated that the surface wind was moving in a straight West to East direction.That was also the direction a line of upper (white) clouds were moving.Besides the small, black, cloud-like formation there were no other clouds in the sky except for the line of clouds that occupied an elevated height. The black mystery object was the only one of its kind in the sky. There were no planes or weather balloons or helicopters in the sky.The sun was near to its time of setting. Other than the above-mentioned clouds, the sky was blue.

I was unable to sleep, and decided to go outside and smoke a cigarette. We have these reclining chares in our back yard, so I laid down on one and looked up into the sky. I was not thinking about anything special, the usual pressures of life. It was a nice dark, clear night. As I was gazing towards the heavens, I noticed this red &quot;dot&quot;. I estimate its height in the sky between 20 to 30 miles up. The reason I estimate its height, is due to the size of the object. I can only compare it to, looking at a laser pointer dot, 30 feet away. While I was staring at this object, I did nothing unusual, at first; I had thought it was a twinkling red star. Then the dot began to move. The dot moved slowly vertical, from it&apos;s position. I estimate, about 1 mile. Then the dot stopped. The dot stayed stationary for about 5 seconds then moved at a 90-degree angle, and stopped again. After about 5 seconds the dot moved again, zig zagging at an incredible speed, in a northern direction. The dot stopped suddenly, zig zagged backwards for about 5 seconds, then stopped for about 3 seconds, and moved strait up, and disappeared((NUFORC Note:  Please see reports from Pennsylvania for this date.

It stopped above us and slightly ahead of our path.  Everyone with me turned and ran back to camp, which was a distance away, as I believe we had been hiking about a half an hour.I was fascinated with it and stayed and watched it.  It was a mechanical object, with clear textured details on it&apos;s dark grey surface of lines and fixture details you typically see on well represented craft in most scifi craft we depict today.  I would guess it was about 40 feet across.  The center of it&apos;s circumference was about 5 to 10 feet in height, and was lighted with multi colored light banks, that rotated around it&apos;s circumference.

It was definitely in the fall of 1987.  I was a junior in high school at that time and on one particular evening my astronomy class went to the observatory on the Yankton College campus.  That campus is now a federal prison.  That evening was very clear and I don&apos;t think there was much of a moon.  Our assignment was to look through the telescope and then write down on our sheet how many rings we could see around Saturn, moons around Jupiter, etc.  When I had finished my assignment I went back outside and stood with the other students on the hill on which the YC observatory is located.  There were maybe 10-12 of us there all talking about whatever when several of us just became suddenly quiet as an isosceles triangle shaped object in the sky to the west moved through our line of sight south to north.  It had no lights and made no sound.  Its only discernable feature was that it seemed to distort the sky behind it and the light of the stars it passed in front of in relation to us; kind of like heat waves rising off the pavement.  There were no additional colors.  Even though I can&apos;t describe the actual aircraft the shape of the visible distortion was definitely an isosceles triangle moving in the direction of the angle made by the two equal sides.  The base, or the back of the object in relation to its direction of movement, was a little longer than the two equal sides.  The translucent nature of the object makes it difficult to determine speed, size, or distance with accuracy.  The YC campus(Yankton Federal Prison) is not very big and is in a residential area.  From where we were standing on the hill the object didn&apos;t seem to be more than a few blocks away at an altitude of 200 feet, possibly lower.  At arms length it was aproximately 5-6 inches from top to bottom and 3.5 to 4 inches from front to back.  I did not get the impression that this was an extremely large aircraft.  When I caught site of the object I was facing southwest, and it moved! straigh t north until it was out of sight in five or six seconds.  Since it was night time and the object had no lights this probably wasn&apos;t a great distance, so it was most likely not moving incredibly fast.  Yankton is a smaller town so there aren&apos;t as many street lights as there are in bigger areas.  If this was not the case the object may have gone completely unseen.  Myself and possibly six or seven other people witnessed this event.  At this time I can only remember one or two who could corroborate this story.Even though this happened fifteen years ago those  five or six seconds are burned into my memory like a movie clip that I can replay.

SE of Interstate 80, 25 mi. ENE of Elko, NV (Elko County) Number of witnesses: 1 Description: Shape, Size, Altitude, Speed of object all unknown; No discernable features, no lights, just black void in sky casting giant shadow on ground.Witness account: Between 12:30am and 1:00am on a Saturday night in late November or early December of 2002 (not sure of exact date), I was driving my truck northwest on Nevada State Highway 229 just a mile or two north of the Lamoille/Ft. Halleck Road (dirt), from which I had just exited.  I was scouting out good vantage points for nighttime photography of the Ruby Mountains, the west slopes of which were now about 7 miles behind me.Under a mostly clear sky with a bright moon, I was cruising very slowly along the road, stopping occasionally to glance back and evaluate the panorama for good shooting locations.  This was perfectly safe to do because the road has an EXTREMELY low volume of traffic, especially at night.  As it turned out, on this particular night I encountered no other vehicles on the road.  Hwy. 229 is used primarily for access to local ranches and to the Ruby Lake National Wildlife Refuge (about 60-70 miles south and lying on the east side of the Ruby Range), and for all practical purposes would give a first-time visitor the impression of being a closed but well maintained seasonal road.I had just descended into a shallow &quot;dip&quot; in the landscape about a half-mile across and then came to a complete stop.  I turned off my lights so I could better view the full distance behind me under moonlight, and left my engine running just in case I had to quickly clear the way for any approaching traffic.My truck windows are heavily tinted, preventing one from getting a crystal clear view of distant nighttime surroundings.  Since it wasn&apos;t too frigid outside, I rolled down my driver&apos;s side window to look back toward the mountains and see if any light pollution was visible from rural homes or ranches.  However, this only gave me a good view of everything on my side of the truck, so I had to alternately look through the back window to see the land to the rear and rear right.While I was turned to my right and looking out the rear window, I became aware that the bright moonlight I had been bathed in all night was suddenly not there.  As I described to a friend recently, what happened during the next few seconds was a lightning fast series of thought processes and internal debates with myself in trying to rationalize why the moonlight was gone when no clouds were present to obstruct it.  At no time was I in a panic.  Everything happened too fast for me to develop any sense of fear about the situation.  Maybe it was because I was preoccupied with my scouting mission and not dwelling on thoughts of being all alone and vulnerable out in the middle of &quot;J.S. Nowhere.&quot; I guess my first reaction was to look up through the rear window thinking I might spot a large owl or other nocturnal bird of prey, which had swooped down low over the truck.  I saw nothing ... and I mean NOTHING ... no moon ... no stars ... just pitch black.  However, the shadow covering me persisted.  I shifted my eyes downward onto the landscape behind me and could see a sharp outer boundary of the shadow about 1/8 of a mile back down the road (beyond that, the land was visibly lit by the moon).  I then spun around and looked out my open driver&apos;s window to see the western boundary of the shadow, about 100 yards away, moving at a brisk pace toward me.  So whatever was casting this shadow was moving west to east.I stuck my head out the window and looked up, but I saw absolutely no discernable shape; just a mysterious mass of darkness the size or altitude of which I simply could not determine.  In the span of about 15 seconds, the shadow moved across the area where I was parked and disappeared over a low hill to the east side of the highway.  The moonlight now once again flooded the truck and immediate surroundings.Not having seen or heard the source of the shadow (my truck engine remained running during the incident), I have absolutely no idea how big or how high the object was or how fast it was moving.  All I know is that it was huge enough to cast a shadow I estimate to have been up to 1/4 mile across and moving about 30 - 40 miles per hour.The odd thing about this whole experience is that I never felt frightened or in any kind of danger.  I knew that something strange had just happened, but didn&apos;t really fathom the weirdness of it until sometime later.  In fact, I was only recently prompted to report this experience.All the above is fact as I remember it.  Now for the conjecture.  My belief is that the object was some sort of experimental aircraft, perhaps a mega-sized &quot;stealth blimp&quot; much like that reported numerous times since the early `90s.  I believe one of the most famous sightings of such a craft occurred just a few years ago in southern Illinois.  It was reported by several policemen, who tracked it into Missouri.  If what I witnessed (or didn&apos;t witness) was some kind of experimental military craft, it was far from any test facility, where you&apos;d expect to find such a vehicle.  Could it be that developers wanted to see how far out of the safe zone they could fly this thing without being spotted by the citizenry?  Unless someone else saw it before I did, then the testers succeeded in flying the device some 300 miles from the nearest test site - the Nellis Test Range (part of which is better known as &quot;Area 51&quot;)- before it was spotted ... or at least detected by yours truly.Even if anyone else on the ground experienced what I did that night, they were probably just as perplexed as I when they looked up and couldn&apos;t see any definite, solid object in the sky above.  So my question to readers is whether or not anyone else has encountered such a virtually invisible object elsewhere in Nevada or any other place.One interesting sidenote to this:  Just recently, I caught the tail end of a radio news report about an &quot;unknown, unauthorized aircraft&quot; flying low and disturbing livestock on ranchland in the Crescent Valley area (90 miles SW of where my encounter took place).  I didn&apos;t get enough details about that particular sighting, but I gathered from the story that it was a follow-up to a previous report from some weeks prior.  I&apos;m now wondering if that sighting actually occurred the same night as mine.  If there is anyone out there, especially in the Elko, Carlin or Crescent Valley area, who might have more info about the other sighting, I&apos;d like to know so I could follow up and maybe start piecing together the puzzle.  If this is indeed some kind of stealth blimp, how big could it possibly be ... and why would it be so big?((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.

The altitude was higher then the commerical airlines fly if their about to land or have taken off and yet the lights where as bright as if much lower.  The sky was extremely clear as I live in the country.  This formation flew silently until it reached the Orion constellation at which point as it was crossing it (from my vantage point) the formation disappeared.  I stood there for 5-10 minutes looking for any tail lights of planes in that area and saw nothing. I saw a plane in the north and a small craft far south east but nothing of the formation.

He reported his dog was going completely nuts has this event was going on. I asked the witness approx: how far away was the object to his location, he said maybe 4 to 6 blocks away up in the sky. He also said the ring which surrounded the object would twirl around the main body of the it.The fellow also mentioned there were a number of colors coming from it, such as blue, green, etc..He also told me it would move up and down, when it got close to the cloud cover it would change to all the different colors, but when it dropped back down at a lower level the color changed to a orange. The chap also said the object seemed to take it&apos;s time moving up and down, watching the ring still circling the main body of whatever this was.The witnesses dog at this time actually took a bite at his owners foot, as it was frightened of what was going on. The witness was phoning from a friends home and the dog was still acting up. There was no sound heard from the object. I also asked if he could give me a rough idea of how big this thing was, he replied that it was approx: the size of a dinner plate from the distance of 4 to 6 blocks from his location. The sighting lasted for about 5 minutes, before it disappeared. But while I was still chatting to the fellow on the phone he gave out a loud cry and said there was a bright white streak of light from where the object has been observed. He also said a short trail of some of the colors I mentioned above was coming off it as it disappeared.

Anyway, the fire ball travelled from North by Northeast to a Southwest by Southerly direction, initially it was bright red like the Japanese WW II symbol only on fire with a fiery tail.  It then turned a bright Light green color which was flourescent.  This all lasted 2 minutes near the town of New Salem of of I-72.  I was travelling east bound and the sky was relatively clear with many stars.  But what really caught my eye was the fact that it was slower than a shooting star.  Lats it was BIG, I mean I estimate the head end to be at least 100 feet in diamter and the tail to be 200-50 ft long.  There were no sounds.

Actually, from my main viewing position on my third floor apartment balconey, my view to the north and west is obscured by my building.I have not yet been able to find anyone else who saw the objects at that time, or have not seen any reports in any media.

We also have had the thought that maybe we saw something that we shouldn&apos;t have.  On this evening My wife, mother-in-law,myself, and our two sons went out for a drive, not really going anywhere we found ourselves just north of Pawnee Ok.  I noticed some lights coming from the west side of the road and slowed the car to take a closer look at what I thought was spot lights from a low flying helicopter.  Which in its self was a strange sight for us to see, at first there were two spot lights shining on the pasture as if looking for something.  So I stopped to watch for a moment,  then one light shut off, as it came closer the light was shined upon our car and continued until the object was very close.  At this time the light was turned off and we realized we were observing something not known to us.  It was a very moon lit night and this thing was very large, and very slow moving.  As far as description it had no apparent lights once the spot lights were turned off with the exception of what appeared as some very white small high intensity light that would flash from the left side and zip across the front and flash quickly on the left.  It made no noise and was very visible as it hovered above our car at about 40-50 ft.  It appeared somewhat stealth like in shape with some sort lower level on the belly side.  It had the appearance of metalic structure and was much larger than a home.  Never did it do anything or move in any aggresive manor.  I did not have the nerve to get out of the car but we did watch this thing over us for at least a full five minutes,  another car had pulled up behind us and stopped so I know someone else saw this same thing, but I was shaken by what I was seeing and did not try to talk to them.The final thing that made this so disturbing was several helicoptors came in from the same path and about the same low altitude.  As they approached it started to move to the northeast and within seconds was completely out of sight.  There appeared to be several high flying planes following along the same flight path but this thing moved many times faster than the planes.  I don&apos;t know why I have decide to share this now as most people will not beleive it anyway, but we are still bothered by this to this day without resolve of what we saw.  We watch everything that comes on television about UFO&apos;s in the hope that somewhere someone will have a picture of something similar but so far we have seen nothing that even remotely resembles this thing.  In my mind it is still impossible for something this large and metalic just to float there, a stones throw above my head for so long and then leave with speed I have never witnessed before.  I can&apos;t explain it but maybe there are others that have been witness to something like this and like myself feel they cannot tell anyone. I feel deceived as I beleive someone knows what these things are.((NUFORC Note:  We will invite the other witnesses to submit their respective reports, as well, together with illustrations.

I was alerted by my security light going on down below my beach condo which is on the beach.  I went out onto my deck and could not see any person or thing that triggered the security light.  It was a clear night full of stars.  I was attracted to a brilliant bright light about 35 degrees to the South West out approximately 2,000 yard out over the beach.  All I could see at the moment was the bright light.  At first I thought it was a star but then realized it was too large and too close.  It hovered for a few minutes then started to dim.  As it dimmed I could see all kinds of colored light eminating out from the center.  As it dimmed I could see a diamond shape object that immediately took off directly to the West over the ocean.  A few seconds it returned and then I saw two objects the same size and brillience.  I grabbed my digital camera and started to take pictues.  I then grabbed my 35mm Cannon and took the remaining pictues on the roll.  The second object seemed to dissapear and the first object staged stationary for the remaining of the 35 minute period.  The last object then dimmed, I saw the color triangle and it just took off at an angle and dissapeared to the West.  The size of the triangle object appeared to be the size of a full moon from my vantage point.The next morning I talked to a contractor friend building a home next to mine.  He told me he was out flying in his Cessna 174 around the same time the previous night and said the object headed directly for him and caused him to dive down to the ocean level and return to the Oceanside Airport.I sent the digital pictures to a company in Irvine to be analyzed.  I was amazed to see the color triangle and a what appeared to be a beam of light from the object to the ocean.  I developed the 35mm pictures but there was nothing but a bright light image on about six pictures.  I sent them off to Irvine and I was told that the same light eminating from the object to the ocean appeared to hit the lense of my 35mm camera.

I stopped to get some Chinese food. I got my order, walked to my car and I got a feeling to look up because of the very clear blue sky that day. I looked up into the blue and stared for about 3 sec. and there they were, 4 ufo&apos;s flying in formation/parallel, white and disk shaped. There were two in front and two in back . The two in back were a distance from each other. They came to a stop for a second or two and quickly returned to the formation. They were high in the blue sky. Higher than the chemtrail planes. They were not F-16&apos;s, Drones or any conventional aircraft I&apos;ve ever seen. There was no sound or sonic booms. They were cruising from North to South at a slow pace. I grabbed my 8mm video camera to get a shot and lost the sight of them in the blue. I had a good visual for about 8 seconds and the feeling I got was that they had authority to obsurve.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous, so we are unable to contact him, and request permission to view the tape.

(a suburb of Seattle), and on the early evening (dusk) of Feb. 07th, 2003, I was wating for the sky to get dark enough so I could do some star gazing with my binocs and telescope.  At about 18:20 I went out side to check the sky&apos;s darkness.  We had clear weather that day, so the sky was cloudless. I could see several major planets like Jupiter and Saturn shinning through the darkening blue skys, but no stars were visible yet.  From the back yard I looked over the top of my house and a bright object was flying at a high declination in the sky over my house.  It looked like the ISS (International Space Station) flying by Seattle, which it was scheduled to due on Feb. 7th.  So I got my binocs and followed it across the sky until it set in the east.  It approached from the west.  But when I checked the NASA ISS sightings web site, it said that the ISS Seattle flyover was scheduled for 19:24 that night, an hour and 15 mnutes later.  The only other thing I can think that it was, was the Russian Supply Ship Progress, which had been docked with the ISS since the Tuesday before, or it was something unexplained.  I sent an e-mail inquiry to NASA about went the supply ship was due to return to earth, but have not yet received a response.   Another possibilty is that the posted times on the ISS Sightings web site was in error, but I never found that to be the case in terms of the times ISS flies over Seattle..  Just was wondering if any one had any infomation on this in terms of whether this was the Russian Supply Ship Progress or the ISS, and whether anyone may have seen what I saw.((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness witnessed, but the Heavens-above.com website states that it does not indicate those events which occur during daylight hours, or close to daylight hours.  Hence, the object may have been the ISS, and the flyover was not shown as being &quot;visible&quot; during the earlier pass.  We saw the ISS on the same night.

At that point they flew in what I would assume in a direction leaving the atmosphere and disappeared.

The DJ had video taped the event and at a later date I did see it on the show Sightings along with an interview with that DJ.

We thought it might have been a shooting star but we don&apos;t believe there were supposed to be any meteor showers. Also, shooting stars are usually not as big as the object we saw and they usually die out after a few minutes (like a streak across the sky). This object was different.

This happened on a late Friday afternoon as we were off duty and preparing for the weekend. Guys were packing, showering, rushing around, when all of a sudden some guy says &quot;good Lord look out your windows&quot;.  So everyone pushed their way to windows and to see a huge gunmetal grey craft just hanging low in the sky near the radar. I&apos;m not good at measurements and distance but it was no more than a football field away. There was no sound coming from the craft and around the edge were colored rotating windows/lights. Everyone who was outside the barracks were just standing transfixed with their mouths hanging open as were those inside looking from the windows. I have no idea how many guys were there I&apos;m guessing at least 100. This event lasted 10 minutes at the most and the craft shot away in a flash. What a buzz of chatter afterwards. Someone who worked at the radar station phoned to see what was going on and to explain what we had just seen. They answered that nothing showed up on the radar and to forget what we just saw and not talk about it. I don&apos;t remember much talk about it after the weekend. I never did forget. It was a spectacular sight to see a craft so close in bright daylight and not so easily dismissed by me.

PD))", "Object in high orbit that looked like a satelite, yet was able to make tight turns and abrupt stops before vanishingOne evening I was outside having a cigarette and looking up at the night sky, trying to spot a satalite in orbit. After a few minutes I caught the familiar sight of a satalite, looking just like a normal star with the exception that this was moving. It seemed like any other satalite I&apos;ve ever seen. It was moving at a typical speed, it&apos;s color was solid white and it was moving straight line in a south easterly direction. After watching it for about 30 seconds it began to cross through the constellation of Orion. It was approaching Orion&apos;s belt and should have passed just above it, but not through it. As it passed above the third star in the belt it began to change course and slow down. It made a clean 180 degree arc through the belt and actually stopped just under the center star in the belt. I thought my eyes were playing tricks with me. Then it began to move again, this time in a straight line to the north. After about 5 seconds it slowed and stopped again. I was in total disbelief of what I was seeing. It started to move again, this time slowly arcing from a westward heading to an easterly heading before stopping. Once more it began to move, only this time very slowly in a straight line going south. Then it stopped once more. After a few seconds it seemed to get brighter before it just vanished.I have told this story to a few people who all tell me it was just a satelite, but this was no satelite. Though I may not know lots about satelite design and propulsion I can tell you this. No satelite can make such extreem changes in it&apos;s heading. It is impossible. Though some can change heading it is only minor changes, not tight arcs and course reversals. It is also impossible for a satelite to stop dead in it&apos;s tracks. There are two reasons for this. First, it needs to maintain a minimum of about 18,000 MPH to stay in orbit, otherwise it will fall back to Earth. Second, the &quot;g&quot; forces that were inflicted on this craft are enormous. To go from about 18,000 MPH to a dead stop in seconds would flatten our fragile satelites and liquify any astronauts if it were piloted by a human. Though I can&apos;t say it was not of this earth, it did break all the rules that govern it. Whatever it was or was not, I found it beautiful to watch!((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We saw many lights other then the large red light.  There was at least one green light and many white lights.  My brother stopped the car just after we had passed under the object. He got out of the car to get a better view, but I could see it fine over my shoulder out of my window.  I remember hearing a very loud &quot;jet engine&quot; type of sound.

So I would really appreciate some more explanation if you could provide so.Also as I mentioned it vanished from the air in less than a minute which is quite unlikely for a jet trail since they persist for a longer duration because of the density differences of the water which isejected out and the atmosphere.Thanks and regards  ((name deleted))((END))", "Fireball shape object over the Black Sea shoreIt was a warm and absolutely clear, typical southern late evening on the Black Sea resort, on the shore of the calm Black Sea. The small village (Novo &ndash;Mikhailovka, 30 miles West of Tuapse) positioned in the center of the small sea gulf and our camp (summer camp of Polytechnic Institute of Leningrad) occupied the shoreline right behind the pebble beach of the Black Sea. My girlfriend and I walked down the beach about &frac34; of the mile towards the narrow shore and tall cliff with very rocky beach. Not too far from the beach (2-3 meters into shallow water) there was a square shape rock about 2x2x2 meters. It was really fun to climb on that rock and sit on its warm surface, slowly giving away its warmth accumulated during hot and sunny day.Typical for that area and time of the evening, sky was almost black and stars were bright and vivid,  no city lights. The horizon was barely seen against the sky, almost black against black background. The landscape of that area consist of hills and valleys, on the left (from my position on the rock facing the camp and gulf) I was able to see the beginning of the cliff. Straight ahead in the distance of 1 to 3 miles were hills, covered 1/4 on the horizon. At the foot of the hill I could see some lights from the small buildings and from our camp, stretched along the shoreline. It was dark, but I could see some elements of landscape and was able to judge the distances, thanks to the bright stars and very small lights from the camp. In addition I was well familiar with this area, it was my third summer I spend at this camp as the member of scud diving team. It was no wind and very calm. No sounds, except really faded sounds of music from the dance court in the distance.Suddenly, I noticed rather bright object, moving silently from the left to right below the hilltops. The object I can describe as the &quot;fireball.&quot;  It had the size of the medium size moon. It was glowing and had the reddish in the center and yellowish colors to the outer diameter. It was slowly moving through the sky and was visible on the backgrounds of the hills. But it did not illuminate any area under it.  It had a visible diameter and shape of the round ball. I can roughly estimate its diameter as 4 to 10 miters Therefore the distance from me and to the object, and the fact that it was seen against the hills (known distance of several miles to the furthest hills) could be determined as 2/3 to 2 miles. It was slowly following the descending trajectory, slow and steady. It than quietly disappeared, I would say landed, in the woods within the hills, 1-2 miles from the shore. (The hillsides are covered with thick and mixed southern trees and bushes and it was practically impos sible to get to that area. The next day we made an attempt to find the place of where it could fall or lend, but could not find any signs of object.) The most unusual in movement and appearance of the object was the position of the tale of &quot;flames,&quot; which if it were a normal falling object or burning meteorite would follow the trajectory of the fall.  In reality the tale was turned about 10 -15 o counterclockwise, pointing the end of the tile to 8 o&rsquo;clock position, and DID NOT FOLLOWED the trajectory like blown fire tale would normally be. That was very strange to watch such an unnatural movement. The tale size was about &frac12; of the diameter of the object in length and 1/3 of the diameter thick. The whole object had a shape of the mirror image of the punctuation mark, colon, rotated with the round point to the right and the tale to the left.The object, at my opinion, was obviously not a meteorite: it moved too slowly for the falling meteorite. The distance of couple of miles or less from the moment I register it in my field of view to its disappearance in the hills this object being seen for 2-3 minutes. It moved really slowly. It also had a visible diameter and shape. And the most important, the position of the &quot;flaming&quot; tale,  it should follow the direction of the trajectory, but it was not; it was rotated down, counterclockwise 10 -15 degrees.", "I was walking my dog after i&apos;d put the children to bed when i saw it,  was huge a great fireball((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

(HBCC UFO Note: The Skeena River widens out a lot at this point and can be up to two miles or more across the valley as it heads to the ocean). The object itself was dark in color, or black.Again what caught the attention of the motorists was the bright lights which were seen on the bottom of the object. Two large, almost rectangular lights could be seen glowing from the bottom of the object. Also they said it moved so very slowly which they found really strange. When I talked with the husband, he said he wanted to pull over to get a better look as he was driving, but his wife was frightened, crying and &quot;insisted&quot; that he keep going and quickly. No noise again was reported coming from the object, but the couple were in their car travelling around Highway #16. It was certainly a disk shaped craft. He also mentioned that there were other vehicles on the road at the time, (not many) and someone else must have seen it. The sighting lasted for approx: a minute and a half at the most from what he told me. I asked the husband roughly how high the object was off the ground as it travelled. He said it was high enough to clear all the mountains in the area. (HBCC UFO Note: On this route from Prince Rupert to Terrace you travel straight through the West Coast Mountain range which is very rugged. I am not sure as to the elevation where this event took place, but it would have to be around 2500 to 3000 feet. I will be checking this out as well. I plan to meet with all of the witnesses just as soon as the weather cooperates.Anyway, this gives everyone an idea of what just took place, three reports, one coming from Vancouver Island, Kitimat and in between Terrace &amp; Prince Rupert all on the same night. Plus there is not a lot of time difference between each of the sightings. When I meet with these folks I will see if they can draw a rough sketch of what they saw, and of course try to get a lot more detail on these sightings.

I was under the impression the man was in some sort of shock, but I knew this guy , and I beleive he was creditable. I thought to myself, maybe he seen something that was explainable. I went home that morning ( Sunday ), and told my wife. She just thought I was crazy, and it was some sort of made up story by this certain person. On Monday, the next day. I seen this production worker again, he was at his second job, being a resturant cook, across from the news paper where we both worked. I said to him seen anything strange last night? He then got this look on his face, and said &quot; look I know it sounds weird, but I am not lying, I seen something crazy, and I can&apos;t get it out of my head&quot;. Me, being his boss, and trying to get my own grip on his story, I told him to deal with it, your a big boy. I myself have never seen anything that I couldn&apos;t explain, but this person had me wondering? That evening I was at my home, also in Sandusky, my wife came home after work, with this look of dispare on her face. I asked what&apos;s wrong, are you sick? She then kept! saying to me &quot; It&apos;s real, your right something is out there&quot;. I said to her what are you talking about? She then went on to tell me about, this woman she works with at her office, who&apos;s husband is a police officer in Sandusky, receive a call Saturday night about something on the shore of the lake, by Battery Park. I said to my wife, what happened? She said, her friends husband, and two other police officer&apos;s went to the shore to investigate something on the shore. Two officers went down on the shoreline with flash light to see what was the matter, the other officer stayed up top of the shoreline. At this time, my wife&apos;s friends husband, radio the station to say that there was nothing on shore an that the three officers where going back to their car&apos;s. As the two officers climbed up the shoeline, the officer up top,said look what is that! As the other two officers looked around, and said to the officer up top of the shoreline, what? The three Sandusky police officers seen a green/blueish object off shore, and it seemed to be hovering or sitting on top on the lake. To say the least, these three officers were shaken, and radio to the station franticly about what they were seeing off shore, right now. I said to my wife, who was still in some sort of ( I can&apos;t beleive it&apos;s true ) type of demeanor,what happened next. She said the officers got the hell out of there quick! She said it shook up the three officers so much, when they told there watch commander, they were up set with what they had seen, their watch commander, or the chief of police made all take 3 day&apos;s off from work. I couldn&apos;t beleive what I was hearing. My wife a church going ( non-beleiver, of the paranormal and ufo stuff ) was acting like the world was going to end. I said I wanted to talk with her freiends husband, I had known him for years, and ask him about what he and the other officers had seen that night. My wife with no hesitation said no, he was scared and told his wife &quot; I just want to forget it&quot;. I ask my wife, what does your friend at the office say about her husbands incident? She said her friend was scared, and had never seen her husband act like that, and that what those officers had seen was real.With an incident like that, and credible wittness like these 4 people, I must admit, something must of had happen that night&hellip;((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We have not talked to anyone else who saw these objects at this same time.  My husband has seen similar objects before in this same area.  This was my first sighting, and it was the most remarkable, awe inspiring thing I have ever seen and hope to see it again.The objects were very bright lights that seemed to be round and of numerous beautiful colors: pink, blue, yellow, white, purple, green.  They were not all lit at the same time.  One would go off and one or more others would come on.  After the light went off at each sight, we could see small, dim white lights flowting around that area.  Then there would be a break of 5 to 10 minutes and the round, colored objects would appear again in a different spot in the sky.  The most dramatic display was a line of six in a row.  They would take turns going on and off and the most lit at one time was three.  We could see the shadow of those that were off when the others would light.  This went on for maybe 10-20 seconds before they all disappeared.  All would be dark and then it would start over with one or two lighting at one time in a different area. We viewed them from about 19:00-20:00 hours.  Then there was a half hour before we saw two more.  That was the last we saw of them. They seemed to dart around, moving very fast from one location to another. Shortly after we saw the first two or three we also noticed 5 airplanes seeming to be following them.  We saw other planes but they didn&apos;t seem to be interested in these objects.  The five planes however seemed to try and stay with or near the objects.  When all the objects disappeared, so did the planes.((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS))Similar sighting seen and reported on this site by others from WisconsinI reported this earlier and may have had the date wrong.

It was over the tree line, not sure of distance, and it moved very slowly, what I would guess as about 20 to 40 MPH. The crickets stopped chirping as this thing moved.

It wasnt a cloud because it was moving in a different dirrection as in the way the earth was rotating. It wasnt one of those plan theat leave the smoke behind either. So my first 2 thoughts that it couldnt be them so i thought UFO!! Well i starting yelling at my mom look next to the sun (since thats were this craft or object was located). Of corseshe starting yellin back at me I cant look at the sun im driving.

First it went up at a 45 degree angle, then made this tight loop, then moved straight across (west to east), then another turn to reverse its direction to go back the same way it came, only lower, then down with the large (ground based) spot light trying to follow it all the while.

The diameter of the cylinder was about one quarter of the diameter of the sphere and projected straight back parallel to the direction of flight for about two or three sphere diameters. I thought to myself that the cylinder was the power source driving the sphere forward.

As it became larger, we could see more and more light showers coming from the top and bottom.  The light showers coming from the top of the object were white light colored and projected from the top in a spraying pattern similar to dotted lines or machine gun tracers.

For a while it traveled horizontally in the same direction we were traveling and we could see what appeared to be flashing light patterns criss-crossing the body of the object similar to static electricity experiments.  The lights were flashing in diagonals criss-crossing from both directions.  The object appeared to stop and hover (paralleling us, but still far south of us) and drop behind our position as we continued traveling eastbound.  However, on several occasions, the object appeared to suddenly move eastbound to a! positio n ahead of our direction, and then hover for awhile.  On a couple of occasions, the object seemed to turn.  On one of these occasions, it appeared to look like a full saucer-shape, and we saw it out-lined completely as red and green lights lit up across the saucer-shape, blinking on and off as they came across the saucer.  We watched this phenonenon for over a hour.  As we came into Milwaukee, the object was still paralleling us.  We saw a plane circling from the northeast, taking off from the airport and believe that someone from that plane surely had to see this object also.  At this time, it became dawn, approximately 6:30a.m., and the object suddenly began to climb rapidly southeastward at a 70 degree angle until it was once again just a small dot in the sky and disappeared into a bank of dark clouds.  My husband, daughter, and I all watched the object and concluded it was definitely neither a plane nor a helicopter.", "Low flying object hovering w/ blue underbelly and eight bright lights oval in shape central FloridaI was heading from Orlando to Ft. Lauderdale and was traveling on Route 60 which connects the Florida turnpike to route 95. The connecting road is about 25 miles and was about 9 miles on route 60 towards route 95 when I noticed blinking lights up the road. Just thought they were lights on a pole but as I got closer, the lights were hovering over the other side of the road. The object was hovering about two or three times the height of a light pole and was about 3 or 4 times the size of my car. The object was oval, almost rectagular with curved corners. I only viewed it from the underside but it had an oval underbelly that glowed a dull teal blue and had two horizontal bands that also appeared blue but a bit darker. The bands on the underbelly appeared to structures within the oval underbelly. There were 8 bright lights that surrounded the blue convex underbelly. The 8 white lights were very bright and went on and off with a regular cycle and alternated with the blue underbelly light that went on and off alternately with the white lights. The white lights would be on then total blackness, then the blue underbelly oval light ( very dull ) then total darkeness then the white lights. It did move a bit to my left and at an angle as I approached. Unfortunately, I had just passed a slow moving vehicle and there was no breakdown lane and also a ditch on each side of the road, so I could not pull over to get a better look, without causing an accident with the car that I just passed, although, that car must have seen the object. There was just nowhere to pull over at that time. One last thing, I noticed a punjent slightly burning oder in my car after I passed it, very subtle.", "Mother Ship?I was travelling west on hwy #4, I had just turned from hwy #24. (about 10 miles S. from Collingwood Ont.) It was a clear night, with tons of stars.  I woke my son who was sleeping in the front seat to witness this.  This object, it was positively masssive, blotted out the whole night sky!  It travelled in a south westerly direction for a few moments - then, at hypersonic speed disappeared.  I have studied UFOs since I was a child, and I&apos;ve seen quite a few - never in awe, surprised, or dismayed of any sighting - but this was spectacular.  The size of this object is difficult to estimate; but it had to be at least the size of 4 football fields - it blotted out all the stars in the sky!((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Still can&apos;t believe I&apos;m telling this but here goes. Around 12/07/02, at approximately 2330 hours, I observed a very bright, tear drop shaped object, travel from north to south across the eastern sky in relation to my position. The odd thing was that it appeared to travel in an upwards direction and then blinked out of sight. Duration was approx. 1.5 seconds. It was bright white in color and the light tailed behind it or at least appeared to. It is difficult to say since it was travelling so fast. I first chalked it up to something skipping off our atmosphere. Which perhaps is true.The thing is, I saw the same thing this past weekend, around 01/16/03, at approximately 0230 hours. This one was in the same general area of the sky as before. Except it appeared to travel upwards from south to north, ie: opposite direction.I am not sure what I have been seeing, but these two are not the only strange objects I&apos;ve seen in the sky recently. I work outside at night so I occasionally see objects. These have all caught my eyes as I have been driving. So at least to me they are very noticeable. They have all lasted long enough to get a reasonable look at them. At last eye exam I tested around 20/10, plus I have a stygmatism on top of that, so I&apos;m correctable to even better. Since I spend most of my time in the hours of darkness, perhaps my eyes are more sensitive to movement and light in the sky, and I&apos;m just seeing more of the junk that&apos;s hitting the atmosphere than most others can see. Who knows. I am a college educated professional. I have doubted this stuff, but man, when you see weird stuff you can&apos;t explain, it bothers you and you really can&apos;t tell anyone about it. Especially with what I do for a living, supposed to be the unflappable one. Some who read this will understand what I&apos;m saying with that last statement and wanting to remain anonymous. Anyhow, I see this stuff probably at least once a week over the skies north of Sioux Falls, SD. I see meteorites almost nightly, so I generally notice when somethings a little different.Well there you have it, hope this helps some people tell what they have seen.

The disaster happened over Texas, I live in Massachusetts where I watched repeated video footage filmed about an hour earlier.This coverage was repeated several times while some spokesperson got their act together enough to say something. So I had ample time to study the video footage.I went channel surfing and got a channel that was showing the same footage as I was previously watching; BUT, this footage showed about five seconds more coverage at the beginning.With this earlier coverage I saw the smoking space craft travel past a disc shaped object whose diameter was about 3/4 the width of the contrail the shuttle was leaving in it&apos;s wake. The lighting of this object wasn&apos;t quite as bright as the shuttle and contrail. This appeared to the far right of my TV screen and the shuttle at this time wasn&apos;t appearing to be breaking apart.The object appeared below the contrail and would have been obscured if the network logo was being displayed at that time.The camera operator was apparently focused on the shuttle tracking it&apos;s flight trying to keep the subject centered in midscreen. Therefore the UFO disappeared off to the right of the screen as though it had no motion at all.Two days later I saw another UFO in close proximity to Columbia. This footage was reputed to have been videotaped in Nevada by an Air Force camera and the pre-dawn sky was darker in comparison to the footage shot over Texas.In the Air Force release I saw two brilliant spots of diffused light seperated from one-another. The light on the right traveling left toward the second light was leaving a contrail. The light on the left stayed stationary and the light on the right appeared to be on a collision. The camera operator went to wide lens and continued the coverage then when collision seemed imminent; coverage ceased.No mention was made of this bizarre display and neither scene has been shown since.That makes two UFO&apos;s I&apos;ve seen in proximity to the shuttle Columbia.Through my connections I&apos;ve heard that six others have experienced similiar sightings.", "There was a white dot traveling very fast, zipping from one point to another very fast.", "An oval ball of light hovering thereMe and my Dad went to this one Motel for a few days.

The street leading away (east) from the station dipped into a severe valley, up the other side and then flattened out for the trip into the town itself.  As I approached the downward (eastward direction) side of the valley I noticed, perpherially, a semi-gloss, silver, saucer shaped object with a slight dome on top.  The dome was one-third the thickness of the saucer which I estimated to be 40 to 50 feet in diameter and (including dome)about 15 to 20 feet tall from the bottom to the dome top.  The bottom of the saucer was flat and unremarkable.  The saucer was traveling from my left to right (north to south) and was following the contour of the valley.  It seemed to be traveling at about 30 miles per hour.  It was totally silent. There were muted red and blue lights circling the perimeter of the saucer.  I could not tell if the entire saucer was rotating or just the light rotating around it. As I approached the bottom of the valley, so did the saucer.  I brought my car to a stop and jumped into a ditch as it looked as if we were going to meet at the bottom.The saucer passed approximately 25 to 30 feet above and to the east of me and blotted out a full moon in the process of following the valley southward toward the Tennessee River and The Power System Service Shops of The United States Tennessee Valley Authority in addition to Wilson Dam, a hydro-electric facility built around World War II.

This thing was huge. And were miles from the foothill at that moment.  We turned the van around and got on the main road again to head towards the foothills.

HBCC UFO Note: The couple of days ago I reported that three blue/white lights in a triangular shape were witnessed by a Canfor sawmill employee flying very low over top of him. The object moved very quickly and disappeared over one of Houston, B.C. local mountains. This sighting took place on February 3, 2003 at approx: 8:10.p.m.Today, February 9, 2003 I went to visit a close friend. While sitting around talking he told me that his brother has witnessed something very strange on February 3, 2003, in the morning between 8:00 &amp; 8:10 a.m. Of course my ears perked up when I heard the date of the sighting, and I asked my friend if he would call his brother and ask if it would be ok to come over to take his report on what he saw. He agreed and I soon left my buddies home and headed over to look into this new report.First of all, I would like to point out that the fellow who gave me his account of events, does not really believe in UFOs, or visitors from else where. I also know this fellow very well, and both himself and his wife are well respected in the community of Houston.The witness to the early morning sighting works for Houston Forest Products which is one of two large and very modern sawmills. At the time of his sighting he was operating a heavy machine in the log yard when a &quot;extremely&quot; bright yellow/orange light caught his attention. The source of the light was coming from the northern side of Pea Cock Mountain, which is at the south end of the forest companies property. There was a low lying fog in the valley that morning but from his position he could see the fog had only gone part ways of the mountains, so it was laying very low. After he saw the intense light, he saw what he first thought was a helicopter, but wondered why it had such a bright light on it, then after a couple of seconds went by he thought it couldn&apos;t be a helicopter due to the size of it.The description he gave me of this object was as follows, the object at a distance of approx: 2 kilometers ( or less) away up on the side of Pea Cock Mountain on a logged off area, sat either hovering, or &quot;sat on the ground&quot; for approx: 40 seconds. The witness said the color of the object was a light gray/white. And the color was changing, as if it was translucent (almost as if it was flickering in and out). The craft was oval is shape with this bright yellow/orange light dead center at the bottom of the object. As the witness sat watching it, it rose up only a little, and flew to the south heading to the top of Pea Cock Mountain. But before it even came close to the top of the mountain, and with no obstructions in between the witness and the craft it completely disappeared. Or as they say, blinked out.Now I find this interesting because of two reports on the very same day, one in the morning and evening in pretty much the same area.HBCC UFO Note: Monday morning I will be stopping into the local helicopter business, in which there is two of. I want to see if they were flying that morning, or around the time of the sighting. I also will stop in and see if the forestry knows of any logging operations going on at the sighting location. Plus I may have to dig out the snowshoes and take a short hike to look around the area for any possible signs that something may have been there. It has not snowed in a while here, so if anything had got close to the ground, or even landed, there should be signs of this taking place.  I will keep everyone posted on this case. Also I am just going to post a computer graphic on my site to give you an example of what this thing looked like. My wife recreated it from the drawing the witnesses supplied.

I had just graduated from high school two months earlier. Since this incident, I have written and published a book on automotive subjects, written for automotive magazines, and helped produce an automoitve television show.I was returning from my friend&apos;s home after working on his race car all evening. It was a week night, and I felt pretty good about our accomplishments for the evening. I turned onto the road that leads to my house, when I noticed a large bright orange glowing object in the sky. At first I thought it was the moon, but when I made eye contact with this object it began following me. I turned onto an access road to my subdivision, and when I turned, the craft (or object) had moved to the corner of the intersection.I continued slowly down the street and the craft slowly moved in front of me and lowered its altitude to approximately 100 feet above the ground. At this distance, the object appeared to be approximately 20 to 30 feet in diameter, and there were two satellites moving around the object. One from the upper left hand corner, and the other from the lower left hand corner, both circumnavigating the object in a flash of sparks (similar to how a sparkler burns). It seemed like the satellites were moving along a guide that was attached to the exterior of the craft, but I couldn&apos;t physically see a guide. The paths of the satellites remained constant throughout the encounter..The night sky around me -- that was moonless -- was illuminated in a bright golden light, while the areas around me were bathed in darkness. I stopped and exited my car ( a white 1969 Camaro SS) and stood watching the craft -- motionless and without any trace of sound -- for what seemed like an eternity. When I realized that I was involved in a stalemate, I got back in my car, turned the corner and continued to the next street. The craft continued its movement along with my car and stopped with me at the next stop sign, only now the craft was approximately 50 feet from the ground, and dangerously close to telephone poles that line the street. I turned, continued to my driveway and pulled my car into the garage. I walked out of the garage to see the craft hovering over my home, and once again it followed me to my front door. I sat on my front step and watched the craft for about five minutes. The entire time I felt no fear, only wonderment at what I was witnessing. At this point I went into my home to retrieve my dad&apos;s car keys. I left the house, still watching the craft over my home. I got in my dad&apos;s car to move it into the driveway, and watched as the craft contiued down my street. I gave chase with my dad&apos;s car, around the corner to the neighborhood ball field. I watched the craft descend through the trees onto the ball field, now flashing the same golden light in sequence around the craft. I felt a seismolgic event as it touched down and the lights went out. When the lights went out I saw what appeared to be a door opening on the craft. At this point, I raced my dad&apos;s car back home went inside and locked every window and door that wasn&apos;t secured. I called the local air force base, but they blew me off and the next day contacted Dr. Alan Hynek and filed a report. The entire time I watched this object there did not seem to be any portals or doors visible, nor were there any visible signs that such things existed, and to this day I wonder what I would have seen had I stayed longer.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was a warm and sunny day and I saw a metalic, egg-shaped vehicle that must have been about the size of a car, it was strange.", "Sighting &amp; Possible abductionHi, I live in Phoenix Arizona. Here is the accounts of my life since the first sighting. First Sighting: In 1983 or 84 I was at my house at 36th Street and Lupine. We were the back house in a very dark culdisac. It was very dark there and easy to watch the night skies. My stepsister and I noticed three stars above the McDowell Mountains just east of Scottsdale Airport that appeared to be moving very slightly. I don&apos;t know how high up they were but it was high. We discussed how they couldn&apos;t be helicopters because there wasn&apos;t any sound from the blades. We also discussed that they couldn&apos;t be planes because the were staying in one spot. They were in a triangle type formation. They looked to be teetering or swaying weightlessly. When we noticed this we immediatly knew we were looking at something very different. They hovered above us silently for about two minutes. Then one of them shot off to the south like a bullet and it was gone. These were the fastest things I have ever seen to this day. The other two hovered a while longer and then one zipped off into the east. The one that remained hovered for about 30 seconds and then it went straight up until we could no longer see it. We were overwhelmed at what we witnessed. You just know when you see something like that what it is and you know inside what you have seen, it&apos;s like they connect with you somehow. We later watched the news and saw reports of people calling in seeing what we had seen. My life forever changed after that night. I began to have feelings of insight or intuition as I call it. The night of my time loss: I was at a party in the desert with some freinds and it was getting late so decided that it was time to leave. Nobody would give me a ride back into town so I started to walk. I walked a distance about half way to town and I noticed the sky above me began to pulse an intense blue flashing strobe and I don&apos;t remember anything after that or losing any time but that 30 minute walk took 2 hours longer than it should have. I know I lost about two t! o three hours and arrived just outside of town, how did I walked that far without knowing it. That was a very scary night. I began to get migrains after that night that hurt so bad I would almost pass out and vomit. I had never even had a headache before that night. It&apos;s all very strange and confusing. I have predicted things like putting on my seatbelt 10 seconds before my wife and I were involved in an accident, I had a feeling something was about to happen and put on the seatbelt real fast and the next thing I know we were involved in a pretty serious accident. I was with a freind at a late night movie asked him for some strange reason to look up at the lights and at that exact moment the entire parking lights(about 50) all shut off at that second. Even I was freaked out by this, I don&apos;t know why I asked him to look at them, I just did and that still trips me out. There are many more occassions where these types of things happened to me.  Recently we were at Lord of the Rings Two Towers and I had a feeling something was wrong at home, I leaned over during the movie and I asked my wife if she left the Christmas lights on at home because it was a three hour movie, I was sensing or worrying about fire. When we arrived at  home I found a candle my step-daughter had left burning on her desk shelf and it was starting to burn the shelf above, my wife was amazed by this! It might seem trivial, but something as simple as driving someplace, feeling when to leave with my intuition and I experience no traffic and make it through every green light. Does anyone else experience these types of things? I was able to start putting computers together without any knowledge of them. I automatically knew how they worked and I instantly knew how to build them. There are many more things I have experienced but it would take all day to write them down, and I feel very strange writing about this. It feels better to finally get this off my chest.

We have assigned an arbitrary date in June 1983, assuming that it may have been summertime that the witness would have been walking a long distance at night.

It was still a night sky and the stars were crystal clear.  Within a 30 second time period it seemed as though the sun was rising and then the sky was as bright as dawn, I could see my town and the house tops of Augusta.  5 seconds later I saw a ball about 600 feet in the sky flying overhead towards Augusta.  The UFO flew steady and straight maintaining a constant speed and direction and then once over Augusta made what seemed to be a 90 degree angle and bolted off towards Whitefield.  Within 30 seconds the light had vanished and 30 seconds later I could see the clear, dark starry night.To back this sighting up, here is more evidence.  My uncle was up at the same time in Farmingdale getting ready to go hunting.  He was in his living room and noticed the light coming in through his roof windows and then noticed the same ball of light going over head towards Hallowell.   As is passed by the lit up area then faded again and he could see the darkness again and eventually the stars.  I was a Junior in Highschool at this time and my uncle an archetect.((NUFORC Note:  The witness indicates that the date is correct, but we are pursuing that issue.

In a very surprising instant we both observed what appeared to be an astrological event in the eastern sky. A large, bright object that seemed to to me to be a fireball was descending rapidly from left to right starting at about &quot;12 o&apos;clock&quot; and disappearing at about &quot;5 o&apos;clock&quot; in our field of vision. The object basically followed a very slightly curved path approximately 30-40 degrees from a perpendicular line drawn from the horizon directly in front of us.The size of the object appeared 1/2-2/3 the size of the full moon overhead. It changed color while in view, from bright white to firey yellow to a brilliant iridescent blue/green. My first thought was that it was a large shooting star or meteor, but then I was shocked to see it change it&apos;s size (it become larger) and color. About half way through its descent it begin projecting a tapering trail as its color changed to bright yellow, almost as if there had been an explosion and acceleration in speed. The trail remained yellow as the object then took on a beautiful greenish-blue color just before it disappeared from view. It was not clear whether the object disappeared over the horizon or simply self-extinguished.I estimate the entire elapsed time of viewing was less than five seconds.((NUFORC Note:  Other reports from multiple points in the western U.

I held a night job in Dubuque Iowa, which is about a 30-minute drive from Platteville through mostly rolling hills and farmland.One night at about 1am, during my drive to Platteville from Dubuque, I noticed some lights in the distance going back and forth over an open field. I wondered why a farmer would have his equipment out at that hour, especially in January when there is so much snow on the ground. I was puzzled but I didn&rsquo;t put much thought into it.As I drove down the hills, I would lose sight of the lights but as I came back up I could see them again. There were three colors: white, red and dark yellow/orange. The lights continued to pass back and forth along the countryside. I drove down another hill and lost sight of whatever it was. I was almost back to the school campus, right on the main highway going into the small town of Platteville.Suddenly, the lights were right in the middle of the road, right in front of me!  Not more than 40 feet!  It was hovering over the road and the lights were rotating. I was absolutely terrified! Plus, it was difficult to see. I had to make a choice, either keep driving straight, which would take me directly under it, or make a fast turn onto a winding back road. In a split second, I decided to turn off onto the back road. I was consumed with fear. I just wanted to get away from the lights. I barely used my brakes as I made that turn. I&rsquo;m not sure how I didn&rsquo;t lose control of my car.I kept looking in my rear view mirror to see if the lights were still there. Nothing. I calmed myself down a little and tried to rationalize that whatever I saw was sure to still be on the highway. It must have been a semi or emergency vehicles or something! My heart was still racing, but at the end of the road, instead of making a left to go back to the campus, I decided to make a right turn back around to the highway. There was nothing. No lights, no semi, no emergency vehicles, no farm equipment. Nothing! Surely, if the lights I saw could be attributed to any of these things, I would have still been able to see it from the highway.I will never know exactly what I saw that night. All I know for sure is that I have never felt terror like I did when I had my close encounter.((NUFORC Note:  Date is January 1990 is approximate.

On a call, I watched a storm cloud moving South, low ceiling, coming directly over the city.  A glimmer caught my eye, underniether the storm cloud, of which I observed 5 pill/saucer aircrafts.  The crafts stayed in relatively close proximity of each other.  They would swing out, in a free flight circle pattern.  Each in a different direction.  This would be my best explaination of what thier movements were like:  They had no boundries as to which direction or speed.  The would scramble from a certain &quot;dot pattern&quot;.  As Braille is a series of &quot;dot patterns&quot; to reprent a certain letter/number, the crafts would swing out tens of yards, and return to the central point, and creat a new &quot;dot pattern&quot;.  It was a sort of a communication dance.  I ran to the other room and 5 co workers came over to the window to see.  I pointed the crafts out and we each stood in excited silence.  As they watched, I scanned the storm cloud.  At the very south tip of the could (front edge), I saw a 6th ship entirely motionless, as if supervising the Communication Dance.The shape and color of the ships were interesting as well.  They were a pill shaped, most likely the size of a minivan.  They were at to much of a distance to see any detailed caps, lids, handles, or symbols.  Their undersides were a dark shade, possibly to camoflauge when looking up at them, from underniether a storm cloud.

It was a very clear night.  I was watching a small airplane&rsquo;s lights traveling due west, when I noticed a V-shaped series of white lights above it, moving in the opposite direction (East).  It looked like a boomerang formation of 7 or 9 round lights.  It was higher and less clear than the plane and had a halo around it, as if it was in some thin clouds (perhaps it was).  The V was moving much faster than the airplane - maybe 5 times faster (not accounting for differences in distance from me).  Shortly after I caught sight of it, the V turned right (south).  It did so abruptly and without much of a curve through the turn.  When it changed direction, several of the lights seemed to rearrange themselves - as though they were discreet objects in a formation, not fixed to one single object.  They did so very quickly - spontaneously - to go from a eastbound V to a southbound V.  The wedge flew south into a part of the sky that was bright from city lights, and I lost it.

Being out in the country, the only lights there were were my headlights and mere lights in distant parts of the country that provided no real light on the road, simply dots amongst the horizon.I had never driven this road at night before out of fear that I would hit a deer, but left Houston (my hometown) from Christmas break a little later in the day.  So, I was driving with my body leaned forward, slumped over the wheel, watching the road intensely for any deer or other &quot;wildlife&quot; on the side of the road.  Suddenly, around 7 pm Central time (19:00 hrs), I saw this silver, metallic oval hovering above the road.  I do not remember seeing any lights on the craft, but I did observing what seemed to be a two-part craft with a small part in between the two parts (see diagram).  And then, I drove right under the craft, and I remember looking up, seeing this craft disappear from the view provided from my windshield.  The craft appeared to be the same width as my truck (a little over three feet).  I am not sure whether the craft simply hovered as I drove underneath it, but I do remember thinking about how close it was to my vehicle -- appearing to be a few feet above my truck when I passed it.I tried to look in my rear-view and side windows, but, it was so dark out there that I couldn&apos;t see anything when I looked back.  I drove back to San Angelo and wrote everything down.  I believe in the possibility of UFOs, but I have been hesitant to report this because I wouldn&apos;t normally do anything like this.  But, I do believe that I saw what I saw.  I do have 20/20 vision and my windshield was clean from all obstructions and smears/dirt.  I do not suffer from any mental or physical disorders.  I work for a student newspaper back at my university, and have been trained to detail and observe events, which I think has helped in this report.   At any rate, that is my story.((FOLLOW-UP #1 FROM WITNESS))Mr.Davenport,    Thank you for your response.  To answer your questions, the trip usually takes seven hours from Houston to San Angelo, and my arrival to San Angelo 30 minutes after the event took place put my in town at about seven hours.However, it is funny you should mention the operation of the truck after the event, because when I got back into town, several days later, the alternator went out on me suddenly.  The alternator was changed out over the holiday, so, the job was less than a month old.  The new battery I had put in overthe holiday was also totally &quot;un-charged&quot; and I had to get a new one.  I check to make sure I didn&apos;t leave any lights on or what have you, but I did think it was strange that my vehicle began having some problems.I did not experience any flashbacks however, but emotionally, I was a little tense at the moment I saw the object and for a few minutes shortly after, only because I can tell you that my overactive imagination and viewing of one too many sci-fi movies sort of scared me into thinking I might beabducted out there in the dark countryside and no one would ever know.But, this isn&apos;t the first time I have experienced a UFO before.  My grandparents have a beach house in Galveston, Texas, and some nights during the spring and summer when I am there, I get on the roof of the beach house and peer into space, just looking.  On one occasion, I saw three triangular shaped space craft, grey-silver in appearance, flying in a triangular pattern maybe 30 feet above me.  They had faint white lights on them, but were totally silent.  Then, a second time, I saw another triangle-shaped craft that had brighter white lights on it.  I had taken a police flashlight that my Dad has in his boat and was pointing it into the great dark sky, and soon after, I noticed the craft zoom around in the distance and just disappear.I really don&apos;t have any accurate dates on these, but, they were quite a  sight.I hope I have been able to help.((END #1))((FOLLOW-UP #2))Mr.Davenport,I was absolutly certain that there was no reflection, and I give you permission to include the followup message with the report.

What attracted my attention was the intensity of the light and the flashes, not twinkling like a star as seen through the atmoshpere. It was about 30 degrees above the horizon and did not move and there was no sound. When I looked at the object through my binoculars, red and blue or blue/green flashes could be clearly seen. At about 2330, the object seemed to move away as it got smaller in size and the intensity deminished until it could not be seen. This process happened slowly over a period of about 5 minutes and as it moved away, it only dropped in elevation by 1 or 2 degrees.

At 2345, the object again became visible but was further south and west of its prior position at about 25 degrees above the horizon.

I observed a blue green fireball moving roughly from the NW toward the SE and possibly desending.  It was quite bright and had a firey tail.  It dimmed momentarily and then was bright again.  I lost sight of it behind a hill.  The reason I thought it may be desending is I never saw it reappear from behind the hill. After the sighting I took a better look at the sky.  The sky had a thin layer of clouds with some stars showing. In my opinion the object was below the cloud layer.  My two daughters were in the car with me.  They saw a bright flash which got their attention but did not have a clear view of the object.((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS))Mr. Davenport,I was looking toward the south.  It was moving from right to left.

Then i said see i told you there were ufos in the winter cause we were argueing earleier that we see a lot more in the summer then in the winter.Thene the bright light on it went out and it went away very fast towards Hebron all you could see whene it left was a small red light like it was trying to look like a plain but no plains have bright lights like that bright white light that it had.so my uncle went inside as fast as he could cause it was about 15.below zero out there.Then ten minutes later i was looking out the window and there it was taking the same f! light pa th like it was doing big circles over Hebron like looking for somthing maybe in the woods cause Hebron mostley woods anyway it made the same flight path four more times ass long ass i looked out  i could probley have seen it all night if i wanted but it did not impress me our my uncle anough to stay out in the cold to look at it.Not like alot of the ones we saw in the summer that were pretty close so many sightings last summer that i could not put in a report every time i just know thers alot of activity in the summer in and around South paris Maine.Thankes for listienig", "2-12-03 orange fiery/glowing circular object flying above tree level  watched for about 10 seconds in Shoreline WashingtonIt was around 6pm on Wednesday when my 14 year old daughter asked me what that burning orange light was. I went over to the sliding glass door and looked up. My 11 year old son came with us.What I saw was a moving glowing orange, or could have been burning round object moving at a steady rate of speed and altitude at above tree level. I wear glasses and thought I just could not make out what I was seeing. I ran back into my apartment and grabbed my glasses, my son grabbed his binoculars. Wearing my glases did not help me recognize what I was looking at. Actually it only filled me with more disbelief and questions. My son looked through his binoculars and said that it looked like a spinning top with an antenna on the top of it. I know that sounds so cliche but I honestly have never seen any thing like this before. I did not have time to look through them because it was already out of my line of sight . This object made no sound had no tail. It stayed on what looked like a path to me.If my kids had not seen it as well I would have thought I had lost my mind. I did call 911 jut because of the way things are going with terrorist threats and that. They refered me to th FAA she treated me like I was a nut and sent me to the ufo center.That is what we saw and now I am on more of an alert when I look up into the sky.

We were just cruising the roads and talking.  While they talked I was just staring at the night sky.  I love looking at stars.  Suddenly I seen a strange looking star up in the sky.  It was orange and moving.  I thought nothing of it.  But then it moved in a pattern of a square.  Then it just took off so fast that I couldn&apos;t see it anymore.  I was the only one who saw it.

It seemed that three remainined mostly on, forming the three points of a triangle, and several more lights within the triangle pattern blinked on and off in a strobe like fashion. The lights within the triangular area flashed sporatically and no apparent pattern could be established. It was a moonlit night and although many commercial aircraft had passed over us earlier in the evening, none were noticed at this time. The object(s), to my best estimate was 10-20 miles away and travelling in a northeasterly direction. It seemed that the further it went, the fewer lights were visible. The flashing lights were fairly intense and if they were from a &quot;normal&quot; aircraft, I would expect the aircraft to be much closer to us. There was no noise from the craft. I called the local state police barracks the following morning, but there had been no reports. The officer said that a helicopter had come in to an accident scene, but he didn&apos;t give me specifics as to when or where. I feel confident that this was not any sort of conventional aircraft, a formation of military aircraft, nor any celestial objects. Both my friend and myself are believers in extraterrestrial life, and are also well eductated professionals. This is the first time that we&apos;ve witnessed anything like this. We are open to any explanation, but hope that", "While I with girlfriend and her two children, a boy and girl aged 6 and 7 years, were camping at an abondoned old lumbercamp about a four hour drive north west of Ottawa called the Osburn Depot. We were at least 70 miles away from Otter Lake the nearest town, phones and electicity. We had met a few fishermen on our way about 30 miles before we arived at our destination, as far as we know there was no one else near us.We loved being away from the civialization We were having a great time, we we really roughing it, and enjoyed being away from it all. No bright lights or noise for miles away, a break from it all. The weather was beautiful it was warm and clear, not a cloud in the sky. We swam and fished in the deep water of the John Bull Creek, and gathered firewood for our second night.After putting the kids to sleep in the tent around 11:30 my girlfriend, Gail and I returned to the campfire and sat together talking, and watching the fire. After a few hours we noticed just how clear a night it was and decided to move away from the fire in order to look at the stars. We walked to a nearby shoddy bridge about 30 ft. from our tent and looked towards the heavens. The sky full of stars, galaxies, and planets and the occational jet or satelite streaked across the sky. We knew morning was comming because in the east you could see the sky starting to brighten. The loons started to sing, a sure sign of daybreak.In the eatly morning hours just before day break things started getting weird. I noticed a strange looking light far off in the distance unlike anything eles I ever had seen it seemed to be zig-zaging, so I pointed it out to Gail. It seemed very far away but as we focused on it, we noticed it was comming towards us. It seemed unbelivable it was heading straight for us. I even made a half-hearted joke to Gail about it being a U.F.O but soon we realized it was no joke.I never belived it posible but as we watched suddenly it was 200-300 ft. away it was large and super reflective with lights all around its outer edge that change colors from a deep red to a light yellow in a circular patern and a bright glowing ball on the center of its bottom. It made no noise. It lit the sky around it. I put my hand to my face and could not belive my eyes. Myself and Gail were terified, We were afraid to run and by the size of it, running seemed pointless. Then we noticed futher off on the right and left of the first ship further of there were two more. the sky was yellowish red and you could see the outline of the trees they were behind. We just sat there and looked at it not really knowing what to do. So we did nothing.Next thing we know they are gone, it is no longer daybreak. The sky is dark the loons are no longer singing it is 1:00 A.M. again. We return to the tent and sit by the fire and try and figure out what had happened but for some unknown reason we are not frighted and want to leave we decided to wait until morning. We start to drift of to sleep near the fire and are suddenly awakend by a loud growl/hiss and the ground trembled under us. I awake and grab my shot-gun and take a shot in the darkness.Whatever it was was gone, it made no noise leaving. It may of been bear but a bear makes noise when running in deep wood.Needless to say we left, the Osburn Depot and the John Bull Creek never to return again.we may never know what we say or heard that night but one thing i know there are more thing out there than I will ever know,,,or want to.", "flying saucers seen near livermore california by driving witness on 680I was driving home from my girlfriends house and was going over a slight foothill pass near livermore on 680 in california headed north, but had not yet reached pleasonton.   As I came down the mountain pass on the other side, I could view the stars as its a great spot to see the sky and hills coming down. I looked and saw what appeared to be two shooting stars come down on an area of the sky ahead of me toward livermore area. The stars split directions and the light was gone.. Further down the hill going approx 65 mph.. I looked out my right hand window of my blazer and saw a circlur dark disk &quot;float&quot; past as if I was looking at the bottom of it.. It all happened so fast it was hard to believe the light in the distance that I saw was the same disk that had &quot;floated&quot; by..

I had no time to stop or didint think about doing it.. To verify what I had seen was not a reflection from something inside my car.. I&apos;m highly positive what I saw was a craft of some sort, as I KNOW I saw the shooting stars before the (UFO?), so my consequential sighting MUST relate to the shooting stars.. the craft must have been one and the same thing. and it has the ability to go extremely fast and levitate without any engine..

Witnessed by 2 police officers.My wife thought she saw a strange star that had &quot;rotating lights&quot; and called me to the kitchen window that faces south west. I looked out in time to see this star go from a stationary position to moving at a very odd angle and increasing speed. From its distance and location in the sky, the speed appeared to be very great as it moved closer to our home, but still well off in the distance. It then stopped and hovered, then dropped what my wife thought was about 500 feet. It continued to hover and then move. The speed at which it moved was too fast for a helicopter. It eventually got close enough to our house that I thought I could hear it. I stepped outside and watched it for a while and it made no noise. The lights were red, blue, green, and white and the white light got very intense at times. It continued to hover and move and move up and down and side to side. It then stayed stationary for over ten minutes. I am a ((public employee)) and called a friend of mine who was on duty to witness this thing. He is very skeptical and he is also an experimental pilot and flight enthusiast. He admitted that the movements and lights were very odd. It is now twenty minutes since he left to try to get a better view in a different part of our city.

She at first thought it was an emergency medical helicopter because she said it was coming closer. When I looked at it I told her it was just a bright star because it was not moving. All of a sudden it moved to the left and stopped. It then started to move to the left or right, and at one point dropped straight down about 500 feet in a matter of a second. There were multiple lights on the object that increased in intensity. The object then moved closer to the house so I went outside and I could not hear an engine or anything. The object conitnued to move in strange directions and would go from hovering to moving very fast across the sky and stopping again. I called a friend over who was working the midnight shift that night. This friend is very skeptical about these things but he also is a flight enthusiast and an experimental aircraft pilot. He agreed that no plane could move light that and no helicopter was that fast. He left and drove several miles towards the object out into the country and later reported that it hovered for about an hour then drove off. The sky was clear and we saw no other objects like such in the night sky.((END))", "The object flew straight up towards the sky for approximately 15 seconds, got smaller then dissapeared.It was approximately 10:00pm sometime in August of 1999, I was at a friends house and we were in his backyard patio chatting with a few other friends.

It definitly was not a plane. It was bright and heading straight up, it was quite far so the actual speed is unknown, but it must have been moving fast, I pointed the object out to my friends who were also stunned.

This was real sad news.Between 9:00A.M.- 10:00A.M. CNN showed earlier footage from Albuquerque,NM. This footage was played for only close to perhaps 30 seconds. This is what I saw.The sky was still dark. There was a long thin cloud near the top left of the T.V. screen that angled slightly upward and 2/3rds across to near the top of the screen.  As the shuttle crossed over this cloud from the top 1/3rd of the screen,at a slight downward and right angle to about the center of the screen,a dark rod shaped object shot across the screen from the bottom center,to the top right corner in a fraction of a second. Then a crow flew across the bottom of the screen from the right side to the left.This footage aired only 3 more times that Saturday.

I am a believer, that we are being visited by something, not of this earth.  I watch the skies whenever I can for anything strange.  Usually I see a satellite or two, traveling a straight and steady path, at a constant speed, from one horizon to the other.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  On Thursday morning, February 27, 2003, I was amazed to see the following:  Two objects traveling one behind the other, a good distance apart, at a low altitude.(About the height a small, two-man airplane would fly.)  There was no sound that I could detect and the objects maintained a steady glow - no blinking lights.  Above the objects and around the objects, at a much higher altitude were approximately twelve other objects that I thought were Airforce jets.  They maneuvered like jets and had blinking lights that pulsated regularly.  The jets seemed to be circling the two other objects, but keeping a distance.  I watched this spectacle for about four minutes until they disappeared to the north.  I am curious to know if anyone else saw what I saw.  Before I saw this spectacle, the lights on the interior of my locked car were on when I was at the top of my stairway with my two dogs.

I don&apos;t think much about it, until I come back to it a moment later.  It is now in a different part of the sky... It&apos;s still hovering.  I decide to lighn it up with a steady object.  I pick a telephone pole, and stand so that the light is centered and just above the top of the pole from where I&apos;m standing.

This flash had the appearance of a torchlight being flicked on and then off as it was white and round and comparable in size and brightness to the largest star visible.I thought that it may have been the flash of a shooting star and so watched the same patch of sky (at approximately 60 degrees height from horizon with 90 degrees being overhead and looking in an Easterly direction) to see if there were any more. I saw the same flash again but in more detail and could make out that the light got brighter and then dimmed much the same as a lighthouse or revolving light seen from a stationary source with the duration of the light being approximately 1 second. There was no trail left as for a shooting star and no noise, nor any beam as from a searchlight, the light being in exactly the same portion of sky as first observed.I continued to watch the same area and over the next 15 - 20 mins saw around 4 more identical &quot;flashes&quot;, unfortunately I didn&apos;t time the frequency but it did not appear to be regular. The light source appeared to be at high altitude similar to orbitting satellites I have seen before but stationary and not a constant light.Becoming bored standing outside I went back in to the chalet where several members of my family were watching television and when they asked me what I had been doing I replied that I was stargazing as it was such a beautiful night.Around 15 minutes later my wife asked if I wanted to go for a walk to the beach &quot;just to see what the stars looked light like at night&quot;. We walked around 80 metres and stood on the beach looking up at the stars when my wife asked me whether I had seen that. I said &quot;seen what&quot; and my wife replied &quot;that flashing light&quot; and pointed to the exact same area of sky. I still didn&apos;t mention I had seen anything earlier wishing not to biase my wifes thoughts and as we were looking we saw another two &quot;flashes&quot; over about two minutes. It was obvious that my wife was seeing the same thing as I was and that she had no explanation for a stationary flashing light source at that height with no noise.I then mentioned that I had seen it earlier and had no idea what it was and we watched for around another 10 minutes seeing one more &quot;flash&quot; before my wife grew too cold and tired to continue watching. Once back at the chalet and now convinced I was seeing something out of the ordinary I stood outside for a further 30 minutes but gave up after only seeing one more &quot;flash&quot;.We are both professionals in our mid thirties and whilst I am interested in the edge science and ufo / extra-terrestrial fields I believe I have rationally discounted all possible sources of this light known to me.Upon viewing the same area of sky the next evening nothing unusual was seen.", "made a humming buzzing noise grey in collor got withen an 1/8 of a mile from it.Was out checking my cattle, I got out of my pickup and herd a strainge a low buzzing humming sound.

This report looks as if it goes hand in hand with the two reported sightings at Kitimat and the sighting between Terrace and Prince Rupert, British Columbia on the same evening.Two Alcan aluminium smelter employees while at work, noticed a &quot;large&quot; disk shaped object travelling very slowly over the Douglas Channel. The object was reported being very low off the Channel and rose up to clear the mountains to the north. One of the witnesses I have talked with said the both of them stood completely still with their mouths wide open watching this thing ! &quot;They said if there had of been any change in direction, meaning towards them. They don&apos;t think either of them would have been able to move&quot;. Large, very bright white lights were noticed shinning on the water, and this is what caught their attention to the craft. Since the object was so low, and casting a bright light onto the water, it lit up a good sized area which made a portion of the object visible to them. No other lights were reported being seen, other than what they saw hitting the water&apos;s surface. It made no sudden moments until it gradually gained altitude to climb up over the mountain. The men witnessed this event for approx: 2 minutes. I witness said they both knew for certain that what they were looking at was no normal aircraft that they new of, mainly due to it&apos;s size and speed. Plus they never have seen anything shaped like that before. No noice was reported coming from the object.HBCC UFO Note: (Still working on this case, and hope to find someone else who may have seen this as well).((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike, Director of the Houston, British Columbia, Canada UFO Research organization, for sharing this report.

I first thought of Mars and I stood admiring its brightness and color.  I then noticed that it began to move.  I stood watching and waiting to see some sort of a beacon to identify it as some type of plane, helicopter, blimp or weather balloon etc. It then moved across the sky with a bright, orange, flame colored glow.  this took about a minute as it moved slowly.  I didn&apos;t think much of it yet because it moved slowly.  I called my wife who was inside watching television and she wasn&apos;t impressed at all until it suddenly disappeared.  My first thought was it disappeared behind the marine layer but then we noticed that stars in the same area were still visible. She then noticed that it re-appeared on the horizon to the south.  We both watched it again for about 10 seconds before it again disappeared.  We were both still skeptical and I went inside to get the telephone to phone my father.  I went outside again after a 2-3 minutes and my wife soon followed and this time I searched and saw nothing. I turned to go back in the house and looked up to the east and saw the same orange glow quickly approaching our direction at a low altitude.  It moved westwardly across the sky and at that altitude and we saw it pass over us and noticed that there was an outer edge that was spinning slowly in a clockwise direction. We were able to see this because of the orange glow underneath appeared to be lighting up some type of marker in a square shape that rotated. We both watched as it moved west and after about 15 seconds it disappeared.", "The object glided quietly above us, while we were in the pool on Summer in 1992We had just gone outside about 9:45pm and got into the swimming pool at the complex I lived in at that time.We were relaxing and talking and for some reason I looked up and said &quot;wow, look at the pink geese&quot; My aunt looked as well as my uncle and said thats not geese and kinda looked shocked, I then looked at my mom and said did you just see that hovering over us? She looked kind of scared. I asked my aunt what she thought it was and she had no idea just that it was large and very quiet gliding slowly over us. I looked at the local news that night and nobody else had reported it.I will never forget this...Several times while growing up in a suburb of Houston, called Rosenberg, I had witnessed several other craft both day and night.The reason I am writing this now is because I didnt know there was any plcae to report this.Thank you for letting me share our experience.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It moved quite a distance in a small amount of time, I came to the balcony and watched, by now it was directly in front of us. It continued to move to our right, suddenly stopping and dropping a white light. THe white light came down and made a burst of white light. The light then it continued to fall and another burst of white light came from the ball. It did this several times. The object in the sky then continued off to our right and straight up fading until it dissapeared. The object had a orange-red ball of light in the midst of it and you could see a dark outline disk type shape around the orange-red light.I can honestly say that I&apos;ve had doubts before, but after seeing that, it was truly creepy. We are wondering if anyone saw this and if anyone could maybe know what possibly the white light that it dropped could be.This was no plane, helicopter or satelite, seen it all, and it was none of that.

I was 15-16 yrs old at the time, which would make it fall of 1975 -1976. I believe it was a weekend since I was out late. I had left Sib&apos;s, a place kids hung out and bought candy at,  had spent time plaing pinball, and rode my bike up Jones St. in Eveleth, MN which would be an easternly direction. A couple blocks away I had noticed a red light above the roof tops of the houses across the street which would be too the north. I cannot say how far the light was but it had to have been many miles. I realized it was moving slowly in a back and forth up and down fashion. For a while I rode back and forth on the street and finnally stopped to watch from the corner. If I remember correctly, the street corner was Jones and B Street. As I watched, a green Light emerged from the red and shot off to the east and soon after an orange light appeared and shot to the west. All I could do was sit there and watch it. About five or so minutes later, perhaps less, the lights came back. The green from the west and the orange from the east, not from where they shot to in the first place. The crafts then merged with the red light and the light shot quckly into the sky and disappeared.

There were 5 or 6 of them moving very slowly and almost static. I woke my wife up to also see the event. When we were back to the balcony, more of the same objects appeared. The final count were 12 in numbers. The objects moved slowly from right to the left and they stop around an area for a while (about 10-15 minutes) before slowly disappearing.

I was casually glancing up at the Western sky when an object caught my eye as it was moving Eastward.  I thought it was an airplane at first.  It didn&apos;t make any erratic turns, however it&apos;s movements began to indicate to me that this wasn&apos;t a plane (eg. it made a leisurely circle would stop for a few moments and then resume moving again).  At this point I got out of the motohome to view more clearly. I then notice that the craft seemed to shoot something out of the anterior (west) side. A second later an impact seemed to have occurred causing what I would call an explosion. The craft moved forward a little and I ran in the house to wake up my wife and son.  When all three of us were on our front porch, I pointed to the craft which they easily found.  A few moments later the craft sent another emanation from the anterion causing the same effect (the explosion) as I had seen a few moments before.

One night in July ( could of been June) we happened to notice some sort of craft hovering over the tree line due east of our house . The exact distance was hard to estimate and could of been one mile away. I had a powerful set of binoculars at the time and focused as best as I could on the object trying very hard to steady my hand . The craft was dark in color and all I could make out were lights, both green and red, blinking in a sequenced triangle pattern. What ever it was slowly moved from left to right several times but never changed alltitude . I was so convinced it was a UFO that I called the williamsburg police department and reported the incident . After I had hung up the phone I noticed the UFO had disappeared from where it had hovered for about 30 minutes.

The light was so bright that the yard lit up like it was day time . There was not a cloud in the sky that night,  no chance of rain , and the flash of light was brighter than lighting .

We were standing outside enjoying the stars and interesting conversation when a large craft crossed almost directly overhead.  The tall Ponderosa pine trees did little to obscure it.  Triangular, it had slowly flashing lights red or white at the corners.  From the faint illumination of the lights and some starlight, the shape was very clear, the color was black or flat black.  There was a faint sound that to me was a very slowly turning (idling) turbine engine like a jet sitting still or an APU on a commercial jet.  Distinct, but quiet.  It almost seemed ordinary.  Almost a perfect triangle, with more or less FAA regulation lights traveling at an impossibly slow airspeed.  We all looked up and after 2 or 3 seconds my friend and my brother continued the conversation.  I was in awe.  Impossible to gauge the distance - 300 ft above us or 1500 feet, no visual clues - it was massive.  It was crawling, almost silent, yet almost ordinary looking because there was nothing dramatic about it.  I kept watching it until it was hidden by the ridgeline about 200 yards behind the house.  No matter how high it was, if it was 1500 feet above us  it had to be proportionally bigger than it appeared if it was actually only 300 feet overhead.  Nothing that massive that relies on aerodynamic lift or thrust could stay airborne moving that silently or that slowly.  It was like watching a sightseeing bus coast past a scenic spot at  5mph.  But buses don&apos;t rely on lift.My brother is not terrificaly interested in technical phenomena but he&apos;s intelligent.  My friend is a licensed Master electrican and licensed in HVAC, is very intelligent and served in Vietnam.  I worked as a mechanic and worked 2 years as an aerospace machinist before I earned my computer degree from ASU.  I&apos;ve been a programmer for 2 decades, served in the Air Force and the Army, did a tour in Vietnam and am fairly familiar with aircraft.  What I saw defied the law of physics as I understand them.  25 years later the impression/memory is just as strong.  A big part of the reason for this was that, at the time, my brother and my friend did not react at all to what we had seen which astounded me.  I had just seen something impossible and apparently it hadn&apos;t registerd with 2 intelligent, informed individuals who I knew well.  It&apos;s hard to say which part of this event affected me more.  What I had seen, or their lack of response.  To this day, I don&apos;t understand what happened.  In retrospect, it almost seems like the muffled &quot;turbine engine sound&quot; and the &quot;legal&quot; appearing lights were &quot;camaflouge&quot;.  Admittedly this is pure conjecture, but I repeat, nothing that massive can move that slowly and stay airborne.   Interestingly, I looked at your website for the first time today and saw a report about Childs, AZ.  My friend used to tell me about &quot;lights&quot; seen in the sky around the power station at Childs.  But a year later I met someone whose uncle was in the military and claimed that prototype Cruise missles were extensively tested in Northern Arizona, and particularly in locations like the Verde Valley where Childs is located.  I now this episode doesn&apos;t sound impressive but what I saw is burned in my memory and defies logic.  I can still vividly remember this huge black triangle &quot;floating&quot; over our heads.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

She saw a &quot;huge&quot;  &quot;silent&quot; &quot;slow&quot; &quot;black&quot;  &quot;triangular&quot; &quot;craft&quot;  with lights at a very low altitude.  She couldn&apos;t explain her reaction/response or her husband&apos;s.  I don&apos;t feel like the Lone Ranger anymore.  How similar, even though 17 years and 100 miles apart.I&apos;m sure you see this kind of commonality in reports all the time, but it sure impressed me.  No one has given any real credence to my &quot;sighting&quot; so I never talk about it.   I&apos;ve been pretty much a skeptic in spite of what I saw.  I&apos;ve reactivated my email at ((e-address deleted)) since I submitted my report, but I really don&apos;t have anything to add.  My brother probably only vaguely remembers the event.  I brought up the subject a few years after it happened and he didn&apos;t remember it as being significant and I don&apos;t know where my friend moved to.  He was in a branch of Army Intelligence when he was in the Army which makes it all the stranger that he had no reaction to what we saw.  Your guess is as good as mine, but it sure was neat watching this monster cruise overhead like it was in slow motion. I feel sort of privileged or lucky, This obviously isn&apos;t a report but I appreciate your dedication to this topic and thought you might like a little feedback, so to speak, the similarities I saw between my sighting and the one in NM.  I&apos;m becoming a believer.If you care to email me, could you give me a hint as to why you think  &quot;they&quot; don&apos;t formally contact us and just tease/study us, instead?  My theory is it&apos;s because we&apos;re such crude homicidal, genocidal morons.  It&apos;s too soon.((END))", "The CNN Film footage of the Shuttle Before the Break up.On 2/1/03 at 9am CST I was watching CNN and they were showing Mission Control when they first lost contact with the Shuttle.Around 9:25-9:35 am CST the first film footage was being shown and It definitely showed a object behind the Shuttle before it the Shuttle started to break apart.Within the hour that segment of that particular film footage was not being shown anymore.I have no idea what it was,but it was there and to this date I have not heard anyone talking about it  till I read it here on your site.Also I do have it on VHS.Thank you", "very bright light on other side of the mountain, hovering craft with bight light  on top and red lights flickering along bottomI was leaving a friends house in Livermore Ca around 1am and I took the corral hollow road so I can intersec with highway 132.

It was hugh, just sitting hovering about 500&apos; or so of mt oso. it was a large something with red lights blinking along the bottom of the craft. It also looked like the center of it had walkways or sky walks. I never stopped and as I connected with highway 132 towards modesto I can see it pretty good. I thought it was maybe tower or crain crews but no way. I know it wasnt a helecopter because I have flown on them and it wasnt a plane because it looked nothing like a plane.

One summer (1989) day I was walking with my wife from the bus station to the studient residence when we saw a light comming torward as in the same path, It was bright and moving fast so I asumed, it was somebody on a bike, but the light was very steady, then we realized, it was gonna hit as, so I pulled my wife to the grass and that object passed by emiting a zooming sound, just like a wasp.....I was a ball, like a red magma,it passed as and desappear into the night, mi wife got scare so we end up running to the residence. One thing that I notice, it was flying by its own power, no string attach,...Only I few people have heard this story,sometime I ask my wife if she remembers this moment and yes she does, so I guess I was not dreaming.Maybe this fenomenon is got a logic explanation, I don&apos;t have one.Do you?

I was walking North West through the town of Dun Laoghaire, which is a suburb of Dublin, to catch a DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit). A movement in the sky caught my attention. I saw a barely discernable oval  of light moving in the North Eastern sky. The source of the light appeared to be behind the cloud. Then I noticed a second, identical oval of light. They looked like two dim searchlights and they moved around each other in large circular patterns, giving the impression that they were dancing performing a dance. In size they appeared to be like two small moons, but much, much dimmer.They were so dim that I wondered were my eyes playing tricks on me. I watched them until I entered the station. Down on the platform I looked to see if they were still moving around in the North Eastern corner of the sky, they were. As I&apos;m a little short sighted I thought I had better get a second opinion. Pointing Northwest I asked a man standing on the platform if he could see the lights. He said he did and made some comment on UFOs and left it at that.My train arrived 5 minutes later. The journey to my station took about 7 minutes. My wife was waiting for me with the car. I looked North East. They were still there, still moving in that fluid circular pattern and in constant relationship to one another. I asked my wife could she see them. She said she did.The date of the sighting is approximate, allow a week either way.I have no opinion on what I saw((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I had a rendevouz to meet my girl friend after night school in the parking lot of a local bank.  As we were chatting in the car and making jokes. I was sitting in the drivers seat and she was lying her head on my lap, looking up towards me and also the window was in her frame of vision.  She suddenly ask me &quot; What&apos;s that!, I replied.  &quot;WHAAAT&quot;.  Then she started pointing directly overhead at the sky from my window and told me to look at something in the sky.  She said the stars are moving in the sky.  That&apos;s when I try to look at what she was refering to.  But from the way I was seating, I couldn&apos;t see anthing. So I got out of the car and started looking up to see if I can see anything stars moving.  She also got out of the car and came on my side of the car and started pointing at the sky about an angle of 87 degree directly over head.  That&apos;s when I notice Three star like object moving in the sky.  I couldn&apos;t believe it.  So started staring at it for like 30 seconds the see what it was.  The three objects were just as bright as the other stars in the sky, if not fainter then some.  They were traveling in a triangular pattern.  One in the front and two in the back, but in a triangular shape pattern.  The were moving fairly slow, enough to see the sighting for about over a minute.  As the lights continue to move in the same direction.  The one on the left side, moved diagonal towards the first light, which was leading the way.  as it moved towards the first light, it came very close to it, nearly touching it and went back to it&apos;s original position on the left side.  Then about 20 seconds past and the objects were at about a 60 degree angle, thats when I started noticing two other fainter lights appearing along side the two brighter lights on the sides.  One fainter light appeared on the left near the original light that was on the left side and same thing happened on the other side on the right light. Now the objects were at about a 45 degree angle in the! sky hea ding due north, cause the highway which was near me runs east to west and the objects werent heading in that direction and I knew for sure that they werent heading south.  They must have been traveling somewhat due north-north east.  Suddenly after the other lights appeared, they were a total of 5-6 lights visible, but strangly what happened after was that the original three lights started to dim away as the other lights started to appear, as that was happening, I started to notice they all were fading away one by one and out of sight.  At that time I looked at the time in the car and it was 9:32PM.  My girl friend and I were amazed to see that, but she mention to me that when she first notice them right overhead they were more of them, maybe around eight lights were visible she mentioned.  I wanted to share this with everyone and let them come with they own conclusions.  As for me I witness these lights as they were traveling in the sky.  They didn&apos;t look like planes nor shooting stars and I&apos;m positive that they weren&apos;t some meteors in the night sky that was burning in the atmosphere.  Please let me know if there is any explaination for this.

At first I thought it was a group of birds, but as I watched they mouved around much too fast to be birds and much to high. They were straight up in the sky and it was clear out. The sun was reflecting off of them some what as it was setting in the west. It was hard for me to judge how high up these objects were but a small aircraft passed under them as I watched which led me to believe they were very high up. One of the objects moved out of the cluster and moved towards the north. The rest of the objects started kind of lining up in a regimented order and started moving with the one that seperated from them.

After 30 seconds another craft, much bigger, appeared and made some strange signals to the other craft, maybe alerting it that there was somebody in the road: me.

We are familiar with these roads and drive along there occasionally just to enjoy the ride.  While riding down a straight part of this section of dirt roads we observed an orange glow behind us following at a distance and the car headlights were dimming by themselves.  I was driving and it felt like the car was held to the grounds by a magnet and didn&apos;t want to move.  We thought we imagined it so we drove back up the road and affirmed that there is no light source that could be seen from behind on that road.  We turned back around and after a few seconds the orange glow could again be seen following us.  In the meantime, there appeared a circle from the ground which encircled our view of the moon.  There were thick whispy clouds blowing in quickly, in a matter of seconds.  We went around a curve in the road and up to a clearing.  For some reason I backed the car up and my friend said, &quot;Oh my God, look at this!  You are missing it! I jumped out of the car and flying 50 yards away from us and desceding to the height of the treetops was a bell shaped object completely covered in round white lights, separate but close together.  The light was a pure white with the effect of silver mixed in. The object floated slowing just beneath the treetop and then started ascending back toward the way it came from and then off to the right at and flew across the trees toward Highway 20.  The object seemed to float in a wobbling fashion for just a moment when changing from the descent to when it ascended.  In other words it hovered in a wobbly way.  The object was completely silent.  I am in the habit of taking my binoculars with me.  When I looked through them the object seemed to be alive, a living flying object self illuminated.  I am pondering, angel or ufo?((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes self as working in a position of responsibility.

It wasn&apos;t emitting any light or reflection whatsoever, only a single small white light underneath. I couldn&apos;t tell if it was flat, or spherical; or the size, because I wasn&apos;t quite sure how far away it was? It was too big to be a balloon, too still, and too perfectly round. It was really foggy out, so I&apos;m suprised I could see it at all; I couldn&apos;t see anything else, not even the stars.

I saw a single, white light, like a headlight from a plane above the trees.  It brightened and then dove straight down behind the trees, like a flare, but faster.  It had no tail.  There is nothing beyond the trees except a Ducks Unlimited pond.  I checked the clock immediately, turned out the living room lights and watched to see if I could see it again.  The night was clear and cold and the full moon was at the other side of the house.

I got up in the middle of the night (around 3 AM)to grab a snack. The east-facing window of our house had the curtains open. I looked out the window and saw an orange light. I at first thought this was an airplane, but the light grew in size. (after thinking about this over the years, I believe it was coming closer and gave the appearance of growth) After about 5 sec of growing it stopped growing and the light switched off and the saucer appeared about 150 feet from me at house top level. I believe this was a switching of light sources from the saucer&apos;s different travel modes from motion to hovering. It was a classic inverted saucer shape with a dome on top and it had a bluish glow around it. I believe this glow was the result of it&apos;s propulsion sytem causing ionization in the surrounding atmosphere. As it hovered, a periscope came out from underneath and it pointed at me or the house and I saw (I think) a yellowish eye in the viewfinder staring at me. Apparently it did not want to be seen because as soon as it saw me it vanished. After thinking about this later, I believe it could of just switched all it&apos;s light producing sources off or sped off faster than the eye could see. It&apos;s likely the thing just hovered around our rural neighborhood for a few hours at housetop level observing at will after I fled in terror back to my sisters bedroom and jumped in her bed.  I have read other accounts of saucers that looked like the one I saw and one account I read has the saucer using this device underneath it as a landing structure. It appears that this structure performs multiple functions for landing and periscope-like observations. It seems like a rather crude observation device as it seemed like a direct optical device like a telescope (I could see the being&apos;s eye through it)as opposed to a sophisticated electronic multi-spectral imaging system.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I looked out the window and quite close was a spaceship with colorful changing lights shining at us. I freaked out and punched my friend in the arm until she awoke. At that moment we both saw a figure standing at the end of the bed. Wewent under the covers and screamed for a while. then got out of bed as it was gone and the ship had backed off a bit. It stayed there until sunrise slowly backing away as we curiosly shined our flashlights at it.We exchanged stories with one another and we both saw a tall figure with a huge head, she says she saw big eyes.

I was on bypass 24 east around the area of the city Peru gazing up at the sky  in front and to the sides of  the vehicle. Plenty of stars were out and i always notice venus, which i know is commonly mistaken for ufo&apos;s. Well, after about 20 minutes i notice to the upper left corner (drivers side) a luminous bright yellow light of significant size glowing and just hovering there like i&apos;ve never seen before. I would guess it to be just a little above a radio tower in it&apos;s reference to height in the sky.This yellow light had definately captured my attention to the fullest. Ok, so trying to drive and keep my eye on it without accident, it faded out for maybe a minute before glowing again. It did this a couple of times for reasons i don&apos;t know before 3 more of the same size lights appeared to  what would be the right of  whatever it was. These other 3 yellow lights (which  were all in the same size)  luminated in what i would describe in junction to the original light as going up in a quarter moon fashion. They stayed on only briefly before giving  what i&apos;m calling a blink in order from the first yellow to the fourth yellow and then it was done. I did turn left on county road 550 to try and get closer if not locate it after it faded but had no results. I have to admit that i am a believer in the ufo phenomenon and when i witnessed this it really made me nervous! It is really hard to say exactly where it was, but i do know that it was close to the Grissom Air Force Reserve Base in Bunker Hill, Indiana (roughly about 10 miles from where i was at the time) to make me wonder if it was montoring activity if any  going on there. I did notice a reasonalbe amount of airplanes around so i knew i could dismiss the fact that it wasn&apos;t a plane. The planes were much smaller and appeared to be higher.

The sky was unusually blue and clear with occasional white clouds. The sighting occured in the Mission Dam park itself. We were standing at the side of the paved road facing northwest, about 1/2 mile north of the visitor center, looking up towards south Fortuna Mountain. We were feeling kind of lazy and were just gazing at crows as they flew from the top of Fortuna Mountain down near the bottom of the canyon and back up again. After a while we were just looking around and noticed that the crows seemed to have left. I looked around for them and noticed that they were circling at the top of south fortuna and pointed it out to my friend. We were both looking at them and then I said &quot;look seagulls are circling above them&quot; realizing that they were not seagulls! My friend then said &quot;those aren&apos;t seagulls&quot; We were looking at about 8 brilliant white spheres doing circles and right angle turns at various hights up to about a mile high or so. They were obviously not birds, but the crows were circling under them which was really strange. We watched them in awe for about 45 seconds and then they were just gone in an instant! The crows were still there though. We stood there for a while hoping they would come back but they didn&apos;t after an hour had passed, while we talked about them.

I was 11 about to turn 12 in August 1987 and was staying at my father&apos;s house at West Lake (just outside of Prince George, BC, Canada).  It was a clear day although briskly cool and more like a fall day.  I was standing in front of our large living room window and looking out over the lake (southern part of the lake, looking east).  I noticed a dark almost black cylindical object vertically positioned almost directly over the middle of the lake.  It was perhaps 50-100 meters above the water.  Oddly I did not think much of it when I first saw it, but then I started to look at it with greater attention.  It was fairly small, I would guess that it was maybe, at most, a meter wide and 3 meters high.  At the middle point there appeared to be a band that was rotating, not really a light, but the band was of a lighter color.  The object stayed motionless, just sitting there for approximately a minute.  I called my dad, but he did not come.  While I was still viewing the object it sped away at a great speed to the upper right at almost exactly a 45 degree angle.  The speed at which it left was easily faster than any object I have ever seen in the air prior or since although it was visible as it sped away.  It left behind a &apos;very&apos; thin black exhaust trail that lingered for at least a minute and disappeared, but never really dissapated.  I can remember that I ran to my dad and told him regarding the object, and he never really reacted to what I stated, more like an approving nod.  The rest of the afternoon I spent outside with binoculars.  We never talked about it much afterwards.  To create a better image of what I saw, it appeared almost like a black lipstick casing with a brighter band in the middle.  The thing it reminded me of the most when thinking about it afterwards was the probe druid in Star Wars.  The object I saw had little detail bit it just sat there above t! he lake, motionless except for that band.  I am 27 now and this small incident in time still remains a bizarre little fact in my life and I thought I would share it.  I am not certain of its origins, but I am certain it was not a figment of my imagination, nor anything else easily explained.  I would qualify it as an unidentified flying object and that is why I am choosing to share this information here.Here is a link to the Park on the Northern part of the lake, fyi:  http://wlapwww.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/parkpgs/west_lk.htmI would also like to add something to this information which is likely unrelated, but on the very slight chance it is I will include it.  About a month before this sighting.  I was standing on our dock on the lake fishing.  I had put some water in the bottom of the canoe about 4 or 5 inches deep and any of the fish I caught I put in the canoe (the squaw fish as we called them were intended as cat food).  The canoe was tied at both ends parallel to the dock.  The weight of the water in the canoe was significant and I weighed at least 120 pounds at the time.  I was standing beside the canoe holding my fishing rod and looking across the lake (my line was not out at the time).  The lake was calm that day but I noticed an extremely fast rippling across the water that was coming toward me from the right.  The force of the wind picked the canoe out of the water, slammed it across the dock and into my leg knocking me into the water on the other side of the dock, with my fishing gear in hand.  All of the water and fish in the canoe were released, the canoe rested on top of the dock turned upside down and I was sitting in the water wandering what happened???  I was just in awe of how wind could pick a very heavy canoe out of the water and knock it into me causing me to tumble over into the water.", "Large,round,orange balls of light,followed by fast moving craft in sky with strobe like lights.My husband and I left Jeffersonville OH. on our way to Chillicothe around 9 pm on Feb.6th,2003. Between Jeffersonville and Washington Court House a large, orange light appeared in front of us. I asked if that was a plane and the light disappeared. We laughed it off as strange and continued. On the other side of Court House on East 35 the same light appeared at the 41 exit. This time it lit up for about 3-4 seconds,faded, then another to the right quickly blinked then went out and the light on the left lit up again. This got our attention and I rolled down the window to see if I could see anything. The sky was clear and cloudless. Nothing could be seen flying or moving. We discussed what these lights couldve been for the next 3-4 miles when we saw another of these lights again. This time we pulled over to the side of the highway. My husband pointed out 4 flying blinking lights on what we thought were planes. We continued driving to Chillicothe as I watched these lights.From the speed I first thought they were jets. I rolled my window down and could not make any shape out or hear any sound. The lights were a single, strobe-like light on each one. The lights didnt blink in a pattern but would blink quickly, then would go off, then blink slow. This happened with all of them. My husband noticed one going left, then stall, and change direction quickly going back to the right. They moved into pairs moving around in the sky going different speeds. The lights were small and if it wasnt for the large, glowing orange light I wouldve never have noticed these lights. Im not sure of the distance. They seemed very far away which would make the speed they were going even stranger. Ive never seen any plane or jet move like these moved, or change direction, or speed like these did. At the Frankfort exit we got off rte 35 to get a better look. Two of the lights lined up, one on the left and one on the right. The other two came in and joined the line in the middle of these. Their lights then rarely blinked and the two on the outside began a patterned blink. As they flew away at one point all the lights in this row blinked and it looked like 8-10 separate lights in this row.As they went back towards the west the two lights continued to blink on the outside and every now and then two lights between them would blink.If I had to make a rough guess I would say the distance between the craft on the left and the one one the right would be around 1-2 miles. This was the strangest thing Ive seen in the sky. I dont know if anyone else noticed these smaller lights but Im sure many people had to see these large round orange lights.", "Craft with 3 lights hovering over 495 then darting awayTonight while i was leaving work to go home at 10:55pm, i was in the parking lot unlocking my car door.

Once it got above the tops of the trees, and was completely visible, it quickly shot upward even more, and within a matter of seconds had moved from one side of the sky to the opposite, leaving behind it a distinct crackling sound, much as a jet leaves a sound trail. For the duration of these happenings, the entire sky lit up neon green, and was, as I describe, brighter than day. I could see everything, and given the circumstances, thought we were being bombed. Once everything was back to normal, and the object was no longer visible, I could see flickering trails that were the same color as the UFO disappearing almost as quickly as they were able to be seen. This all happened within a matter of seconds, but everything remains so clear in my mind. As I went back inside to tell my family, there had been reports of transformers blowing around the county, and a wire down on a nearby street. These events seem peculiar to me, and though there could be some rational explanation, I am very skeptical. I know what I saw, and I&apos;ve never seen or heard of anything that comes close to being like it, especially not the fact that the entire sky was brightened even past the normal daylight we are all accustomed to. I leave it up to the readers of my &quot;sighting&quot; to come up with a logical explanation to this, whether it was something &quot;explanable&quot; or in fact a UFO.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous, providing just an e-address.

Perhaps one of our readers could confirm whether there might have been a balloon launched out of the balloon facility in the Southwest.  PD)) slow moving object evolves from a light green colored embryo shape to a full saucer with tent top and wht bulb like trim.Object appeared, without the use of camcorder, as a bright white round light the size of a pencil eraser in the Southern skies of Santa Fe. As I started to film, the object looked like it was starting to fry like an egg until you started to see the bottom appear to start rolling up from the bottom. The object all the while started to pitch a pointed roof on top as the bottom rolled up to the middle where there was a slow revolving red light. As it continued slowly rotating, the pitch of the roof started to flatten out as round folding table top looking wings started to develop. The object then evolved itself into an object that looked much like a garlic or acorn. This means that the pitched roof on top of object sucked itself in like a flexible piece of aluminum while the bottom body remained looking like the bottom part of a garlic. As I continued to film for 15 minutes more, the object flattened out for another 3 to 4 minutes, meaning you could no longer see the top at all, however, the bottom finally started to flatten itself out horizontally like the traditional frisby like looking disk. As I filmed for another 3 to 4 minutes, the object popped (or should I say sprouted) it&apos;s roof up from the inside up then out just like a mushroom or a volcano. Once the new top was on the craft, you could see  small little white light-bulb looking type fixtures around the trim of the disk. The bulbs appear to be revolving or e-volving around the craft slowly like maybe 2 to 3 miles an hour. I continue to film this object every morning if skies are clear.

I have cordially invited several individuals to join me as I film but have not been succesful.

We watched it for 15 minutes until it dropped below the rooftop line of our neighbors house.There was one single disc/saucer type object observed that was stationary for the fifteen minutes we watched it. Skies were clear.  It was staionary although it was dropping some in altitude to eventually dropped below our neighbor&apos;s roof top which was our viewing area and certainly moving away from us as the vision got smaller in that fifteen minute period.  It was as if it was going sideways as it did get smaller and did drop in altitude a little, but appeared stationary at the same time.It was fairly large as seen at a distance,(hard to determine how far away it was) had a rotating outter circle of lights all the way around the saucer and the lights would change colors from green, to all red, to all blue and to all white.  Most of time, I observed more all red, or all green and these light rotated the whole time.  I was thinking to myself, just like they make it seem in real life or in the movies.We had time to get our glasses and also binoculars to take a better look.  With the binoculars it was strange to only to be able to see a white undefined mass.  Kind of like a thin white mass/cloud-like in the darness.  I thought that was strange. Obviously you could see it with the naked eye, but there was some sort of field that made it unobservable while trying to use another type of viewing apparatus. Thought about taking a picture of it, but didn&apos;t.  Glad there were two of us that viewed it, so there is no question that we saw what we saw.After it dropped below the rooftop line of our neighbor&apos;s house, we didn&apos;t pursure it any more.  As far as backgrounds of the observers - I am 49 years old and a professional by occupation.  The other observer is a 20 yead old college student who was home from school for a few days, and had been studying late.  He originally spooted the thing and brought it to my attention.  Interesting, yet kind of scary.I never believed in those things before, but I certainly have to change my stance on them now.  Either that, or our own government is experimenting with some type of contraption in the wee hours of the morning when they knew most people would be asleep.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Couple this with the large amount of media coverage which occurred which means this event is researchable &amp; verifiable....AND yet...it has never been properly reported!! I distinctly recall the Radio station I was listening to receiving streams of excited callers and it took over discussion for quite some time.The Papers and TV also covered it however within a few days it had been &quot;explained away&quot; as &apos;reflections of a fishing fleet at sea&apos; or parts of &apos;skylab&apos; or &apos;venus&apos; etc Description of event: At dusk a &apos;mothercraft&apos; (2-3 football fields in size) flew over the city at a very low altitude as a very large dark shape with long trailing arms on either side, set against the fading light of an early evening sky.I witnessed it with a girlfriend and actually stopped the car in a suburban street to watch it in awe. Reminiscent of the opening of the original Star Wars 1 movie without all the craft detail. The following night (Sunday) the hills where swarming with people (I estimate 30-40 groups of 3-5 people) waiting for it (with Binocs etc) to return. It could easily have been a scene out of a Spielberg movie! What makes my role in this a bit unique was that the night before (Friday) I had sat on the bonnet of my car for 15 mins and studied a smaller 3 tiered space craft (Clearly visible windows on each level, not dissimilar to NZ&apos;s Parliament &apos;Beehive&apos;) hover on the outskirts of the city approx 200 feet away across a field and just above some poplar trees (75-100 feet above the ground). Although I studied the windows intently there was no sign of life or movement at all. There was also no missing time or anything like that either.It then proceeded to fly slowly over the western edge of the city in the exact opposite direction than that of the &apos;mothercraft&apos; the following Sat night. I was in visual contact with it for over an hour.I have a large artists impression (a quite accurate representation) of this smaller craft.In short an event at least as big as any of the major UFO sightings worldwide and it has never made it into the annals of UFOlogy.....and it deserves to be.I would be very interested to hear if anyone else has or does report this event. My bet is that given the numbers who witnessed the large craft a researcher would be able to uncover many of them with some publicity.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

My father was a farmer, but he had received his &quot;wings&quot; from the USNavy during World War II.  He had done quite a bit of night flying and was trained in night flying by using the constellations. He was somewhat interested in the reports that pilots would see unusual objects, but he wasn&apos;t a nut.  He spent many hours alone on the tractor, cultivating soybean fields at night.  The evening of my UFO sighting,  my father was taking a bath.   I saw what at first looked like a large airliner over our neighbor&apos;s barn, but the &quot;airplane&quot; didn&apos;t move or appear to get closer and larger.  There were white lights that looked like windows of the plane, but the plane would have been way too low to be on approach to the Indianapolis (Weir Cook) airport.  The airport is located about 20 miles to the north west of my parents&apos; farm.  When I realized that this was not a jet, I shouted, &quot;Daddy, come quick.. It&apos;s a UFO! It&apos;s a UFO!&quot;  There had been several sightings around Indianapolis during the summer of 1965.   My father came running, with just a towel on.  The whole family tried to see the object, but it darted quickly to the west and disappeared.  I was the only person who really saw the object.When we got to the high school, I was still rattled.  Then some of the other students said that the radio had reported that people saw a UFO over Southern Plaza, a shopping center located near US 31 on the south side of Indianapolis.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Lights.This was an exceptionally clear night, and I was out doing time-exposure photography of star trails and the northern lights, which were unusually visible due to the clarity of the sky.  As I was looking through the viewfinder of my Canon EOS-3, I noticed something strange in the upper right corner of the view finder...I removed my eye from the viewfinder and tried to get a better view as to what I was seeing.  It was a VERY large (2-3 times the size of a 747) disk, that was black, or at least looked black due to the absence of light.  It was honest-to-God saucer shaped.  I would have NEVER believed it was anything out of the ordinary..until I saw it move eastward in the sky.  There was absolutely no noise at all...not even crickets.  It was moving very slowly...in my very rough estimation, maybe 20 knots at the most.  It stopped periodically and hovered in its location before continuing on the way.  I attempted to take pictures, but it remains to be seen if anything will appear on film, due to the fact that I was shaking very much, and there was little light.  Exposure times were in the 20-30 second range that I had set to record the northern lights.  This is not any sort of a joke that I am playing.  To be honest, I am still shaking here at home, as I write this.((FOLLOW-UP #1 FROM WITNESS))For confirmation....it is Saturday evening that I made the sighting.

It had what appeared to be very small wings at midpoint on the fuselage colored red and black. The rest of the craft was silver. It was huge and noiseless.

They were often moving to each other and back and when a car would drive by they would move toward the cars . I remember the children on the  school bus on the way to work had inspired us to see this odd appearance in the sky. It was often a nighty watch of hours of lights outside in the sky. My sister was older than me. My father said we were only watching weather balloons and would go back inside our home after he would check on our excitement of the nightly lights following each other and at times cars. We became so fasinated with the objects that my mother would start to come home after work and join in observing this strange array of moving lights.One evening has haunted my memory the most. We never usually spoke of the scary experiance after it happened. ..I had run upstairs to get a better view of the lights from the 2nd story window of our rented house. Suddenly the cat jumped off my brothers bed..cows started mooing , every animal in the area made noises of alarm...That was the time a huge saucer shaped ufo appeared out of the sky and was so close I feared for my life. It was very odd and the noise it fineally made was more like a whooping sound very slow and paced. I never forgot the feeling in my heart when it made the noise. My mother and sister never usually talk about it. I was around 13 at the time and am now 42 almost 43 years old. When I asked my mother the other day if she remembered the experiance she even was able to recall the noise.It is something when people look at you if you even whisper you know there are strange saucers in the sky...and you know what you saw. So, all I can do is state to this report today that there were 3 of us. ...We saw it as close as you see your neighbors house if you live next to anyone close...It was spooky and years later when I fineally saw a movie called close encounters I could fineally realize someone else has seen something..The saucer in the movie is larger than what we saw , but almost a perfect match. The lights went around the object making it look like it was spinning.I used to be afraid to be alone....I know that people will one day see something in the sky....and I can only hope they don&apos;t have the nightmares I have had in my lifetime. The occourance was one I know will never forget ..it is something that stays with you. I remember the tops of the trees swaying when it passed...Then the saucer shaped thing left as it had arrived...It really was beautiful. But it was also very spooky. I am glad we left the country farm home after that..I am so very glad I now live in a town 5 miles down the road within reach of friendly neighbors.But, on nights I look up and name a star..remembering the time a ufo came to Medaryville, Indiana....and I am so happy I don&apos;t live in the country anymore. I never will again..Not after that.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

About one mile later we were directly opposit the glow. This is steep mountainous terrain and we were at river level and the glow was on the mountain, which was probably 800 feet high. The glow appeare to be along the top of the ridge line and appeared to be 200 to 300 feet wide. It extended down the side of the mountain for approximately 1/3 of the way to the bottom, which would be approximately 300 feet. It didn&apos;t illuminate anything but was a vivid soft red glow. At times there were white lights, about the size and brilliance of the brightest stars; and they would move around the edge of the glow. At times we could hear what sounded like human voices buy could not distinguish words; also, we heard what sounded like metal pounding on metal. At one point a powerful spotlight illuminated us briefly and just a small area around us. The beam came from the top which would have been about 1000 feet.My friend wanted to go into Whitesburg, about 2 miles, and get a friend of ours, who was an attorney, to see what we were looking at. By the time we got back the glow was not as vivid and if I remember correctly we did not hear anymore sound. The glow just kept getting dimmer. Many cars came by and inquired as to what we were looking at. The next day my friend and I traveled to the top of the ridge to see if there were any signs of the activity there were none. It was very rough terrain with many huge boulders and heavily wooded. In order to get to the scene we had to travel a short distance north, cross the river on the highway bridge and walk down a railroas track for about 300 yards to go straight up the hill to the area. After getting back to the railroad track we met a young man who live nearby, about 12 to 15 years old, who had a rifle on his shoulder. We told him what we had seen and was trying to figuer out what it was. He said he knew what it was, a flying saucer.I was a ((employment deleted--federal employee)) at the time and my friend was a Whitesburg business man. The young fellow mentioned above is now, and has been for many years, an attorney practicing in Whitesburg, KY. I happen to meet him several years later, after he became an attorney, and mentioned the scene to him. He told me that at the time we met him on the railroad he was very scared becaus he thought we were from the saucer.Within about one month of this occurence we were traveling toward Whitesburg again, at approximately 10:00 p.m. About a mile closer to Whitesburg one of us spotted strange lights high in the sky, about 80 deg. above the horizion. Due to the movement they couldn&apos;t be counted but it looked like 12 to 15 objects. They looked like a very bright stars and was dancing around each other, in an area a little larger than a full moon, very rapidly. In a very short time one started to expand and became slightly larger than fell moon. That was scary because when it started expanding I felt it was going to engulf everything. When it got to the maximun size it appeare that molten material, of the same starlight intensity, was dripping from the edge. While this was going on the small lights were dancing around the large object. This sight also disappeared gradually in the same area. I don&apos;t know if anyone else saw this or not.We became avid saucer watchers after this. We would travel to the top on some of our mountains where we had an unobstructed in every direction and spent many hours trying to something else. We never did.

We had a nice view of the valley pointing south and of Red Top look out. Our tent was a three person tent. our car was parked about  8 feet away from the door of out tent and our two dogs were in the car that night. The tent door was facing the small hill away from the view. The stars were out and the moon was almost half and located to the back of the tent away from the door side. We were sleeping with our heads to the back of the tent. I was on my back. I happened to wake up as i normally do. As soon as i opened my eyes there was a round bright white light on the centered part of the door to the tent. The light was perfectly round with fine edges and solid white.  It was there about 10 secounds, and went out. I layed there about 20 secounds and it came on again, same location and intencity. It stayed on about the time it took me to just out my bag, about 4 secounds.  I open the tent door and stuck my head out and looked all over, the hill the sky and saw nothing. I didn`t look behind the tent toward the valley, because it was cold and i already had chills going up my spine.  I ruled out the moon reflecting off the mirror of my car and my flash light in the tent was positioned not to shine on that area.  As far as time lost i don`t know. I was asleep and woke up that.  Dogs did not make any sounds at all. The wife slept right through it all.  We came back the next year same weekend and did not have any sightings.

I grew up on a farm in eastern South Dakota. My uncle was traveling to his home near Nunda, South Dakota a very small elevator town near Brookings, South Dakota. He had been helping my father cut silage on our farm near Volga, South Dakota. My uncle Gene, said that the object at first looked like a bright star in the southeastern sky. The object then grew in size rapidly and appeared to be coming at him on a pependiclar vector. Then it was very close to him as he was driving over a hill about two miles from where he lived. It was huge now and hovering over a swamp. At first my uncle didn&apos;t know what to make of the object. He stopped his car which was a 1959 Ramble Station Wagon. He got out and studied the craft which was about 800 yards away. It was saucer shaped emitting a very bright pinkish red light. He could see what looked like bars connecting the two saucers together. In between the bars were windows and he could see aliens inside looking back at him. This terrified him and he got back into his car and sped off for home. The craft was about 1/4 mile off to his left and kept up with his speed. Then my uncle had to turn left and the craft went over his car at that point and out over his farmland. As soon as my uncle reached home he called my father and told his story. We went outside and sure enough in the distance off in the southwest just above the horizon was a red object. My father and I watched it for about 10 minutes until it suddenly disappeared.didn&apos;t know what to make of the object. He stopped the car he was driving which was a 1959 Rambler station wagon. He got out of the car and studyed the object. It was emitting a very bright pinkish red light.It was shaped like two discs on on top of the other inverted and connected with what looked to him like bars of metal. To his astonishment there was an area in between the bars there was windows and behind the windows he could see aliens looking back at him. This jolted him back into his car and he sped off the last two miles home. The object kept up with his car and stayed probably a 1/4 mile to his left. He had to turn south at the next intersection and at this point the craft went over him out over his farm land.((NUFORC Note:  We have requested additional reports from the uncle and father.

It was silent...no engine or prop noise. My eyes from the light are still spotty as I type this.

I turned around and saw 6 long lights cruising along the dark sky. I stood in awe as the craft moved so slowly. In about 10 minutes they seperated and scattered in all directions. I saw that they were slow so I ran home to get my camera. When I got back they were much further apart but had sepperated into two groups of 3. Itook several shots of each until I had no film left in my camera. When I went home no-one would believe me. I hope you do!

I read of the sighting over Williamsburg, Virginia on November 1 with great interest, as I had a similar experience back in November 1966. Heading east on I-64 from Ashland, Ky to Huntington, WV, I took the(I believe) the 5th Street exit (may have been the 16th Street exit). The exit ramp was uphill to the stop sign at the end of the ramp. It was a weekend night, clear, and little/no traffic. At the top of the ramp, I had the need to relieve myself, so I stopped the car and got out.While in the &quot;process&quot; I gazed to the sky. My father, a WWII AF vet, had instilled in me a very high interest in aircraft, space and the like. While standing there, I noticed an a triangular shaped object (almost exactly the same as described in the Williamsburg report) going straight over my car. If I had been holding a basketball at arms length, the craft was larger.  I imagine that the shape was triangular, as there were around 7 to 9 red lights arranged in an error shape, point at the front, or at least the direction the craft was headed.I also noted that there was no sound, and the speed of the craft was just over a hover - very slow. I had no fear, just interest. I noted the craft for approximately 40 to 45 seconds, in which time it was still in close proximity to me - again, it was moving very, very slow. Once I finished my &quot;business&quot; I sat down in the car, but did not shut the door. I thought to myself that that thing I just saw was just not acting right. I stepped back out of the car and the craft was gone.  I did not sit in the car any more that 3 or 4 seconds.  I had visibility for at least 5 miles in every direction, but the craft was gone.  Returning home, I told my Dad about the incident, and he said, &quot;you saw something, but who knows what it was&quot;.The more telling part of the sighting happened the next weekend. My Mother and Father were not living together at this time and I took a trip the next weekend to see my Mom in Oak Hill, WV.  Oak Hill is approximately 85 miles NNE of Huntington. While eating dinner, my Mom began telling me a story about seeing an odd aircraft the preceding weekend.  She and some of her friends were driving from Oak Hill to Charleston, WV, which lies between Oak Hill and Huntington.  Traveling down SRt 61, the road, which is very mountainous, opens up to a wide valley when it comes to the Kanawha River. Upon entering the valley, she and her friends noted an object on the north side of the river, moving SSW, at an extremely slow speed. From the distance they were from the craft (a marble held at arms length, about the same size), she could not determine definite shape or lighting, though she did say she thought the object had a faint red glow.  She and her friends observed the object for a good minute, then the object gained a rate of speed, almost too fast to follow, and almost immediately (from almost zero to bullet speed in an instant) and disappeared from sight.  Two points, (1) I had not told her my story yet and (2)this was the same day/evening I observed the craft in Huntington.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

A still shot was shown on TV, and I saw it.  It was an overcast evening, and the UFO was dark, perhaps brown.  The announcer said she had no idea what it was.  I set up to tape it later, but it was never shown nor discussed ever again, nor was it mentioned in the Tyler Telegraph newspaper.  I figured then that the film would be confiscated and the news crew would be told to not talk about it, and that would be that.  I didn&apos;t know at the time that I could report it to anyone.

Carson, CO, to a restaurant in Fountain, CO, I remember seeing an object from my car.  It was daylight and clear - The object was saucer-like and appeared to have a couple of tiers or layers, was bright, almost as if a balloon lit from within, but it had separate lights on it.  I was driving east (don&apos;t remember road) on Ft. Carson, and noticed the object as I approached the I-25 overpass.  I was on high ground and the object was low to the horizon on the other side of the interstate.  I snuck glances at it as I drove, being quite taken by it&apos;s presence.  I remember thinking it was probably a balloon for a sales pitch, and I couldn&apos;t wait to go see it.  After I crossed the overpass I couldn&apos;t observe it any longer because of the decreasing road elevation (bad angle) and increasing amount of trees (obstruction).  I did my best to estimate  the point on the ground upon which I thought it was, so I could drive there and see it, but I could never find it.  I was too embarassed to ask anyone at the restaurant.  When I drove back, I u-turned to see if I could see it again, but no joy.  I was very familiar with the area back then, that portion of Carson being mostly high desert, and Fountain being a smallish Army post town where friends lived- I&apos;m sure it is all built up now.  I do not remember the exact time of day, other than I think is was in the afternoon (near meal time).  I don&apos;t remember the time of year, but I suspect it was after January and before July (before my discharge).  I believe it was a weekend, becuase I couldn&apos;t drive to Fountain during the weekday due to my work.  I can&apos;t believe no one else would have missed it.  I was dumbfounded, and to this day wonder what it was.  I never saw it move, never heard anything - it was just a few miles away. I concede it could have been a ballon, but I couldn&apos;t find it.

Two, it glided in towards the city and did not seem to be any color of any airplane I have ever seen, either. Also, it glowed with a strange orange lumininous crackle, and when I looked at it for very long, it hurt my eyes to do so.

The object being chased had what seemed to be a circular shape of very bright light or lights. The light appeared to be one mass from our distance and point of view. The shape of the whole craft could not be made out. We recognized the jet by the wings lights, one red, one green, and a center light. The lights on the jet were flashing in rapid procession.

We were just driving along a rural road in my friends pick up truck - there was a light in the sky - we both saw it but didn&apos;t comment because we just assumed it was a plane - until a few minutes later when we realized the light had not moved!

I shouted for my friend to stop the truck - to pull over because I was dumbstruck! I was looking at the most magnificent sight - a huge round object with huge round lights - two of which were lit - the lights had what I called &quot;hoods&quot; over them - making them look like the hanging traffic lights. The lights would go off and I could see that they would come on at a different location on the object and then back to where I was looking. Tonight as I was trying to describe to my husband what I had witness I used the word &quot;energy&quot; - as in I could feel a great &quot;energy&quot; within this object - as though it were seething with power but I did not really feel frightened - just in awe. Well, as we watched the UFO program I saw where the pilot ! over Pit tsburgh described what he has seen as &quot;pulsating&quot; and I just had the chills as that would exactly describe what I had seen.

I really could not tell how big it was until I realized that the lights were coming on on the other side of it and then I was able to ascertain that it was huge - it was blacking out a huge area of the sky! I could not imagine why more people had not reported seeing it but then I realized that without the binoculars it just looked like a light in the sky.  When I called the newspaper I was told nobody else had reported it. In the time it took me to hand the binoculars over to my friend it was gone - however, he did see the light earlier. So, this was my experience and now I am convinced that others saw it too - especially the pilot. I wish I could remember the month - I cannot and I had just told my husband that I was pretty sure it was 1996 and then I heard the pilot had seen one in 1996 and I am now convinced that I saw a UFO. Thank you for listening to my story.((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.

I glanced out my window (to the right) and noticed lights flashing in the night sky. I asked my mom to pull off the road so we could see what the lights were. I opened my door and stood on the running board to get a good look at the lights. There were at least 20-30 square shaped white lights all in a row, and each one would light up one right after the other, and move from left to right and then move back from the right to left. My Mom, my cousin and I just stood outside the van and watched this object move right over top of us. It was moving at a speed approximately 5-10 km/h. The object had no other lights on it besides the ones flashing on the front of it. As the object flew over top of us, I noticed that it was round in shape. It cast a dark shadow against the starlit night sky. I also noticed there was absolutely no sound coming from the object as it flew over top. I live in a mountainous area, and this object was flying from the north part of the mountainous area, and moving southward to the open waters. I would estimate the object was flying about 100 feet above the trees. My Mom, cousin and I watched the object&apos;s shadow until it was no longer visible (due to the trees across the road). There were no lights behind the object, it was a dark shadow gliding through the night sky, not making a sound. As my Mom, cousin and I got back into the van, we all looked at eachother in disbelief to what we had just witnessed seeing. There is no other explanation in my opinion, except to say that we had just witnessed seeing a U.F.O. Approximately 8 years later, there was a write up in my local paper asking for people to come forward in regard to U.F.O. sightings in our area. I feel that we seem to live in silence with information such as this, but now I would like for my story to be shared with other&apos;s who may have found themself to be a disbeliever.

I became so shocked while I was driving that I had to pull over to make sure my eyes weren&apos;t playing tricks on me. I noticed about 2 other cars pull over behind me and we all got out and just stared at this huge disk hovering over the bay. i was in complete shock and all the hair on my arm went straight up. The disk made an eerie whirring noise that was almost ghostly. The exact location was just after the McDonalds and Tim Hortons Drive through in Mill Bay (just after the malahat drive).

Fiery object emits fire like objects that float down to ground.On December 24, 2002 I pulled up to one of my friends house, him and another friend said they were going up to the construction site of a new hospital where my friend worked as the night secuirty guard.

On the way up I saw an orange light in the sky but thought that it probably was just a airplane and didn&apos;t notice when it must have disappeared.When we got up to the hospital the security guard was still hysterical and was trying to tell us what it looked like and what it was doing.  We kind of joked with him for about ten minutes when we all went into his office that was located in a modular next to the hospital.  I called my father who is the chief of one of the fire departments in town and asked him if he would call dispatch and see if anyone had reported anything.  One of my other friends called his girlfriend on the office phone.  The guard sat down in his chair and said to me I was looking out this window when I first saw it, as the security guard pointed out the window to show me where, he said, &quot;Oh my god there it is again&quot;.When I looked out the window I saw an orange light that was bright orange.  It was somewhere around six hundred feet off the ground and about a mile away.  I could not pick out a shape of the object only that it was emmiting a light that looked like fire and that it was coming closer.  I immediately called my dad who lives up on a hill about the same distance away and told him that I didn&apos;t know what this thing was and for him to try to see it from his advantage.  Then the UFO started emitting little tracer fire balls that looked like they were floating down (swaying back and forth).  It must have dropped around 8 of these.  I then became frantic when my friends started screaming in terror as this object is slowly coming towards us.  My parents immediately hung up on me when they heard my friends screaming to come to where we were at.  At this time I felt that it was time to leave so we ran to the cars.  As we were running a car came over the horizon and the UFO dissappeared like turning off a light bulb in a dark room.Friends of ours and my parents and grandfather arrived shortly and we stayed there for a while but it never came back.  The security guard said that when saw the UFO the first time a car stopped alongside the highway to watch.  But never heard any other reports.

I had never had an experience like it before, nor since, and I am now 37.  Right after it happened, I told two friends and my mom.  They did not believe me though I had never had a reputation for lying or even having been a daydreamer.  In 1981, I was popular, had good grades, was a cheerleader, and did not do drugs or smoke.  I had nothing to gain by telling a false story.  My friends and mom thought I had a &quot;dream,&quot; though I kept insisting I had not.  I had no clue as to what the experience was about, but as the years went by, and I heard more and more about people&rsquo;s experiences with UFOs, I came to wonder if it was of the same nature.  I have always been skeptical of UFO stories, but there are so many similarities to my experience.  This is what happened (exactly), as I remember it like it happened yesterday.  It was right after 10:00 p.m. on a school night.  I had just hung up from talking on the phone.  I wasn&rsquo;t sleepy yet, so I dimmed my light and turned over on my left side with my head propped up on my pillow.  I closed my eyes to relax when I distinctly heard a scurrying sound coming from the back of my closet.  Since we lived at the end of a cul-de-sac near the woods (only one other house around), it wasn&rsquo;t unusual to have squirrels on the roof.  I thought maybe one of them had gotten down in the wall.  I recall giggling to myself thinking how appalled my mother would be when she found out there was a squirrel in her wall.  It was such a nonthreatening sound, I didn&rsquo;t bother to open my eyes.  Right after the scurrying stopped, I heard crinkling paper (but it was distant).  Again, I thought, what are those rodents up to now?  Then the crinkling stopped, and in its place I heard a faint murmuring of voices (like in a crowded room).  I thought about getting up and looking out my window, as teens like to come down into our circle to hang out.  Maybe someone was playing their radio.  As I debated on whether I should get up or not, a l! oud clea r voice suddenly spoke near my right ear (the one not on the pillow).  It said something I didn&rsquo;t quite catch, but the last words were &quot;the gun.&quot;  When something startles you, your natural reaction is to fly up, and that&rsquo;s exactly what I thought I was doing, when I had what I call a &quot;time gap.&quot;  In the split second I was turning to see what had spoken, I found myself flat on my back vertical with my bed with my right arm extended upward.  It was pitch black (though my light had been left on), and I strained to see the tips of the fingers on my extended arm.  I was paralyzed, but not in pain.  My whole body had an electrical current running through it (like when your leg goes to sleep).  I was stunned because I had no recollection of coming into that position.   I thought, how did I get like this?  Then something else began to happen.  Up to this point, I thought I was lying on the bed.  I didn&rsquo;t realize I was actually levitating over the bed until my body, in a perfectly straight form (with arm raised), began slowly moving counterclockwise.  When I felt the bed sheets grazing my back, I knew I was the one moving and not the bed.  In a 180 degree position (cross with bed), my body would be longer than the width of the bed, so my head and feet would stick out in the air.  As my head cleared the bed, I literally felt my hair FALL off the edge!!  That was when ALL doubt left me as to the reality of what was happening.  This was NOT a dream!  Reaching the 180 degree mark with the bed, I stopped, then began moving back the same direction I had come.  When I was vertical with the bed again, my whole body dropped (including my arm) onto the bed.  I was released from my paralysis, though not from the electrical current.  In a panic, I reached for the phone on my right, but it had no dial tone, just a loud buzzing sound.  I threw it on the floor.  I then leaped out of my bed to the left side and landed upright on my feet.  I was going to run out of my room to my mom&rsquo;s across the hall.  I took one step and looked! up all at the same time.  I stopped in dead fear because instead of my bedroom door being there, there was a very black hole (tunnel like) in front of me.  It was already pitch black, but this hole was blacker than black.  I was too scared to go forward, so I decided to yell instead.  When I opened my mouth to yell &quot;&ldquo;mom,&quot; my voice was electric and it came out like I was holding a vibrator to my throat.  The sound scared me so bad, I threw my hand over my mouth in utter shock.  At that very moment, I had another &quot;time gap.&quot;  In a split second, I was back on my bed, turned to the left, head on the pillow, light dimmed, just as I was before the whole event happened.  I spun around and looked at my whole room.  My phone was back in the cradle, and only 10 minutes had passed on the clock, though I felt like it had been at least an hour.  If you saw or know anything unusual that happened in my area during the time mentioned, please let me know.  This has bothered me for years.  Thanks, ((name deleted))((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "Triangle up close.  Uncharacteristic thoughts in my mind.I remember this as if it were yesterday.  Please note that the month, date and time are approximate.  I&apos;m fairly confident of the year, however.  At the time I was working in Manassas and was on my way home to Shipman.  To break up the monotony of the long drive, I would often times take back roads home.  This time I turned off US 29 toward Rockfish.  I saw the craft for the first time about two miles before I reached Rockfish. Skies were clear and it was almost, but not quite full dark.  I was about 1/4 mile from a small hill directly in front of me.  I noted what at the time I thought was an airplane moving direcly away from me over the hill.  I could make out distinct red lights.  This would be about 1/2 the size of a thumb nail at arms length.  I expected the &quot;plane&quot; to disappear behind the hill.  All the while I&apos;m getting closer.  Just as I expected the craft to disappear, I saw the craft cross between the top of the hill and my car.  That&apos;s when I realized the craft was coming straight down.  At this point I was directly in front of the hill and I see this thing start to fly horizontally through the trees.  At this point, the size would be about two hands held at arms length.  It had three red lights forming a triangle.  For some reason, it reminded me of the back end of an automobile.  The third brake light was still novel at this time.  I distinctly remember thinking &quot;Hmmmm.... I wonder if there&apos;s a road up there and this is the rear of an automobile.&quot;  Now this thought is riduculous; I just saw this thing come out of the sky and fly through the trees!  I just shrugged it off and drove on.I drove through Rockfish.  (This hardly qualifies as a town, just a railroad crossing and a couple of houses.)  I was on my way toward Shipman, somewhere near Ball Mountain.  This would be approximately 5 to 10 minutes later.  This thing flew right over my car!  It filled the entire windshield!  It floated across the road from right to left.  It was a perfect equilateral triangle defined by blood red lights in each corner.  These lights would be about three or four feet in diameter, and there was about 30 feet between the lights.  It was just above the trees.  I&apos;m guessing there was about 40 feet from one side of the road to the other and it took several seconds to cross this distance.  I watched this thing float away and it kind of followed the terain at treetop level and had a very peculiar way of moving.  When it changed direction it would point one apex into the direction it was moving.  This appeared as a small rotation.  I continued to watch this thing for ten to fifteen seconds.  By this point, I&apos;m turning around and looking over my left shoulder and was just creeping along.  It finally went out of sight and I drove home and FORGOT IT!  Literally!  I was sitting around talking with my wife, Dad, and Sister and in passing the subject of UFO&apos;s came up.  At that point I suddenly &quot;remembered&quot; the event and described it to my family.  That was also the first time I felt frightened.I started driving this route home every night after this event.  Two more events of note occured.  One night about three miles from Rockfish, I again saw this triangle shape just hanging motionless above another ridge.  This time, however, the corner lights were yellow.  The craft appeared about the size of a thumb nail at arms length.  I stopped the car and got out.  Like my initial sighting, I had the distinct feeling that this thing was aware of my presence.  I watched for about twenty seconds and this thing did that peculiar rotation and descended behind the ridge.  Another night, in the vicinity of Ball Mountain again, a jet flew over the car and it was LOUD and LOW!  It really made me jump!  Now we don&apos;t typically see jets flying low in the mountains at night! It has only been recently that I figured out what was so peculiar and may account for my feeling of being watched.  At all times when viewing this object, it appeared as a perfect equilateral triangle no matter how it moved in relationship to me.  If it were a flat object with lights on the bottom, you would expect the relationship of the lights to change as this thing manuevered.  This was not the case.  If it were a flat object, it had to keep one face focused on me as it moved around i. e. it was aware of me.  I even thought that perhaps the object was a tetrahendon, but the the same argument still applies.  I have never seen this observation descibed in other &quot;triangle&quot; reports.  Have you? I did start having bad nightmares after this event and would wake myself up screaming.  They do not happen as often anymore.  I have no idea if they are related to this sighting.  One other odd thing.  I have never been able since to exactly pinpoint the spot near Ball Mountain where this thing flew over my car.  A couple of spots look almost, but not quite &quot;right.&quot; Believe me, this is NOT a hoax.  It really happened.  I have a degree in physics form the University of Virginia and now work as an aerospace engineer in Charlottesville.  This thing has haunted me for years and I thought it was time to share it.

This experience changed all that.I live in downtown vancouver in a highrise on the 16th floor. I was just about to tune on to the simpsons(that&apos;s how I know the exact time) when i saw this flying object over the the buildings in front of us. At first I thought that it was just the light of one of the cranes on the construction areas. I knew it could&apos;nt be a plane because first of all planes arent supposed to be that close to the city and after watching the planes that go around here everyday I ve almost memorized their paths. second of all the lights in this craft werent flickering or blinking or anything they were just constantly beaming a hazy sort of wierd whitish/yellowish light. I kept looking at it for a while and thought what the hell could that be could it be a blimp? At first I didn&apos;t see the 3 lights on the corners of this triangular craft until it very very slowly and I stress SILENTLY without the smallest sound just hovered towards my building. I mean anything made by man that flys only 500 meters away has to make a sound. by now I had called my brother cause I thought my eyes were fooling me. As the craft got closer we realized that it was no plane but some sort of triangular craft because it passed exactly a couple stories over my building and we were looking at the bottom of the craft and saw it&apos;s structure and there was a red light in the middle of it (the sterotypical red light, I know) I was just astonished and ran for my camera I kep searching for the damn thing in my messy house and eventually found it and took one lousy picture which I have no idea on how it will turn out. My brother is my witness and all those who know me know how much of a skeptic  and disbeliever I am.I then ran downstairs yelling that there&apos;s a UFO outside and nobody believed me i ran and saw the craft. suddenly instead  of going on it&apos;s horizontal path it went vertically straght to the skies and turned into a star and stayed their for a while and then left.

While I&apos;m on the phone I tend to look out at the sky and clouds.  Today I looked up at a contrail and immediately noticed something moving near it -- a pinpoint of light, like a satellite, but obviously a satellite can&apos;t be seen during the day!  The light was on a very steady trajectory from N/NW to the S/SE, moving about as fast as a satellite would.  I thought it might be a mylar balloon, as it was moving in the same direction as the cloud-level winds but slightly faster than the clouds, which were higher (i.e., the light was seen against the cloud backdrop -- it was partly cloudy).  But within seconds, I noticed another light, following in a straight line behind it, and I put my fist up to see how many degrees apart they were.  If my fist is 5 degrees, which is what I remember from astrophysics class, then they were about 2 or 3 degrees apart.  Then I noticed a THIRD light, equidistant from these two, so that they formed a string of three star- or satellite-like lights traversing the daytime sky.  I watched until they disappeared to the left from my window view -- a few minutes.  Because there was sun in the east, I could have been seeing a reflection off mylar or other metal, but I couldn&apos;t say with certainty that they were not self-luminous either.  And because they travelled in a straight line and were equidistant, I find it hard to believe they were mylar balloons, unless they were connected by a very long string!((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM SAME WITNESS))Correction to reportThis is a correction to the report I made on 1/31/03.  For one thing, I may have entered 1/31/02 by accident, but it was 1/31/03, the same day I reported it.  Furthermore, I had forgotten that a fist-width at arm&apos;s length is 10 degrees, not 5, as I guessed in my initial report.

I spent some time since our submission visiting the Web site to familiarize myself with it.  You have a very interesting and tremendously challenging job!  I have a whole new awareness and appreciation of the job sorting out UFO&apos;s etc.  It definitely requires a certain personality, intelligence and integrity.Our experience has definitely changed our life.  I always thought it was other people who saw those types of things (i.e. comets and things flying in the sky).  It felt really good to know that there are people that we could call after having that kind of experience. So you might pass it on to the powers that be that the arrangement that you have with the local authorities in our experience was a highly effective one from our perspective.Best Wishes to you.Until next time?????((END))", "We saw a disc-shaped object with a row of blinking lights traverse the sky silently, rapidly, and repeatedly.My friend and I were walking towards a carnival in the parking lot of Belmont Hills Shopping Center (located on the corner of Windy Hill Road (then Cherokee Street)and Atlanta Road in Smyrna, Georgia in the late Spring of 1974. I glanced up into the sky above the shopping center (the sky was dark, probably around 8 p.m.) and observed a disc-shaped object with a row of sequentially blinking circular lights traversing a large angle of the sky repeatedly. This back and forth path covered an angle of maybe 80 degrees or so and was at a low altitude; maybe 150 ft or so above the shopping center. Since the sky was dark the lack of reference points made a size estimation difficult, but it appeared maybe 6-8 feet in diameter. The object was totally silent and rapid in its motion. It was witnessed by a couple walking away from the carnival.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

This man, a logging truck operator left the town of Houston driving up the Morice River Road heading approx: 100 kilometers out across the Reach to pick up a load of logs. He went on to say when he reached the 30 kilometers mark on the Morice River Road,  he witnessed  &quot;one&quot; bright white light high in the sky heading in his direction. As the light got closer to him, he watched the light split up into two parts, with both pieces flying in different directions. He said one part went west and the other east. What was so amazing was that the two lights shot back up into the sky and disappeared. The sighting lasted approx: 6 to 7 seconds at the most.He was so surprised and excited at what he just saw, he got on the trucks radio and asked other drivers on the road if anyone had witnessed what he just did. Two other drivers who were in the same area reported back to him that they also witnessed the same thing.HBCC UFO Note: I have the name of one of the other drivers and will be speaking to him tomorrow to take his report.

Above the stack, and I believe some distance behind it, I saw two or three red lights. At first I thought it was an airport antenna, but then realized I had never seen one in that area, and I looked again, and noticed the position of the lights had changed, and they appeared to be coming toward my direction. I then saw about 4 more behind them, in a straight line, and still moving toward me. I tried hard to listen for the sound of an engine, or helicopter blades, but there was none. I ran to the intercom of the building, and yelled at my friends to get onto their balcony and look up in the sky toward the foundry. I then ran around the back of the building, below their balcony and pointed up to where the lights were. There were 7 or 8 red balls, moving silently, and quite slowly, (perhaps 2 or 3 miles per hour), some were moving up and down, some would &quot;fall back&quot; and the one behind would move ahead. They were not blinking, and again, I cannot stress enough, they were ABSOLUTELY SILENT. By now they were directly in front of us, and steadily moving past us in the sky.I have no idea how high up they were, but from a layman&apos;s visual standpoint, they looked a little smaller than a soccer ball (if I were to hold one in front of me). They proceeded toward a nearby lake and conservation area, and we jumped in the car and tried to &quot;follow&quot; them, however, they continued travelling (south west to north east), and disappeared over the horizon. We went back to my friend&apos;s apt. and called the radio station, and when we finally got through, the person answering the phone said &quot;Are you reporting the red lights in the sky?&quot; They  said their phone lines were &quot;lit up&quot; with people reporting them. I believe it was the following day on the local 6pm news (Kitchener Ont.) that the anchorman reported the lights had been reported from the southern US to northern Quebec. Also,  he ! said tha t a Regional Police Officer, or an OPP, had stopped his car and got out to look at them, but he claimed they were the Snowbird Jet Team, flying to some air show. However, they did not appear to be attatched together on any surface, but were definitely separate, and while &quot;interchanging&quot; their positions, almost touched each other. A couple of them would go up and seemingly wait (hover) until the ones below moved ahead far enough until they could drop into the middle of the formation, or at the back. Some of them seemed to &quot;circle&quot; backwards to change positions with each other. I have never reported these lights before, have never seen anything remotely similar (or anything disk shaped or otherwise unidentifiable in the skies), but when I looked at some of the reports listed on your site, I saw a pic or illustration of the red balls I saw, except the ones on your site are in a &quot;V&quot; formation, and these ones were not.

Soo.. after I changed to go play HALO at a friends house I witnessed the last part of the sighting.  My brother was with me and I was about to get into my car when I saw the same two yellowish white lights coming from the right of the trees this time I watched it for about 10 seconds then noticed no sound and told my brother to get out of the car and look at this, he did and by the time he got out of the car it was over head and had three yellowish white lights in a perfect triangle , as it went over head I couldnt hear anything, but as it was past us to the North we started to hear what sounded like a low frequancy jet type sound but very quite and very low.I was exstatic because I have witnessed a triangle craft that to me was a UFO.  After we calmed down we started to drive the two miles to our friends house and on the way about halfway, we both witnessed another strobe search lite craft, I was alot closer this time it and thought it might have been the tail guy saying OK your through everything back to normal in the sky?? After I started thinking about it for a day I got to thinking the first strobe object we saw might have been the clear craft to clear the way for this huge triangle craft and the last strobe craft was to close the line so to speak or bring up the rear. Kind of like an over sized load on the freeway with the start car and the back car maybe, now if that is true then what we saw was probably human craft but MAN was it kewl and ill tell you alot kewler then the old stealth bombers!! ohh one last thing I forget to say at the time the triangle craft was over our heads my cat jumped into my car and refused to come out of the back, I was starting to get weirded out because I had to drag him from the back and hold him, he was shaking and apeared scared? maybe someone has some insite on what is REALLY going on contact me at ((e-address deleted))", "A soucer dissapearing infront of our very eyesMe and my daughter where heading back home from a christmas party some time around midnight, we were driving down the highway and we saw some kind of glowing object high in the sky, we began joking around saying that it was ufo (thinking it was an airplane heading towards us and making it seem like a ufo from the bright light). We kept on looking at it and we freeked cuz it wasn&apos;t moving, so we desided to follow it, it looked like a bright light, but after driving for about 10 min it began looking like somekind of a saucer, we stopped on a quiet street watching it for about 3-4 min huvering in mid air about a 1 km over the ground, all of the sudden with great speed it zoomed down to the ground, ending up about 500 meters away from us and about 50 meters off the ground. It was there for about another minute or so and then all of the sudden it went into a big flash leaving us blinded from the light for about 2 seconds and then when we focused back in that area it was gone.

It hovered there for a bit then zoomed off at an extremely high rate of speed not seen by normal aircraft and disappeared.  A few minutes later, another one appeared, but this one was a bit further away.  The first one was almost directly over us.  I lived in the Kill Devil Hills section of this area, which might have been about milepost 9 or so.  The other interesting thing was the woman I lived with was holding her dog, a Yorkie terrier, and the dog looked in the direction of the craft and was growling, which was not normal behavior for the dog.

My sister and I were driving up a hill by a field with a line of tall trees on either side of the road in a very rural town.  There are no street lights, so it gets very dark and clear.  Out of nowhere a bright yellow-white spherical object shot across our field of view, right in front of us, covering the arc of sky we could see between the trees flanking the road  (about 20 degrees of sky)  this occurred extremely fast (a few seconds at most)  but long enough to tell that it was a discrete spherical glowing object traveling horizontally.  It appeared similar in size to the moon, but a little brighter  (not blinding).  There was no trailing tail or &quot;halo&quot; around the object...I&apos;ve grown up in this town and seen plenty of fireball meteors (good viewing, no city lights) and this was nothing like them, I knew it the instant I saw it.  Given its speed and size, I guess it was going several hundred miles per hour no more than a hundred feet over the trees.  I was really impressed by how fast it moved.. that I especially remember.  And thinking it simply couldn&apos;t be some very large, distant object...it would have to be moving insanely fast to have the same effect, then.

I make that assumption based upon my knowledge of how far the city of Sabastopol is from Santa Rosa. Using the lights of Sabastopol peaking through the fog as a measuring stick I would have to say the object was close to being at least a mile across.Now unlike other alledged sightings this object did not have any flashing lights.I thought it strange that it wasn&apos;t illuminated like the fog or lit up at all.It was like light had no affect upon it.

The smaller spheres sort of exploded off the large sphere in all directions except in the front of it. I watched this whole thing as I walked slowly home. The spheres never changed speed but it was a constant quick pace across the southern sky. I was able to view this event until the speres disapeared over the eastern horizon.

I have read extensively about this &quot;project&quot; online and in news sectors. Apparently the US military is developing a laser-based high energy beam system for disrupting/destroying satellites in orbit, they are also developing satellites with optic shields to prevent the same happening to our own. My guess is what people are seeing are tests being conducted on orbiting satellites and nothing more. Theoretically, a beam of concentrated light is fired at an orbiting satellite in the hopes of disrupting sensitive onboard navigation systems, thereby rendering it useless. By the same token, we are also protecting our own from the same possible fate by shielding any and all sensitive gear, including optical lenses, etc. It&apos;s just a guess...but seems likely. Any project requires some form of testing.((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE TO WITNESS))Dear Mr. ((message deleted)), Thank you for your message and comment. I suspect our government is working on high-energy lasers, and other beam weapons.

Since we live in a big city here, I&apos;m absolutely facinated by the dark country skies to which every star in the sky can be seen, so as usual I was looking up at the stars through the front windshield and passenger window while my husband was driving. I immediately became aware when I saw the red flashing lights out of the corner of my eye.  You know those Christmas lights they call &quot;chasers&quot; that you can set the speed of the flashing by a remote near the plug-in?  That&apos;s what these lights looked like, very fast and rotating around the the circular perimeter, it was hard to miss.  With my mouth wide open in complete awe, I grabbed my husbands arm and said &quot;LOOK at that!&quot; What direction in the sky were they sighted? We were traveling North, and the lights were moving from east to west.Did you use any binoculars or use eyeglasses to view them? No sir, I don&apos;t wear glasses and we didn&apos;t have any binoculars unfortunately.How were the lights strobing like quick short flashes, random around the circular perimeter? They were flashing rapidly (red)in a rotating fashion (like the lights were chasing each other) around the circular perimeter. I&apos;m not sure if my eyes weren&apos;t just getting blurry from staring so long at these things, but I thought I might have seen them change colors once or twice, to the color of white, very quickly as well.Did you stop and get out of your vehicle to watch at all? Unfortunately no.  I wanted to but there were 16 inches of snow on the ground (there were no place to pull over because of the snow drifts from the plows)and it was 9 degrees out that night, and we were late getting to our next destination.  We just drove very slowly observing them from the windshield of our mini-van.Have you seen any ufos before this sighting? Yes, but these two were very different from the other time.  The first time was about 1993 in Kokomo, IN.My mother and I were getting some groceries out of the trunk of her car (sometime around 9PM I suppose, it was over 10 years ago) when a triangular object with 3 big red lights on each point of the triangle (the lights weren&apos;t flashing) passed low in the sky right over our heads.  It was about the size of a football field and moved silently. It was made out of some kind of black metal and had some kind of groovy patterns on the underside. It flew just above the trees and was so low that we could see these patterns. I don&apos;t remember much about being 15, but I&apos;ll never forget that.  It was my curiousity in researching if anyone else had any similar experiences with both of these types of craft that led me to your website.Did you tell anybody you visited about the sighting? No. We were travelling with our roomate and her 5yr old son at the time to visit my husbands grandmother.My roomate and her son were asleep in the backseat of the van, and I didn&apos;t want to scare them.Did they tell you if they have seen or heard about any ufos in their area in the past several years? My husband&apos;s grandfather used to watch them from the front porch of the same house we were staying at when my husband was about 10yrs old (he&apos;s 24 now).  Oddly, every Tuesday or Wednesday (it was one day a week at relatively the same time at night, around 9PM) it would appear in the same place in the sky.  The front door of the house faces to the east and the craft could be seen from just above the trees.  He passed away in 1995, and has been known to watch this thing once a week for years while he was alive. I heard this directly from my husband.Are you or your husband from Missouri? I&apos;m originally from Indiana, and my husband and I live in Virginia Beach due to him being stationed here in the Navy.  He&apos;s from Nebraska. My husbands family is from Missouri though, and his grandmother still lives there, whom we were staying with for the holidays.One more thing to add....  They were stationary when I first noticed them, then they began circling around each other very rapidly while moving from east to west and west to east again across the sky...sort of like they were playing or dancing. There were no other aircraft in the sky, and it was around midnight at the time.  There were no other cars on the road at the time either. We watched them for approx. 10 minutes, then they began to dim, or maybe get farther up into the sky so that they appeared to be dimmer I&apos;m not sure, but then they just vanished.I would like to thank you for sharing your similar story with me.  I&apos;m glad there is someone out there who saw the same thing and I know Im not crazy now.I&apos;ve never shared either of these experiences with anyone else, besides my mother and my husband out of fear that they would think I&apos;d lost it.  But I know in my heart these were not aircraft I was seeing, planes and jets just don&apos;t move like that.

It was a clear blue sky outside and I was sitting in the backseat between my kids looking out the windows.  I was looking around when I saw a white spot in the sky out the left window.  At first I thought it was a plane, but then I noticed it wasn&apos;t moving.  Further in the distance to the right of the object I saw an airplane flying leaving a white trail behind it.  This kind of helped me notice it was not moving.  Then I thought I might be a star, but it looked to big for that.  Plus the plane and this were the only two things in the sky that I could see.  No other stars.  Looking at it I noticed there was a sort of white, cloudy smoke around it.  Almost not noticable.  The object looked like someone took a pencil, dipped the eraser in some paint, and tapped it on the sky.  The color of the object looked like the same color white a very thin cloud might have. I was looking at it, and wife asked me what I was looking at.  I said I didn&apos;t know, and she made a joke that maybe it was a ufo.  I pointed at it to show her and told I didn&apos;t think it was a plane because it wasn&apos;t moving.  She looked but said she couldn&apos;t see it.  I looked at her, told her look where my finger was pointing, and looked back out the window where I was pointing.  It was gone.  I looked all around where I had seen it, but I couldn&apos;t see anything.  It was like it was never there.  I looked away for only 1 or 2 seconds to make sure my wife was looking in the right direction.  The car hadn&apos;t started moving yet, and the airplane was still in site.  It happened very quick.  But it was bigger than the airplane for sure.

It raises the spectre of whether the interesting video footage, taken from a helicopter to the west of Manhattan, might have been hoaxed by people in the television and entertainment industry.  We are not surprised that this might be the case.  When a dramatic event, the likes of which are shown in the video footage, actually occurs, NUFORC usually receives numerous telephone calls and written reports from other witnesses in the vicinity of the alleged incident.  In this instance, we received none.  Moreover, those in possession of the video tape did not contact us, either, or generate any type of formal, written report, which describes the alleged incident.  From our experience, this absence of information is more consistent with a hoax, than it is with a genuine sighting event.

FOX News did not show the clip.  I waited to see it again so that I could run it through the VCR and try to slow the sequence, unfortunate there was no follow-up.What I saw (brief seconds) was the shuttle with a bright object (whether cloud reflection or otherwise) close by.  Although I did not witness the &quot;dark&quot; objects streaking by (and cannot confirm source direction) - within a split second I saw what appeared to be a small &quot;burst&quot; coming from the vapor trail of the shuttle.  The bright object (nearby) seemed to &quot;disappear&quot;.  There were no further frames after that event.My first thought was: &quot;there is something wrong with this picture&quot;.

However, I do believe in life beyond our planet and no, this is not a report based on my being an X-Files fan. I did not have any alcohol in my system and what I and my fiancee saw was as real as these words I now type. We had extremely cold conditions tonight due to the freeze that has hit much of the south. My fiancee and I were leaving our home at 1850 hours CST to meet a friend for dinner. We are both college professors, lest anyone doubt the validity and reality of what we saw. We live on the east side of the city where few if any street lights are lit. Our driveway runs north/south. We were walking from our north facing front door to my sedan to our right (east). My fiancee said, &quot;Look up, the stars are so beautiful.&quot; I did, and at that moment as were looking toward the eastern sky, approximately 60-70 degrees above the horizon we saw what appeared to be another bright star, only moving. This light (star) moved to the left (north) of the constellation Orion. I knew the constellation well--Orion&apos;s belt and his inverted triangular upper point stars and his lower standard triangular lower point stars. This star-like light seemingly moved slowly north. It had no trail of a comet, did not travel quickly and leave a streak as a meteor or meteorite. The moving light was as bright as the surrounding stars, moved awkwardly, but mostly in a straight line. This star-like object did not blink in patterns as an airliner might, was not blinking red and green as a lower flying aircraft, it just stayed aglow. Then as it appeared to travel north-northeast, the light diminished in intensity, then faded as if losing power? switching itself off? or climbed higher out of the earth&apos;s surrounding atmosphere into space. The light flicked out. There were absolutely no clouds in the sky; the heavens were clear. We went to dinner shaking our heads, but we both agreed that the object we saw was real. In fact, when we arrived at our dinner location, we looked u! p toward the eastern sky again and saw two aircraft, one flying high and blinking its steady strobe flying westbound and we witnessed another low-flying aircraft with visible red and green lights as a comparison to our original siting. I truly believe what we saw was not an aircraft, meteor, meteorite, or satillite. This object had none of their characteristics. I hope other individuals saw this event in this part of Louisiana because I never would have believed this as a young boy, but I definitely can attest to this sighting, as well as my fiancee, that it was perfectly and absolutely real. We are still discussing the event even after telling our dinner friend; NOW, we are having a glass of wine.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the object may have been the ISS/Space Shuttle.

I was asked to empty the teapot and make a new one for our guest.  I took the teapot out the back door to empty it and as i looked up in the sky i was freightened to see these two massive bright yellow teardrop lights (not pulsating). These two objects had their larger ends facing each other and the smaller ends appeared turned up resembling the cartoon devil eyes.  It was hard to determine if it was one ship and these were the windows or was it two ships.  The sky appeard so dark around these lights.  3 tiny lights were in between the larger ends but unable to say wheather or not they may have been stars.

She said it was reflection of the moon.

I have not talked about this experience much in my life because its sounds like a little boys dream. A little history about my family. I am one of 17 children, 8 older and 8 younger. This happened one summer morning. My brothers and sisters slept in the upstairs of the house. There were 2 rooms a boys room and a girls room. The bed I was sleeping in that night was up against the east window. This bed had a old rot iron head board that you could see thru. I was awakened that morning from a voice that kept saying wake up over and overuntil I was awake and sitting up. The voice then said look out the window, which was open. As I looked out the window I noticed that there was total silence. This time of the morning there are usually chickens, birds and other animals making some kind of noise. The voice then told me to look up in the sky. It was pre-dawn and just starting to get light. As I looked up I noticed a bright star or light about 45 degree from the horizon in the middle of the sky. As I watched the light it moved verticly down to the horizon then all the way up to the top of my vision, about 90 degree from the horizon. It then went back to the center of the sky and moved horizontal to the left of my vision then all the way to the right of my field of vision and then back to the center of the sky. The sun came up then and the light disapeared. I looked around the room and my brothers wwere still sleeping. This experince scared me so bad that I ran down stairs and climbed in bed with my Father and Mother. My mother woke up and ask me why I was shaking so bad. I said I had saw something and was scared. I have often thought about this experience and wondered if I was having a dream or nightmare. To me this was real and not a dream. I was awake and aware of what was going on around me.

I believe it was in early September but I&apos;m not positive about the date only the occurance.  It was either &apos;75 or &apos;76 and had to be late in tne year because it was cold!  We had a small camp trailer there and also an old bedstead which you could put a mattress on so you could sleep outside if you wanted.  The girls chose to sleep in the back of our new Datsun pickup and we clamped a sheet on the roll bar to the tailgate so they would be warmer as the wind was really cold.  They were sleeping and we were hanging a sleeping bag over a clothes line which hung above the head of the bed where we were going to sleep as a sort of windbreak also. It was about 11:00 P.M. and a crystal clear night.  All of a sudden the sky lit up like it was 12:00 noon! We looked toward the east to which we had a perfect view of the mountains of Yosemite amd sailing across the sky at a rapid rate was the biggest fireball I have ever seen in my life!  Not thart I have seen any before or any since this thing was HUGE and it was whistling and had a huge, long firey tail!  At first I thought it was lightening until we saw it!  I litterally thought the sun was falling out of the sky!  It takes some time to register these things because you don&apos;t believe your eyes!  I am glad someone was there to see this with me. So this huge fireball sailed from the east to the north towards Mariposa and we watched it for about 20 seconds or less even until it HIT somewhere over the mountains to the north of us.  When it hit the whole ground shook!  So as we were watching over where it had hit with our mouths hanging wide open before we could say anything here comes right over the top of us three lights in a triangle pattern.  We could not tell if it was one huge object or three fkying in formation.  I finally spoke first as by then I was totally freaking out and said what the ! F--- kin d of plane is that but I knew when I said it, it was no plane.  It or they or whatever made no noise what so ever and they were almost grazing the tops of a couple pine trees next to us.  The light in front (one in front and two behind) glowed bright white and the two behind were an odd blue green color. As they flew over a couple oak trees going from north to south, we ran along side through the trees which took us about 5 seconds till we reached a clearing where we could see the whole sky and all the horizons and they were totally gone!  No noise, no nothing!  We spent the whole night trying to decide what to do.  Should we tell someone?  Should we call the cops and what the heck are they going to do?  We asked a lot of people if they saw anything-it was so hard to miss as it was lit up like broad daylight!  During those years, though, the area was very sparsely populated.

I will read about you experience at NUFORC. This experiene happened off the coast of Vietnam in the Tonkin Gulf during the Vietnam war. At the time I was in OI division (Operational Intelegence). I was a Radarman/Electronic counter measures and also trained as a lookout, so I had good observational skills. I was on duty on the 010 level, which is as high as you can get on the ship.

I called CIC, Combat information center, to see if they had anything on radar. They reported that they did not have anything on surface or air radar in that area of the sky. The light seemed to hover in place for about 1 min then shot over head stoping off the starboard aft at about 10 t0 15 miles and about 30 degrees off horizon. The speed was so fast thar it left a streak of light as it traved through the sky. The distanced traveled was, we guessed, about 20 to 30 miles in about a second or two. Being in ECM I knew what air craft the U.S. and U.S.S.R had at the time and nothing could match the maneuvers this light was doing. We called down to the bridge to see if they had anything on there radar and to report it to the duty officer. They reported no contacts in that area either.

(There may have been a whistle sound but not postive of that).(Weather at the time was a totally clear blue sky with no haze and since we were next to a 2 story apt. building the sun wasn&apos;t high enough in the sky to be seen over the roof).A teardrop shaped object flew over us at about an 75-80 degress angle of elevation above the Southern horizon moving east to west. It appeared to be emitting it&apos;s own light source and was uniformily white in color. The light was a very pure white but did not glare. I recall trying to see any detail but could not. The perceived size was larger than a full moon but there was no way we could determine how high it was nor the actual size and speed. I had the impression for some reason it was at least a few thousand feet up. There was no contrail left nor any pieces falling off and no change in direction, velocity, shape and color in the short time we witnessed the object. Afterwards my father and I we wouldn&apos;t report it and as far as I know there weren&apos;t any reports of a sighting in the area in newspapers.While hardily an expert I do know that the object was not a plane, bird, cloud, balloon, bolide meteor, or Venus.

PD))I noticed the attached photo on the index page of your site.  About 25 or so years ago I saw a remarkably similar sight over my house near the Mississippi River in New Orleans.  I had a small telescope set up for observation of a total eclipse of the moon that was occurring that early evening.  My father was visiting, and I called him to come see these mysterious lights that were moving over us apparently very fast in a wedge-shape or V shape formation.  But they were out of sight before my father could see them.  About 10 years later, when I was leaving work on Canal Street in New Orleans, I saw a similar sight.  I was alone again, and it was just after sunset.  But this time just before the &quot;lights&quot; disappeared from view I saw that they were actually high-flying birds of some kind - probably geese.  I had been convinced for years I had witnessed a &quot;real&quot; UFO and would have dismissed as impossible any attempt by anyone to tell me these lights could be birds who were flying high enough to reflect the light of the sun even though to us in darkness at ground level the sun had already set.  But I saw with my own eyes these mysterious lights resolve into something not so mysterious at all - or at least not any more mysterious than everything is all the time.I&apos;m not trying to convince anyone that the lights in the attached photo are birds.  I don&apos;t know.  I can only say that what I saw looked exactly  like that.  I have several relatives who are solid people with their feet firmly on the ground who have told me of things they have seen for which I see no ordinary explanation - things that certainly were NOT high flying birds - a star, e.g., that is very bright and suddenly breaks into several smaller stars that shoot out in different directions and then return to form a single star again!  One of my relatives swears he saw such a sight one night many years ago in the deep woods and swamps of central Louisiana - and I believe he did.  So I know there are things happening that we can&apos;t explain in any ordinary way.  I wouldn&apos;t at all be surprised to find in the near future that we are able to confirm in some way acceptable to most people that some of these phenomena are in fact extraterrestrial in origin.  But I think we owe it to each other to be as accurate as possible in our observations and to exhaust all ordinary explanations before entertaining thoughts of any extraordinary ones.Much thanks for your wonderful web site.((name deleted))", "bright orange flashing lightI was taking photos of the sky down on the local beach when I saw a very bright flashing orange light but I didn&apos;t see from where it came.

I was slightly surprised but I have seen tumbling satellites b4 and also the NOSS triplet so I assume that it was a tumbling piece of debris.  The only strange thing was the colour and the fact that the photo I have shows it turned slightly, but I put this down to atmospheric refraction.  I have never seen an orange satellite but it could be that this object was reflecting a space sunset?  It also faded away which I assume was it entering the earth&apos;s penumbra.

I turned to look at it properly and it had a rotating sphere on the underside of the craft, the reason that I know this sphere was rotating was because there were smaller spherical lights on the underside of the sphere (and on the underside not on the side or on the lip!) and these lights were moving round what seemed fairly slowly.  the rest of the underside disk appeared to be dark with no real discerning colours. the top of the craft was a golden orange colour and more of a block shape, with no protrusions or other lights there were no sounds eminating from the craft, and I only saw the craft for 2 - 3 seconds.it basically hovered there and with no noise at all moved away with extreme pace, it also left a brief golden orange light trail.

The object itself was about three times the size and brightness of Venus on a clear night. There were maybe 13 &lsquo;rays&rsquo; coming from the object that spanned approximately 25 degrees of arc (it was huge, anyway I couldn&rsquo;t cover it with both hands at arms length) and were equal in brightness to the object, uniform in thickness and length, and absolutely &lsquo;steady&rsquo;. In other words, they did not &lsquo;waver, change color, or vary in any way until the object &lsquo;exploded&rsquo;.

I quickly found a turn-out, stopped the car, and my father and I got out and sat on the hood of the car to watch it.As objective as I&rsquo;ve tried to be it&rsquo;s impossible for me to judge the time we sat there watching this. I have to say maybe 20, even 30 minutes, although it felt much longer.After it had crossed 2/3 of the sky, it &lsquo;exploded&rsquo;. I say exploded, but I really don&rsquo;t know what it did, it was so beautiful and inexplicable. Suddenly the &lsquo;rays&rsquo; disappeared like a light switch being turned off at the same moment a &lsquo;ring&rsquo; of fuzzy light expanded rapidly from the object (which at that moment retained it&rsquo;s size and brilliance) and, in about 2 seconds time, vanished out of sight over the horizons and into space. This &lsquo;ring&rsquo; lost about half of its intensity during this expansion.Then, VERY slowly, like the unfolding of a six petaled flower, the object itself began to expand: As it expanded, in perfect symmetry, it rotated very slowly. This phase of the experience lasted maybe 5-10 minutes. It continued to rotate and expand in graceful majesty, slowly growing dimmer and dimmer.By this point the &lsquo;lines&rsquo; of the &lsquo;flower&rsquo; were becoming fuzzier and less distinct. Until it filled the entire sky from horizon to horizon, although by this time it was extremely dim, like a fog or vapor, with the &lsquo;lines&rsquo; only barely visible.And then it was gone.What was it? I don&rsquo;t know. It felt somehow &lsquo;alive&rsquo; to me&hellip; like the creature in the first Star Trek: Next Generation pilot movie. It didn&rsquo;t seem like a &lsquo;craft&rsquo; exploding because of the perfect symmetry. The speed with which it was moving gives me the feeling it was quite distant, above orbital range, perhaps as far as lunar orbit, but I am no physicist.The local newspaper reported on it the next day, and I suppose many people saw it, although I&rsquo;ve never spoken to anyone who did. They said it was a Soviet rocket stage re-entering the atmosphere. Maybe it was, but I don&rsquo;t believe it.

I climbed out of the camper, out of the truck, and into the parking lot. I looked up for some reason or another, and I saw three pinkish-red lights. They would zigzag around, and then stop in triangle shape, and then zigzag around again. Then they suddenly disappeared, and I ran into the truckstop and told my parents what happened. They dismissed it as a dream, but recall me telling them about it. I was only four, after all, and I didn&apos;t know what aliens or UFO&apos;s were. But I believe I have been abducted multiple times since them.In the summer of 1999 I had a surgery on my right foot, because it hurt all the time and the doctors&apos; x-ray showed something in it.

As I pulled out I noticed a very bright object in the eastern sky. At first, because of its location directly above the sun, the object appeared to resemble a bright ball of light in the sky.  But after a few seconds the object started to move to the northeast revealing its true shape, which resembled a cigar. The object was tilted at a 45 degree angle as it moved through the sky. I can only guess the altitude or distance it was from us, but from what we saw it was a very big object.  It continued to move east/northeast and eventually disappeared. I did not literally see it disappear or shoot off towards the eastern sky, I discribe it this way because I turned my head to yell at my wife, who was in the garage, to look at the UFO and as I turned back to look at the object it was gone.

As he describes, this craft was a triangle/chevron shape. It had one light at each point of the ship, for a total of three lights, which did not blink, as most aircraft running lights do. The craft was at an altitude of approx. 800 to 1,000 feet, and it was moving slowly to the north. This craft made no sound, which my husband found to be quite odd, considering it was flying so low. Another observation he made was the fact that there is a strict no-fly zone in effect over the entire shipyard and naval base. Did anyone else see this?", "I was driving  with my daughter. It was dusk but getting dark quick.My daughter noticed it first. It was a big dark circle with a little dark circle behind it like a tail but not connected. It was flying thru the air at a good speed and steady. It flew right over us. It headed North east. I chased it in my car. I couldnt believe it. I tried to rationalize. It was not a big bird. It was not a mini jet. It was not a weather balloon. It was not an ultra light. There were no lights and absolutly no sound.

( it was not a year since 9/11, and there had been talk that our locks could be a target).  anyway, it started floating up again.  it took about a minute or two to jerkily float upwards and then zoom back down toward the water.  this repeated many times, and continued for about 15 - 20 minutes.  i dont remember it disappearing, it just sort of vanished.  it was extremely unusual.i did not report this at the time because i did not know of this site.  i actually thought there would be others who had seen this and there would be a report in the news or paper about it, and i would come forward and confirm it at that time as well.  but nothing was ever said and my husband thought i was &apos;nuts&apos;.  but i cannot forget this, it was very strange, and nothing that i can explain.  i also thought i may find something in this site about someone else who had seen this.  i am not sure of the date.  i do know it was early summer of 2002, in the mid to late evening.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was a fine day with no rain or thunder that day but about 20% scattered light white colored cloudes. While I was watching, a black cylindrical cloud formed, about 3/4 of a mile long and about 100 or 200 yards thick. This was the first cylindrical cloud I have ever seen, and the ends were almost square. It looked like a cigar shaped cloud.   Have you ever seen a smoke ring blown from a cigarette? Well next a cloud shaped like a smoke ringformed, about 400 yards diameter. This smoke ring shaped cloud formed directly over one end of thecylidrical shaped cloud. This stationary smoke ring shaped cloud looke look like a single coil of rope, and was rapidly rotating like a smoke ring, with an active torroidal shaped flow. It was rotating at about one revolution every 45 seconds. The cloud ring was rotatintg so that the inside of the hollow, cirular shaped cloud ring was moving downwards and the outside of the cloud ring moving upwards, so I assumed while watching, that it must be very cold in the centre of that cloud ring.  The cloud ring was directly above one end of the cylindrical shaped cloud, and then some flashes oflight appeared between these two clouds for one or two seconds and then a clear sphere shot out from where the flash was.  The sphere curved upwards to the left and then disappeared or dissolved from sight. It retained its shape while it disappeaared, it did not shrink, but disapeared in a fraction of a second. The spehe was in view for about two seconds. I found it hard to believe what I was seeing.  After 20 or 30 seconds another flash of light and another sphere shot out and curved up to the right and disappeared like the first one. Then several more flashes of light and several more spheres shot out in similar fashion at 20 or 30 second time intervals. Each sphere went in a different direction. All the spheres came out at about mach 5, so that they covered a mile in about one or two seconds. All came out straight and then curved away. This was all happening about three or four miles from me, about half a mile up. The third sphere left a black contrail, a mile or two long. This contrail was very black in color, just like the very black cylindrical shaped cloud, and not like the white clouds elsewhere in the sky. These were the only black clouds in the sky that day. The smoke ring was white in color. The contrail left by the third sphere started where the spheres appeared from and exactly followed the path of the sphere. This contrail formed in one or two seconds but remained for some minutes, showing the exact path of the sphere. None of the other spheres produced contrails. About six spheres came out in total.   I did not report this untill after I read that other people had seen similar spheres. The color of the spheres seemed clear or silver, it is hard to describe the exact color. They appeared to  be about 30 or 40 meters in diameter. After the last sphere came out the smoke ring shaped cloud stopped turning and the cylindrical shaped cloud and the smoke ring cloud both disappeaered within two minutes, so the total time from appearence of the clouds to disappearence was about 7 minutes. These were not saucers or elipses or triangles, but perfect spheres. When they disappered, the retained their shape and size, and did not disolve by getting smaller.", "spotted bright object in clear night sky going slowly due NNW and disappearing in a fast graduating fashion.I left my apartment to visit someone and as i was warming up the car on a clear night, i looked up at the stars and suddenly noticed a brightly lit(white) object that was moving slowly NNW.

It was then that we stopped tormenting the babysitter (who was trying to get us down off the roof) and just sat there, watching this dim and yet bright yellow oval shapped object just hover, suspendid in animation over a small hill coverd in pine trees.At first, i thought it was some kind of bird or plane, because i remember seeing something similer a few months back.

Before I had time to think she yelled &quot;oh my god&quot; and we all started running back to the house.  When we go to the porch I looked out from under the over hang and saw a large diamond shaped craft flying just above tree level.  There was a bright headlight colored light on each corner with a red light in the middle that had a red beam shining out and rotating around.  It was grayish in color with no apparent seams.  The sound was similar to an electric razor hum but not as loud.  It flew about 5 mph in a straight line with no sudden movements or turns.  We watched it until it disappeared from sight.  My best guess is that it was about twice the size of a football field.  We try to get my friends parents to come and look but only her little sister came out.

The orb did not seem particularly defined but it did emmit a very clean,bright white light that I would describe as dazzling.  The orb was not moving very fast and I was able to watch it for several minutes as it passed over the field i was in. The Orb headed over a wooded area to the south west of me and then stopped dead, then a small pinpoint of light broke away from it and proceded to dance erratically around the orb performing manouvers that I would imagine any conventional aircraft would find impossible. This carried on for several minutes until the pinpoint dissappeared.  The larger orb remained stationary as I began to walk home with my back to it.

I would say Summer).  The time of day was approximately early afternoon.  I was working on the second floor of a two-story building of a satellite office of a major corporation in Dickson City, Pennsylvania.  I was sitting at my desk, which faced a row of large non-shaded windows.  As I looked up from my work, I saw out the window an object that was moving nearly laterally through the sky.The object was dark in color (I would say flat black.)  It&rsquo;s size I would estimate as that of a small plane (say a Lear Jet) I saw no details, no markings, no marker lights, no windows, etc.  The object did not even appear to have any reflections or glare.  It was chevron in shape, like a wide &quot;V.&quot;  (There was no &quot;tail&quot; or any other protrusions.)  Each of the 3 &quot;tips&quot; of the &quot;V&quot; came to a point, with the widest section being (using this example) at the nadir of the &quot;V.&quot;  I would say the angle of the &quot;V&quot; was about 100 degrees.The object was moving (nearly) from left to right from where I was (now standing) by the window.  It was approximately one quarter, to one half mile away from me.  It was &quot;flying&quot; with it&rsquo;s &quot;wings&quot; perpendicular to the ground (like a plane would normally fly), and the bottom point of the &quot;V&quot; was pointing in the direction of it&rsquo;s movement (like it was the &quot;nose&quot; of the vehicle).There was no exhaust or contrail.The sky that day was partly cloudy, with a good base to the clouds (in other words the clouds did not vary much in elevation, the base of each cloud was at pretty much at the same elevation).  The sky was light &quot;sky blue&quot; in between the clouds.  Other than the clouds, the visibility was unlimited.I do not know the objects elevation, but it was flying just below the cloud layer, because the craft would every now and then &quot;skim&quot; the bottom of the clouds.Its speed appeared to be approximately, one and a half, to two times the speed that a &quot;Piper Cub&quot; type airplane would fly at, at that distance and elevation.It was completely rigid in its motion.  In other words, it did not increase or decrease elevation, or speed.  It made no wobbles or movements of pitch, yaw or roll.  There was of course, no flapping motion (it was NOT a bird in my opinion).  It&rsquo;s flight was completely steady.From the moment I first saw it, I watched it for about 10 seconds, then turned to go to my office door to see if anyone else was close enough to call over and see it with me.  No one was there, so I immediately went back to the window.  I was away for approximately, 3 or 4 seconds.When I got back to the window, it was a little further along its flight path, traveling in the same manner as I have already noted.Then I noticed another object, exactly the same type as described, coming from the other direction (180 degrees from the first objects direction), and it was traveling in the exact same manner as the first.  It appeared to be on an exact collision course with the first object.When the objects got almost &quot;nose-to-nose&quot; with each other, they proceeded to do one &quot;loop-de-loop&quot; around each other.The &quot;loop-de-loop&quot; was accomplished by each craft, by increasing elevation.  (If you remember the old &quot;Hot Wheels&quot; toy car TV commercials with the yellow &quot;Hot Wheels&quot; track and how the miniature cars would do a loop around the track, that is how these objects each appeared to travel around each other, but in opposite directions.)  The &quot;loop&quot; was not vertical.  The plane of the loop, would have been at about a 50-60 degree angle, using the ground as the base level for the angle.  (The objects were still at their approximate elevation, just that the angle of the loop&rsquo;s plane, compared to the ground, would have been about 50 to 60 degrees.) The size of the diameter, of the circular type loop that each did around each other, I would estimate to be approximately twice the length of the distance between wing tip to wing tip, of one of the objects.After completing the &quot;loop-de-loop,&quot; each object continued flying in the same matter as I originally described, on each of their respective original courses.I watched each object until both were out of sight.The entire event, lasted from first sight to last sight, approximately 40-50 seconds.Immediately after seeing this, I quickly noted the time, date, and estimated the angles, etc.  Then I sent email to a local TV station, asking if the weather department knew the elevation of the cloud layer that day above Dickson City, PA was.  The station never answered my email.  So subsequently, I was never able to calculate the altitude, distance, or speed of the objects.  Moreover, since then, I cannot find my original notes.  This is the FIRST TIME I am reporting this to anyone.Thank you.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Im guessing between 1 and 3AM this event occured. I was laying on my bunk bed which was placed against the wall, which right on the other side was my baby sister. Her crying not only woke me up, but my parents also. And in a minute i could hear my stepdad walking across the hardwood floor of the living room to tend to my sister. I awoke facing the wall inches from my face. I turned on my opposite side to get more comfortable and i saw something standing two feet away from my position in my room. I had not a clue as to what it was. But whatever it was it was not there when i had gone to sleep. It was as tall as my bunk bed, so i was horizontal with the upper portion of it. i was very scared, frozen into staring at it. I saw no discernable features, it didnt move, but it definately was smooth (skinned?) cuz the only light from the fishtank around the corner allowed me to see it well enough. I stared for five minutes while right around the corner my stepdad tended to my sister.

I hadn&apos;t been in bed long when my mother called me to look at something out the window with my friend, who was also witness. I looked out of my bedroom window and seen a hazy orange glow - it was obscured by the screen, so I went for a closer look out of the living room window, from which it could be seen in perfect clearness. The sky was clear with a few clouds, none of which were near what we seen.It was a round orange ball in the sky across the road and field to the west in front of our house, above and diagonal with the treeline. Not at all like a meteor, which most people would think of when I describe it, as it wasn&apos;t a &quot;ball of fire&quot;; It was bright and light orange; the edges were even brighter, a red-orange. My mother, who had been watching it for longer and when it was higher in the sky, said there was a half-ring of darker flickering &apos;fire&apos; on the left side (I couldn&apos;t see this, because it was hidden very partially by the trees). It was very smooth, lacking any pock-marks or lights, metal sheen or anything at all but smooth orange, unlike most &quot;UFO&quot; sightings I&apos;ve read about...it was nothing I&apos;ve heard of before. It was perfectly solid looking, emitting no glow. It was large, or seemed pretty big, although to give a description of the size is difficult. Looking through binoculars, it was a definite sphere.At first, I thought it might be the moon -- but then I realized... the moon isn&apos;t full. In fact, it&apos;s only in first quarter. The majority of what we seen would have been the side that is DARK. Later on that night (morning), my mom seen the moon nowhere near where the orange circle was, high in the air, and white, to boot.It was moving... very slowly, diagonally downwards and to the right, further into the trees - it didn&apos;t look like it was moving unless you watched closely. When it was in the trees, it noticeably paused. Although it was difficult to tell, it looked as if along with the trees in front of it, the circle also obscured the trees behind it, but it&apos;s hard to say for sure. It stayed there for a moment...an orange glow in the forest (though it didn&apos;t actually glow)...and then went *staight down*, quickly -- not light-speed, but about five or six times faster than the sun sets and disappeared out of sight. As I was thinking of running for the camera, that&apos;s when it went down. In retrospect, it was rather pretty, but at the time, it gave off no such vibes... there was an eerie quiet and still. None of the traffic that had been going by drove down the road the entire duration of the sighting, but started up again only minutes after it disappeared... probably a coincidence, but it added to the feel of there being something wrong here. We contacted the coast guard and they reported no other sightings.", "Brilliant red light above Panorama City, in the San Fernando Valley, CaliforniaAt approximently 22.35 pm I sighted a red light in the sky, after driving for about a half a mile the red light was still in sight.

My son turned the northwest and said, &quot;Look at that light!&quot;  I turned to look, and I saw a oval-shaped cream or beige colored light moving from the northwest to the southwest.It was about 20 degrees to the left of being directly overhead.  It also appeared to be the size of 5 to 10 average stars, and as bright as Venus at a close approach to earth.It was moving in a straight line and moving much faster than a satellite.  We saw it coming toward us, pass us and move away from us, and there was no tail or trail whatsoever.  During the time we watched it, its outline remained highly defined.After it passed us and traveled some distance away from us, it suddenly accellerated and moved rapidly forward and to the side at the same time.  It made a scallop-shaped trajectory somewhat like tracing the fingers of a glove.  At the top of the third &quot;finger&quot; it instantaneously disappeared.My son and I sat down and compared impressions of what we had just seen, and they were almost exactly the same.  While we were talking, and approximately 5 to 10 minutes after the sighting, several (5 to 10) jets flying without navagation lights, but with afterburners on came from the northwest along the same path the light had traveled.  When they reached the approximate spot where the object had accellerated and began the strange sideways movements.  They broke and buzzed the general area for a short time, then left.The incident left me with several impressions, but no facts to back them up.  I believe the object was very high in the upper atmosphere.  I also believe that a human being could not have lived through the movements this object made just before it disappear, and the speed was so great that the pursuit jets had no chance of even keeping with with this object.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

There was a fair amount of cloud cover in the sky, but pretty bright due to the city lights.As we neared the object we were able to look up at it and see it in silhouette against the clouds.  The object was a perfect triangle.  My companion pulled off to the side of the road and we got out to the car to look at it.  Several other motorists also stopped to see it.The object had white and yellow lighting -- initially these lights were blinking and running along the back side of the triangle only.  After watching the object for approximately 20 more seconds it began to move slowly southward toward San Francisco, and as it did, all three sides of the craft lit up.  These lights were blinking and then moving in a sort of pattern around the edge of the craft.Approximately 5 seconds after it started moving, the craft disappeared (in an area where it still should have been completely visible and free of the clouds).((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said today that this did not constitute a ban on all lanterns.&quot;It is not a blanket ban on all lanterns as we understand the requirements and traditions of the Chinese community. But we have to regulate the practise and indentify the type of lanterns which are suitable.&quot;The huge air-borne ones caused some serious problems when they were released near the Bayan Lepas airport in Penang. We cannot allow this to go an as it poses a serious threat to aircraft,&quot; Abdullah, who is also Home Minister, said.Pointing out that such huge lanterns could cause fires if they were blown onto houses, he said police would come up with clear regulations on lanterns soon.&quot;I will inform the police about this and they will go into the details of the matter, including approaching tanglung makers and relaying to them the problems that had cropped up,&quot; Abdullah said when responding to media queries on the issue.He was speaking at a Press conference at the Home Ministry after chairing the Cabinet Committee on National Competitiveness (CCNC)&apos;s second meeting today.The Kong Ming lantern issue made headlines after 12 evening flights at the Bayan Lepas airport were forced to be diverted last Saturday due to the runaway being littered with the lanterns.The airspace near the airport was also reported to be filled with the hot-air lanterns that night.Following the incident, Penang Chief Minister Tan Sri Dr Koh Tsu Koon called on the Federal Government to impose guidelines on the release of such lanterns while Penang police chief DCP Datuk Arthur Edmonds suggested that the lanterns be banned.&quot;What happened in Penang is serious enough for us to impose some kind of a partial ban on certain kind of tanglung. Malaysians must know to enjoy themselves but not create things that endanger the the lives of others. That was the same reason why we banned firecrackers,&quot; Abdullah said.((END COPIED ARTICLE FROM THE NEW STRAITS TIMES))", "I saw a stationary light fade in and out for fifteen minutes and could see with binoculars this was a large craft with bright lights.I notice large, bright light in same spot fading on and fading out.

It was somewhat cigar/diamond/elongated shaped and appeared to be rotating like a football in flight. It was not anything that I had ever seen before, or since. The object was also moving at a tremendous amount of speed and I cannot say for sure if it was changing colors or if the rotation was causing the sun to reflect off of the hull in a brilliant white light. The object, from my best guess, had to be approximately 35 to 50 thousand feet up, and once it started to move southward, it moved with a speed I have never witnessed before.

I was out in my front yard and just looking around and at the area where the rock breaking machiner was, and I saw a long, cigar shaped craft not far off the ground and it was huge.  I rather remember it being brownish-red in color.  I never mentioned it to anyone, after all I was eleven and who would believe a child and even adults are not often believed.  I have never spoken about it, let alone written about it.  Reading reports and making note that there are cigar shaped crafts made me decide to make mention of the fact that I had, in fact, seen one.  This was quite a long time ago and, since I was a child, I cannot readily remember how long it was there.  I do remember, however, that it was hovering, standing still in the air and that it was huge.  I think I saw what appeared to be windows as well and they appeared down the length of the craft.  Since it has been over forty years ago and I was rather young, that is about all I can recall of the event.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))((FOLLOW-UP FROM WITNESS))I am sure it was not a dirigible or blimp or baloon.  It was very low in the horizon as I remember and it was more longish rather than roundish as a blimp tends to be, although I have seen blimps with lights that could have fooled one into believing that they something else until seen clearly.  It was quite a long time ago and I have always remembered it as I have always been one to read books on UFO, science fiction, mythology, theology, etc.  I am a bit higher than normal in intelligence and I don&apos;t imagine seeing things so far.  I am not great in remembering names, but extremely good at remember faces and events, some events are almost cellular and/or visceral in their recall; remembering conversations, emotions, scenes of events, textures, etc. What I recall was a longish, cigar shaped (which really threw me because all the movies about UFOs showed disk shaped objects - War of the Worlds) object suspended not too far off the ground, at horizon level, it was rather flat there, unlike where I live now (not too far from the Hollywood Hills).  It appeared to be a brownish red color and really long.  I didn&apos;t stick around too long and, more than likely, went inside.  Uncommon events tend to make one unsure of the true nature of things and since I was only about 11 years of age, I had nothing to relate what I saw to.  I tucked it away in my memory banks and there it has stayed until I started reading some of the sightings listed on your site.  I never realized others have seen flying cigars also.

Kentucky...On the morning of November 23, 1996 I was driving alone and witnessed a large triangle type of UFO. The craft appeared to be a helicopter from a distance but as it got closer I began to realize that it was not a chopper at all. It was very large, at least 300 feet from corner to corner. It had three large lights on the bottom located in the corners of the triangle. Two white lights and one red. The red light was in the front of the craft as it led with that corner. The lights were bright and did not contain a hot spot. They were uniformly lit and I would estimate that they were at least 12 to 14 feet in diameter. As I said before the craft got closer, in fact it hovered above me for about 3 minutes. It was about 100 feet or so above me and was totaly silent. It was low enough that the light from under the craft was actually bouncing back off the ground and illuminating the underside of the craft. I was able to see that the craft had a flat black type of paint. Exactly what you would see on the F117 or the other stealth vehicles. I was able to notice a series of rectangular panels that were surrounded by rivets, they reminded me of a traditional aircraft like a large jet for instance. If you look at a large jet you will notice what I am refering to, they are covered with rectangular panels that are surrounded by rivets.The craft hovered above me and I was truly amazed by it. I did flash a peace sign with my gloved hand through the sun roof which was open. After about 3 minutes of hovering I began to think of the numerous abduction stories that I had heard about or seen on TV &amp; how people would say that something approached them and then the next thing they remembered an hour or two had passed and they are on their way home. As this thought began to scare me I reached down to start my car and when I looked back up the craft was gone in an instant. I did not experience any lost time or witness anything that would lead me to believe that this was of alien origin. It has taken me many years to feel comfortable enough to share this publicly online as I know what I saw was real. I am also aware that very few witnesses have reported any kind of details relating to the panels with rivets that make up this craft. I have not seen it again since that night in November 96. I hope this story allows anyone else who has seen it to realize that they are not the only one out there who has had this thing come down on them and hover.

This is my first known sighting.  I was on the oceanside of the beach club checking the club&apos;s beach access boardwalk.  I routinely look up and down the beach for small boats or boats out in the ocean because there is a lot of drug smuggling along what is know as the Treasure Coast of FL.  It was clear and the sky was full of stars.  In fact, I believe that night there was an alignment of planets, the moon, and earth going on.  I saw a light on the horizon of the ocean, almost due east.  I at first thought it was a fishing boat out on the gulf stream.  However, I noticed the light seemed a little high off the horizon for the mast of a fishing boat.  It was pitch black out there and all of a sudden, the light shot up into the sky going very high.  It looked like an amber star, a small star or one that is very far away.  I of course was astonished and began observing it.  It appeared to be stationary in the sky then all of a sudden it would move right, then left, and made loops like a helicopter.  This went on for awhile so I went back to my cruiser and got out the binoculars, 10X and focused them as best as I could looking into the black background.  I could tell this object emitted it&apos;s own source of light and had red areas on it&apos;s surface.  Sometime, when it would move I thought I could tell it was oval in shape, but I can&apos;t be sure.  I went to the beach gate house and had another officer go out on the beach and observe the object.  He came back stating, &quot;that thing is dancing.&quot;  I observed it later while locking up the building, standing on the second floor balcony of the beach club.  I locked my arms in a bi-pod position holding the binoculars in one position.  The object would move out of my field of view and come back.  I went on with my duties and at 0230 I looked for the object again but it was gone.  The next two nights I saw the object in the sky, almos! t due ea st, about 45 degrees from the horizon.  The third night I also noticed one, maybe two more objects at the same altitude that looked like the first object.  They were spread out going south down the coast.  The reason I am reporting this is because I believe my sighting is almost the same as two others on this board, Mokena, Il and McKinleyville, Ca.  I will say this, if I hadn&apos;t seen the object shoot up from the horizon into the sky, I could tell myself that these objects were stars and their movements could be optical illusions.

The sun was already below the horizon but the sunlight lit up the contrails a brilliant white. The clear sky had a reddish hue near the horizon.  The three aircraft were flying different directions and the three flight paths formed a triangle.  I then noticed a very bright light in the center between the three planes. The light was circular and apparently motionless and seemed to be the same altitude as the planes.  The light had no contrail.  The planes were so distant that I observed no motion[only over a period of time as with a clock&apos;s minute hand].

As ikt was getting closer the light got brighter and at its brightest moment it seemed to have hit somthing, like it bounced off and started goimd backwards on a 45 degree angle towards the sky as it was doing this the light started to stretch then it vanished. When I was first sall it I thought maybe it was a military plane with the landing lights but I imediately dismissed that because there was no noise, then I thought maybed it was a meteor or a shooting star again I dismissed those accounts as well because I never sall a light in the sky look like it hit somthing and bounce back in the opposite direction. The object was moving fast  dont know how fast but as quick as it came it vanished. I&apos;m sending this now because when it happened I didnt have a comp. I hope I,m not the only one who sall this.

The object was a luminiscent pale green orb with a thin, bright yellow rim and short, sharp tail.  It was early morning with dawn just breaking.  The mountains on the horizon were dark silouettes.  I was facing east and it moved from north to south and it over the mountains to the southeast, which were many miles away.  Witnesses reported this sighting to a Dr. Lincoln La Paz, who, I believe, was a professor at the university of New Mexico.  It was speculated that this nay have been St. Elmos fire.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It left very abruptly, then the electric went off until 4:00am. I was again woken by our microwave beeping when the power came on. I looked out the window again and saw another object but a different shape and only blue and red lights flashing very fast. I saw it only for 30 seconds or so then it left.

My mother realized that my brother and I had not put out the garbage yet and it was getting late.  It was about 10 or 10:30 at night.  so we put on our winter coats and headed out.  My younger sister wanted to join us she was 9 years old I was 10 and my older brother was 14years old at that time. As we walked in the snow covered ground and slippery ice the night sky was beaming with stars. We had too walk down the long driveway to place the garbage cans out for tomorrows pick up by the garbage trucks. enroute we ran into a friend of my brother who lived two houses behind ours.  He would take the short cut home often cutting threw our backyard.  He helped us finish throwing out the trash, but there was one can stuck in the deep ice. My brother kept chipping away at the ice with his boots to free up the garbage can as we three were talking about school.  my sister than tried to get our attention.  She said there was something over head flying towards us, but we payed no attention to her. Again she said I think you three should look up to the sky theres something flying towards us.  But we were so focused in trying to free the garbage can that we payed her no mind and said it&apos;s probably a plane.  Her voice then became alarmed and she screamed! Look straight up above us.  We looked up to see a craft hovering above us it was maybe 100 yards over us 16 ft. in diameter with a reddish pink like lights that flashed around it with a blinding white light at the center of it that would flash on and off as it hovered above us it seemed to get closer too us and it would pan up and down slightly causing the perfect circular lights to appear as a semi circle.  Now from that time on we don&apos;t remember what happened.  All I know is we found ourselves looking around for the craft.  It somehow disappeared on us.  Until our friend said there it is, it&apos;s right over your garage roof.  The craft hovered over away from the garage roof took a slight altitude flight. made like a letter z ! formatio n and shot out of sight into the night sky with a woosh sound with such velocity that no jet plane till today could achive leaving behind a trail of two flourescent green laser like lights with a red and white light ray within the two laser green lights that slowly dissolved in the air.((NUFORC Note:  Interesting report; date is approximate.  We have requested that the witness attempt to have his brother and sister submit independent reports of their recollections of the event. The case is very similar to a report we received in December 1994 from a mother in Traverse City, MI, in which she described how her children, who had been out sledding, came rushing in the house in their underwear, babbling about the disc they had seen hovering over them.  The next thing they knew, the disc was in another part of the sky, and they found that their outer clothing was neatly folded and stacked on their sleds.  The mother was alarmed by the situation, and reported that she knew something peculiar had taken place, because it was unthinkable that her children would fold and stack their clothing in neat piles.

Disapeared when military craft aproached.January first, 2003. Driving on rout 8 from West to East, having passed Yuma about 15 to 20 miles behind, we noticed a bright white ovoid object to the North, above the mountain range.  I mentioned the fact to my family; my wife and two teenage daughters, and we started to speculate what it could be.  We quickly discarded that the object could be a plane, blimp, weather balloon or cloud.  What was odd was the apparent size of the object and the fact that it was stationary, floating or hovering in the sky. I stopped on several occasions during the next half hour to photograph the object.  Traveling at an average of 80 miles an hour, we were able to see the object for over 50 miles, and still distinguish it clearly. The shape looked a little different from this latter angle, a shade appeared in the middle of the object that looked more cigar shaped than previous. We thought that it could be two ovoid shapes together or a peanut shaped object (see photos).   At approximately 10:10 AM two military craft were coming in from East to west over the highway. I assumed that they were military because of the fact that they were leaving vapor trails, and were flying side by side, a formation civilian planes do not oftenly practice. At seeing these planes, I asked my girls to see what the UFO would do and they mentioned that it had disappeared.  Because the mountain range was low in comparison to the height of the object, the fact that we were on a straight away, and the fact that we had observed the object moments before, we concluded that in fact it did disappear and was not obscured by the scenery.", "11/19/02 Lumberton, NC Diamond shape with 4 dull green lights flying from S to N @ 500 ft made no sound.On or around the 19 Nov, 02 I was driving on a rural road outside lumberton NC proper. It was dark outside but it was clear and the stars were visible. Although there were many trees around there was an open field around me for at least 500 to 700 meters. I saw out fo the corner of my eye an object with no other lights except a dull green color. I know that most aircraft have red, and plain white lights with at least one blinking light on either wing. The object was at least 300 to 400 meters ahead of me flying at least 500 feet or tree top level from a south to north direction. I pulled over on the side of the road and noticed through my sunroof that the aircraft was diamond shape with 4 dull green lights at each corner. There were no discernible details ofthe aircraft but I could see its shape against the sky. As I rolled the window down the aircraft had already crossed my path, but I heard no engines or propellers. The aircraft just left without a sound. I have just fin ished a 20 year hitch in the Army, I have jumped out of C130, C141, and other rotary aircraft and know what they sound like. But this aircraft left no type of exhaust or other sound signature behind. I never beleived in UFOs untill now. Ft. Bragg and Pope air Force Base are only 50 miles away, but their aircraft fly through this airspace all the time.

It appeated to be spinning and hovered for about 15 minutes.I was going to be and happened to look out my window. I saw an unusually bright star i the western sky. This one appeared to have been spinning with colors that I could make out to be red, yellow, blue and white. I called my husband and he came and thought it was a star. We both went out side with a video camera and taped it. It appeared to be the only object in the sky at the time meaning no planes or helicopters with flashing light. It just hovered in sky for about 15 minutes. All of the dogs that live around here were barking. It was really cold so we went inside. I got on the internet to see if there had been others who had seen it. It had been about five minutes since we had come inside and my husband told me it was gone. we went back outside and it was gone but a similar object was now in the eastern sky.((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witnesses observed.  However, if it was not distinctly below the clouds at any time during the sighting, we feel that the first possibility to be ruled out would be a celestial body, perhaps a twinkling star, or a planet.

We were unsure so I ran into the house and grabbed the camcorder so we could zoom in on it.  It would go large with viberant colors (blue,red,white,and kind of a purple)then it would go into a small white dot. We do have this on tape and also another sighting that was on the show Extra, back in 1999.  There was an expert that check the tape out to find that, we did not make it up or do any creations from computer or the image inhancers.((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the large image was due to the fact that the &quot;AutoFocus&quot; function may have been left in the &quot;on&quot; position.

Then noticed that it was so bright white but not blinding &amp; unlike any light I ever saw, didn&apos;t have heat/distortion waves &amp; was a perfect, uniform brilliant white.  I was going 65 in the fast lane &amp; there was a car 10&apos; ahead of me also traveling the same speed on the slow lane.

I continued to watch but saw nothing else.  It was the neates thing I ever saw!!((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))", "A large illuminated cigar shaped object glides over head in front of me - no sound at all.The date and time (mid-1970&apos;s) has blurred over the decades but my memory of the event was as clear as a crystal bell. Some of my older friends had an out door party on a dam near a spillway. They left beer cans out which I came back later to clean up.  As I was leaving I looked up to see the beautiful stars - a stillness came over me.  In shock I saw a very large cigar shaped craft glide silently  over head in front of me.  The silence was thunderous if you know what I mean. I could not believe my eyes and my brain was having a hard time trying to process the 1-4 second experience.  The speed was probably 100 miles an hour plus and moving parellel to its length as a plane would. Without good triangulation the exact size and distance of the UFO (Unidentified Flying Object) can only be estimated.  Using my eyes depth of  field I estimate the object to be around the size of a mid to large jet airliner. The shape was an absolutely perfect cylinder with domed ends (cigar). It was  slightly illuminated in the darkness and ~ a third of a mile away (45 degrees angle up). The direction was north-east. I was walking on the dam&apos;s path going south. There was no wings or other indications to assume that it was a jet or airplane.  (I had made a hard choice to give up all cigerettes, alcohol or drugs  long before that night  so you can rule out intoxication.)  That is my experience to the best of my ability and I make no claim as to what this event is or what it is not.I beg the reader to take in but not judge either way several other experiences I have had that are more difficult to describe dealing with experiences at night  after I went to bed.  In the early 1970&apos;s (during puberty -and hormones) I do remember going to bed, starting to feel very heavy then the walls in my room would &quot;breath&quot; (not scary). Then I would find my self in a series of 3 absolutely hopeless hynogogic experiences.  In one I was tied across railroad tracks with a speeding train an inch from hitting me then I was balancing on a long needle that balanced on top of a radio antenna that was on top of the Empire State Building and the third experience I blocked from memory in the last few years.(I called the 3 situations &quot;the tourture&quot;.)  Then still in a groggy state I would walk (sometimes run) out of the house for real and go for 10 minutes.  Coming out of the groggy state I would be outside as far as a third of a mile away from my home in my underwear (much to my extreme embasasment). My mother would sometimes find me yelling-wide eyed as If I was trying to get away from someone.  I would go back inside but it would take an hour to shake off the strangness of the whole thing.  This happened in the exact pattern maybe 20 times, then after a trip to a psycholigist and 6 or so relaxer pills the experiences ended abruptly never to happen again.  Over the decades I have had  ET dreams : one human and one short elder &quot;gray&quot;. who communicated wordlessly using either an instructional 3d image projected over my minds eye with a force of emotion that shook me to my core.  My common sense tells me that all the experiences are related but I am the first to admit that the dreams and night walks could be due to my own illusions or projections (in essence nothing to do in anyway with the cigar craft my eyes saw.) I also have no negative feelings toward ET&apos;s etc. quite the opposite.  I realize that if they are real then there is a whole range of them just like there is a whole range of humans positive and negitive.I try to keep an open mind and my mouth shut but I continue to hear people I have become friends over the years describe their own Richmond UFO experiences.  They have no intention of reporting their own experiences and I can&apos;t blame them.  Their body language and tone displays honesty and openess.  On this issue I also have seen hypnotic eyed -very animated folks go off on cart-wheeling flights of pompas fancy. On another extreme I have seen stiff necked ultra myopic &quot;scientific&quot; skeptics roll their eyes in their own pious pomp.   I take both with a grain of salt.  Most people are neither extreme as they are open and are a pleasure to relate to.  I am thankful for this important web site.

I told my sister that it was an UFO behind her, and we rapidly ran to open the balcony in order to see it closely. But it was not necessary, because it was very clear to see. It was a really big one. Like a half moon but bigger in diameter. It stopped for a while, maybe 2 or 3 minutes in front of us, until it started to move from west to east and dissapeared. While it was happened, I called my brother, who lives in other place but in the same area (South Miami). He went outside, and he could see the same fenomena.

As we peered up we saw three fireballs, orangish in color, moving into various formations: vertical , triangular, and horizontal patterns. They did not move any  farther or closer during the four minutes that we saw them. They stayed in the same posistion in the western sky moving around in these semi-controlled patterns, and the night was clear as a bell (no clouds reflecting anything).They were 2-4 times brighter than the brightest star. Then, suddenly, they aligned so that we could only see one light. One of them appeared to drop quickly from the sky like a bottle rocket being shot downward, leaving a trail of sparks, then another, and the third just disappeared. Before all this ended I grabbed my video camera and managed to get about 30 seconds to one minute of tape. It certainly backs up my descrioption of the event, although the color off the fireball is absent. I am also aware that Vandenburg airforce base is in the direction we were looking, about 90 miles west/northwest of our location, and I have seen rockets launched from there numerous times. This was defintely not consistent with those. I have lived in  the Burbank/Glendale area for 32 years and never seen anything like this.

I thought this was a bit strange so i got up to have a better look. Still moving left. Then it changed a really bright white colour and it was about 4 or 5 times bigger than it had been before. I dont know if the actual craft changed shape or if the light was so bright that it made it look bigger than what it was but this could certainly not be a plane. After a few seconds it when back to flashing white in the smaller form and turned direction and headed to the right. Now i know this could not have been a plane because planes cannot chnage direction so ubruptly. After a while it headed in a direction diagonally down and to the left. It then started to flash red again. After it continued in this direction i lost sight of it because there were trees to block its view.", "Blue/green comet like object leaves orange trailI was sitting on the deck with a friend on Christmas evening, facing west, when we saw what might be space junk.

It was a cold still night, and I was singing along to a cassette of the &quot;Mamas and the Papas&quot; on my car stereo. I just passed over&quot;Stephentown Creek Road,&quot; when something in the sky caught my eye. Ahead of me and to the right, just above the tree line, I saw two round white lights. They were much bigger than any stars and they appeared to be coming towards me in a south-west direction. I checked my car mirrors to see if any other vehicles were on the highway. There weren&apos;t any, and I immediately slowed my car down to about 10-15 km/hr. As the two lights approached it looked like big bus headlights in the sky.  I thought to myself,  &quot;What kind of a plane or helicopter has two white lights like that?&quot;  I&apos;m not too knowledgeable about aircraft, but I&apos;d never heard of anything with two big white lights. Then I noticed that there was a smaller red light blinking between the two white lights. It started on the inside of the left light and &quot;blinked&quot; its way to the right light, and continued this pattern back and forth. At closer look, I realized that there was also one small red light that stayed consistently lit next to the right white light.The object was flying slowly and just over the treeline (approximately 2-3 telephone poles high). I quickly checked for traffic again, and then flicked on the high beams of my car, because I thought it might help me get a better look at this thing. I didn&apos;t stop the car, but I was driving so slowly I was barely moving. I couldn&apos;t believe my eyes; it was a black equilateral triangle right ahead of me above the road. The triangle was exactly even and equal in length on all three sides and each of the three angles. There was a large white dome light steadily &apos;glowing&apos; at each of the three points. Each of these round dome lights were about the size of a half-volleyball. None of the lights were actually shining a beam of light on anything, or even casting a radiant light for that matter. I could no longer see the red blinking lights at all, and I wasn&apos;t sure if these glowing dome-lights were the same lights as the headlights or not.I quickly put my window down and stuck my head out. As it passed over my car I got a very good look at the bottom of the craft. It was flying point-first towards the Kingston Mills Locks area. The black triangle was actually very dark grey and almost shadow like above a very distinct 3-Dimensional black shape directly attached to and under the triangle. It looked like something out of a Star Trek movie! It actually had arrow-like points at each of the three corners. After the point, the shape made something like a small inward rectangle, then outward to a larger rectangle shape, back to a small inward rectangle, and then to the next point. Each side was exactly symmetrical to itself and to each other side. It struck me how slowly it was moving (maybe 40 km/hr), how low it was, and how small it was... it would easily fit in a school gymnasium.The next thing that crossed my mind was that perhaps it was some sort of military stealth-like plane. I thought whoever that is, is so close they can probably hear &quot;Dream a little Dream&quot; playing on my stereo. I considered turning the radio off, but I didn&apos;t bother. Maybe it would draw their attention to me; then another thought crossed my mind; would that be a good thing or a bad thing? What about a real UFO; and possible abduction? I didn&apos;t feel scared, though, especially since none of those &quot;stereotypical&quot; things happened to my car. No stalling, or dimming of lights, or weird radio noise. I noticed two sets of car headlights coming towards me from around the next corner of the highway. I thought, &quot;Good, those people have got to be able to see this thing too!&quot;  I felt better that I probably wasn&apos;t alone in the &quot;sighting&quot; and I just continued around the corner. The strange craft never stopped or hovered, just continued slowly on its course towards the area of Kingston Mills Locks. I did not see the craft from behind. I looked at the clock in my car, and it read 6:21. Since my clock is set exactly 8 minutes fast, it would actually have been 6:13 pm. I noticed the next street sign that read &quot;Isle of Man Road&quot;. The whole incident probably lasted less than two minutes.I was very excited about what I had seen, so I explained it and sketched it out for friends immediately. They asked me what it sounded like. Sound had never crossed my mind. I told them that I did have my stereo on, but I didn&apos;t notice any sound at all coming from the aircraft.  I also made note that I hadn&apos;t noticed any sort of big wind or anything like that. It was certainly a bizarre experience, and I will certainly never forget it.This account was written on Monday, January 27th, 2003 (3 days after sighting) and  the diagrams were computer drawn on Tuesday, January 28th, 2003 from memory and from the sketches I made immediately after sighting.Please note that drawings are approximate renditions only. Stars in sky are not accurate, just representation of stars. The third diagram is a drawing of the craft from directly underneath. (I am aware that the perspective of this drawing is a little off.) The pattern of the black underneath of the craft is as similar as I could make it, but I&apos;m sure it is definitely not exact.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length, and found her to be an exceptional witness.

I still don&apos;t know why but we were stopped on a main road.  When someone noticed a very large disc shaped object hovering just above the trees, directly above us.  I was in the rear of the van where there are no seats so I opened the rear door of the van and simply got out and looked straight up at the object.  It was at least two football feilds wide, completely round, it was motionless, with bright multi-colored lights that ran around the rim of the craft.  The other kids in the van with me got out and were staring at it along with me.  We could not believe what we were seeing.  The adult that was driving the van was yelling continuously &quot;get back in the van.&quot;  Because we were on a main road with traffic in front and behind us.  I noticed some of the other drivers were also out of their vehicles looking at this object.  The only thing I can compare it to, is the mothership in the movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind.  What is really weird is when we got back to the school no one spoke of what we had just seen.  It is as if it never happened.

It sometimes had red, orange and green lights spinning around the top. A steady bright white light was at the base.  The light was dancing in the sky, making deep drops, and steep climbs, other times staying motionless.  When it appeared the light turned to the other side, we could see the outline shape of a saucer.  At times the object appeared to send rays of reddish light downward to earth.  The light at time seemed bright and focused in our direction, at other times dim and focused away. It was mostly in  the southwest sky, out toward Puntarenas and then south over Panama.  Once the light disappeared, the dogs all quieted down.((NUFORC Note:  We agree with the witness that the object was not a star, if in fact it was moving across the night sky as described.

We were comming home in my van on a dirt road. I looked to what I believe to be N/E at a large hill in the distance. Above that hill floated the object. If you held a quarter at arms length that is how big it appeared. It looked like a round ball of fire with small flames comming off in all directions including straight at the viewer. Every once in a while it would dip behind the hill and then back up. I blew it off at the time as a military flair, but what flair suspends that long a period of time. Here is the clincher. It did not look &quot;HOT&quot; at all it gave off a dull orange color but I did not get the impression of heat or light. Intense light like a flair would make.

Also referenced in the 50&apos;s Sci-Fi classic &quot;The Giant Tarantula&quot; they referenced the base in the movie. To paraphrase &quot;they were going to send to Victorville&quot;(for air support). This was George AFB. I also can add for a reference point that when the town folk tried to blow it up(the tarantula) it was traveling toward Victorville on Highway 247. My sighting was a few miles behind the spider away from the direction it was traveling and far to the left of the highway. I intent to look at the California map and draw a pretty good location and picture of the sighting. I believe the direction I saw the object was toward &quot;China Lake&quot; military installation.

After I had sent the message a looked up at the sky to see if there was possibillity for snow, I then noticed a light.The light was blueish white, sort of like xenon car-headlights.  It moved rather slowly from southeast to northwest, approx. 3-4 km. to the south of me.  (A guess based on the angel to the light and the apparent cailing of the clouds.) There was no sound, and the route is not an approach channel to the Vaernes-airport, which anyway have no night flights. (The airport are about 40 km north of the city, and aircraft come from the west or directly form the south.)  The light was neither on an apparent course towards the Oerlandet air force base about 60 km north-north east of the city.  The light did not have the characteristics of posistioning lights on any form of aircraft I&apos;ve ever seen.  The hospital often get ambulance helicopters landing, but these make a lot of noice and extremely rare this late.The light kept a steady pace, and I remember being puzzled that the light did not seem to be reflected from the few clouds,as it seemed to be bright enough to illuminate them.  The properties of the light was &quot;cold&quot;  like a neon-lamp as opposed to the &quot;warm&quot; light of an ordinary lightbulb. It did not seem to have any special shape, more like a radiant pinprik or singularity, if you understand me.  When it seemed to reach the &quot;Graakallen&quot; hills (where there&apos;s a military radar station) I looked down as my cell-phone suddenly beeped, when I looked up again a half-second later the light was gone. This seemed to have neccesitated an significant acceleration. The time of the observation, 5 minutes, is based on the fact that my cigarette was just a stubb at this time and I usually use about 5-7 minutes on a smoke.  I waited for about 5 minutes, but when the light failed to appear again I went home.I didn&apos;t think to much about it when there was no other reports in newspapers etc.  I had only had 1 beer that evening as I had been lending a hand during a tv-recording at the student community, and had to get up early the next morning. Had it not been for the fact that the light was clearly visible below clouds I&apos;d probably guessed it to be a satelite or high flying plane reflecting the sun or something like that, but it was undoubtably not that high.  (The cloud probably being at about 3000 feet.. (measured in regards to the Graakallen.)  The weather at the time was quite crisp, about 5 degrees centigrade below freezing.Trondheim being a quite large city, with the accompanying light pollution the light was obviously quite bright, since it was brighter that for instance the road illumination on the opposite side of the river valley.  (Trondheim being situated along the Nidelven river, where this exits a glacial valley into the sea)  I was located at the lower part of the eastern side of the valley.  Hope the sighting might be of interest to you. I&apos;ve seen lights i couldn&apos;t identify before, but this somehow seemed different. And I must beg your apology, feeling that the report might have been more precise had I made a written record of it the same evening.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

We had lived there maybe a month or so. I wanted to finish high school at Tyee Senior High instead of changing schools so my stepdad who worked at Mc Donald Crane in Kent would drive me to a friend&apos;s house during the week who lived on 188th and Pacific Hwy South (Sea-Tac International Airport across the street and Boeing Field is nearby too) and we&apos;d walk to school. It was nearing the end of the school year and was a  bright, sunny morning with no clouds in the sky around 6:30am. It was so bright that I could easily see in the truck and was doing my homework that I hadn&apos;t done the previous evening. There is a large clearing on the left coming down Hwy 410 out of Bonney Lake heading down into Sumner (near the Winery), which overlooks the Sumner valley, and some of Puyallup (Tacoma can be seen off in the distance). I&apos;m engrossed in my homework and suddenly my stepdad (who doesn&apos;t believe in many things, especially UFO&apos;s) very calmly turns his head towards my direction and says, &quot;(my name), Look at that UFO&quot;. He turns his head forward again to look out the windshield and never looked back at the UFO or me and neither of us said another word all the way to my friend&apos;s apartment. I raised my head and looked at him. Outside his driver side window (within the frame of it)was a UFO - the classic shaped kind that looked like two silverish grey plates inverted on top of each other. There was a dome on the top that looked like cloudy thick/heavy plastic. Underneath the dome where it met with the top portion of the saucer were big round bright white lights that were like strobes. They were blinking white or seemed to be rotating around it. I heard a whirring type noise but was unsure if it was the sound the extremely long antenna was making in the wind or if it was coming from the craft. I think my jaw dropped and I was completely awed! Didn&apos;t think to look around and see if anyone was looking because I couldn&apos;t take my eyes off of it. It stayed visually within his driver side window all the way down near the River Grove apartments..it sped up out of the window frame and was directly above the apartments when it suddenly got a little fuzzy looking and completely vanished-quic! kly! I w as so amazed, happy but confused too by my stepdad&apos;s reaction. Couldn&apos;t wait to get to school and tell everybody what I seen but I think only 2 people half-way believed me. I didn&apos;t know where to report the sighting but KISW had a number to call. Was interested if anyone else had seen it but procrastinated too long and never did it. That incident put me on a quest that I am still journeying - I felt &quot;special&quot; and extremely happy that I got to see it. The experience and everything I have learned on my journey has enlightend my spirituality. Throughout my life I&apos;ve had many strange occurences happen, not only lights in the sky, a very impressive encounter in Olalla, along but other types of paranormal activities as well. It took me nearly 15 years before I ever mentioned the incident again to my stepdad due to the weird reaction of his that morning and becuase he is so opinionated and closed minded about things I&apos;ve experienced or believe in - thought he would explain it away and ruin my thrill. But when I did finally ask him many years later what we saw that morning, he laughed and said, &quot;(my name, I don&apos;t know what that was)! His statement surprised me but reassured me that we had seen something very extraordinary - HOWEVER, whenever I bring it up to people in front of him, his standard answer then and now is that the craft was a jet and I&apos;m crazy!((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Around midnight, several nights a week, I spend an hour or so on our third floor deck listening to the ocean, looking for shooting stars and satelites (wondering about UFO&apos;s). This night I saw a very bright (brighter than the bightest star/planet) orange light in the sky moving from the shore, inland WNW. It appeared lower than a plane when it is on approach and holding. Behind it was a jet. We live near an Air Force base and often see airplanes traveling in tandem, so I assumed it was a pair of Air Force jets although an object moving across the sky with nothing visible but a bright orange light, looked quite peculiar. Less than a minute passed when I realized I was observing a jet in pursuit of the orange light. The two traveled back and forth and up and down, with the plane clearly following whatever the orange light was doing. It really looked like a rather slow chase. They were both moving at about the same speed of an airplane on appraoch as well. After about six minutes, the plane followed the orange light SE and out of my view.On 23 January at the same time of night, my boyfriend and I saw the same orange light in the sky moving inland from the ocean.

I had about 5-7 mile visibility from where I pulled over.

It seemed to be directly in the middle of the moon. Now this craft was very large in size and was lit up all over and just appeared out of nowhere. I mean literally that it was if someone just turned on a bunch of colorful lights.We were traveling eastbound on highway 16 towards U.S. 31and approximately 12-15 miles from GRISSOM AFB. When it appeared i kinda shook my head to make sure i was seeing correctly and turned to the back to look at my daughter, who had fallen off to sleep. I look to my left and it was still there traveling slowly heading in a eastern direction. I then look to the south where GAFB is located and notice in the southern, southern east and straight east sky a numerous amount of aircraft. At this time the large craft ,what i would describe now was in a triangular or a diamond shape that seemed to be picking up speed and gaining altitude. At the first moment i spotted this craft out of my drivers side window (which would be the north) i instantly was like WHOA!! But now that it had been gaining speed i  tried to keep up at a rate of about 80mph but thought that it was not wise to jeopardize my daughters life traveling at a high rate of speed to try to catch something that is impossible to catch. Anyway, this craft from what i could see was now very far from me to the point that i had lost sight of it all together, but the planes were still in the air. i myself had a hard time putting this altogether because i have been really inerested in ufo&apos;s but when this sighting happened i thought no way  someone like me that is on the look out for them could actually encounter one.  I firmly believe that this was the real deal and can&apos;t really tell anyone for they would call me crazy.

I have also seen one yellow hovering light that has changed location and on another account of a huge red fire ball with blue and yellow tint of what seemed to be a meteorite kind of decending at an angle.  Again, this fire ball just appeared out of nowhere and rather instantly.

The jet and noise were gone in about 10 seconds; but, the tube was silent, big and slow (faster than any blimp but much slower than a plane like a cessna 172). It was not a blimp because it didn&apos;t have a pod beneath or fins or engines and it was much slimmer than any blimp. It was shiny as a mirror and I didn&apos;t see any wings. I began to scream &quot;look, a spacecraft!&quot; over and over. Three girls about six ran over and I believe they saw it as I was headed to a neighbors house who came out to see what all the fuss was about but it had passed behind some trees.

It was twinkling like a helicopter or an airplane at night, however it would move side to side, then up and down quite rapidly, and at other times was quite stationary. We dicided it must be a helicopter seen from a great distance, circling as if searching. At no time did it vary from the same general spot in the sky, it simply would change direction, noticably, therefore NOT a star.Must to my surprise, I went out again after sleeping until about 3:00 AM PST, and IT WAS STILL THERE, with the same behavior.

I thought this was interesting because we had a bad ass metior shower about a week before this happened and I just couldnt understand how it would still be going on after. Then I noticed something odd. The star never disappeared, like you would expect it to in a metior shower. It traveled across the sky at a fairly quick pace. I thought well, it must be a sattellite. But then it started to move all over in the sky, and in quick and rapid motions, it would make sharp turns. obviosly this was not a sattellite. As I continued to look at it, the light ( it must have been as artifial one, made to disguise it like a star) would get very big, and then fade away. A short while later (5 seconds at the most) it would appear in another section of the sky, darting from place to place to place, so easily that I could definetly tell that this was something straight out of a videogame or something. And it would always fade out, then reappear. i called my mom out, but she said that she couldnt see it. I guess I couldnt blame her, as the sky was full of stars that night. this continued for about an hour, as I sat and watched this machine continue to do this same thing, until i finally called my friend who lives in the woods on the outskirts of town to get his ass out side and look at the sky, but he didnt see it either.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I don&apos;t drink or smoke and I don&apos;t do drugs...I am in my early 40&apos;s and have a daughter so we often go to my grandfather&apos;s cottage in the summer.  I&apos;ve been going there with my family since I was 4 years old.This ocurred at our cottage 45 min from Ottawa at Innisville on the Mississippi River.  I sometimes sleep outside in the tent because I like the outdoors and the sound of the water puts me to sleep...this particular night the people next door were playing loud Elvis music and I liked it, so I listened until approx 1:30am.  Just as the music stopped, I lay awake for a few minutes (I had a sharp throbing pain in my arm that wouldn&apos;t go away) and then I heard a low whispy sound outside my tent.(almost like a hot air balloon but the pitch was lower and more consistent)  The reflection of light that shone on my tent was moving very slowly.  Usually when cars go by, the shadows and reflections from headlights move very fast.  I thought it was strange, so I got up and looked out the tent mesh window (I kept it open because the moon was full that night and all the stars were very bright) (saw the Northern lights earlier) When I looked out the window I couldn&apos;t believe what I was seeing...this was a massive ship (very tall, wide and tubular) completely covered by bright white lights (8 ft away from me) It was a beautiful display of white light  (looked like large light bulbs all over it) it started moving very slowly over the water passing my tent, so of course I ran to the other side of my tent to see where it was going.  It kept going until it was half way to the neighbours cottage (30 ft.)and stopped and just hovered over the water for some time...I just watched (this is something so unbelievable to see and I didn&apos;t know what to do) This was massive and it also had additional tube lighting in which white light circled (travelled) around the ship.  My reaction was to get closer to it, so I unzipped my tent and ran outside towards it.(I don&apos;t know how other people would react but I was so excited and I wanted to make contact) Then, suddenly, with a low sound, it completely disappeared leaving a sharp white light from where I stood and left a trail of light all the way to the stars (it looked like a star in the sky at that point) This trail of white light stayed for a few seconds before the whole thing disappeared) I kept watching this star because I was totally amazed...a few seconds later I saw that star zip across the sky in a sharp straight green line to another  star.  I will never forget that night.  I used to laugh when I saw pictures etc. of flying objects and aliens.  Now, I am convinced that there definately is life beyond our planet.(and a little nervous about the alien part)  I could hardly sleep and was a little nervous to tell everyone in the morning because I thought they&apos;d think I was nuts!  While I was telling my sister in the cottage, my mother said that she was glad someone else saw it. She saw what looked like a ship with windows just outside her window around the same time that morning.  She said she was lying down and couldn&apos;t sleep (the music was keeping her up) and out of nowhere she saw what at fi! rst look ed like shooting stars but then she realized that they were shooting in all directions and there were many of them.  Then she was staring at lights and windows of what she describes as a ship or building.  Anyway, for the next few days we were both in shock.  I&apos;m sure she&apos;ll never forget this either.  I was a little worried about my mom because she&apos;s 78 and was really shaken up about it. She didn&apos;t want to go back to the cottage to sleep.It&apos;s strange because for the last few nights prior to this incident, my neighbour had been hearing strange sounds like a hot air balloon but never looked out of her window.  She, and her partner also heard a baby crying at 3:00am that woke them and when they looked out the window, she saw nothing.  I always walk in the water as it has very shallow rapids and I noticed this summer that some of the very heavy rock had been moved (it didn&apos;t move when we had a flood several years ago and I wondered how it had moved) This was a particular spot that I used to sit in and I thought it was strange.

It looks like a really bright star, but if u pay close attention to it, u can see it hover from side to side like it is looking around for something, it also moves forward a little and then back into the same spot, up and down(back into the same spot) and it can suddenly stop. It kind of seems like it wants to move closer toward the earth, but something pulls it back into where it first was.. it moves really slow and steady and when i look really hard it looks as if there are like 5 greenish spikes coming out the top of it with a little reddish yellow light in the middle.. I&apos;ve seen it for the past few weeks maybe even a month only when it gets dark outside, and it goes away when the sun comes up.. I was wondering if it might be a satellite or something of that sort, but it just seems really peculiar. I told my friend about it and she stands outside with me sometimes to view it.. sometimes i think i see like little lights or something fall from it but i only see it out of the corner of my eyes, so im not really quite sure but there is a slight purplish cloudy haze around it... Again it is a bright light almost like a very bright star, with 4-5 greenish spikes on top with a little reddish yellow in the middle...

The light began moving East and back West in very fast straight lines.  The movements were first short and then covered increasingly longer distances until it was due South, standing still directly over the horizon of the lake.  The light then moved up and down in quick jerking motions, and East and West in very short jerking motions.  It then shot off diagonally to the South-Southwest at a speed faster than any of it&apos;s earlier movements and disappeared.

I turned to the North and thought that since nobody was around that maybe something fell from the sky. I then looked up and I saw a very large stationary ,round and bright light in the sky. It was a clean white light, like that of the moon. It seemed as though the light was focused on me but I didn&apos;t see a light beam like you would expect to see from such a bright light.

It looked like a jet. It had a short tail. The kind of jets I have seen usually leave a very long trail.

We were both stunned and I asked whether she saw what I saw and she confirmed that she saw the same thing. It was very high in the sky and looked like a star.  We both agreed that it could not be a plane,a jet, a satellite, or anything we could recognize, and it certainly was not a shooting star.  It was moving very fast.

Not knowing what she was talking about..I explained that we were not suppose to see a comet and that what we were to see was just an asteroid shower that was to take place in the early morn. She was really frighten so I went outside with my binoculars and telescope.  In the west, approximately at 10.40 p.m.  I seen on the horizon which look to be a very bright light.  I assumed it was a planet and set my scope on it. Because of atmospheric conditions I seen this very bright light jump all over in my scope.  I realized then that it was not a planet and told my niece and my 2 children (ages 12 and 13) to look in that direction.  It sounds really stupid but it had a very bright light in the middle and a red light on one side and a green light on the other.  I hate saying that because it seems like I am making it up.  I watched it through my scope for about 5 minutes trying to get my husband to come out when it started to ascend slowly straight up.  About 40 seconds later, it just shot up in the sky to where it seemed to be a bright star.  It hovered there for a minute and proceeded to travel north.  I looked at it until I could see it no more.

He estimated that the witnesses first noticed the object an estimated two seconds after they had first witnessed the Shuttle in the sky to the northwest. The grandfather reported that, at first, he did not trust his eyes, and said nothing.  However, a second or two later, his grandson asked what the &quot;green thing&quot; in the sky was. NUFORC hasn&apos;t received their written report, yet, but we include below the grandfather&apos;s e-mail, which we received February 4th, 2003. ((BEGIN FOLLOW-UP E-MAIL #1 FROM WITNESS))Peter,   I spoke with you just minutes after the shuttle disaster on Saturday. You were kind enough to listen  ((to me)) regarding the bright green light I saw running parallel with the shuttle prior to the shuttle&apos;s explosion.  I was there with my grandchildren watching for Columbia&apos;s re-entry....we watched it from horizon to horizon and I can&apos;t imagine having a better overall vantage point than the spot where we stood.   I told you that I would send a detailed description of what I saw...green light, explosion, sonic boom, etc.  But before I do that I ask that you &quot;hear me out&quot; so to speak. It&apos;ll take about a paragraph and then, if you still want me to, I&apos;ll send the detailed story. Actually I suppose that I&apos;m asking what you would do if you were in my position:  On May 23&apos;rd, 1959 I had a very &quot;up close and personal&quot; encounter with two UFOs.  Since that time I&apos;ve had sort of a &quot;been there, done that&quot; attitude regarding UFO&apos;s. I don&apos;t try to convince anyone one way or the other, but I&apos;m always very irritated when, through someone&apos;s stupidity, the idea that we are being visited by extarestrals is &quot;debunked.&quot; Which brings me to the green light and the shuttle. We now know that pieces of tile were being ripped off Columbia over the west coast, and of course that would be most people&apos;s explanation for the green light. I wish I could rationalize the light away with the tile theory. I&apos;ve tried. But I can&apos;t get my mind around this thing for several reasons. Why was it at such a great distance from Columbia?  Why was it closing the gap between itself and the shuttle?  What could have come off Columbia at that point that would burn such a bright, unremitting green?  And most importantly, why wasn&apos;t the green object leaving a smoke trail?  My eight year old grandson said it all when he asked, &quot;Grandpa what&apos;s that green light following the shuttle?&quot;    In any case you probably see where I&apos;m going with this.  This is a terrible tragedy for a lot of people and the world as a whole. People are not in the mood for, what they would no doubt consider a quack, coming out of the woodwork. So my question to you Peter is...do we say a whole lot about this now?  Or anything at all for that matter?  It could cause emotional pain to many people and badly damage ufology.It occurs to me at this exact moment that you yourself might think I&apos;m a nut case. So for the &quot;unofficial&quot; record I&apos;ll tell you this: Although I don&apos;t have a clue what the green object was, I don&apos;t believe for a second that it was anything from the shuttle.    With that little bit of bravado I&apos;ll close. Let me know what you want me to do now. Let me know too if anyone else has reported anything similar to what I&apos;ve told you. Misery likes company you know.   God bless you and yours.  ((name deleted))((END FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION))((BEGIN FOLLOW-UP #2))Peter...   If I&apos;m not mistaken I told you in our phone conversation on the 1&apos;st that the green light approached Columbia from the south. That was an oversight on my part...it came in from the north as stated in the following report.    I hope the report will be of use to you. Feel free to edit it for brevity if you like. Let me take a moment now to thank you for the wonderful work you do. I often wonder where individuals like yourself get the time and energy to work their miracles. I am in awe of you. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   In making this report on what I saw Saturday, February 1, 2003 I&apos;m well aware that it will be offensive to a great many people. The loss of the shuttle Columbia and its crew of seven has left, to countless millions, deep sorrow, great pain, and confusion. The wounds will be slow in healing. It is not my intention to cause additional pain or hinder the healing process for any human being on this planet. What I saw may have had nothing to do with Columbia&apos;s demise...yet it may have had everything to do with it. I&apos;m able to rationalize away much of what I saw, but in the end I&apos;m stuck with questions that I simply can&apos;t get my mind around:   On the morning of the shuttle disaster I walked with three of my grandchildren to the front yard of my home for the purpose of watching the shuttle&apos;s re-entry. It was 7:45 a.m. central time, the sky was perfectly clear, and we were 35 miles north of what would turn out to be Columbia&apos;s ill-fated path. We stood looking to our west, the sun to our backs. When the shuttle first appeared it was quite visible in the clear, blue sky and was, of course, a great distance away. For the first few seconds I saw nothing that looked out of the ordinary. If the shuttle&apos;s tiles were indeed breaking away as we are now told I saw no sign of it. I expect we were too far away at the time and the tiles were in too close proximity with Columbia. However, as the craft came closer to us I saw, far to the north of Columbia, what can best be described as a bright, invariant, green light. It appeared to be moving at a greater speed than was the shuttle, and was clearly closing the gap between itself and Columbia from the prospective of latitude. It did not vary in intensity, traveled a straight line, and more importantly, did not leave a trail of smoke. All of which prompted my eight year old grandson to ask, &quot;Grandpa what&apos;s that green light following the shuttle?&quot;    At a point still to out west, though much closer, the green light passed behind the shuttle and did not reappear.  The shuttle was, of course, giving off quite a lot of smoke at the time although the craft was still, to my untrained eye, doing quite well. But a few short seconds later I saw what appeared to be small pieces of material breaking away from Columbia, giving off a lot of smoke as they slowly dropped behind. In a very short time Columbia was directly to our south. At that point it appeared to explode&quot;...there was a flash of light and large pieces broke away, leaving the trails of smoke filmed by so many people.  I felt sick to my stomach as we stood for several more minutes watching everything disappear to the east. Then came the sonic booms.   I don&apos;t know what else to say. Many people besides us had to have seen the green light, although in the beginning it was too far away from Columbia, I think, to appear on the videotapes. The primary questions I am left with are as follows: If the green object was something from the shuttle why was it initially so far away from Columbia?  Why was the light traveling on a path that intersected that of Columbia? And why, when everything else was leaving a smoke trail...why wasn&apos;t the green object smoking?   This is what I saw. I have made my report and now I can start trying to forget the horrible sight of seven good people dying. Through the whole ordeal a lot of stuff was flying through the skies that Saturday morning. Feel free to rationalize away everything I&apos;ve said. I only wish that I could. God bless those who lost family and friends andGod bless America.

It was a Monday... the Monday that I was supposed to go back for the first day of school after the Christmas holidays.  However, there was so much snow that the buses couldn&apos;t run so school was cancelled for the day.  I had been working on building an igloo an our side deck and was almost finished.  At around 5:00 (this is just a guess... it was dusk) I was kneeling inside the igloo when I heard what sounded like an airplane.  Living nearby to a small airport, I thought it was no big deal.  I then thought I heard a helicopter.  Not knowing what exactly was flying nearby, I backed out of the igloo and looked up expecting to see both a helicopter and an airplane, but to my surprise I saw neither.  However, I did notice something dark behind some trees that were located across the street in my neighbour&apos;s side/backyard.  It was hovering a little below the tops of the trees when I first glanced at it.  It then began to move up above the treeline at a very slow pace.  Once it emerged from behind the trees I could distinguish the dark shape of a disk against the slightly lighter sky.  It then started heading straight towards me and as soon as it had gone past the tallest trees it sank back down to it&apos;s original height.  It continued in my direction at an extremely slow pace.  As it began to fly directly over me, I remember thinking, from a nine-year-old&apos;s perspective, that it was strange that there wasn&apos;t a beam of light coming out from the bottom lifting me up off my feet.  I did, however, see three small lights that formed an equilateral triangle on the underside of the disk.  One was red, one white, and one blue.  After careful thought, I have realized (and I&apos;m fairly certain this is accurate) that the lights had some peculiar characteristics.  First of all, their brightness was constant and unchanging.  It wasn&apos;t as though someone was holding a flashlight that was blinding at one point when shone directly into my eyes... these lights were ! bright c ontinuously.  And secondly, despite the intensity of the lights I don&apos;t recall them illuminating anything else around me.  The disk flew past me and over the fence into my backyard.  Then one side dipped down, like the wing of an airplane, and it swung around behind the house and out of view.  Although it was a noise that initially caused me to look up, I don&apos;t recall the object making sound as it flew over me.  A few minutes later I went into the house and told my mom what I&apos;d seen.  My mom ran to the back of the house and looked out the sliding glass doors and saw that it was still in the backyard.  It&apos;d raised up to the height of our 2nd story windows and was gradually moving away.  My mom went upstairs as I started taking off my snowgear.  She clearly saw a row of windows lit up around the rim of the disk.  We continued to watch it for hours as it very slowly raised higher as it moved away from our house.  It wasn&apos;t until after 10:00 that we stopped watching it.", "We saw 8 elongated cigar shaped craft at twilight moving in different directions.There were 7 long, cigar-shaped crafts that were moving in different directions(an eighth one joined a few minutes into the event). What attracted me was that 2 of them were on a diagonal collision course directly in front of us. They came very very close to colliding. They were a whitish-beige color. The one furthest to our right had a metallic edge to it. I videotaped the event through our front windshield. We were not able to stop and pull over. Upon viewing the tape, the objects appear to be rotating north/south as they moved across the sky.", "Bright white light moving very fast  above cloud cover from east to west in eastern skyWas sitting on theporch having a cigarette.  Felt like I should go out in the driveway and within a couple of minutes saw a bright white light above the cloud cover moving from east to west in the eastern sky VERY fast.  Was about the size of a dime from my viewpoint.  Lost sight of it as it moved behind a line of trees on the property line.", "More sightings of The Orange light appearing over Burbank Ca.I have reported about the UFO that is appearing in Burbank since then I Have had a couple more sightings of this craft. It appeared on 2/6/03 at about 8:09. I saw it while going home it appeared to be over the Burbank airport, but this is very hard to tell because it is so high up you cant tell where it is located. when I got home I still saw it, I decided having over 30 video taped sightings of the craft I dont need to take more so I observed the object. It was so high that it appeared over my area now .I watched the craft as it moved from right to left then right again very slowly, and it stayed hovering for a while then throw down a fireball from the bottom of it. It was the same color as the object it was orange. then it changed its color to white, it may not have changed its color but maybe it went so high up I could not tell. but it began to move backboard and then so high up it vanished from my sight.By the way I dident send this message on my other email address, but another one.", "Two extreemly strong flashing lightsTwo very bright white flashing lights (appr. 1-2 sec. interval) The strange thing is that the movement was very fast and the rear and the front light where on the same axis. That is the lights where not moving side by side as you would see on an aeroplane. No other lights flashed during the whole time. I saw these lights mabee close to 50&deg;-60&deg; up from where I was standing no noise was heard but the flashes where so strong that I had to blink my eyes every time they flashed.", "White/Orangy fast moving bright light comes to complete stop.I had a witness call from Smithers, B.C. this morning. She mentioned to me that her husband thought she was seeing things, but it sounds like she was certainly witnessing something rather strange. The woman was up with her baby at 2:40 a.m. and has a great view of Hudson Bay Mountainand the ski runs, (which is located in Smithers). Actually the witness sits at the base of the mountain. Her blinds were semi open and allowed her to see a very bright light crossing the mountain, and then coming to a complete stop over one of the largest runs, which is called &quot;Cold Smoke&quot;. She went on to say the light was dead center of the run, and wondered if it was just hovering, or &quot;maybe&apos; it had landed. She also reported hearing a clicking sound from the direction of the object. (HBCC UFO Note: My son lived a while back in the very same area as the witness lives now, and I know many sounds bounce off the mountain which allows everyone to hear different noises much clearer). The object moved from east to west before coming to a complete stop over the run. Approx: 5 minutes went by and a train could be heard coming in the distance and the object disappeared. &quot;Her words, turned off&quot;. After the train had come and passed, and approx: one hour later , the object once again showed up. She knew the times for certain as she was up with their baby.After the second time the light showed up, she said I got  frightened and closed the blinds. I asked if she could describe the color of the light to me, she went on to say it was a extremely bright white, with an orangy light coming from the center. The light moved quicker than a helicopter, or any small plane that she knew of. (keep in mind that this light was spotted travelling some distance just below the peaks of the mountain and came to a sudden stop above the ski runs).When the witness observed the light the second time, or after the train had long passed. She did not notice the light moving, but just showed up in exactly the same position it was observed before. The second sighting only lasted a couple of minutes. She reported her cat, which was also sitting on her bed, perked it&apos;s ears up looking in the direction of the window. I asked her an appro: size to the light. She said it may have been half of her thumb nail and round in shape.HBCC UFO Note: After I received the telephone call I called the Smithers Ski Hill in Smithers to ask if any equipment was working on the runs around the time of the witnessed sighting. I was told work was being done on four runs throughout the early morning, and would be continuing throughout this week and over the weekend in the wee hours. This sighting may be the result of grooming equipment working on the ski hill, &quot;but&quot;, what puzzles me is that the object was spotted travelling an appro: 3 kilometers along the mountain before it came to a stop. I also just called the witness back to clear up one point about this sighting, and that was, did she see the object before it got close to the ski runs?? She said yes, I observed the light as it traveled over rough terrain, then got to the runs and stopped. So still puzzled at what was seen.((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Mr. Brian Vike, independent UFO investigator in northern British Columbia, for sharing this report with NUFORC.

Object stopped mid air. Lights sequenced. Object darted and stopped twice.In the fall of 1975,  I was newly married and enrolled in graduate school at Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana.  My husband had been a US Air Force pilot of T-38s and other aircraft.  He had been trained to recognize the configuration of aircraft.  We had visited my parents at the farm in Morgan County, Indiana.  We were driving back to college on a dark Sunday evening in the fall of 1975.  There had been a heavy snowfall, but the weather had cleared.  There was a bright moon and puffy clouds in the sky.We were driving on I-69 between Indianapolis and Anderson, Indiana. I saw lights in the sky, and at first I thought the lights were coming from a large aircraft that was in a steep bank (turning). Then the lighted object seemed to bank the other direction.  I watched the lights for a couple of minutes.  I had never told my husband about seeing a UFO in 1965.  I said, &quot;Is that an airplane?&quot;  He said, &quot;No.&quot;  We watched the lights getting closer. We were traveling northeast and getting closer.  The lights were so close to us, that I said, &quot;Pull over.&quot;  A couple of other cars pulled off to the edge of the interstate.  We were parked on the east side of the interstate, and the object stopped in the air over a large lighted parking lot of a factory or shopping area on the west side of I-69, near Anderson, Indiana.  My husband rolled down his window to get a clear view without reflection.  The lights on the craft were in a horizontal row, similar to lights coming from inside a lighted passenger compartment of a jet.  There were also red and green lights on the object.  We could hear a whirring sound, but not a roaring sound.  Then ... the lights appeared to start moving in sequence ...left to right.  I wonder now if the object was rotating on a horizontal plane and if the object was turning rather than lights coming off and on.  The object darted to the east and in about one second appeared to be stopped again to the east of I-69, maybe about two miles away from us.  &quot;Follow it.&quot; ... I said.  My husband exited the interstate and headed toward the object.  The object then darted in the air to the west side of I-69 and stopped again.  Then it went behind thick clouds, and we couldn&apos;t see it at all.We continued our drive to our apartment on the Ball State campus in Muncie.  We stopped and ordered a pizza.  It was very late at night - maybe after 10pm. We told the pizza guy about the UFO, but we didn&apos;t attempt to report the incident to the FAA or even to the Muncie airport.  We had college on our minds, and the next day was just another day.  I felt so blessed that my husband, a pilot, actually saw the object, heard the whirring, and saw how quickly the object could move.  I also felt fortunate that I could have seen two UFOs and that I wasn&apos;t just seeing things back in 1965.I wonder if there is a kind of convergence of solar systems that makes space travel easier about every ten years.  I live near the Wright Patterson Air Force Base, where supposedly the wreckage and the alien victims of the Roswell, New Mexico crash are kept in a secret area.  Most of the people who know about it are probably in their seventies or eighties.  I wonder if any of them will ever talk.((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful for the report.  We doubt that the Sun, or its planets, come anywhere close to any other star system.  If such occurred, we would see two stars in the daytime sky, not one.  Date in November 1975 is approximate.

I have benn living in my home now for 3 years and have been seeing these lights in the ski I watched them every night light up to ski but then i started telling my husband about this and we started watching well there would be one big round looking one that would get really close and light all up and stand still in the ski well lighting up then there would be other once zigging all around it now its been so many times that i see this and its when the stars would always be in the ski when there out and its always around the time when its dark about 8:00 and 9:00 at night now i live in kingston mi 48741 ..I would really like to hear back from you on what you think about this I never really thought about this before but now its getting pretty weried....

I have here a report for you. On Friday March 7/03 @ 7:30 PM me and my daughter (name deleted)were outside ready to leave in the truck when we both looked up and saw this bright white light shoot over towards Mount Hays. Traveling South East for two to three seconds, it just blinks out when it was over Mount Hays, it was the brightest white light that we have ever seen. My daughter told me that she had seen almost the same thing just two weeks ago while with her friend Patricia at 4:30 am, the object they saw wasn&apos;t as bright as this one was, it was traveling East, and it too blinked out before it went over out Hays.HBCC UFO Note: This sighting &quot;might&quot; be easily explained as a meteor, but after receiving so many reports for Northern British Columbia I am not putting this down to a meteor just yet, I will be looking into the sighting report to see if there is anymore information which could be gathered on it.((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike, Director of the Houston, British Columbia, Canada UFO Research organization, for sharing this report.

It was about 9:30 p.m. We stopped shortly for gas before continuing home. As we pulled out of the gas station to turn, I immediately noticed a large bright object that was nearly directly in front of us in the sky, just across the road from our position. At first I did not notice any particular hard shape to the object -- it appeared to be a formation of hundreds and hundreds of white lights, pulsing, and moving slowly parallel to the road that lay in front of us (approx 45 -55 mph). It was roughly the shape of a cut diamond-- a flat top, angling out to two points, then down to a point at the bottom center. The lights were continuously pulsing -- not being extinguished, but alternately growing bright and then dim. They did not pulse in pattern, but seemed to be random, but quickly and continuously. Other than the white lights, I did notice at least two red lights - one in the center mass of the object, and one, perhaps two, at the bottom edge. This object was quite close; we were within just a couple hundred yards. It was flying over treetop level, so I would estimate it was several hundred feet in the air. The object by my estimate was 50 to 100 feet in length. There was no sound whatsoever. The night was dark but clear. Exasperated by the sight, we quickly turned right to follow the object. As we followed the angles of the road, the object was in front as we trailed to follow. I did not notice a &quot;change&quot; in shape, but perhaps from a different viewpoint, the object then appeared to be somewhat oval in shape, and I picked up a distinct pattern to the lights - the object seemed to be divided into four equal quadrants of white lights, and was &quot;hollow&quot; in its center. That is to say that the quadrants seemed to meet together around a small hole in the middle that had no lights. We continued to follow the object, but its pace began to pick up. At one point, it seemed to stop and hover over the road in front of us for several seconds. It then continued to cross the road to our right, and we turned off to follow. We followed its trail for several minutes, intermittently losing it in the trees and then sighting it again. The last sighting of the object we had, it was moving away at a very high rate of speed; in a few moments, its spectacular lights were indistinguishable from the nights&apos; stars. Traffic on the roads that night was not particularly heavy, but there had to be a dozen or more witnesses. I called local television stations and the Air Force Base just to ask if anyone had reported &quot;something weird&quot; in the sky without relating my own story. No one had. I did hear, from the base&apos;s public affairs, that a commercial blimp had flown in the area earlier on the same day. But with the flight characteristics, it&apos;s shape, the hundreds and hundreds of pulsing lights, I just don&apos;t see that I could mistake a flying balloon for what in my own estimation was an unkown object. I&apos;m an Army veteran and have flown in all sorts of aircraft and helicopters, but I can&apos;t say that I&apos;ve ever seen an object like this, and I haven&apos;t seen one since. But ever since that day, I do spend quite a lot of my time with my eyes toward the sky, hoping that I get to see one again.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "I saw lights and looked out my window  looked out and saw two teardrop shaped aircrafts .I was getting a glass of water in my kitchen and looked out the window and saw bright flashes of red,blue,and white. Then all of my electrical equipment turned off. I did not see the color or shape of the aliens because they never stoped they just shot by. I was so scared i just went back to bed without drinking my water or saying anything.", "What I saw was a stationary orange light that dimmed and brightened irregularly. The light lasted for approximately 30 minutes.", "&quot;reflective&quot; white &quot;tube&quot;  flying 100 ft or so under passenger plane during daylight.Driving 422 West in afternoon. Noticed passenger jet in sky, had red and white paint  with white words. This caught my attention, as it seemed lower than usual. Stopped my car in middle of intersection when i saw sunlight glint moving underneath jet, about 100 ft underneath. &quot;reflection&quot; followed exactly with jet but was 1/5th the size. Best I can say it was either a &quot;steel pipe&quot; shape or tube. Absolutly stunning, it moved with jet perfectly timed but definetly an object,as it moved it stopped reflecting sun, and I saw it had white color then it faded away. Cars honking behind me made me move. Pulled into parking lot of diner and looked back, could see passenger jet but not object. I watched for about 30 seconds. Broad daylight, great visibility that day. I would not be suprised if someone on that flight saw something. I almost don&apos;t believe this was real, but I stared again and again in that time to try and make out more, but it was mostly a bright &quot;reflection&quot;, like shiny metal. However the object seemed white when the reflection of the sun died down. About the size of a automobile in relation to jet.", "A glowing flock of birds in a symetrical V shape formationIt looked like a flock of birds that glowed white. The formation was in a &quot;V&quot; shape, but not symetrical. As it approched closer, the &quot;birds&quot; had more os a star shape. The star looked like they were enclosed in a nearly invisable boomarang shape &quot;V&quot; formation and then it dissoved out of sight.", "Daylight NJ i78 large chevron shaped craft 50 plus eye witnessesIn August 1988 my parents and I were traviling east on I-78 from Clinton NJ to Newark airport. While in the vicinity of Basking Ridge near the wildlife overpasses with reley towers on the north side of the highway I caught a glimpse of something large aproaching the highway from the south. I leaned forward to get a better look and in doing so saw a airborn vehicle aproximatly 40 to 50yds from tip to tip.The shape was that of a cresent moon or chevron which was light metalic grey in color. I would estimate that the craft elavation was no more than 400ft. I told my parents as we passed under it but the brake lights were distracting them as both lanes of traffic were rapidly coming to a halt as people saw the object. The entire veiwable amount of time I had to observe the object was aproxamatly 30 seconds. This sighting was in broad daylight around 3:30pm. The object was moving sideways tip to tip. When I stuck my head out the window I noticed that there was no dicernable noise generated by the craft. The craft was moving far to slow to remain airborn by any conventional means of propulsion that I am familar with. There were five lights across the front arc and a panel of white lights pulsing a pattern rythmicly as we drove under it.  I know other people saw this craft and am very anxious to speak with anyone with anybody who could confirm this sighting for me. This was absolutley not a blimp!((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "UFO and lights appear in sky in Maui Hawaii in 93&apos;My girlfriend and I were sitting on the beach in Kihei Maui Hawaii and she pointed out a strange amber light over one of the other islands.  We watched it blink and shimmer for about 10 minutes or so and then it started to move to the south part of the island only it stopped in the middle.  About 45 minutes went by and then it seemed to start getting bigger and brighter.  It was about a mile away and her and I saw what appeared to be green, yellow, blue, red and orange lights oscilating around the object.  Almost orbiting the craft in a way.  Then it moved between the west maui mountains and haleakala (volcano) and we ran down to the waters edge and saw bright orange engines glowing.  We heard this pulsating sound though it was very faint.  We started to question it to ourselves, so we needed to see if anbody else had seen it so we called the local law enforcement and filed a report.  No one had seen it that night....maybe!  There were no articles in the newspaper that day of the prior night.  Til this day I still question what I saw that night, but it was definately something I had never seen or heard before.Thank you.  ((initials deleted))((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have amended it, based on follow-up communication.  PD))((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION))Peter,I think I had a brain failure.  It was 06/93 not 6/03 because unless I can travel into the future (lol lol lol).  The time we looked at this object was 1 &frac12; hours or so.  It was pretty close to us.  If you put the moon behind it you would not be able to see the moon.  It was dark and the object was about a &frac12; a mile away down the beach.  This was the only time that we got a good look at it.  When it was far away it looked just like any normal star in the sky except is was amber in color.  Any more questions just call me...not collectthanks   ((name deleted))((END MESSAGE))((FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE #2))Am I correct in understanding that the object appeared to be dramaticallydifferent sizes at different times during the sighting?Thanks, again!  Peter Davenport((RESPONSE))yeah!  It was smaller furthur away (the other island was about 6 or 7 miles away ) and became bigger as it flew about a &frac12; mile away from our point on the beach.
