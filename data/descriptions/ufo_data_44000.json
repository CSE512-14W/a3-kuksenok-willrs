["Two very large stationary crafts illuminating the sky above Arkansas.While driving back from Jacksonville to Heber Springs, we were exiting Hwy 67/167 onto Hwy 5 at Cabot.  Just entering Hwy 5 we noticed two large strings of lights in the sky on the east side of the highway.  First thinking that they were C-130 aircraft from the airbase we pointed them out to our ten year old son.  We observed that the lights were stationary.  Closer observation showed to prove the craft much larger and much farther away than we first thought.  We took note of the lights remaining where they were first observed util we drove out of sight.", "Hovering sphere with flashing lights seen over a farm in Powell County, Kentucky.In the summer of 1979, when I was 21 years old, my former husband and I were attending a party on a farm in Powell County, Kentucky.  We had gone up to the house to use the restroom and were on our way back toward the stage, where the crowd was listening to Bluegrass music, when something caught my eye.My husband was a bit tipsy, having had several beers, but I wasn&rsquo;t, because I didn&rsquo;t drink. When I looked up into the clear night sky, I was astonished to see a huge round object hovering over the field at about 2500 to 3000 feet above.  The sphere had multi-colored flashing lights going around its perimeter of green, yellow, white, and red and was making a very faint whirring sound. I believe the lights were moving counter clockwise, but it has been so long that I am not sure of that.I got my husband&rsquo;s attention and had him to look at it, too. He sobered up pretty quickly! The object hovered a few more seconds (approximately 15) and just as if it had seen us see it, it darted amazingly quickly away in a zigzag pattern in a due east direction.  Within 2 or 3 seconds, the object had completely disappeared with no trace. (I grew up the oldest daughter of a career Marine that taught Avionics. I had been to many Blue Angel Shows, grew up around aviation, flight simulators, etc., and I had never seen or heard of anything that could move that fast.)  As far as I know, we were the only ones to witness the object.((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event may be approximate.

These objects hover and then move very rapidly across the night sky. I have witnessed these objects travel several miles, stop, change direction, move slowly and actually travel in a complete 360 degrees around my view on the back deck at my home. I have actually seen these objects slowly move across the sky and then move quickly to an area very close to passing aircraft and actually move with the aircraft for quite a distance. These objects appear to look like a star falling from the sky but have distinct movements and do not fade out like a star falling through the atmosphere. They appear to be very small in size but last night they appeared a few times as though they had a cloaking effect and you could make out a shadow of a much larger object.((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Sirius?

I am not exactly sure of the direction but Jupiter and Antares were just right of center as I was facing almost due south. Just a couple of minutes after the satellite passed, I noticed a large dark red crescent object pass in about the same area and direction as the satellite. It would have been about the same size as a first quarter moon. It seemed as if it was very high and passed very quickly. It seemed to have skipped through the atmosphere and could have been a fireball but was very dim and I have seen a number of fireballs and this did not look like any I have ever seen. It was only visible for a few seconds and covered the distance of about 1/5th of the night sky. If it were at a low altitude in the sky, the speed would be that of a jet fighter at mach speed.

I went inside the house and retrieved my 8 x 30mm binoculars. I focused the lenses, and I cold barely see the object: However, it appears that it had a round center with bicycle spokes, and the object did not move. Since the object was so far I kept losing it since my binoculars were hand supported. i found the object several times, and it appears to have move just a bit or perhaps it was the earth&apos;s rotation. I found the object at approximately 18:05 and this time I was looking at TWO objects instead of one.my wife witnessed the first object, and I went inside the house to tell her that a second object had appeared.

It look as if it were off in the distance a few miles (could have been more since there&apos;s no comparison to the size). You could see through the oval, and as it laterally transversed in the sky across long distances, it would change angle so you could see through the cirlce of lights (just looked black inside). It would shoot down as if to dart down to the earth sometimes spinning around and around. It went away for 15 minutes and then returned again for maybe 5 minutes to the same place, this time higher up in the sky as it swooshed down out of sight again. It would hover in one space and then travel laterally, as the angle changed quite frequently.

I looked up at through my clearstory windows. I saw a row of5 bright lights in a v shape coming very slowly over my house. I ran out to my back deck and watched the lights approach. As the lights got closer, I could see the bottom of the craft they were attached to. It seemed to be traveling at a very slow speed and made absolutely no sound. It blocked out the stars as it passed overhead. It was extremely large, the size of a football field and it was chevron-shaped. It looked like a gigantic stealth bomber. I could tell from the lights on the front, that the bottom looked to be a gunmetal gray. It passed through the woods behind my house and headed east. After about 5 minutes, a friend who lived over in that direction called me to tell me her husband was outside looking at the same exact thing. I know it was initially stated that this was a hoax perpetrated by ultralights. This was NOT a formation of ultralights. It was a massive solid object that, as I stated, blocked out the stars as it went overhead. I have been wanting to report this story for years but didn&apos;t know where to do it.

It was very early in the morning, approximately 5AM.  I was awakened by a female presence from my bedroom and I had this desire to get my bicycle out of my parents garage and go riding.The sun wouldn&apos;t be up for another hour.   It was the summer.  It was in the 70&apos;s, within a month or two of the June 8th, 1974 Tornadoes which destroyed Tulsa, Oklahoma, my home town.  I was outside riding my bicycle in my neighborhood, just 300 yards from my house.  The sun was just coming up.  There was this very unusual popcorn shrimp like cloud formations in the sky.   Just thousands of clouds which were white and puffy alto cumulus like clouds which were spaced out widely in the shape of curled up popcorn shrimp.   The local media weather personality on Channel 8, Don Woods, commented on how rare this day was because Tulsa had never had this kind of weather clouds before in it&apos;s recorded history.  I am to believe that this incident may have been just before June 8th, before the T.V. stations were knocked down by the tornadoes.  I have searched and searched for the exact name of these clouds and their exact date and history has buried it.  I can&apos;t find it.  Anyway, I&apos;m riding my bike on dark streets back and forth, back and forth, until the sun rises for one hour when I see these clouds.   Their startling clouds. I can barely find information on the June 8th 1974 triple twister storm which almost took my life and my family&apos;s life and left us in ruin for the balance of the year of 1974.  It was truly an awful time with not running water, no gas, no electricity, no phone and no T.V.   All we had was KRMG AM radio to inform the community for quite a while.   AM radios and batteries and lots of kerosene burning Coleman products to make light and cook our food. As I rode my bike, the sun came over the horizon and you could see all these very strange shaped clouds.   And there were no cars running nor jet aircraft landing.  It was as if Tulsa was frozen.No noise outside at all, not even birds.  And I heard this one noise growing and growing as if it was coming from an aircraft or something up in the air and I began to point my eyes to the direction of this very unique, unearthly noise.  I would hear where it was coming from and move my eyes to the noise as it moved through the skies above me yet I saw nothing.  It flew right over me I would guess at the altitude of a landing jet aircraft and proceeded off to the east.   I kept peddling my bike eastward following the sound and looking up and continued to see nothing as the sound faded away.  This whole encounter did not take just 3 minutes, it was like 25 minutes.It moved as slowly as a Goodyear blimp from the sound as the sound moved in the skies as my ears could track that sound yet I saw nothing and it didn&apos;t wake anybody up in the neighborhood.When the sound finally disappeared in the east, I was standing on the ground straddling my bike.Not 5 minutes passed and the entire neighborhood woke up and came to life.   People went out to get their paper, started mowing lawns, dogs started barking, tire sounds of cars were heard on Memorial drive, all the noise of life returned as if somebody just threw a switch.  It was really weird as a 13 year old I actually recognized this and knew major things were wrong here..... And for some reason, I forgot about this sound.  I just shelved it in my mind and never ever thought about it again.  I never spoke with anybody about it.  Never made it a bid deal.  I also had at the time dreams of being a bird and being able to fly in my own back yard.  I used to dream somebody taught me to flap my wings and I would actually fly around up to 1000 feet high.   And this female person would talk to me then and was like my foster mother if you will.I was encouraged to fly and remember topping the chimney on my parents house and actually flying just above the cloud cover of the town and hovering there for hours at night.  It was always at night.It was a female but I never could remember her face.   But she took a liking to me as a child.And then I never heard anything more from her again.   This whole thing probably spanned just 4 months as I remember.   But I shelved the entire thing and never told anybody. I also remembered looking into the neighborhood houses for open windows of known Rock and Roll stereo freaks who might have a stereo playing but all windows were shut that I could see and besides, the sound was from above me and slightly to the south heading west to east in direction as it moved.  It also wasn&apos;t the kind of sound which was played back from a recording with hiss or scratch sounds like a record does, it was the REAL THING SOUND.  It had the decibels of a powerful engine or something like that.   There was no stereo which could make a noise that loud which was obviously far up in the air somewhere up there. It also gave me the feeling that somebody was looking down on me, the one kid outside with the bicycle chasing this sound and not being able to catch it and I felt this terrible, awful sorrow coming from somewhere as if a family member was either just abandoned or died or perhaps the feeling you get when your best pet dog is killed in a violent way.  A very sorrowful, sad feeling which actually made tears come to my eyes finally as the sound finally went away to the east and was never heard from again.  I had the feeling that I was just abandoned like a mom would say goodbye to here child for the last time never to see him ever again.   There was a sense of concern and fear and I remembered now, at the time I was led to believe I was going to have a very hard and challenging life. I was 13 years of age at this time. Lost in space had been on T.V. and the sound of that spaceship in that T.V. series was Erie but not similar to this sound.   This sound was not man made it was real.  And so I grew up, and time just buried all of this.  I never heard this sound again and forgot about all this until recently. I&apos;m 46 years old now.  I&apos;m driving across country and the AM radio is on.   Coast to Coast AM is playing and George Noory.  He&apos;s interviewing Michael Horn.   Michael Horn is supposed to be the U.S. press representative of Billy Meier from Switzerland.  And I listened to this interview they did and somewhere in the middle of it they played the wedding cake ship sound.  I said to myself as soon as 10 seconds of this sound was played that I&apos;ve heard this before somewhere??? And I began to ask myself which T.V. show or Movie did I hear this sound on before so I could know where these guy&apos;s ripped this sound off from. I eventually went to the website and downloaded this sound and played it a few times and it all started coming back to me.  I was asking same question back in 1974.  I remembered that morning.  I remembered the weird bicycle ride I took that summer morning.  Asking the question is this sound was coming from a neighbors house, what T.V. show or movie  did they get it from.  Yet I knew it wasn&apos;t coming from a neighbors house or some passing car&apos;s 8 track.   This is 1974 you see, not even the cassette tape was popular then.  Microwave ovens and cable T.V. were years off.  Color T.V. was just getting popular.  FM stereo existed but not widely used in cars yet.  Cars still typically had noisy AM radio with 8 track players bolted on.    We didn&apos;t even have synthesizers in that era to manufacture a noise like this. But I heard this damn noise.  I felt those feelings.  I had those dreams in my sleep of flying with my other mom.  I felt some love from this person. And I have some post comments to make to this female person, whoever it was.After having done some years research on Billy Meier and the Pleiadians and finding out that these people frequent all of our media and are somewhat experts on Human current events.If what I have read and felt are indeed true, then I&apos;m dealing with an emotional being who&apos;s not learned to separate herself from her science projects....    And I&apos;m sorry you never had a child.And while it&apos;s sad that you people actually read the contact reports from this very website, maybe you&apos;ll read this one and remember what you did back in 74. I know it was you and I shake my head and ask the question if you leave that much concern in a 13 year old childs mind how are your possibly going to help mankind?  It was the certain knowledge and admission that this sound was the Wedding Cake Ship.That the Wedding Cake ship was commissioned at around this time. And I&apos;m left with the question, why Tulsa, Oklahoma?  Was it the knowledge we were about to be greased by a large group of Tornadoes?   Was there something special about me? All I&apos;m personally left with is she decided to adopt me as her son for a few months and perhaps study me, I guess...  I dunno.... But I did hear that Wedding Cake ship sound on that popcorn shrimp cloud day which we have never had again, ever....((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

They were not flashing. They did not have any color like an aircraft light. These were single lights. The distance apart was approximately 3 inches at an arms length.

I live in Santa Ana, California, but the object was southwest from my position, into the Costa Mesa area. The only visible part of the object was a solid bright bluish ring. A storm was approaching in the distance and it was slightly windy, so at first I thought it might be something floating in the wind. It&apos;s movement was very fluid, but still fairly erratic. The movement pattern almost looked like a plastic bag caught in an updraft of air. But, it wasn&apos;t very long before I realized that it was way too big to be something floating in the wind. It looked to be flying at a fairly low altitude, around the height that a helicopter might fly, but it&apos;s maneuverability was beyond anything I&apos;ve ever seen a helicopter do. It slowed to a hover, then dove in an arc and came back up a few times, both horizontally and vertically. The speed at which it could turn made me think it might be a radio controlled airplane, but I&apos;ve never seen one a big as this. It had no lights on it other than a blue/white ring on the bottom. When it tilted away from my perspective, the ring was not visible. Conversely, when it tilted towards my direction, the ring shined brightly.

She escaped to a back room to do something so I was sitting alone.I looked through two standing trees in her yard and saw two silverish colored, clear balloon type objects in the distance - circular I suppose - in the clear sky.  I figured they must&apos;ve been helium balloons that were escaping into the sky as they were moving as balloons at first.I continued to watch and yelled for my girlfriend to come from a back room - she then came and witnessed the UFOs with me.  After a few minutes of watching we were not able to identify them as balloons - they rose higher and continued to float at what I believe to be - thousands of feet - in the air - slowly - not exactly erratically, but not as though being propelled by the wind either.I became excited when I saw two neighbors outside in the front where I had moved after the ufo&apos;s floated over the treetops from the backyard to the front.  I saw THREE very clear unmistakable shapes - lights or light reflecting - as the sun from a balloon shape.  But as my neighbors and I gazed straight up overhead at the object - there were two others close to this object - same size and dimensions - we could not say if it were a weather balloon or not - it did not seem to move as a weather balloon might - although I don&apos;t know what a weather balloon looks like in the air.I feel this is a significant sighting as there were witnesses and we all saw the same thing for several minutes before the objects just continued to float out of sight.  They did not zip off into the sky.I don&apos;t know what I saw.  I would like answers as to how this lit object could appear so large in the sky - I have seen balloons before as I live near a place that has helium balloons escape all the time from it&apos;s premises (auto dealership) - and I have watched these balloons travel high into the sky before they just disappear.The objects we four witnessed were not balloons such as these - transluscent balloon shaped - well - lit objects.I felt they were intelligently manned but that is just a guess.Please advise.", "there was a round shaped object that glowed a dull red collor in the night sky; that moved very slowlyAt  approximately 10:10pm pacific standard time I was standing outside in the back yard of my house  located in fountain valley, California.I was looking up at the stars when I noticed a very dull appearing  star; I thought it was strange  I had never seen a star look like that .My house is located between two airports, the Long Beach airport and John Wayne airport; I am very used to planes flying over.There were three planes flying over the area at that time and the object which I still believed was a star did not move; it was only after the sky cleared it began to move across the sky when again planes were coming into the area it stopped  and only after they passed did it continue to move.I called my daughter from the house and she came out ;I pointed out the object and she clearly saw it also we watched as it passed directly overhead of us .The object was extremely high in the sky way higher in altitude then any plane I have seen since living here.We continued to watch  as the object seemed to climb higher then disappear  in the night sky .The object appeared to be round yet there was bulk to it very hard to describe and it seemed to have a dull red glow about it but as it flew overhead it was dark and remained that way till it disappeared  it moved very slowly until the very end when it seemed to disappear quickly.", "2 spheres side by side traveling west to east over claymont de.2 spheres 1 purple 1 blue traveling very fast west to east. very high in sky i thought at first maybe it was a meteor shower but they were the only ones that went by. a falling star is alone not two side by side. observed from my back deck just looking up at that time. i hope someone can let me know what it was. thank you", "LIGHT BULB IN THE SKY.CLEAR NIGHT SKY PIERCING WHITE LIGHT LOWER THAN AEROPLANE HIGHER THAN HELICOPTER SEEN FIRSTLY IN FAR DISTANCE AND TRAVELLED TOTALLY IN COMPLETE SILENCE OVER HEAD IN STRAIGHT LINE INTO DISTANCE IT SEEMED EGG SHAPED AND WAS A PIERCING WHITE LIGHT WITH NO FLASHING LIGHTS WHAT SO EVER ON BOARD AND NO SOUND FROM FAR IN DISTANCE /OVER HEAD/INTO DISTANCE I WOULD SAY EXAMPLE WOULD BE A LIGHT BULB IN THE SKY, I REGULARLY LOOK AT NIGHT SKY AND AM AWARE OF SHOOTING STARS / SATALITES /AEROPLANES / HELICOPTERS AND AM 100% THIS WAS DEFFINATELY NONE OF THEM IT TRAVELLED AS FAST AS A LIGHT AIRCRAFT MY PARTNER AND DAUGHTER ALSO WITTNESED THIS.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

When I looked up I dropped my paper cause I saw suddenly 3 balls of light hanging still in the air in a wide triangle-form. My first thought was it was maybe a reflection of my window, but it definitely kept hanging there on the same spot and when a rising cloudformation covered 2 of the 3 objects after 3 minutes of watching it out of my train window, it ruled out the possibility of being a window reflection. It appeared like they were reflecting sunlight though because they were hanging in the late-evening western part of the sky, and looked orange/yellowish. They appeared to have a round form but rather oval, it&rsquo;s hard to say, but they definitely didn&rsquo;t appear to be pointy like a star. Furthermore, the light didn&rsquo;t appear to be coming from a concentrated spot like you have with the flare of a plane or a planet/star, they looked like bright &lsquo;ink&rsquo;spots in the air, so they should have been really big. I believe they were hanging 25 to 30 degrees above the western horizon and I could look at them for at least 3-4 minutes! Then a cloud covered the bottom 2, which formed the basis of the triangle you could say, and only the upper one was visible. The train then made a curve and I lost them out of sight. Later in the car I pulled over a few times to have a look when I was outside the city, but that cloud had risen so they were just gone or behind the cloud but I haven&rsquo;t seen them after. I estimate they had the magnitude of Venus at its brightest, magnitude -4, but it was like there were 3 wide (no-pointlike/starlike form but broader in shape) Venuses hanging in the sky exactly in a wide triangle form, on a great distance I guess cause a cloud at the horizon covered 2 of them. I &lsquo;ve seen all kinds of phenomena and have been a member of an observatory/amateurastronomer for 8 years (not anymore now) so I know basis meteorological and astronomical phenomena. I have watched the skies for so many hours and nights and seen a lot, from magnificent fireballs and meteors to satellites and iridium flashes, but nothing that was unexplainable. Never ever I saw something as yet uncomprehensible like this.

At first it was hovering in the air, then it became clear to see it was an object and it had a shape. It started to move left to right and back and forth for a few seconds...then it disappeared behind a cloud.  Then it came from behind the clound.  It was dark ...its shape was like a saucer.  I tried to reach in the back seat of the car to get the video camera, but as soon as I was about to press the record button...the object started to leave.  It was very visable until we got the camera out.  It seemed to fade away after I was about to get it on video.  Then it took off at an unblievable speed.  At that exact moment, it started to thunder and rain.  From the same cloud it disappeared behind, came a lightening.  It only rained for only about one minute.

As I drove further about a mile and approached the local high school a craft came hovering above me close to the ground but still very far in the sky.  I stopped my car and rolled the window down to have an unobstructed view, it was triangle in shape which I could tell even in the night sky and had large white lights lining each side, something I have never seen in a normal aircraft, there was also a red and blue blinking light, something I have seen in an aircraft which led me to question whether it were really a ufo or not.

After about five seconds it started to move across the sky in an erratic zig zag motion. After viewing this for about two seconds I told the other person camping with me to come look at the light. He walked over with the flashlight  hanging off the zipper of his shirt still on illuminating his front as well as the ground in front of him. This flashlight is made by mountain equipment co-op and is intended for use on pedal bikes. Note: it is a very small light powered by two watch batteries, yet a very small amount of light coming directly from the bulb would have been visible from the UFO&rsquo;s position at that time.  We saw the UFO&rsquo;s light move up and down and diagonally up and across as well as down and across, sometimes pausing briefly before moving again. After watching this for about one minute I shined a rather small flashlight directly at the UFO. The flashlight has the name Reactor on it, one L.E.D. Bulb, is powered by four double&quot; A&quot; batteries and a reflective surface measuring one and three quarter inches across. As soon as I shone the light at the UFO it continued zig zaging to the edge of the forest across the bay approximately one hundred fifty feet away from us. At this point it paused and it appeared to me that the UFO&rsquo;s light became brighter and somewhat larger.The UFO light was about 1&apos; across. It then started to descend at a forty five degree angle across to the edge of the bay about forty feet in front of our campsite.As This descent took about ten seconds.At a distance of about one hundred feet I could distinguish what appeared to be an aura around two objects at the top of the UFO light. The bottom of the light was round and solid light.The UFO had a slightly oval shape. When the UFO was about fifty feet from us I said &ldquo;I think we better turn the lights off. I turned my light off at this point and my friend turned the light in his hand off a second later. I started to turn my attention back toward the UFO again but decided to double check that all the lights were off. At this point the UFO was aware of the light near my friend&rsquo;s neck. He was not very familiar with the on/off switch and it was a tense moment.  But one of us finally turned it off. My friend saw UFO come to the same altitude as us and proceeded to move directly toward us. As soon as the last light was turned off it went back to its previous agenda of flying erratically above the forest. It reached a distance of about five to seven kilometres away and after about one minute. Not wanting to lose sight of it I picked up a large &ldquo;million candle watt&rdquo; flashlight and shone it at the UFO.  Not the smartest move, but I felt relatively safe since it had approached so slowly the first time. This time it made about three zig zags to the same spot at the far edge of the bay in approximately two seconds.  At this point it slowed briefly. I turned the light off, and turned to run as soon as I saw the UFO go in front of the tree line. However my friend grabbed me as he didn&rsquo;t want me to be injured running through the woods. I soon turned around and never saw the UFO again.

Upon stepping out with my dog, motion caught my eye and I glanced up. Despite my classes in astronomy, merit badges, and 25+ years of amateur sky watching I have no name for what I saw other than UFO. I&apos;m college educated, a respected member of my community, and former Army Reservist that held a Secret Security Cleareance. This is my first sighting, and I have debated about whether to even say anything to anyone, for fear it may harm my professional reputation. I was certainly a skeptic until last night. What I saw when I looked up was at a very high altitude, its initial position in the sky was just north of the constellation Orion and about 75 degrees above the horizon. I believe it may have been initially traveling either due west or descending because it did not seem to be traveling fast. Then almost immediately it turned sharply to the south and crossed the sky at a speed I can only compare to a meteor. Much faster than any satellites or planes I have witnessed. The object was illuminated at first, perhaps from entry; it then faded in intensity as it crossed the sky to the south. The object did not streak, or trail however. It also did not seem to be producing the light itself. It had a white-blue glow and seemed large. The glow disappeared when it was about three quarters of the way across the sky, and I could no longer track the object. All of this took place in about before I was able to light my cigarette, I think maybe about 5 seconds or so. I kept my eye on the sky for some 2 to 3 minutes trying to see if it would reappear, I had about convinced myself that it was just a meteor, when out of the north a fast moving triangle of 2 red and 1 blue (non-blinking) lights flew across the sky at a increasing altitude, on what appeared to be an intercept course. I assume the lights were a single craft, but may have been a formation of three crafts at a much higher altitude. This one also moved much faster than anything I am familiar with and I have lived in this area for 31 years. I counted 6-mississippi as this craft crossed the sky, but it remained in my field of vision longer, and its lights did not extinguish. In both cases there was no noise. I pondered what I had seen and watched for additional movement in the night sky. I did spot a plane flying northeast possibly towards Chicago or further north, it was too high to be flying to KC. I could hear it, and it took several minutes to cross out of my field of vision.

Altitude was hard to verify since the size of the objects was unknown.

Altitude and speed remained constant while I observed them. Both of us agreed that their shape was circular. My wife commented later was that she thought of jellyfish as she watched them.

Sun has totally set for about one hour. Traffic was of moderate density.  My speed was roughly 25 mph.  I was heading in a north easterly direction.  My attention was drawn to a rapidly flashing light (15 - 30 flashes per second) moving quickly from left to right.  The object was approximately 20 degrees above my apparent horizon  As I tried to track the flashes while still watching traffic it appeared to be farther to the right than I had anticipated every time I looked back up. It also passed behind trees which were between the object and myself and just became lost in the trees and buildings.  I did not have a wide horizon at this time but the speed at which the object traversed it was impressive.  About a quarter mile after the sighting Kenwood Ave. makes a 90 degree right hand turn.  About another quarter mile past the turn I momentarily caught another glimpse of the object as it disappeared over the horizon, heading directly away from me.At no time could I detect anything other than the flashing light.  The light was very small.  Not much bigger than a BB held at arms length.  The flashes were primarily white  but I think I may have detected intermittent red flashes.  The part of this episode which has me baffled is the speed of the flashes.  It was actually almost a solid light.  Not at all a standard nav light.  And, the speed at which it traveled.  I also had the impression that the object was spinning, but I can&apos;t really say that for sure.  That may have been an illusion caused by the flashes.  My driver window was down but I heard no sounds other than traffic.

We were southeast bound flying direct to the Gaviota VOR (a radio navigation beacon near Santa Barbara) at 9,000 feet. We were in visual meteorological conditions with clear skies and 30+ miles of visibility. I really don&rsquo;t know how to describe what I saw. This wasn&rsquo;t a classic &ldquo;flying disc&rdquo; type UFO.

I observed it for perhaps 15-20 seconds. Not long, I know.The first thing I want to emphasize in my description of this object(s) was that it was small. I would say no more than 5-10 feet across. At first, I thought I was looking at two birds flying close together.  There were two distinct &ldquo;bodies&rdquo; or shapes that were either attached to one another or flying in a very close echelon type formation. One object slightly behind and to the right of the other.  As it approached, I became unsure if I was looking at two separate objects flying close together or a single object. As I said before, this thing was small but as the object got closer, I thought the two separate bodies looked somewhat triangular or diamond shaped. What was really remarkable about the object though was its color. This thing was an amazing blue color. I find it difficult to describe the shade of blue but I would say it was slightly darker than a &ldquo;sky&rdquo; blue but not much. The color is what really made me think I was looking at something artificial. It stood out against the generally brown/tan color of the ground but if you were below and looking up at it, it would have been very difficult to see. A wayward kite?

We were in Sweetwater (Hammonton), NJ.  The time was about 10:00 PM.  The sky was mostly clear.Being a city dweller, I am intrigued by all the stars that can be seen when in a rural area.  I was on a boat dock, looking approximately NE, at about 70-80 degrees from the horizon.  There was a fairly bright star that was sort of yellow in color.  Slightly below and to the left was a dimmer &ldquo;star.&rdquo;  The &ldquo;star&rdquo; moved in an erratic manner over a very small area.  Sometimes it would stand still.  Sometimes it would zig-zag and even reverse direction.  Brightness of the light changed as it moved.  All of the stars around it were stationary.  I pointed it out to someone who was with me and they confirmed my sighting.  We watched it for about 5 minutes.I looked around a bit and spotted a second moving light while looking in a south-easterly direction, a little to the right of the glow from Atlantic City, and about 60-70 degrees from the horizon.  This moving &ldquo;star&rdquo; was also confirmed by the person with me.I went into the house and brought two other people outside.  They were unable to spot the lights.  We continued to watch the lights for several minutes.  Total time of the sighting was about 15 minutes.After going home, I contacted an amateur astronomer.  He knew of no natural phenomenon that could cause what we saw.  Another person I discussed this with suggested search lights or a laser pointer he saw used in Australia to point out the constellations.  Both search lights and the laser pointers create a visible beam pointing to the sky.  The lights we saw had no &quot;beams&quot; leading to or from them.  Also, search lights cause a wide beam and a spot if they hit a cloud.  Air craft cannot move in this manner.  Any idea what we witnessed?", "Neon green object dissapears in night skywe were driving down the street in the dark with a completly clear sky. out from behind the trees ahead of us a giant neon green colored egg shaped object caught our attention. we saw it for almost less than a second, but we saw that it was flying in mid sky, too low and too fast for an airplane and at a weird angle. we only saw the object once and it never re-appeared.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Directly above the couch on the ceiling is a skylight. I happened to gaze up through the skylight at the blue sky and noticed what I initially thought was a very bright star. But, as I watched it it moved slowly from left to right. It also changed in light intensity. When I initially spotted it it was very noticeable; it would fade and re-brighten. After a few moments I decided to get my brother to come look at it too (to make sure what I was seeing was real). Once he came downstairs and I pointed it out to him he also thought it was very strange. He confirmed that it was indeed moving back and forth. At this time he also noticed some fainter star like objects close to the main object which also appeared to move slowly. As we watched them some of the objects would disappear and then reappear a few seconds later. I have seen satellites on clear nights moving across the night sky, and know that these were definitely not satellites. As far as I know satellites move along a linear trajectory; these definitely were free moving. The fact that they could disappear and reappear in a different spot was mysterious. I have no idea what these objects were but they were definitely not like anything I have ever seen. To give you some background, I am located about 20 miles from O&apos;Hare International airport, so I see alot of aircraft in the sky here. This was absolutely not a high altitude, man-made plane of any type.", "Red orbs over Lansing MichiganApproximately 9:40pm on Saturday, August 1, 2007, I was traveling northbound on Aurelius Road in the vicinity of 84 Lumber when I spotted a round, red light to the east above Cottonwoods Campground.  I pulled into the 7-11 on the corner of  Aurelius &amp; Jolly, got out of my car, and called to the attendant and customer in 7-11 to come outside and look at the sky. What I saw were 3 round, red objects about 50 feet apart traveling silently to the north in the area bordering Jolly Road to the south, Aurelius Road to the west and Dunckel Road to the east. The objects seemed to keep the same spacing between them, traveled in silence, and were not just merely floating. I would estimate their speed at 20-30 mph. The only description I can think of would be that they looked like red, Chinese globes that one might see in a Chinese restaurant or Chinese ornaments. There was the appearance of flickering light at the bottom of each object that I thought could have been a flame. As we watched, the flickering in the southernmost object disappeared, leaving only two objects that I could see. Those two objects continued north toward Lansing and disappeared from view.", "Observed a huge black bommerang shaped UFO the size of 2 football fields hovering &amp; moving slowly over the prison.Several co-workers and myself observed a huge black bommerang shaped UFO in the sky hovering over the women&apos;s prison in Bedford Hills.

I was at least the size of two football fields and made no sound except for a very low vibrating hum. As it hovered  approximately 100&apos;over us the hairs on my arms and the back of my neck stood up as if touched by some sort of static electricity.  When it began to move it did so very slowly.

They were directly above our housing estate, so wheh we pulled up on the driveway about 20 seconds later, they had moved a considerable distance southwards (i know this as our front door faces north) as we got out the car we all walked up the road a bit to watch and discovered that they moved in to the shape of an equalteral triangle, which is when one of our neighbours said &apos;you spotted it too then?&apos; as we watched the lights moved from the equalateral triangle shape they had formed, to a straight line.It looked like they had gained speed as the light&apos;s became more distant, and one by one they dissappeared from sight, although the last one took longer to dissappear than the first two, there was a sort of disruption in the clouds i had noticed where they had dissappeard, as it was becoming late, and the sky was settled, but had a stirred up area in the clouds, but barely visable to the human eye", "Red light hovering over WinnisquamAround 11:30PM I heard a noise that sounded as if it were something hovering over the lake house.  The sound was as if there had been some massive object above the house, lasting about 5 minutes.  After about a half-hour I was still unable to sleep and so I went to another room to watch TV.  I decided to step outside to check out the meteors (hoping to see some more).  Around 12:30 I looked across the lake and saw a strange red light hovering over the shoreline.  It moved slightly from time to time, as if it were trying to balance itself out again.  A bit closer and to the left there was another object moving in a similar manner, which was white. I watched the red light for a while it would sometimes drop and then more higher up again.  Also, every so often a flash of red and white light would appear on one side or another.  I at first hoped it would come near to me, and at one point it seemed to start to move closer but it made me slightly nervous. I felt a bit apprehensive and excited at the same time, and I felt that whatever it was could sense my reluctance toward it coming too close and it backed off.

They were small and resembled very dim stars so I believe they were very high in the sky.  They fluctuated  intensity in their brightness as they moved in very erratic patterns.  They would seem to drift for a moment or two, then all of the sudden they would fade and take off in a totally different direction at many times an accelerated speed and then slow down again.  They were not moving in unison. This activity went on for hours until I had to go to bed.  This is not the first occasion  that I have witnessed this same phenomenon.

There was no way for me to tell it&apos;s altitude nor it&apos;s speed, however, it&apos;s actual movement was puzzling. At first it was travelling south and passed by just west of Vega; it&apos;s speed was constant. Suddenly it stopped instantly for a short moment (maybe for 1/2 of a second), then instantly returned to its original speed in an easterly direction. When I saw it do this, the first thought that came to my mind was, &quot;am I really seeing this? Is this my imagination?&quot; Yet still, I was able to continue following the object through the sky. And for a second time, it stopped instantly without any negative acceleration for about 1/2 second.

We were laying on her trampoline looking up into the sky. We noticed that there were shooting stars. About a minute after we sighted shooting stars, we looked to the Southeast sky. Greenish-bluish flashes started occuring. There were about 6 flashes. They were in one area of the sky high up. They lasted about 30 seconds Then the flashes stopped. The sky went dim over there. About 10 seconds later, we heard 2 booms in the area of the flashes.

They seemed to be quite low in the sky, much lower even than the aircraft on approach about 12 miles from the airport.They seemingly followed the same path as the aircraft that had just gone ahead of it.There was absolutely no sound, which was strange, but what was stranger&hellip; The 2 lights were not overly bright, no brighter than the brightest stars visible, but as they traveled east, they moved toward and away from each other.At the outermost part of the cycle, the lights were about 35 to 40 feet apart, from the ground they came apart a distance that seemed a bit wider than the houses they flew over.At the innermost part or cycle they would almost touch.A complete cycle I would guess at maybe 3 seconds.I saw this for a total of about 6 or 7 seconds. The path the 2 lights took toward and away from each other was perfectly straight, almost as they were moving from wingtip to body center and back.But there was no wings or body, there were no stars blocked out as it traveled; there was no shape or outline of any kind. I was surprised once more when it  disappeared right after it seemed to pass over the nearest house to me,, emphasizing how low it was. The speed was fast enough that it would have been visible across the sky, from west to east, for no more than 10 or 12 seconds.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

I just got back from my vacation at Myrtle Beach.  We were there since 8/31 and just got back today, Friday 9/7/07.  We stayed in North Myrtle Beach. Last night (Thursday 9/6/07) around 11:30 pm, my friend and I were walking along the beach toward the Apache Pier. We were in deep conversation as I looked up to my left at the clear night sky over the ocean.  There were a few cumulous clouds that were visible.  As I looked, I saw a bright orange slow moving object moving to the north.  At first I thought it was plane, but it didn&rsquo;t look like a typical plane light you would see at night.  Before I could say anything to my friend, it faded away.  Consequently, I just let it go and didn&rsquo;t mention anything. Shortly after that moment, we turned around and started walking back to our resort.  About 15 minutes later, my friend nudged me as he pointed up to the sky and asked, &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;  There in the sky, was the same slow orange light.  As we both watched in silence, the light separated into 5 or 6 other orange lights that lined up in a perfectly straight diagonal line.  Then, in perfect unison, they slowly started moving to the left.  Then they simultaneously faded away. Neither one of us could come up with a reasonable explanation.  My friend&rsquo;s first proposed explanation was that it could have been a flare.  But can a flare separate into 5 or 6 other orange lights, evenly spaced apart in a perfect diagonal line, and all move in unison in the same direction?  We stood there staring for about 15 more minutes, hoping that the strange lights would reappear.  Unfortunately, that was the last we saw of them.  As we walked back to the resort we kept our eyes on the sky.  We even stayed on our balcony for a good while.  We were hoping that there would be something about it in the news this morning.  But no such luck. I would just like to add that I&rsquo;m not a believer in little green men visiting the earth from other planets.  I&rsquo;m just perplexed as to what this could be..  I&rsquo;m sure that there is a rational explanation to this.  I would just like to know what it is.((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports from this area of South Carolina.

We went out and proceeded to sit on the rocks surrounding the outside of the field at the Mount Misery campground portion of the forest. The night was perfectly clear and there were no clouds nor was the moon visible. There weren&apos;t any planes either, just a sky full of stars. I was looking up at the Southwest portion of the clearing and my girlfriend had her back to where I was looking and was walking towards me, when out of nowhere a rectangular object with 4 bands of light ranging from red, orange, yellow and pink appeared in the sky roughly about a football field length away from me over the tree line on the other side of the field. It was low flying and above the tree line but not by much. It started out small, about 1 school bus in length and about 3 in height [relative for that distance away. that is the best measurement I could think of]  and then when it moved from right to left in the sky it expanded to about 3 school busses in length.  I shouted for her to turn around but when she did it disappeared from site. I got pretty freaked out and proceeded to walk back to our campsite. I at first tried to convince myself that it was a shooting star but after talking to my girlfriend for a bit we came to the conclusion that what I saw was a possible UFO.

I was watching the red moon, and at 4:34am I saw an object moving from the north-west toward the east. It traveled in an arcing motion across the sky.  The object had no lights, and from the bottom it reflected light from the city.  It was a light grey or white in color.  It looked to be round in shape, though hard to tell from the distance and limited light.  The object created no sound what so ever, and it was very quite at this time of the morning.  The sighting only lasted for about 4 to 5 seconds, until it traveled out of view.  In my best estimation, the craft was 2000-5000 feet above, and was traveling, i would say approximatly 200-300mph. I dont know how large it was but i estimated it would be larger than the largest aircraft made.

The eatery is located on Preston Rd just south of George Bush Tollway. The route we took was to head north on Preston Rd and enter onto George Bush Tollway heading east. As we continued this way and reached the vicinity of Coit Rd to Custer Rd we witnessed three strange looking lights in the sky northeast of our location. We first thought maybe they are lights attached to a pole for construction work purposes, but as we approached closer we realized they were higher in the air, but not as high as you might expect a plane to be travelling. We then thought they were low flying planes, but the lights appeared to be brighter than what i&apos;m used to seeing and they did not appear to be moving. We continued to monitor the crafts as we transitioned from George Bush Tollway onto I75 heading north and noticed that there were more than just the original three crafts. As we made the change to I75 there were now 3 to the west, 3 to the east, 3-4 to the north, and 3 to the south as we traveled through Plano. On approach to the city of Allen, Texas we then observed 3 more in the distance to the north and 1 to the northeast. They all appeared to have lights like a plane would have ( red, blue flashing lights with a headlight), but the light seemed to always be facing us even as we changed directions and as mentioned before, they did not appear to be moving. Shortly after we arrived at our home in Allen, Texas I proceeded outside with my binoculars, but was unable to observe anything unusual within the airspace I was able to capture. My viewing space was limited due to homes and trees blocking most of my view. Was there some military action or police action? If so, then why was it not aired on the news? Was there excessive air traffic because of the Erin storm front? Again, why was it not on the news? I was not under the influence of any alcohol or mind altering drugs. I have no history of psychologica! l proble ms and was not excessively tired or drowsy.

We immediately shut off the t.v. and watched in awe for a few moments until we started to get frightened. We then woke up our grandmother who came out of bed and we all walked right up to the sliding glass door in hopes to get a better look above. All of a sudden the light started to pan from side to side. Thinking rationaly about the situation as I always do when wierd things happen I thought it might just be a helicopter. Unforntunately I had to throw that thought out the window due to the fact that it was absolutely SILENT. I wanted to go out side to get a better look, but I knew my grandmother wouldn&apos;t have allowed it.

Neither of us cared to see anything out of the ordinary, in fact this object kind of ruined my date I had planned out.  We were 15 miles Northwest of a very small community(Hazelton ND) laying out on the bed of my truck out in the hills on a prairie trail, when my girlfriend pointed out a small object a little larger than a majority of the stars around us soaring through the night sky.  I explained that it was just a satellite no big deal, she insisted that it was going to fast, but I stuck by my satellite explanation.  10 mins. later she started talking about this object she had been keeping tabs on, for a moment I couldn&apos;t see what she was pointing at, she said the object turned, I didn&apos;t see it because I didn&apos;t realize how dramatic it&apos;s course change was, once I had spotted it, I knew it wasn&apos;t a normal sighting.  The object had moved almost directly in front of our field of view and was moving from side to side, and then it would stop hover and begin to move diagonally across the sky, and than in an obscure figure eight pattern, then stop again and hover, it was very bizarre.  We watched it for 15 mins. or so, and decide to head back to the ranch, by the time we reached the farmstead, stopped, and got back out on the bed of the truck the object was gone, we watched for over a half an hour before my girlfriend was to creeped out to stick around out there anymore.  I don&apos;t know what that object was, but it gave the feeling that it was almost watching us, the way it would stop and hover out amongst the stars, and then to disappear like that within a 5 min. drive back to the house.  It creeped us out.", "Spherical object maintains position in sky for ten minutes over approach path to Midway AirportAt 2:30 in the afternoon on August 31st I was waiting for my wife outside of a shopping complex at 135th and Cicero in Crestwood, Illinois, when I noticed a spherical object hovering in the sky.  I noticed it while watching aircraft using the 4R approach to Midway airport.  Aircraft at that point in their approach are flying at about 2500 feet and the object appeared to be at twice that altitude.  It was, like the airport itself, directly north of my position and about 60 degrees above the horizon line.  The object maintained its exact position in the sky for 10 minutes, though, as its coloring shifted from white to gray, it may have been rotating.  The object then proceeded south and flew directly over my position.  As it did so its coloring shifted from bright white to black and then back again.  It continued to fly off to the south and I lost sight of it. I hold an aircraft mechanic&apos;s license and served in the USAF as a jet engine mechanic from 1972-1976.

There were no apparent doors or windows seen. No blinking lights of any kind. I didn&apos;t hear any sound, but I believe I had my window rolled up. I didn&apos;t see any movement around it as I was watching for people or something to clarify what I was seeing. There was no one else on the road; it was very dark.

Seen by 8 people.This sighting occurred on Saturday, the evening of the 4th of August in Canaan Maine.  My friends and I have a regular camping spot that we meet at just about every weekend during the summer to camp and cook out and enjoy the spectacular view.  The spot is on a ridge, and known locally as &quot;The Pinnacle.&quot;  This night, it lived up to its name.From the Pinnacle, an observer has an expansive view of a large lake valley oriented more or less due west, with the north and south views open before the tree line by about 75%.  The valley is bordered on all sides by long low ridgelines, like the one we were camping on.My friends and I were cooking dinner on an open fire when my girlfriend mentioned that she could see a light moving in the distance.  I stood up and looked where she was pointing and could see an obvious orange orb, having approximately the size color and brightness of Mars on one of its closest approaches.  The orange orb was moving parallel to our ridge, in a more or less south to north direction.  The were no features on the orb other than its clear spherical shape.  No protrusions of wings or tail, and no lights to speak of, blinking or otherwise.  It was the lack of running lights that first made me really question what we were seeing.At that point, I called it to the attention of my friends and we all started watching it.  It was obviously very far away, but for that, it was moving very fast to our perspective.  Much much faster than a plane would have.  For nearly five minutes we watched it cross about half of the full sky from our point of view, and then it suddenly flared bright arc welder white and at the same time made a 90 degree turn to the east and started coming more or less toward our position.  When that happened we all gasped as one and all conversation that been going on as to its nature ceased.  From this point until it vanished later, we were silent.  It traveled for another three or four minutes, seeming to approach almost right over us. and then just as suddenly flared again and made another turn, of over 90 degrees this time, so that it was heading about northwest.  We watched it for another couple of minutes until it vanished beyond the treeline.After that we started talking about what we had seen and tried out different explanations to try to explain it away, but nothing fit.  A satellite wouldn&apos;t have changed directions and flared the way it did.  Neither would the space station.  A meteorite would have burned up after only a few seconds, not ten minutes, and certainly not changed direction multiple times.  A helicopter would have had running lights, and considering how high up we were, would have been clearly visible as such.  Also, it would not have been self-illuminated over its whole body.One of the main things that interested me was the fact that it didn&apos;t slow in the least when it made its turns, as if inertia didn&apos;t exist.  At the speed it was going, inertia would have required it to slow down, and that&apos;s assuming a plane could even make the angle of turns this thing was making, which to my knowledge, they cant.Just as confirmation of everything we were thinking, about twenty minutes after the sighting we saw a pair of what were obviously planes flying fast and at high altitude.  Whether by coincidence or not, they were streaking in the direction of where we last saw the orb.  Chasers perhaps?  At any rate, the difference between the planes and the orb we saw were obvious, and just cemented the unusual qualities of what we had seen that night.  Some of my friends are a bit more skeptical of these sorts of things than I am, but even they were left speechless and agreeing that what we had seen was definitely beyond conventional explanation...", "daylight disk at 200 metersSighting - Late June 1967  When I was 13 I was standing on the front porch of our house in the early afternoon with my sister ((name deleted)), who was looking off the other way while I gazed across the cornfield to the north.  Suddenly an object came over the treeline along the right edge of the field at about 200 meters from me and 100 feet off the ground.It was a bright shiny silver disk about 50 feet in diameter making no sound other than that of it splitting the air. I distinctly remember seeing a slight vapor coming off the edges of it as it moved through the air at perhaps 350 mph.It passed out of my sight over the woodlot  at the left side of the field quickly, but I had seen it and gotten a very good look at it.

Around approximately 23:30, my associates and I were astonished to observe a dim, brief, yet prominent flash of light which illuminated the entire sky. The flash of light was accompanied by what appeared to be a spherical, orange to red explosion at high altitude, directly above us. The entire incident lasted not more than 2 seconds and was not accompanied by any audible sound such as a sonic boom or a pressure wave. The phenomena appeared to be very similar in appearance to explosions I have seen in documentary videos of high altitude / low-earth orbit thermonuclear detonations, except the flash and fireball which my associates and I observed on the night of August 21st was particularly small.  There were no perceivable electromagnetic interruptions or interference to electronic devices around us such as my cell phone or nearby streetlights.

The weather was beautiful all week and we were aware that there was a good chance to see meteor showers.  As we chatted, we were gazing at the stars much of the time looking skyward over the ocean.One evening mid-week, we saw a rectangular shape of three vertical rows with 3 or 4 lights in each row of bright red (slightly orange) lights.  The lights were huge and looked like they were located just under and slightly to the left of Mars in the sky.  They appeared out of nowhere, were stationary and blinked out after about 3 to 4 seconds.About an hour later, lower in the sky in the same direction were more red lights (3 or 4 lights more or less in a horizontal zig zag row) they also appeared and disappeared  within a few seconds.  These second set of lights reminded me of flares, but they did not move or stay lit like a flare would have.  I know Camp LeJeune is close by, but I do not know what those lights were.

It was very dark, basically pitch black, and the only other lights around were from the vehicles, and the RVs of some other hunters also parked along this road.  As previously reported, the object was completely silent.  As far as I know, none of the other hunters saw the object, as all appeared to be inside campers and RVs for the night.This is a serious site, and I think editorial comment is not mainly what is being sought of reporters.

They were formed in a isolates triangle. If an aircraft was in the vicinity of one it would hover towards it. When it would hover I could see and trail of light coming from it.

I&rsquo;m a skeptic but a believer. This incident occurred on my way to work at 0430 between Waunakee, Wi. 53597 and Middleton, Wi. 53562.  As I was driving on county hwy K and heading west between county hwy Q and US hwy 12, I saw a column of lights that resemble the broadcast towers that dot the west side of Madison, Wi. which is adjacent to Middleton. Initially, I instinctively interpreted this column of flashing lights as one of the broadcast towers off in the distance.  This thought did not follow through in my mind though.  As soon as I focused on the road ahead again I immediately returned my gaze to the lights again.  This was not hard to do for the traffic at 0430 is nonexistent.  I was able to slow my car speed and observe. What I observed was a tower of flashing white lights not far off in the countryside.  My calculated guess would be about &frac14; - &frac12; mile.  The countryside here is farmland &ndash; dark as night can be.  I always enjoy viewing the stars at this time of morning on my way to work. There are few things that I enjoy better than the night sky.  I must say that after I concluded that what I was seeing was a possible UFO mimicking a TV tower, I burst into laughter at the thought of concealment by looking like a tower of lights.  Beautiful!!

Sooo&hellip;.it was observed by me for approximately 10 min. I just recently decided to report this observation because I believe that what I saw was not part of the normal fauna of my path to work.  I also continued to look each morning thereafter at the towers that do exist there and the distance and size they actually are.  They are extremely further away to my sighting and observations. I didn&rsquo;t count the number of flashing lights but they were all flashing white.  The height of the light tower I find difficult to estimate but will guess at between 100 -200 yds.

It turned and the lights dimmed and at one point seemed like a horizontal line of lights. We were seeing it from the side or horizontal plane. The cluster of lights were very bright, about 6 sets of lights that looked like an array to me, but my husband&rsquo;s better vision detected an outline and many lights that formed the array.

The first thing we noticed was a very bright, flashing sphere of light.  Red, blue, and green lights, and it looked like the blue lights strobed around the middle circumfrence of the ball, flashing twice per second. Didn&apos;t think much of it until it started getting closer.  We turned up the music and began flashing the truck headlights and it grew twice as large and even closer.  At this time we were freaking out and shut off the headlights and turned off the music.  Whatever is was hovered erratically for thirty seconds and dissappeared instantaneously. We couldn&apos;t believe what had just happened and sat back down by the fire and were talking about it when the strangest thing that has ever happened in my life hit all three of us at once.  We were in a half circle, sitting on the ground, and from the tips of my fingers spreading through my whole body I recieved a powerful jolt of electricity, a quick ZAP!  It wouldn&apos;t have been a huge deal, but ALL THREE OF US GOT HIT EXACTLY AT THE SAME TIME!  The millisecond it happened we all looked directly into each other&apos;s eyes and said, &quot;Holy $%#@, DID YOU FEEL THAT!  All three of us had recieved a shock the strength of an electric fence, at the exact same time, but instead of my whole body being shocked at once, i first felt the jolt in the tips of my fingers because I was pointing at something and it was the closest body part to the dark forest in front of us.  The crazy thing was, I thought I heard a faint zap type of a sound when it happened, and it seemed to have come from the forest, directly below where we had seen the spherical object with flashing lights. The night had just begun.  The music and truck lights were turned back on, when two of us noticed something and called over the third person.  We saw a creamy-white light, larger than a star, but we couldn&apos;t tell if it was in our atmosphere, or out in the solor system.  It seemed far away and close at the same time.  It was moving in a swooping direction, like how you would draw a puffy cloud, or in elementary school when you move the decimal point you make the swoosh under the numbers to count how many spaces to move the decimal.  That is the movement this object was making, yet totally different location in the sky, different color, and complete different erratic movement than the first object we saw. Immediatley following, there was one more oject that appeared way, way out, as far as the stars and about the size of a star, but it was going up, down, left, right, diagonal, every direction possible.  It was so erratic it was completely unpredictable where it would move next.  All three sightings lasted nearly five minutes each, spread out over the course of almost three hours. That night was the clearest I have ever seen the sky, even more clear than it is in the middle of Alaska.  There were aircraft going by, easily distinguished by there red and green lights, direction, altitude and speed.  I am a pilot so I know what is an airplane and what is not,and what we saw that night, had no scientific, logical, or spiritual explanation.  We all told each other we are surely not alone in this universe.  And we proved it to ourselves that night.

I asked my Weapons Systems operator behind me if he happened to notice that and he responded very positively that he did.  It was a clear and beautiful evening with no clouds and a bright moon.  I told my back seater that I would maneuver to try to intercept what ever it was doing that.  It wasn&apos;t long before what ever it was was seemed to be playing games with me for it would be here and there and when I would go towards where ever I thought it would be, it would be gone. We continued this for maybe a few minutes and by this time were somewhere Northwest of Austin and somewhere around 10,000 to 15,000 for our directions and altitudes kept changing due to this light in the sky I was trying to catch up with.  Suddenly in the distance before me the light made a tracking 180 degree turn and was obviously returning directly headon into us.  I made a comment to my back seater &quot;Damn &quot;___&quot; I think we&apos;ve pissed it off.  I pushed the stick rapidly forward to avoid what I thought surely was going to be a midair collision. The instant I knew we had avoided the collision, I immediately went into afterburning to initiate a high g turn for that really angered me.  It may have just been my imagination, but as whatever it was we had just missed seem to give our aircraft a compression push downward.  That may have been from my own action of abruptly pushing the stick forward and then going into afterburner.  To continue, craning my head back during the high g turn, there is no doubt to me I saw an eerie blue glow quickly fading away from me.  For a brief a moment I thought the thing was gone and my back seater and I began a rather spirited conversation about the preceeding events. I made calls to other aircraft in flight as well as both control towers in the area, BUT none had seen anything unusual.  Had almost called it a night when we both saw what looked like a firey crash just off of Robert Mueller airport.  I immediately called the control tower, but they said that all was normal and they saw nothing.  We circled just north of the airport for we both confirmed with each other what we had seen. Suddenly, from off the airport the way it went in, we saw a spectacular show of something shooting into the sky to the north.  I again called the control tower but they saw nothing.  I pushed the throttle forward and flew in the direction of the thing we saw leaving the ground.  Suddenly before us and about over the city of Georgetown, the most amazing thing I have ever seen in my life happened.  This thing we were pursuing stopped in mid air and lit up like with flashing lights and what looked like a classically described UFO, Oval in shape with portals and flashing and beaming lights coming from it.  My backseater and I confirmed together all we were seeing.  I told my back seater, as I remember, &quot;---&quot; this is too much. We need to bring this thing down -- it is too important to let it escape.  I am going to try to give it a glancing blow and think we will be ok, but be ready to eject if you have to.  I again went into afterburner and aimed for that UFO.  It suddenly went completely dark and the next thing we knew, we watched as it left an almost vertical path upward and we knew at the speed it was going, there was nothing we could do about it. Within a few seconds it was gone and mixed in with the heavenly stars above.  Our fuel by this time demanded we land.  We did not make a report.

I see many commercial planes in the valley flying into and out of Ontario International Airport, which is in the valley below the sighting.

I lived in Oxford, Michigan and for an unknown reason I woke in the middle of the night, I do not know the time, however I was drawn to the window.  I looked out the window and saw a very bright light land in the gravel pit behind my house.  I figure it was about a mile out&hellip; Once the bright light landed it did illuminate enough to see a glow in the woods. (Just beyond the dig section of the pit).  I honestly cannot remember how I was drawn, but I was drawn outside.  If I had to guess, I would say it was a &quot;sound&quot; or frequency that drew me outdoors.  I remember knowing I was not supposed to be out of bed let alone outside, but was heavily drawn. Upon entering the backyard, I was greeted by a Being.  It was slightly taller than me with a long neck, oversized head and large oval shaped eyes, long fingers and toes.  The feet were bear, but honestly do not recall clothing.  The overall color of the skin was grey/green.  When I came upon it, it took my hand and we proceeded across the yard to the back fence.  Once I passed the fence into the woods heading out.. I do not recall a thing.  But what I do remember is a feeling of warmth, friendliness and curiosity on both our parts.  I felt no fear and felt hugely curious.  I remember that my feet felt cool and damp and I remember very clearly the sounds of the night, and the feel of the warm yet slightly cool damp air.  There was very little breeze.  It must have been mid to late summer. I had not thought of that night until I was around 15 or 16 years old when my mother and I went into a book store and I saw the book Communion for the first time.  I started hyperventilating and feeling dizzy and week in the knees as the memory flooded back.  The major difference in looks is that the &quot;grey&quot; on the cover of Communion is a sinister looking being, when my experience was much different. I petty much put the whole thing out of my head and avoided anything regarding Alien abductions, whether it was books or movies for years.  I now feel so far removed from the experience that I am comfortable relating it.  I don&rsquo;t know what it means or if anything happened or even if it really happened.  Was it possible it was a dream?  I did once talk to a hypnotist when I was in my early 20&rsquo;s and described my memory to her.  She was a Stop Smoking therapist and did Abduction Hypnotherapy also.  She indicated that based on her experience, my details were too heavy and too much physical memory for it to be just a dream.  She wanted very much for me to follow up with her, but I never did. I have done very little research, as I was checking out sites on the web I came across you site and decided to throw the information out there and see what came back.  Perhaps this is the time for me to do further investigation on this and determine if it were real or not.  I see that in 1966 there were a number of sightings in Michigan.  However that was years before my time. So here is your information.  Do with it what you will.  If it ties into other types of reports, perhaps this will be of benefit.  If not, I know that nothing will come from this report.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

There must have been 8 or 9 lights - bright white and some red - creating the oval formation.  I was in disbelief of what I saw and called my friends over to look.  Two of my friends came to my side and they too saw the formation of lights.Just after my friends arrived, the object changed its position and we could now only see three lights &ndash; still moving in coordination--until the object flew out of our sight.  A third friend had joined our side and saw the object with only the three light formation.  We were all astonished by what we had just seen, and we kept staring upward to see if the object would reappear.  The object did not pop back out; however, we do believe we saw the object hovering behind some trees that were on the right of the horizon, as we would sometimes catch a glimpse of the bright lights moving up and down.I had a camera in my hands at the time of our sighting; however, I only got a picture of the object when the three lights were visible.  When zooming in on the object, the picture reveals 3 half-moon shaped lights in very close proximity to one another, appearing the color orange (burnt orange).The next day when I was thinking about the sighing, I remembered one piece of information that I found to be relevant or interesting.  From where I was standing and looking, I could see airplanes in the distance (further back from where the object was flying) taking off or coming into my sight path from the bottom of the horizon.  (These airplanes may have taken off from the nearby Schaumburg Airport.)  As it was dusk, I could see the actual airplanes and not just their lights, however when I saw the flying object, at or around the same time, I could only see lights, and not any solid object.

I work a lot in the area and airplanes and helicopters never fly in that northeast to southwest direction, so I watched it.

It seemed to move slowly, meandering in an S pattern, south, then west, then south again before I lost sight of it behind some trees.As it moved almost out of sight to the southwest I then noticed airplane &quot;headlights&quot; moving underneith it by about a distance of seven times the size of the object flying northward in a strait and normal direction of flight.

Suddenly, it just stopped in place and quit moving.  Then, it got dimmer and dimmer while continuing to remain stationary.  It seemed to be ascending at a very rapid rate up into the stratosphere.

The lights looked like they were fused together yet you could see their individual round shape. They were horizontal in the sky and did not move, glow or strobe. I was telling my friend about it and that this was the first time I had ever seen anything like a UFO. I got and walked toward the fence and the lights went out like someone had turned off the switch. I did not see any dark image around the lights like a craft. I wish I had taken a picture with my cell phone but I was too excited and shocked since this was the first time I had ever experienced something unfamilar to me in the sky.

We arrived before the others and did not have a key to get in the church, so we waited outside.  It was a very nice fall night, a full moon, but covered with clouds.  The clouds were traveling in a southeasterly direction, with the moon behind them the clouds were lit up like a neon sign.  For whatever reason we both looked up at the same time.  There was a translucent object traveling in a southwesterly direction, exactly opposite of the clouds.  All you could see was the outline of the craft.  It looked like a stealth bomber, but 10 times larger and the most remarkable thing of all, it made absolutely no sound what so ever as it passed over.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

They all took off in different directions with what seemed to be sparks flying behind them faster than any airplane or helicopter.  My husband at first thought they were comets but they circled back over the house again.

It silently floated northbound in a straight line (not descending) as I gazed east toward the Gila Mountains. It was a few degrees above the mountain ridge and about the size and brightness of the moon (when the moon is high - not it&apos;s just risen appearance) Unfortunately, buildings &amp; trees blocked my full field of vision so I didn&apos;t get to see where it went. I watched it for about 30 seconds. Also, another UFO incident I know was when I was a child. My father worked at Cape Kennedy (in Data processing and died in 1969) came home all excited (a very stoic man) and said something came up to one of our unmanned rockets right after it launched and like a mosquito to a man (UFO to the rocket) and checked it out at many angels and then flew off in a blink of the eye.

The apparent size was perhaps 8 to 10 times larger, and its magnitude was perhaps 5 times that of than any of the stars visible in the waning twilight. It was the prospect of seeing Perseids meteors that had us sitting outside in the tourist camp near the Flaming Cliffs in the central Gobi. The character of the pulsing light seemed to be more of something tumbling out of balance, but there was no apparent movement of the object and somewhat reminiscent of a light house. The event lasted long enough that after my initial sighting was I first drew the attention of our driver who was sitting next to me to it. I was then able to call to my nephew who was inside a ger (yert) laying down to get up and come out and spot the light overhead for a short period before the light faded. I&rsquo;m capable of believing this to be a satellite of some sort given the angle the suns rays would have been traveling at the time of the event, but it was just a very unusual sighting I thought worth the mention and still leaves me wondering what it was we saw.The Perseids meteorite shower was outstanding being seen from such a place with virtually no light pollution, and a relatively high elevation.

The sky was cloudless and unusually clear for my urban location. I had just watched several satellites pass overhead, when I noticed a light low in the southern sky. At first I thought it was another satellite however it seemed a lot brighter and faster than the ones I had just been watching. The object was going from South to North and appeared to be at great altitude. Numerous general aviation and commercial aircraft were visible at the same time. The object appeared to be self luminous instead of reflecting sunlight, as it had an unusual blue/purple tinge similar to an electric welding torch. The object passed almost directly overhead of my location, continuing North until I lost sight of it behind the roofline of my house. The light maintained a straight course the entire time I could see it, traversing the sky from where I first saw it to where I lost sight of it in approximately one minute or so. Shortly before I lost sight of the object it blinked out and lit up again in a regular pattern about three times, going dark for several seconds. I checked the Heavens Above site and could find no info about any satellites passing overhead at that time.

That is when I saw the bright orange thing in the sky. It was closer than I had ever seen it before. It stayed in the same spot for probably about 3-4, doing absolutely nothing. Then it began to flicker and it seemed to be swinging something around itself that had 3 smaller bright orange things attached to it. That lasted about a minute and then it began to quickly move south. All of a sudden it stopped moving again and started to flicker once more. This time it began dropping what looked like little orange lights for about 5 seconds and then grew dim.

At first we thought aloud that the object was a plane in the distance, or a satellite, or even a helicopter. But the object was stationary and looked almost frozen in the sky. The light was white and pulsating and appeared very big from afar. What bothered us was the object appeared to be floating high enough for a visible plane but low enough to know it was a solid crafted object and not a star. As daylight slowly starts to appear, I can still see the object from my window. It looks like it is there for all to see and stands proudly over Hollywood.

She said the total silence and speed of the object&rsquo;s departure had terrified her. I had her make a drawing to the best of her recollection about the object she saw.  She made several drawings, and she finally settled on a drawing that looked similar to a butterfly, basically two triangles with a central area much like a cigar.

At approximately 11:38pm CST, as were walking on the northernmost point of the track, my friend was startled and pointed to an object observable above the northern tree line moving East to West at a high rate of speed.  My first thought was that it was a falling star due to it&apos;s silent flight.  Then, as I noticed NO downward movement of the object and what appeared to be either 1) multiple lights OR 2) several different objects flying in formation, I quickly realized that the object was moving in a trajectory PERPENDICULAR to the horizon and not FALLING as I had first assumed.

I can&apos;t say for certain what direction it went in after I saw it the second time but it was definitely gone by the third time I was able to see it&apos;s path.  It was traveling completely silent, with no engine noises whatsoever.  It was not a helicopter (too fast and too silent), it was not a propeller-driven plane (too fast and too silent), and it was not a jet because their was no sound whatsoever even after it passed.

It was either one LARGE silently moving obje! ct OR se veral objects flying in a VERY TIGHT arc formation for a considerable distance with no real deviation from a perfect arc.  The object traveled at an elevation that was in a straight line with the local water tower and approximately at a 25&deg; angle from where I was standing.  The object&apos;s distance from me was unknown.  I have had experience with the observation of flying objects in the past.

I hope this helps..", "Grayish object flying fast North to south over Independence BlvdOn September 02, 2007, at 2339, I was looking up during a cigarette break at work, standing at the Carmax on Independence Blvd in Charlotte, NC.  There is a low to medium level of light pollution, and looking almost straight up under an overhang cuts out most of that.  I was outside about 5 minutes, and I was looking up, as I usually do at night, looking at constellations, and I happened to notice and watch a very high flying airliner flying approximately east to west.  I then noticed an object flying very fast approximately north to south.  It was a dark grayish shape, with a tiny spot of an orangish color that really seemed like a reflection of light versus an active light, and it was almost unnoticeable except for the movement.  I would say it was almost oval-ish.  It first appeared directly overhead, and was flying at a much higher rate of speed than I&apos;ve seen any aircraft at a visible level.  It was going slow enough to follow it with the naked eye, however.  I first thought it might be a helium ballon due to the characteristics of appearing smaller but moving faster than a plane may.  However, there is no wind during this incident.I have no idea how high or the size of the object, but I would guess possibly 2000 feet up, possibly more, but no where near the height of the airliner.  It traveled in a straight line, jinked to the right similar to a bat would move, about 6-10 degrees, flew about a second on that heading, then jinked back to the left, again in the same instantaneous motion, a smooth, quick motion, while continuing on.  I would say from noticing it almost directly overhead, until I could not see it, lasted about 5-7 seconds.  I shouted at a coworker to look up, but they had just stepped out of hearing range at the time.  I am not taking any medication, do not drink, and have been at work about 6 hours when this happed, so I am fully awake and alert.  I called Charlotte Douglas airport and asked for a controller to ask if they saw anything, they replied the only thing they had was a plane flying around to land at the airport.I know there is no way this thing was a plane.  No flying lights, no blinking lights, the 2 smooth curves it made while flying.  If there was a helicopter that could angle that fast, I might believe that is what I saw, however there were no lights and I don&apos;t believe helicopters fly nearly that fast.I spent 10 years in the Air Force and have seen a few planes fly.  Nothing this fast, seemingly lower height, and the turns/curves it made.  Would like to hear if anyone else saw anything.", "Triangle UFO with orange lights seen over Arizona City twice in one day.My husband and I were outside smoking a cigarette around 11:30 p.m. and he was just telling me about seeing a UFO on the way to work that morning on Sunland Gin Road around 4 a.m., hovering over the crops riding right along side of him. As he was describing the triangular craft with 3 big orange lights when we actually saw it over in the distance! It was facing us, then rotated to its left, our right... So fast that the orange lights left trails going sideways. I was shocked! My husband told me it was definatley the same thing he saw riding ridiculously low to the crops on his way to work. He didn&apos;t know what it was.Now I&apos;ve looked this up on the internet, and I did find a picture of the exact same lights, and the article that followed said these were flares being dropped from a plane. Well I think that is a bunch of B.S. because we actually saw the craft for one thing, and flares being dropped would leave trails going down not sideways.We don&apos;t know what this is, whether its some secret military aircraft they&apos;re testing out here in the middle of nowhere, or if its aliens but we definately saw it.", "It was a bright hovering over the ridge of the mountains  It was Sept. 2001 It was about 10:00 P.M.

At the time of the sighting, I was taking practice celestial fixes pursuant to becoming an Air Force navigator.The exact date escapes me, but it was in July.  There were celestial navigation trainers in the quadrangle, small enclosures with astrodomes inside, that each of us used with a bubble sextant hung from an astrodome.  The sextants were 1.5 power and were pre-set by the student for azimuth and elevation.  Once the settings were in the sextant, the student would look into the eyepiece and choose the brightest star in the field to set the sextant crosshairs and hold them there for two minutes.  The two minutes was necessary for the sextant averager to arrive at the proper elevation for the precomputed time of the shot.On this night, I had precomputed a shot for Kochab in the Little Dipper, set the proper azimuth and elevation into the sextant, and had set the crosshairs on the bright star in the field.  I began the shot and was adjusting the elevation as the averager was ticking away.The &quot;star&quot; I was shooting held firm with other stars in the field for about half  minute.Then I noticed that the azimuth and elevation were changing in excess of what was usual and could see that the supposed star was changing location relative to the other stars in the field.  I took my eye from the eyepiece and watched the &quot;star&quot; slowly moving to the right and slightly downward in relation to the other stars.There were two other cadets in the trainer precomputing for a shot.  I tried to show them the &quot;star&quot;, but they could not easily see it among the other stars and it was moving too slowly for them to notice it easily - so they lost interest quickly and never saw what I was attempting to show them.  I was not excited because the nothing exciting seemed to be happening.  Consequently, the other cadets went back to what they had been doing.I watched the &quot;star&quot; continuing to move for a distance of about ten degrees across the sky (perhaps it was less) and then it stopped and just stayed in place with the other stars once more.  I continued to watch the &quot;star&quot; for several minutes and checked its location again before I left the trainer (at least a half hour later).  The object never moved again during this time relative the other stars.I thought about this for some time.  I never reported it.  This was before there was ever even a Sputnik.  Later, in the Air Force, I learned of many UFO sightings that were never reported (reporting them was unwise at the time), and I began to think that what I had seen was a &quot;mother ship&quot; changing its solar orbit (otherwise, it would have been moving all the time).", "My UFO Sighting: CE IIAt 21:00 or 9:00 PM a coworker and I left work for the day and went to start up our vehicles in the associate parking lot of a local /chain retail store.  It was approximately -34 to -44 degrees below zero with a strong wind and dark.  It was colder inside our automobiles than outside so we waited outside our vehicles while they were warming up.  I looked up at approximately south, southeast (which was above the discount store building) to observe an object, in the shape of a trapezoid, that was large enough that it&apos;s bottom was 7 degrees above the horizon and it&apos;s top was 24 degrees above the horizon.  The object had a cluster of lights that were semi structured / semi randomly placed that apeared mother of pearl in color.  It was stationary regardless of the wind.     I waited to see if the other person observed it as well then he asked me if I was seing what he was seeing.  After observing it for about 15 minutes it moved 5 degrees to the right then went stationary again.  At this time our vehicles were warm so we both drove home.  It just so happens that I lived 1.4 miles in the direction of the object.  So I observed it getting larger as I drove toward it.  From the balcony of my appartment I observed it for another 15 minutes.  Then I went to sleep due to exhaustion.  I since then have taken GPS readings from both sighting locations.  With the help of University Scientists I have obtained Infrasound and Weather Radar Data.  The infrasound data may not be related based on university staff reccomendations.  Also, the infrasound readings are below audible levels.  I did not hear any noise. However two bars of infrasound do appear.  One bar at about 21:00 the other bar maybe 45 minutes later. (The one scientist that explained this to me became upset when I expressed my intention to report this data.) It is estimated that the object was 45 miles away and 4,000 feet above the earth. (?) With the help of three mathematicians I estimate the width of the object to be about 23.3 miles wide. ! It is t hought to be of a natural origin.  However, it did seem to exhibit some movement that suggests intelligent operation.  But I cringe at that speculation.  The creative part of me wants to elaborate and fill in the blanks.  But the logical side of me is struggling to explain it away as a natural phenomenon.  I have put together a 77 page book on it and sold one copy over ebay.

Very bright green then red then blue and white flashing lights.

I was looking North-East in the direction that the meteor shower was supposed to appear.  Suddenly I saw a meteor.  My son did not see the meteor.  I directed my son in the direction that the meteor was in.  Almost immediately, we both saw this set of orange lights fly over head from North-East to South-West.  It sort of resembled 7 orange birds flying in a &ldquo;V&rdquo; formation.  The object made absolutely no sound!  We didn&rsquo;t see it coming over the horizon, it just appeared.  Almost like the lights just came on.  We tried to follow it, but it disappeared over the South-West horizon.  But it was again almost like the lights just turned off.  Maybe you have to be directly under the object to see the lights.  I&rsquo;ve seen many pictures of this type of craft before, but never in my life did I think I would actually see it myself.  It scared my son pretty bad, so we went inside and did not watch any more of the meteor shower.  I&apos;m sure that if someone else was watching the shower that they too would have seen this craft.

I was looking east and saw what I initially thought was an airplane with its flood lights through the branches of the tree located in my front yard, I then thought the plane is pretty low so I walked forward to see clearly what was going on. As I walked toward the light my second thought was the Rockford PD with their new police helicopter are on the hunt for someone with the search lights on, until I came to a clear view and the lights grew intense and then more intense as though a star was expanding glowing brighter and brighter for a few seconds and then from the light it looked as if it was a very large meteor entering the atmosphere catching on fire. I was convinced I was seeing the coolest meteor ever to fall to earth until it hit me, the meteor was not falling to earth it was moving away from earth up through and out of our atmosphere . As soon as I realized it was going the wrong direction for a meteor, a small object too small for great descriptive detail but if I were to give the best discription it was almost like an object with a perfect oval shape tilted on its side horizontally shot from the object that was on fire exiting our atmosphere at an imperceptible speed and seemed to disappear into the starry night sky with the fireball left trailing until disapating to blackness.  I then went and looked at the launch scheduled for NASA to see if it had been the shuttle and found that there were no launches scheduled for July.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

He called me over and we were watching for about 5 minutes or so when we saw the object get very bright almost as if it had stopped and just started glowing intensely.  At this point, my son started watching and we were pointing at the object.  Then two other planes came in from behind the object.  They began flying in formation behind the object for several miles.  The object itself was very light and seemed high in the sky.  The planes followed closely behind the small light until it was out of view.  The odd part was that we live near enough to the airport, that we see planes all the time.  These planes made no sound at all.

I was trying to find the big dipper, when I noticed that there were two stars, that didn&rsquo;t quite fit in. It was only a fraction of a second before the two unidentifiable stars were in motion. When I noticed that there were two stars that were moving, I thought that perhaps hallucinating because I was tired from being up so late. I studied the objects in motion for a brief moment when I realized that there was a third star not too far ahead of the two, also in motion. The two stars were moving at the same speed, in the same direction. The third star (in front of the two) was also moving at the same speed, in the same direction. I told my 3 friends who were out there with me to take a look and pointed them in the direction, and they were just as amazed as I when we realized that as the &ldquo;stars&rdquo; were moving through the sky, that the actual stars in the sky, disappeared, and the reappeared after the moving &ldquo;stars&rdquo; had passed. When placing an imaginary line to get a shape of the moving &ldquo;stars&rdquo;, you were looking at a triangle. The triangle was enormous. It was moving at an extremely slow speed, and was obviously a solid object, because as previously stated, the actual stars in the sky, disappeared as the object flew over the night sky. My friend insisted that there was some army-base near by and that it was an aircraft. I had to disagree because the object was larger than any aircraft we have in the area, and said that its 1 o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and that there are no army-bases testing aircrafts in the local neighborhoods in the middle of the night! Also, aircrafts give off three different colored flashing lights; one red, one blue and one clear (bright). Aircrafts don&rsquo;t fly in sync unless doing a performance, which we don&rsquo;t have in this area. Aircrafts also don&rsquo;t fly in the same direction for more than a few seconds until they fall out of line because they are going to different places. The object took about 10 seconds to be out of sight, but that was only because it flew so far into the distance, and we weren&rsquo;t able to see past the surrounding area. The direction it flew was NNE, towards some of the back roads. (There is an airbase located in the area, however the object was larger than the base itself.)  Using google earth, I am able give you enough information to get a visual of how large the object was.

It was very large and moving at great speed.  It seemed to loop around quickly to change directions, then accelerated at a sharp angle as if trying to land quickly.  It disappeared.  The area in which it seemed to go down was too far from Fort Campbell to be near that airfield. It had a V shape of bright white lights that seemed to be in a straight line sometimes depending on the angle.  At first I could only see the three lights at the outside angles forming a triangle.  I only saw white lights, no color.  The lights were equally spaced apart at least 6 or 7 in number.  I did not hear any sound of a helicopter or plane.  I&rsquo;m guessing the distance to be less than a football field away from my car. There were plenty of vehicles on the interstate including truck drivers.  No one even slowed down.  My daughter and I saw it simultaneously.  It seemed obvious that it wasn&rsquo;t an ordinary airplane.  I wonder if it is some fancy military craft.

When she looked to her left, which was a westerly direction, she said, &quot;Boy, that balloon is really low.&quot; When I was finally clear of the barn doors I turned to my right to see this black sphere shape that was crossing the sky. I was trying to determine if it was a balloon as she said but due to the speed and the direction in which it was flying I thought that it can&rsquo;t be a balloon. The sun was still up and had not yet set as I watched the object move across the horizon. The object maintained its shape and altitude the entire time and did not change from its black color. As I started to turn to the southeast direction I watched the object move.  You could see that the object was shiny as it caught the setting sun. The object crossed over the roof top of my neighbor&rsquo;s house and then over a group of trees in the field across from our house. This gave me an idea of how high the object was. I would guess that it was between 800 feet to 1000 feet high. As it traveled northwest to southeast the object did not change from this altitude. The distance traveled was very quick.  Once it was over the field, which would have put the object directly in front of our house, it disappeared in the sky.  As my husband and I were walking towards the house I noticed something in the sky above us. I couldn&rsquo;t tell what it was so I asked him if he saw it, too. Together we watched it cross the sky right above us.  What we saw is best described as a black sphere. It was very visible to us; there was nothing else in the sky. It was clear in our field of view. At the same time we noticed it so did our dog as she began barking. There were no lights &ndash; no sound as it traveled &ndash; just a black sphere that traveled across the sky. It was flying north to south and at a fast speed. It flew horizontal, it didn&rsquo;t move up or down in the sky just straight across in a direct path. Then it just disappeared &ndash; it didn&rsquo;t go up into the clouds or disappear into the horizon - it was just gone. We saw it at around 8:45 pm - the sun was just beginning to set. We watched it for several seconds as we discussed what it could be. The height it flew was similar to the height of a low flying aircraft.

I was on the deck of our home at approximately 10:30 p.m. mountain time tonight, and as I looked into the night sky (it was virtually cloudless) something caught my eye. At first I thought it was a satellite because that is about how bright it was, but I quickly noticed it was made up of at least three objects in a forward facing V formation and it was traveling many many times faster than any satellite I have ever seen before, yet much slower than any meteorite I have ever seen. It did not leave any kind of streak behind it, or have any kind of tail, it just looked like a formation of stars in a V shape traveling in a straight line at a very high rate of speed. I do not have an explanation for what I saw. I hope someone may by chance have seen the same thing at the same time as me somewhere in the United States. It was on a southeast heading. I am located in central Wyoming. I honestly believe there were a total of five lights, I said three in the first post because I was trying to describe a V shape. I am sure these weren&apos;t lights on the forward edge of some kind of giant object. There was no blocking out of adjacent stars around the lights. It just looked fast moving stars flying in formation, and I didn&apos;t get the sense they were even in earth&apos;s atmosphere. When I was explaining it to my wife we did see some meteors that were streaking from the east to the west.

As we were standing there I looked up into the sky and saw a rather bright glowing object in the sky.  I at first thought it was one of the planets, but realized it was still too early and not yet dark enough to see any stars.  I told my wife I thought it was something reflecting light from the sun but it was stationary and rather large.  I told her I thought maybe it might be the International Space station but I frankly do not know if that is ever visible to the naked eye.  I just sensed it was unusual so I went into the house to retrieve a pair of binoculars. I returned to the backyard and looked up at the object and could see then what looked like red glowing lights around the bright center circular object.  We could also see a jetliner moving through the sky and it too was reflecting some light.   My wife looked at the object through the binoculars also but did not try to adjust the lenses to her eyes and did not see the detail I did.  She said she could only see that it was a bright object.  This is when it got very interesting.  I got the binoculars back from her and as I was looking at object I saw approximately six smaller bright looking circular lights move away from  the brighter object we had first seen.  They moved away slowly from the center object at first and paused in a pattern around it.  They then suddenly took off at high speed and simply disappeared from view.  The center glowing object disappeared also.  As I was telling my wife what I was seeing she looked back only to see the original object was gone and the sky was now empty in the area.

I looked up and saw what I thought was a shooting star but immediately decided that it could not be one because it continued moving and was very bright.  I told my husband who immediately saw it.  We decided that it was impossible for it to be an airplane because it was moving very fast.  My husband looked down for a second and lost track of it, but I didn&rsquo;t.  The light continued moving and suddenly began to turn, up and down and left and right, as if it was trying to avoid hitting something up there.  Eventually, I too lost track of it.

As I drove closer I notice one yellow and two white lights at which the white lights where  going on and off.  The yellow light stayed on.   As we got closer we could tell it was not a helicopter, and it was hovering above Stop 11 and Madison Ave.  I pulled into Egg Roll King Restaurant and stop my car to take a look, my Grandson got out of the car, I stay in the car.  It wasn&apos;t a plane or helicopter.  Both of us could see the bottom clearly.  The bottom looked like a triangle shape, I could see metal beams two on each side of the triangle.  I could not see the top, cause we where underneath the object.  The only lights we seen where on the bottom of the triangle.  The white lights we going off intermittently as the yellow stayed on.  I could see the outline above the triangle of the object.  It appeared to be somewhat oval shaped, and what I mean by that there where two spots where it protruded out and it equal in shape, opposite each other.  The color of the object was metallic, the triangle beams where of a black color.  We watched this object from one 1-2 minutes, then it started to move to the south slowly, then to the west.

I live to the north of uptown Sedona, Arizona and my house sits on the edge of the Coconino national forest with only dwarf juniper and pinion forest behind my home.  I am just south by about half a mile from the base of mount Wilson in an ever rolling series of elevations. As I watched this object there were long trailing flames coming from each end of the unidentified thing.  I was paniced by the sight of this as it looked possibly like a plane in that it was somewhat chevon in shape with the flames coming from each of the tip points and the apex was pointed in the direction of the fall. It took about 2 seconds to fall out of sight. I first noticed the object at about mid point on the horizon and watched it fall directly behind Brins Mesa which is about a mile to the northwest of our home.  There was no noise or blast from an impact.  However, in the area of the trajectory there were pluming clouds that seem to come from the point were the object would have made contact with the ground.  There were no other clouds in the sky.  At an arms distance it was about the size of a nickel to a quarter. I have lived here for about 5 years and been witness to many meteor showers but none have ever looked as strange as this object.  It obviously had a span between the flaming ends just as an airplane would have from wing tip to wing tip.  I did not see a fuselage or tail section.  It was more like a flying wing.  I did not call the police.  The flames and total comprized color of said object was bright white.", "Three steady orange lights in a triangular formation, much bigger than a conventional aircraft, moving slowly from east to north.At 8:40 pm I went outside to take a walk and noticed, in the northeast, two bright orange lights, moving slowly, in tandem toward the left.  The brighter of the two was about the same brightness as Jupiter, which has been prominent in the southwest sky for weeks now.  The second was a bit dimmer.  At first it reminded me of the tandem flyover of the space shuttle and ISS a couple months ago, except they were going the wrong direction and were completely the wrong color. However, the speed was similar, and the brighter light appeared to be following the other. The lights were low in the sky, and soon moved behind some trees. When they came back into view, I realized there were 3 orange lights, forming a broad-based triangle, with the two dimmer lights at the bottom and the brighter at the top, between them. As they headed behind some trees again, then behind the house across the street, I called for my daughter to come out of the house, and I ran around in my yard trying to find a clear view. Once my daughter was outside with me, I saw the lights once more in a gap between trees. By this time the lights were in a different configuration &ndash; as if the brighter light were &ldquo;catching up&rdquo; with one of the dimmer ones.  They were all slightly dimmer by that time, so I had the impression that they were moving away, toward the north. They soon dropped below the treetops and I didn&apos;t see them again. As I think about it now, the 3 lights may have represented the corners of a very large triangular object (way bigger than an airplane), which turned toward the north while it was behind the trees, thereby changing the angle at which I was seeing the lights. Size - if I held my arms out straight, and pretended to put one finger on each light in the sky, my fingers would be about 5-7 inches apart between the brightest light and the two dimmer ones, and about 12-13 inches apart between the two dim lights  Out of the 4 or 5 minutes that elapsed, I had perhaps 60 seconds, total, that I could actually see the lights. I didn&rsquo;t hear anything. But then again I saw a conventional small aircraft in roughly the same area, and couldn&rsquo;t hear that either.  The conventional aircraft seemed to have circled around in the same general direction as the UFO, then back again toward me. Or it could have been two different aircraft, going in two different directions. I&rsquo;m wondering if there&rsquo;s any way to find out if the pilot(s) saw anything?", "Early morning Boulder, CO UFO sighting with photosI couldn&apos;t sleep and went to work on my computer.

They moved overhead without any sound, heading toward the west and then arching to the south-west/south, like they were heading toward White Sands.

It appeared to be at a very high altitude. I assumed it to be a weather balloon as it seemed to move in the same direction as the clouds. These clouds are the wispy type usually found at high altitudes. After thought not too much about it until I saw another object in the same general vicinity. By the way, I am looking to the southwest at about a 75 to 80 degree angle. This other object is moving from Northeast to southwest at a much slower rate than the first object. I no longer see the first object so get my digital camera and start taking pictures. I am taking pictures because this is now quite unusual. They do not seem to be aircraft as they are not shaped like one. I am a former Air Traffic Controller who used to work at Lambert. I am familiar with aircraft and their flight characteristics. I continue to take pictures hoping that the clouds can give some reference to size and altitude of this object when I notice another object in the same vicinity. It seems to be higher than the second object. Both these object are either stationary or moving very slowly because the clouds are now obscuring them. The clouds eventually became a little thicker and I could no longer distinguish the objects.I will attempt to send the pictures.Thank you((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

No aircraft collision lights were observed around the orbs.  The light did not vary their color and only varied their brightness when fading away.

It also slightly pulsed. And that &quot;star&quot; just stayed there, not moving...and NOT like the way the headlights of a plane can seem to not move when coming directly towards you...it simply DID NOT move.

I was lying down next to my pool which is screened in but I still could see the stars easy enough.  I am an amateur astronomer and I specialize in imaging so I know the night sky well.  It was 11:45  and I was laying down and watching the stars when I saw it. It was a perfect V shaped set of red lights going right overhead. I believe there were 6 lights on each of the two sides. There was no noise and no strobes.The lights did not change position to each other and the object went across the sky at a moderate speed.This object was quite large, about the size of two full moons. So either it was a very large object at a very high altitude or still a large object at a lower altitude. Either way I did not see any strobes or hear any noise. I have jets fly over my house all the time and it&rsquo;s quite easy to tell them apart even at night time and this did not look nothing like one. In fact I watch a jet fly over about 10 minutes later and not only could I hear it and see its strobe lights, it was much, much smaller is size. I have seen blimps to and it did not look like them.I was wondering if anyone else noticed this object that night at that time frame.I would find it hard to believe that no one else saw it.", "Three strange lights moving irregularly close together and at high speed.Facing west, we noticed three dots of light traveling in a triangular formation at very high speed and very close together. I compared their speed to obvious planes moving in other areas of the sky. They were not flashing, but rather constant. All three lights were traveling from north to south about four feet off the horizon moving into the horizon more than across it. The peculiar thing is that the lights seemed to be kind of weaving instead of moving in a straight line-very odd movement. I have never seen anything like it. After about 30 seconds and grabbing my brother from inside to take a look, they disappeared. My guess was that they were too high and as they got closer to the horizon we lost them in the light, but it seemed really abrupt. As we stood there dumbfounded, there appeared another light with a smaller, fainter red light traveling right next to it. These two traveled along the same line as the first three and at the same speed. They also moved in the same strange way-not in a straight line, but more like in a wave. I have to say that it gave me chills!", "High altitude light moving E-W, stops, loiters, makes a 90 degree turn, and accellerates at lightening speed out of the atmosphDuring the spring of 1982 I was camping with my girlfriend on Mount Palomar near the observatory in California.  It was a very clear night so we were able to see an incredible amount of stars that evening, it was really very beautiful.  Around 10:00 PM, I noticed a red light moving across the southern hemisphere at an attitude of about 11:00. The object appeared to be moving slow like an airplane from west to east, but its altitude was very high as if it was in the upper atmosphere somewhere in the neighborhood of at least 80,000 feet. At this altitude I imagine that its ground speed had to be tremendous, and it was probably pretty large if I could see it that far away. We watched the object move across the sky for about three to four minutes and then it simply stopped and loitered for five to ten seconds before it made a 90 degree right turn and departed at lightening speed out of the atmosphere. Even though the red light was probably the sun reflecting off of what ever it was, this was not a shooting star, they don&rsquo;t leave the atmosphere once they enter it and this was not another planet, they don&rsquo;t move like that.  I am retired military and somewhat of a UFO skeptic, but I am not aware of anything in our inventory that is capable of flying at such a high speed then come to a dead stop, loiter, and then make a sharp turn and accelerate out of our atmosphere in less than a second.  It just doesn&rsquo;t exist. On one other occasion I made a similar observation during the early 1990s. I was on an at sea deployment with the Marines between Hawaii and the Philippines when I saw the object.  The Navy usually operates under what they call &ldquo;darken ship&rdquo; conditions at night so it gets very dark out there and you can see are the navigational lights. Because of this, you can see stars like you&rsquo;ve never seen before under these conditions.  Anyway, I can&rsquo;t remember all of the details, but I do remember that the events that occurred that evening were almost identical to the ones that occurred in 1982, which is why I have remembered them even after all of these years.   And yes, there were others with me when we sat what ever it was.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))", "Afternoon sighting of stationary white spherical objectLate in the afternoon of a bright and clear day, my daughters and I were taking a walk along what is known as Auditorium Shores in downtown Austin Texas.  The Colorado River (or Town Lake as it is called) runs through the city of Austin and there is a green belt, with hike and bike trails running parallel to the river on both sides.  I was looking up at the sky, which was particularly blue with beautiful cumulous nimbus cloud formations, when I spotted a small white circular object almost directly above us.  The object appeared to be stationary and was positioned very high in the sky.  I was very surprised and I pointed it out to my two (almost) teenage daughters.  I tried to recognize it as possibly a planet, or a balloon or even a strange and bright star but could not say it was any of those things.  It was the same color as the beautiful cumulous nimbus clouds but of apparent solid structure with a definitive circumference.  We stopped walking and began to only observe the object.  Like I mentioned it appeared to be stationary, white in color and circular in shape.  While observing the object a large plane, which I recognized as a commercial airliner, flew near it and I was able to compare the object to the plane.   The object appeared to be higher in the atmosphere than the plane which looked pretty small.  The plane was at an angle as if it was climbing to cruising altitude.   The airliner cruised on by the object, strengthening my conviction that the object was not traveling in the sky, but was stationary.   I looked around often to observe the people out walking, running, biking and fishing along Town Lake.  No one appeared to be aware of the object.  We began walking again and periodically looking back up at the object.  After a few moments, my daughter started exclaiming that the object was breaking into two pieces!  I looked up again, refocused my gaze.  I too observed what appeared to now be two circular objects; however their sides appeared to still be touching.   I readjuste! d my eye s for several different looks as I know that an object at a distance can appear to be two due to a trick of our eyes.  No matter how I readjusted my gaze the object did appear to be morphing into two circular objects.  After only a few moments, it appeared to morph back into one object again.  My daughter and I where exasperated and excited by the strange behavior!  A few minutes later, we came upon a man fishing and we stopped to point out the object to him.  Due to his confinement in a wheel chair and apparent poor eye sight he never was able to see the object.    He could not position his head to look almost directly above us to see the object.  The man felt it might be a planet and politely dismissed us.   Not wanting to appear strange I quickly agreed with him.  About that time a cloud began to move in front of the object.   I could still see it through the cloud cover for several more minutes but by this point the novelty was wearing off and we resumed our hike.   Even if it is a UFO, I thought to myself, it is positioned too far off and people where not even noticing it.   Nevertheless, I looked diligently in that area of the sky for the remainder of the hike and did not see the object again even though the cloud had moved on.  I took the man&rsquo;s assumption that it was probably a planet to heart.  I felt that if it was a planet I would be able to see it when the clouds moved on, but I never saw it again during the rest of the day.   I scanned the whole sky looking for the object but it was gone.  So upon returning home I looked on the internet to see what planet might be visible to the naked eye during daylight hours at this time of year and at our location.  I could not find any information pertaining to a day time planet visibility for our area or anywhere near us for that matter.   I am baffled as to the odd behavior of the object and felt that if it was a planet it would not have apparently morphed into two objects nor would it disappear from view.   A planet would have remained on its path thro! ugh the sky.", "Red revolving light in IllinoisWe were walking in the door as I caught a light in the corner of my eye.  I looked up and it was a bright red light fairly high in the atmosphere.  My husband and my mother both saw the light and we watched it.  It stayed stationary, but it looked like it was revolving, the brightness of the light was almost the same effect a lighthouse has, as it rotates the intensity of the light became brighter.  An airplane passed fairly close to it, but it seemed to be even higher up than the airplane.  It then zipped to another spot and rotated a few more times then the light slowly disappeared, it did not move left or right it went up.  Tried to take a picture of it, but could not get a good picture with the camera we have, also do not have binoculars or a telescope to have gotten a better look.", "UFO&apos;s over Keighley UKI have just seen quite a major UFO flap over keighley, UK, several UFO&apos;s, red/orange in colour all following the same flightpath i guess you would say, yet a few mins between each one. About 1hr ago i got dropped off near my house by a friend, it was quite dark and so it was quite easy to notice this red flickering ball in the sky. I wondered if it might be a UFO but kinda just kept walking to my house. Then about 30 seconds into my walk i saw several people stood out in their garden and heard them say &quot;here comes some more, they are quite evenly spaced out&quot; or something like that. I looked over my shoulder and sure enough there was a pair of them coming over into sight. Same characteristics as the first, totally silent and flickering red/orange. I called my friend up who had just dropped me off and told him to look into the sky, he too saw them! a couple of mins later, after the pair of UFO&apos;s had gone from my sight, 2 more came strolling over the horizon exactly the same, just ambling along in no particular rush. They kept coming mins apart, then finally one on its own. I wasn&apos;t counting but i must have seen about 10 in total, and judging by the crowd of people in the garden there was more before that!

I was standing in our company&rsquo;s break room talking to another co-worker when a third co-worker opened the door and told us there was a strange object/light hovering near and above the south side of town. Having some experience with a few sightings before (because my eyes never leave the sky) I ran out and immediately began to compare its movement with a nearby by airliner, houses and trees. According to my co-worker, the object/light started out as being as large as his fingernail.  It moved slowly upward, silently.  By the time he arrived at work and I had gotten outside to see it and it was half the luminosity of Venus which was shining in the predawn light also in the southern sky.  The light from the object began to pulsate and the object began to move in a tight circular pattern.  A commercial airliner began to approach the area from a westerly direction at what I can assume to be a 30,000 foot ceiling.  As the airliner came closer, the object moved sporadically in a straight line heading south, quickly the light flickered and dissipated and finally shot away. 30 minutes later while we were talking about it in the office, a third witness told us that she saw the same object from a different angle. She said that she saw two smaller objects &quot;eject&quot; or &quot;shoot&quot; out from the bottom of the main craft. She pulled her daughter outside to watch. 20 minutes after the craft shot away, the sky was a full military aircraft scrambled in multiple directions and all in the basic area where the object was hovering. A person in our group familiar with Air Force maneuvers mentioned that those aircraft were moving in a scout formation.  We are all familiar with the regular air traffic patterns from L.A., Vegas and Phoenix. None of these six or so aircraft followed those usual patterns.

After just about a half mile, I looked up to see an egg-shaped rust-colored craft moving from the north. It was, I would guess, less than a thousand feet above me and moving to the south. I was near enough that I could see sun glint off its surface and thought it must be a plane of some sort. It didn&apos;t have wings, though (none that I could discern), and it made no sound. It was not like any craft I&apos;ve seen before. I rounded a bend and lost it when oak trees obscured my view. Then, the line of sight opened up and I saw it move very rapidly south until it was out of the sight to the south. It seemed to remain at about the same elevation that I initially observed it as it moved south. I&apos;ve never seen a craft move that rapidly--only 15 to 30 seconds and it was well past the Ojai Valley and on to ranges to the south. Again, I heard no sound from it.", "My TV went off and I felt that something or someone was &quot;fooling&quot; with me and watching meAround the fall of 1991, as a teenager, I had stayed home from school by telling my parents that I was sick.  I stayed in bed most of the day watching TV.  My mother came home from work at the ordinary time and cooked dinner.  We all ate and then I went back to my room and continued to watch the TV, that had not been turned off all day.  As it began to get later and dark outside, my parents went to bed and I continued to watch TV.  Here is where my encounter began. I don&rsquo;t remember what show was on, but I do remember that I was beginning to doze off while watching TV around 11PM or so.  All of the sudden, my television turned off.  I immediately assumed that I had rolled over on the remote and accidentally turned it off.  I grabbed the remote and hit the power button, but nothing happened.  I then thought that either the tube was shot from being on all day or that after I rolled over on the remote and turned off the TV that the battery must have gone dead in the remote.  I then got up out of bed and walked over to the TV.  I reached down and pressed the power button on the TV and nothing happened.  I then figured that the tube was gone and reached over to my stereo, which was in the same entertainment center, and pressed the power button.  Again, nothing happened.  I thought, it could have been a power outage but the only problem with that is that both my TV and stereo had a &ldquo;standby&rdquo; light which was red and signified that the units were receiving power.  Both lights were lit.  At this time I started to get a feeling that someone or something was &ldquo;fooling&rdquo; with me and I had a feeling that I was being watched. I had two windows in my room.  One was facing the front yard and street, and the other was facing our next door neighbor&rsquo;s house which was probably 50 to 60 feet from our house.  Something inside me told me to look out of the window that was facing my next door neighbor.  Both of my windows had blinds and both blinds were closed.  I stepped over the window facing my neighbor and began to roll open the blinds.  As soon as the blinds opened just enough for me to get a glimpse of the yard, I saw a disc-shaped object hovering over the ground right outside my window!  Although I didn&rsquo;t get to see this object long, I will never forget what I saw.  There were blinking lights of all colors around the rim of the disc and I couldn&rsquo;t hear a sound that it was making.  As soon as I got a glimpse of this object, it took off flying straight up in the air.  It took off so quick that it startled me even further, but my interest was on high alert and I wanted to know what this was.  I then pulled the string down so that the blinds would open completely.  When the blinds were open, I looked up to the sky and I saw this object, now just a speck in the night sky, suddenly disappear!  I stood there for a few moments trying to make sense of what had just happened.  After I regained my senses, I reached over and pressed the power button on the TV and it came on!  I immediately thought to myself that I must be dreaming, so I went into the dining room which was adjacent to my bedroom and wrote a note to my mother that said, &ldquo;wake me up if you get this note, I saw a UFO&rdquo;.  I then went to bed and figured if I had dreamed this, she would never get the note.  She did get the note, and woke me up in the morning. I was a football player, a very smart student.  Although I had drank alcohol maybe once or twice on an experimental basis with my friends, I had NEVER used any kind of drugs, nor had I EVER experienced any episode of hallucination.  This really happened and I would sware to it!  When I told my mother what had happened, she didn&rsquo;t tell me that she did not believe me but I could tell that she probably didn&rsquo;t want me to tell anyone else this story.  I really didn&rsquo;t want to tell anyone anyway because the story sounded so &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; and I didn&rsquo;t want people to think that I was delusional.  I did tell a couple of select people over the next year or so, and got the reaction that I thought that I would get, so I kind of forgot about it. I joined the Army a few years later, and when I was in training in Colorado, I told a friend of mine this story and he proceeded to tell me a similar story from when he was a teenager in Utah.  It involved his truck stalling out in the middle of nowhere and he then witnessed a UFO hovering over his truck.  It took off just as quickly as the one I saw did and then his truck became operable again.  After he told me this, I became a little more comfortable telling this story and began telling more people.  I attempted to tell my story on one of these websites once before a few years ago, but it was not as user friendly as your site and I don&rsquo;t think it went through.  Just about an hour ago, I saw a show on the history channel about USO&rsquo;s, which led me to google &ldquo;UFO sitings&rdquo;, which led me to your site and I decided to go ahead and put my story on here. I am a sales manager for a Toyota dealership.  I am a very intelligent person and my family and friends often look to me for advice on lots of things.  I come from a family that taught me to tell the truth, even when it hurts.  I come from a middle-class family which is a very conventional, church-going, don&rsquo;t make any waves type of family.  I don&rsquo;t want to overstate this, but this is the TRUTH.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I told her it was a star, but she was sure it was moving, and had blinking lights on it. I got my binoculars and looked at it. It was hard to tell if it was moving, but then when I saw an electric line in my foreground, and sitting in the same position I could tell it was moving very slowly. It was pretty far off but I could distinguish red, green, and white lights that blinked. I watched it for about 20 minutes, until I couldn&rsquo;t see the blinking lights.

It was brought to everyone&rsquo;s attention, but instead of looking, everyone thought it was probably just an airplane. As time went on, everyone slowly made their way to the window to take a look.  Everyone agreed that there was no way it was an airplane because it wasn&rsquo;t moving.  We thought it could be coming straight at us, but it NEVER came overhead, and it NEVER moved left or right.  It couldn&rsquo;t have been a star either- because it was flashing VIVID white, green, red, and blue lights. Very bright!  The figure also seemed to change shape.

Then it started get smaller, like it was moving further away-still flashing (easily seen by the naked eye) bright vivid colors. Still no movement.  Just size change, as it appeared to be flying directly away from us toward outer space.((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Sirius.

I spotted a very bright white light that was moving across the sky and pointed it out to my son and asked him if he thought it could be a satellite or an airplane. We both agreed it was far too bright and too close to be a satellite or airplane. Plus, it wasn&rsquo;t making any noise.With the naked eye it appeared to be round in shape, but when I checked it out with my binoculars it looked more triangular. It continued to move across the sky from west to east. But what REALLY got our attention was when two much smaller circular lights flew right past it going the opposite direction and then appeared to circle around behind it.Surprisingly we weren&rsquo;t really scared, but more interested than anything else. Could it have been some bizarre military flight, or was it truly a UFO? I&rsquo;m convinced it was, even though no one really believes us. My son is a young teenager and I&apos;m a late 40&apos;s business executive with no science background.

I just saw it again tonight. When I first saw it I thought it was a satellite, but then I realized it couldn&apos;t be because Earth made satellites don&apos;t move like that. It shows up around midnight and stays around until 4am or so. Its not out every night, but it has been out the past weekend.I was going to film it myself, but its so blasted small I couldn&apos;t possibly find it though the lens of the camera in the night sky.

I don&apos;t recall exactly when I saw the UFO, but it was some time in the winter months of either 1992 or 1993. I was with my husband, Michael (who was my boyfriend at the time of the sighting), late one evening.  I was a student of Pennsylvania State University at the time.  Michael was a graduate of Penn State and was visiting me for the weekend at the time.  Penn State had an area in its vast grounds commonly called the &quot;Deer Pens&quot; which is part of its Deer Research Facility. Late that evening, perhaps roughly around 11:00 pm, though I don&apos;t recall the exact time, we decided to go up to the deer pens and see what we can see at night, even though it was pitch black out at the time.  Call us crazy college students.  Anyway, we went up there driving in Michael&apos;s car, and the place is deserted.  The deer pens themselves are surrounded by a tall chain-link fence to contain the deer, and the inside the fenced area is off-limits to the public and accessible only to the deer researchers and the deer themselves. The access road (dirt and gravel road) we were on was just outside the fence. As we drove up to the central part of the deer pens viewing area, we noticed a glowing object on the ground inside the deer pen.  The object was roughly the size of a small barn or very large storage shed.  However, the object&apos;s shape was like a rounded cone shape.  The whole thing was glowing a bright orangey-red color, and appeared to have a &quot;doorway&quot; in the center of the object.  The doorway was shaped in a vertical rectangular shape that was arched at the top.  The doorway, or opening perhaps, was colored black or was simply darkened.  The object appeared to be sitting on the ground inside the deer pen, and was located perhaps 100 ft away from us in a clearing of the woods. We sat there in the car peering at this object in disbelief for a long minute or so, wondering what in the world it was.  We both quickly came to the realization that we might be looking at a landed UFO or some sort, and became freaked out.  We then fleed the area as quickly as we could by backing out down the access road in our car.  After we left the scene, we did not see anything else that night out of the ordinary. The following morning, we went back to the site to check and make sure there wasn&apos;t some strange building on-site in the pens that would explain it all and make sense to us in the morning daylight.  When we arrived at the site, there was no buildings or structures of any kind in the deer pen, only deer and trees.  The was a clearing in the trees in the area where we saw the ULO (Unidentified Landed Object) large enough to contain the ULO, but no sign that anything had been there the night prior.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "This very delayed report is the result of just finding your site as received a link from a friend.Let me preface this with an observation.There was a major documentary in the 80&apos;s on one of the tree big network hosted by one of the Primetime anchorman. One of the subjects was the Air Force Report called Project Bluebook. I recall an Air Force spokesman saying in an interview that the entire U.S. is covered in Radar put in place for ABM and bomber defense, and if there really were UFOs they would have shown up on radar.By some coincidence the Air Force code name for the Top Secret  project to develop Stealth Bombers and fighters was named &quot;Have Blue&quot;.Due to the length of time I am not sure of the exact date, the only thing I recall for sure is that it was the week prior to the weekend Air Show at the Niagara Falls Air Force Base where either the Thunderbirds or the Blue Angels were appearing.  As it turns out the Real show was to begin much earlier.I was traveling on Ridge Road which is on the escarpment in Lewiston, New York.  This ridge was formed by glaciers and is where Niagara Falls started.  The Ridge Road is very near the U.S. and Canadian Power Plants which has seen a host of sightings and also Lake Ontario where at least one Air Force jet was lost chasing UFOs (or trying to.While driving down the road I saw numerous people out in their yards looking up into the Sky.  I stopped at one house and asked directions.  After getting the directions I asked why they were outside.  The father answered that they were just enjoying the nice weather, apparently not wanting to appear to be nuts.I proceeded down to my friends, friend&rsquo;s house to find them out in the yard as well.I asked what was going on and they said that you have to see this.  They pointed to some light in the sky that appeared to me to be just stars.  I said So? They told me to keep my eye on them.  All of a sudden one of the lights started from a dead stop to well beyond the speed of sound, but with no noise, and then proceeded to make 90 degree turns.  Sometimes there would be two or three moving in formation or by themselves. Most of the time these lights just looked like bright stars but occasionally they would pulse and while they were predominately white they would they would sometimes have a blue or green tint.  Another strange effect is that while watching one it would suddenly withdraw slowly up until it was out of sight.Since I belonged to the Civil Air Patrol I had the phone number for the Tower at the Niagara Falls  Air Base.  We called the tower and asked if anyone had reported an strange lights?  He said &quot;Where are they now&quot;?  He said that he could report them but they are pretty common and they are harmless.  But he agreed that tonight&rsquo;s &quot;show&quot; was more impressive and much bolder than most.  He said that he doubted that they would scramble any planes as they had lost some before, not from being attacked so much as blacking out or pushing the planes or themselves past what they were capable of in the trhill of the pursuit.About 20 minutes later though  some jets appeared and chased the light around making a lot of noise.  It was pretty amusing as the light seem to be playing with them able to travel 10-20 times as fast, hover and turning at impossible oblique angles.  It was a very weird feeling that something was out there just a few miles away and it sure wasn&apos;t meteors, weather balloons, reflections, or Northern lights all of which we had seen plenty of times before.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

I&apos;ve always wanted to see a u.f.o&quot; and I said, &quot;yea!  me, too!&quot; and all of a sudden, not even a half minute later, he started yelling, &quot;DO YOU SEE THAT? DO YOU SEE THAT?!&quot; so I turned my head to the E. where he was pointing and way up high in the sky I could see what appeared to be a HUGE, rectangular shape that was so wide it encompassed the width of 4 stars which were directly above the shape- I could see it changing from translucence in to a more opaque coloration and as I watched I could see what appeared to be 4 windows or panels take shape on it&apos;s side...it was IMMENSE and practically invisible, it moved like one would think of a balloon moving in a summer breeze late at night...it made absolutely no noise whatsoever and made me think it could have been made of the finest silken threads or polymer fabrics...We saw it for a total of about 5 seconds at most, as it was extremely FAST and out of our view in no time at all; it appeared to follow the course of the river, heading North...My friend said that when he first saw it he saw a triangle shape emerging from the area of sky we had agreed we&apos;d see the next falling star at, but what he saw was a triangle shape so totally translucent he could see stars through it, then he saw it make a turn N.E. and that&apos;s when I saw it...He thinks we saw a stealth bomber that was emerging from &quot;cloak&quot;...he thinks there IS such a thing as a total &quot;cloak&quot; now that goes beyond being hidden from radar, but we also feel t! hat in o rder for the thing to be SO HUGE and SO SILENT and SO FAST!!! it must have been a u.f.o....it was an absolutely amzing phenomenon we will never forget!  I realise now that for us to have thought there would be something special happening from that part of the sky there had to have been a subtle discoloration both our eyes were able to see, but which was so subtle we weren&apos;t aware of it- I think now it was like that part of the sky was lighter, as if a flash from a camera had lightened it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

We live in a very rural place with much farmland (right at 15 minutes outside of Farmington Missouri (south west)).  Our lot is 5 acres and we have dogs, cats, horses and cows on the surrounding farmland.  It was right at 6:30 am and it was still pretty dark here.  I saw what I thought to be a very bright star in the North East sky.  And it was not twinkling, however it seemed to get larger and larger.  It was very quiet here and we could not hear anything at all.  When I noticed for certain it was getting larger I just figured it was an airliner going southwest towards us.  My daughter and I just watched it for about 2 more minutes and when it started to get closer and closer, I could see how low it was and got scared. My daughter and I then went under the nearest tree and I tried to hide her under me a bit.  The aircraft was in full view the entire time and it came right over us.  The light on the front was a very large bright white light, just one light in front that we could tell.  The light was too bright to be able to see the topside of the craft.  When it went right over us at about 100 feet, the horses and cows and dogs went crazy and started making loud sounds. The lights on the side were blue and there were 5-8 of these small blue lights on the left and right side (underneath).  The object was triangle in shape and never made a sound.  It did not seem to interfere with the trees at all, though it was right above the tree line (approximately 75-100 feet high).  There was no wind or anything else emitted from the object.  When it passed over it was going rather slow. It seemed to slow down a bit going over the farmland right across from the road.  I could not say how fast; however my daughter and I were able to tell what the underneath looked like.  The color of the craft was mainly gray-scale and was not what you see in movies at all - meaning it was not all flat and perfect.  It had what looked like ridges and mechanical wiring, etc... It was not a shiny object.  After it passed I quickly moved to the right of the tree so I could see the backend of the object and it had red lights on the back end, though I could not say how many lights were on the craft - definitely more than 5 and they were small.  Then the craft just took off very fast on the same heading.  Soon after the animals got quiet and nothing else followed.  Of course I came inside as soon as possible and did not wait to see if there were any to follow, either. I will be honest and say that I did not believe before I saw this in the sky.  I did ask my daughter what she thought that was in the sky, and she said she did not know but thought it was strange because it did not make a sound and the animals did not like it.  I had her explain it to my husband and as she was explaining it, not one detail was different from what I experienced.  I looked up some military aircrafts online to see if perhaps it was on of them.  The closest I could find was the stealth bomber, however this was still quite a bit different from what we saw.  Differences between the stealth and the object we saw were the underside was different, the lights were not the same and no sound came from the object we saw.  They were very similar in shape, however the craft we saw was a perfect triangle from underneath.I would like you to catalog this, if you need to for your data and record collection; a return call is not necessary but if you need more information feel free to contact me.

The lights resembled spot lights on an object. The object moved in a very slow westerly direction.  An airplane would have been out of sight in minutes whereas this object was in sight for at least 1.5 hours.

About the controller&rsquo;s scope, he had informed me his scope had a reach of 60+ nautical miles. The object was an unusual shape almost the shape of an animated drawing of a boxy automobile.  I used my binoculars to try and get a better look, I don&rsquo;t have a telescope.The object slowly went away and finally out of sight. I have no conclusion; I can&rsquo;t imagine this was some kind of GA aircraft, military aircraft or helicopter of some sort.

The craft I witnessed was clearly visible in the glow cast by the street lights. I could make out every detail on the under body. Along with the strange size, color and placement of the lights, I could also make out what appeared to be two arched shaped tubes running along the bottom back side of the craft. In the glow of the street lights the craft looked to be of a dark non-metallic color. Its shape I would say, is not beyond the imagination of a human mind. However, this craft exhibited maneuverability characteristics far beyond that of any known current technology. The G-force&apos;s involved in the maneuver I witnessed would have been too great for a human. The craft seemed oblivious to any form of inertia. It approached at a constant rate I can only guess to be around 50 to 60 mph. It did not slow down. It simply just stopped, spun around and accelerated back to about the same speed it approached, all in an instant. It didn&apos;t even drift. There was never a sound or any sign of smoke or exhaust. Now here&apos;s the weird part. Not long after I filed my initial report, the street lights on the big bend part of the sawgrass highway (by Coral Springs) where removed!!! This I find very strange.

Just early this morning around 5 am I was out smoking and there was an unusually bright light above Gold Hill mountain, there seemed to be like rays of light coming from it and no sound and it would appear to get closer and then go farther up, I watched it for about 15 min and then went inside. I tried to take a picture, but it just showed up as a small line on the camera. I read over the reports on here from the Arlington area and a lot of them say that it looks like the lights they see head towards Darrington. I have seen these same lights for years. They are bright lights that at first look like stars, but then they will start to move side to side, or up and down and then after a while they will just go up really fast and dissapear. I am not the only one who has seen this happen either. One time this last Spring, my daughter and brother, and I were out in the yard at night and I saw this bright red light move slowly across the sky, it was big and bright and I have never seen anything like it before, I expected there to be a noise or a fire because it looked like the light went down in the mountains, then about 3 min later there were jets flying in the same direction. The part that caught my attention about the reports in Arlington, WA is that more than one person has reported seeing jets following these lights, and in the last few years I have noticed the same. If you go out at night and watch, almost every clear night you can see these strange moving lights here, and a lot of times within minutes after seeing them there are jets flying in the same location, which I find very strange.

Soon the formation (or possibly one single craft) broke apart.  The objects on either side took off at extraordinary speed to the north and south respectively until they were completely invisible.  Soon the leading object did the same, flying straight ahead to the west.  These objects were moving extremely fast, and apparently at an extremely high altitude.

Object was looked for throughout the early morning hours and the next evening, but was not seen again.  I think it&apos;s safe to say this wasn&apos;t a weather balloon or meteor; military!  I also might note that there is a local airport with very little traffic nearby, however, this airport also houses military aircraft for soldier transports, usually to and from Iraq.  Furthermore, these aircraft are incapable of going straight upward and also do not have the ability to hover for hours at a time, for all you skeptics. Make your own opinion.((NUFORC Note:  Venus.

A friend and I were camping in my back yard one night in the summer of 1989 (I think). When everyone at my house had gone to sleep we snuck out of the yard to wander the neighborhood. After a while we stopped near this building, I think it was a public restroom.  We were on the eastern side of this building with our backs to the wall and in front of us was Mount Hebo.  This is a small mountain that sits to the east of the small town. As we were looking up a ball of orange light passed directly over us and slowly moved in a straight line until it went over the mountain.  It made no sound at all and had to be big and high in the sky to go over the mountain like it did.

They appeared larger than a star or satellite, but (reflective ?)brightness of about half of the surrounding average stars. They appeared to be very high elevation, and faster than any  manned aircraft I have ever observed. Speed estimate would be slower than a meteor, and much faster than a satellite when viewed from Earth and moving about 5 degrees apart at exact speed and direction, one following the other. They crossed the sky  about 25 degrees above the North horizon to about 25-30 degrees from reaching the Southern Horizon and duration of abount 15-20 seconds.Curiously enough, I was again outside at  aproximately 8:40 pm on Monday 9/17. I did not see the same objects, instead only a single. Appearing larger, (about 3/4 thumbnail at arm length) and a triangular in exact symmetry. Coloration was dim, but reddish hue possibly from reflection ,against the early twilight blue. This object appeared to follow the exact previous North to South path , but may have been considerably larger or lower in Altitude. The triangular object speed was nearly 2-3 times faster than the previous, with the duration of about 7-10 seconds to cross the sky.Neither obsevations included atmoshereic disturbances, contrails, or sound activity. Elevation, I believe was low orbit, maybe several miles above commercial aircraft.I tried but did not observe anything other than normal aircraft/satellite activity on 9/18 from 8:35 pm until 9:00 pm.

I was looking eastward, paying special attention to the flickering stars.  A speck of light in the mid-level eastern sky caught my eye because of the nature of its flickering.  It appeared to be multi-colored, green, white, red, brighter flickers at times. There appeared to be an almost rotational aspect to the flickering. I began to watch it closely, primarily because of the fact that when I first laid eyes on it, I thought I detected movement.  As I moved my position to be free of neighboring lights, I attempted to ascertain whether or not the object was moving.  Using two objects in the sky which I was sure were stars, the object in question was in such a position with respect to the two stars that it formed an isoceles triangle.  But then the object became aligned with the top-most of the two stars; minutes later it was aligned with the bottom star.  I was convinced the object was moving, but so slowly as to be indiscernible. As I changed my position, I looked down at my feet for a moment, and when I returned my gaze to the object, it was no longer there.  I looked southward of where I had been looking and I thought I detected it somewhat lower in the sky but the same flashing pattern was evident, so I thought I had re-detected it. I studied its location in the sky for a few minutes but could not detect any motion, and after awhile I went inside, it being quite chilly out and it was getting late.

On the night of Oct 9th, roughly at midnight, I looked out my window to see a surprisingly clear night. There was one &quot;star&quot; that appeared brighter and somewhat vibrating. I grabbed my binoculars and found the object. The reason it seemed as though it was vibrating was because a red and blue light were tightly moving around another object with a bright white light on it. This is when I went outside. I went into my backyard and easily found the object again. I watched it for about 25 minutes. It just hung there in the same spot while the lights moved around. I was too far away to make any sound out, as it appeared to be hovering over Northern Waukegan. Trying to photograph it with my camera phone would have been pointless, so I didn&apos;t bother. Occasionally the lights seemed to blend together and the red and blue lights would disappear. Then it would start up again. I got distracted at about 12:30 by a friend.

I could not see a shape, just a ripple in the sky.I was laying in bed on the 9th floor at 43rd and 10th facing north looking out the window at birds and planes.  I saw something moving very fast in the sky behind two buildings.  I watched the other side of the building to see the object emerge because I wasn&apos;t sure I&apos;d seen anything.  I observed a dark dot moving in a straight line going north, north west at incredible speed, like a shooting star but without the trail or the light.  I saw other planes in the sky for reference and they looked like they were standing still compared to this object.  I was so startled that I jumped up and ran to the window and stared hard at the object moving throught the sky thinking it must be a fighter jet.  I am an airplane buff and can ID most things that fly but I had trouble even seeing anything and yet, there was something there.  My impression at the time was that I was seeing through the object and it was distorting the background of clouds behind it.  I could not see any distinguishing features.  I thought it might be a floaty in my eye, but it kept flying in a ruler straight line at preposterous speed.  I could not hear any roar of engines or a sonic boom, though I could hear helicopters that I could see so I know I was hearing the sounds from outside.  The object just flew out of sight at an altitude of about 3000 feet.  I base this on the angle at which I saw it and that it passed in front of the contrails of higher jets and the clouds.  I called my  girlfriend about an hour later and told her about the experience.

My mother was driving. I was gazing north, looking at the constellations but not paying special attention. Then I noticed something odd about one of the &ldquo;airplanes.&rdquo;  At first glance, it looked like any small aircraft at night: a pair of red &amp; white lights flying low, headed west, roughly parallel with the road. What struck me as odd was its slow speed. In fact, we seemed to be outpacing it. (I believe the speed limit on that road was somewhere around 40-45mph). It would have been out of view soon, if not for the fact that my mother made a wrong turn, north onto Weber Road. We were headed straight across its path as it continued west. I didn&rsquo;t say anything, but after a few seconds my mother noticed it too. I remember her asking, &ldquo;what is that?&rdquo; over and over, in an increasingly anxious tone. It was only about 20 feet above the ground, and moving so slowly that it just looked completely wrong, as if it shouldn&rsquo;t be in the air. We rolled down the windows and killed the radio. I&rsquo;m not sure why we thought to do this, but we were duly shocked to find that it made no sound. By now we could see the shape of the object, and in a few more seconds it passed directly in front of / above us. We had a clear view through the front windshield of the car. From the side, it had looked like a very thin wafer with lights front and back. From the bottom it was an equilateral triangle and each of the three sides curved inward. Each of the triangle&rsquo;s three apexes terminated in a small rectangular &ldquo;nub&rdquo; with a light. (It was actually a very elegant-looking shape). The lights were red and white, but I don&rsquo;t recall if they flashed or alternated in any way. The object itself was pure, unreflective black. My mother and I later disagreed somewhat on the size of the object. She felt that it was about the size of our car (a large sedan), but my impression was that it was slightly smaller &ndash; maybe about the size of a dining room table. I won&rsquo;t vouch for my memory of what happened next. (Not at a distance of 20 years, to be sure.) But what I remember is this: After it crossed Weber Road in front of us, it stopped in midair, hovered a second, then rapidly dropped several feet. Then it took off at a shallow upward angle, traveling east at a surprisingly fast rate. It was out of sight in a few more seconds. A few final comments. If you look at a map of the area, you&rsquo;ll see that the intersection of W. Boughton and N. Weber streets is just northeast of a small airstrip (Clow Airport). I&rsquo;ve thought about the possibility that we saw a light plane &ndash; especially considering the red/white lights. I just can&rsquo;t completely accept that conclusion based on the evidence of my senses that night.  I should also mention that the terrain in the area was mainly uncultivated fields. I didn&apos;t know it at the time, but a stream runs parallel to Boughton Road right along where I estimate the object&apos;s flight path was.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It would be bright, and then it would not.  So mulling it over I thought, this is really a UFO so I grabbed my camera and zoomed in.  My camera is a Sony Cybershot so picture quality is not as good of professional photographer quality.  When I zoomed into what I thought was a start, I realized I was gazing at a circular ball of light with the colors of fire (red, blue, yellow).  I took note that this light had a pattern which was, after a few minutes, easy to follow.  At the end of the red, blue, and yellow the light expanded.  When I took the picture I would get a disk in the photo, it looks like a disk of energy.  The light would move far away, then it would come back.  I think it had to be several miles away in the sky.  When I started to look around there were 5 others but not as bright, my camera could not even zoom in that far.

At first I assumed it was a bird, but when I began visually observing it, it was obvious that it was wasn&apos;t, as it had a smooth, man-made appearance. Also, it was obvious that it was fairly far off and at a much higher altitude than one would expect to see a bird. This is especially true since in the region in which I live, during this time of the year there is little bird activity, especially at night. The object appeared to be flying at an altitude of around 1500 feet and at an slightly oblique angle to me. It appeared not much smaller than a C130 at that altitude, but I could not make out a fuselage, etc., that one would expect to see on an aircraft. The object moved rapidly, much faster than a helicopter - perhaps several hundred miles an hour. It appeared to bank to the left (north-west) as it passed in front of me. It was an extremely smooth banking turn and the full wing shape became quite visible at that time. As it reached full bank (object perpendicular to the ground), I lost sight as it passed behind a building. Due to the my angle of observation, that&apos;s the last I saw of it. The object was gray in color. It blended well with the cloudless night sky (especially as effected by urban light pollution). There were no visible markings. Intriguingly, the object made no sound. At that distance, if it were an aircraft like a C130, one would have definitely heard the engine drone clearly. Also, there was no jet sound as one would expect to hear from a jet flying so close. I thought that, as in the case of an A-10, I might hear the sound after the craft had passed overhead. I heard no sounds. The flight characteristics exhibited seemed to indicate it was an aircraft. But as previously stated, it lacked a fuselage, any markings and was completely blacked-out. There were no lights of any kind visible. Furthermore, the object left no contrail. I  am, as one might expect, fascinated by what I saw. But I certainly cannot explain it. Though it exhibited some aircraft flight characteristics, I could not identify it as any aircraft I&apos;ve ever seen (in person or through research).", "A HUGE SHAPE LEVIATATING AROUND 40,000 FEET IN THE AIR FOR 20 MINUTES AND THEN RISING UP AND DISAPEARINGAT 5PM ON SUNDAY MYSELF AND GIRLFREIND WITNESSED A SHAPE THAT DID NOT MOVE, HIGH UP IN THE SKY ( AT AN ESTIMATE OF 40,000 ).WE LIVE IN GOUROCK SCOTLAND.

We were all instantly enthralled with the object beacuse it had virtually no form, it was glowing, it was silent, it would stop in mid flight (float would be more like it), and then it would change direction and go in reverse.

That was until today.At exactly 12:05 noon time I was standing outside in the garden, looking roughly eastwards, when I observed a loose formation of 5 or 6 shining identical spheres heading from the South East towards the North West (I was so fixed on the phenomenon that I simply forgot to count the number of spheres, but I am sure there were at least five of them).The sky was perfectly clear, blue with no clouds, and with an almost unlimited visibility, with the sun shining in the South (noontime) and a light surface wind coming from the North East. Some contrails of aircraft, as well as the aircraft themselves were clearly visible at high cruising altitude.The spheres were reflecting the sunlight at their backsides (sun side) as if they were from polished aluminium.The formation was visible during approximately 25 seconds. During that time of observation they travelled trough an arc of view of approximately 110 degrees (because of their relatively high speed, I did not have the opportunity to pick up my camera inside the house). The formation itself stayed together within a field of view of approximately 25 degrees, but their movements were very erratic, overtaking each other with brisk accelerations, and then slowing down again, and with brisk changing of directions over about 10 to 15 degrees deviation from the groups heading, before regaining the general track. During the observation the group travelled at an elevation of approximately 50 degrees above the horizon. They left no contrails behind them. There was no audible sound until the silence was disturbed by an airliner that had just departed from Brussels International Airport (about 8 km away), departing from runway 25R, turning to the North West as a standard instrument departure towards the Nikki, Costa or Koksy VOR. At that moment the group of spheres was about to disappear behind the roofs of the houses North of my location. The airliner turned towards the general direction of the spheres but never passed in front of them from my point of view, so it was impossible to have any form of reference towards their distance and dimensions. In my opinion the spheres must have been visible from the cockpit of that airliner (especially from the co-pilot&amp;#8217;s position) although they seemed a lot higher and faster. As I said, I had no reference, no cloud base, and they didn&apos;t pass under or over any contrail present, but if you allow me a rough estimate, I would say that if the diameter of the spheres were around 20 feet, I would estimate their altitude at around 15000 feet, but that is only a guess. These objects were certainly no balloons (too fast and against the wind direction), no birds at altitude (light reflection, far too fast, and not the same flight behaviour) and seemed clearly under intelligent control. What I found the most stunning was the brisk acceleration and deceleration when they were changing their relative positions. As they flew over a densely populated area it seems almost impossible that no other person should have made the same observation. By the way, just after the spheres disappeared behind the roofs of the neighbouring houses, I phoned my wife who was at work at that time, a couple of km North of my location (at that moment they should also still have been visible from there) but I could not make immediate contact, so I have nobody to confirm my observation. As these spheres were crossing straight trough the Brussels TMA and Control Area, I wonder if the air traffic controllers would have given a departure clearance to any airliner if they should have been visible on their radar screens!", "ufo seen taking of from in palestine texasNovember 18 2007 about 9pm night Palestine Texas just turned off hwy 79n onto loop 256 heading east. passed over the railroad bridge passing mccoys builder supply watched an object about 4meters by 13 meters pod/teardrop shaped leave the wooded area off of harcrow road. was orange and red on top fading into a purple with a blue glow about it leaving a faint blue chemtrail behind it.

I was TDY to Ramstein AB in Germany. The other maintainer that accompanied me on the trip had never been to Germany before and wanted to do a little sightseeing.  I have been to Germany several times and had never done any real sightseeing myself, so we decided to go for it.  Well, Germany has many castles and after doing some research, we discovered that there was a castle close by in the town of Landstuhl.  So we got a cab and took the 15 minute ride to Landstuhl Castle.  Well, unfortunately, we got there a little late and the casle had already closed for the day.  Since the castle was at a higher elevation, it provided some nice views for picture taking.  So I started snapping away.  We were offered a great view of the town of Landstuhl below.  As I was taking pictures, a 747 aircraft was on final approach into Ramstein AB.  Of course, I didn&apos;t want the plane in some of the pictures, I waited for it to get out of the frame.  Digital cameras offer the option of taking pictures using the LCD screens rather than the view finders.  So I always use the LCD screen.  So once the airplace was out of sight, I snapped my picture.  Once a picture is taken, I have my camera set up to show the picture on the LCD screen for 5 second.  Then it goes back to live picture mode.  When I was taking the picture, I didn&apos;t notice anything on the screen.  When I looked at the screen after I took the picture, I noticed a dark shadow, which had the appearance of a flying saucer.  I then looked up into the sky to see if I could see what had showed up in the picture.  Whatever it was, wasn&apos;t there anymore.  So I looked back at my camera, which had already gone into live picture mode again.  I then switched the camera into picture viewing mode to further exam the photo.  At that time, I showed to picture to my companion.  We were both in awe at the sight.  When I zoomed in on the shadow, it truly made me believe that I had gotten a rare photo of a UFO.  I checked the lens on my camera and there was nothing on it.  I did not wipe it down for fear of scratching it.  It did not show up in any other pictures that I took.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  We have requested a copy of the photo, but have not received it.

Both were similar in appearance and seemed to be joined to each other by a very small darkened area located directly between them. At first glance, my attention was drawn to what looked like one long, thin, silver rod like appendage extending downward from beneath these two adjoining lights. I could also see a faint haze with a clearly defined outer edge located beneath each of the two luminous objects. Perhaps this was due to heat or propulsion, I don&apos;t know. Yet, each of these two very faint, hazy areas were clearly shaped like the letter &quot;U.&quot;  And the silver appendage was centered between these two hazy &quot;U&quot; shaped areas, in a very symmetrical pattern. The total width of the two adjoined lights was at least as wide as a cruising jetliner. The vertical appendage beneath them was twice as long as this total width. The appendage gradually faded from view as the two disc shaped lights began to merge together to form one luminous cigar shaped object, though the small darkened area at the center remained.

SD UFO SIGHTINGS 10-22-07  On 10-22-07 I was traveling south from Sioux Falls on interstate 29 when around 8:30 pm on a clear night the stars were starting to show up I noticed a bright organgish round light to the west over the horizon thinking it was a plane heading for Sioux Falls, because I could see the two planets. When I looked over again it was gone just some faint stars in the sky were the light was. Then I looked over again to make sure it was not a star, when a moment later I saw in the dark sky a light go from nothing to bright then another light came on in a line with the first only a little ways away, only to have the first light dim out as a third light came online a little ways away from the second light, as it got brighter the second light went out. As with the fourth light however they were not moving. Kind of looked like big sparks between them. Then no lights for a few minutes.Next I turned west onto old Hwy 44, now 280th St. after traveling west for a couple of minutes I was pondering at what I just saw thinking this is no plane, planet, or star. It happened again only this time it was more west southwest this time. When it happened again I called my wife who was bringing the kids home from their football game in Sioux Falls, I asked where she was and if she saw the strange lights to the west she said no, so I told her and the kids to look half way (2:00 o&rsquo;clock position) up the windshield and look west, I said they come and go and to just watch the sky and hung up.About four miles from Hwy 19 I saw them doing the same thing again but now one was farther north by itself. Moments later the phone rang and it was my wife and kids and they said they saw the lights to the west. I drove west for 26 miles and turned south on 449th Ave. for two miles and pulled over the time was 8:53 pm again the lights came on but not in a row one light up a little to the south and as that one faded out, one light up north a few miles from it. They would take turns going on and off at 9:00 pm a plane came from the southwest at a high altitude moving northeast. At 9:14 pm was the last time I saw the lights. At 9:23 pm I saw four navigation lights in an echelon formation spread a few miles apart come from the west at a high rate of speed when they arrived at the vicinity of the lights they stayed in formation and turned northeast to Sioux falls were our F-16 fighter base is located. After they turned northeast I saw two-twin engine jet fighters come from the southwest (Omaha?) they flew the area for a few minutes and left, also some came from the south (Sioux City?) All these planes were on the same altitude and intercept as the strange lights.My wife had stopped in Hurley and talked to a man who was standing on 283rd St. watching the lights, he had also been watching them from the interstate.

When I had seen it before, about a year ago but in the same town, it was very high up in the night sky. The trail was too far away to see as flames. I realize that it actually traveled the exact same direction. There is absolutely no way that this was some meteorite falling out of the sky. It&apos;s path and trail was so defined and visually unique. Holding my thumb and pointer finger to my eye, it was an inch thick, and the trail was a good 4-5 inches long. It looked like flames reaching outward for oxygen. It didn&apos;t trickle off into other colors. It&apos;s integrity remained the same the entire time it was in my line of site. It almost seemed to take off from the vast wooded area. Not a vertical lift at all, but coming from a slight angle and never curving away.

The object was 7 to 10 feet above the palm; it was flying in a flight path that aircraft use all day.  I thought it was a helicopter because it was flying low and seemed large, but it was not. I stopped in my tracks and it flew right over me and have never seen anything like this before. It was a black triangle with 3 white lights one in each tip and a smaller red light in the center, this thing made no noise but I felt like I could feel, more of a since of something rather hearing it. It was very low and as I watched it fly over and passed me I didn&rsquo;t see any sign of a engine.

It was around 4:45 am and I was going home to get into my work clothes and go to work.  I noticed it because it was so unbelievably bright I&rsquo;m talking if you were on the road that night or morning you seen this darn light if looking into the sky.  I also started to notice that it sort of changed colors a bit maybe wrote it off as a satellite or planet until I noticed that it didn&rsquo;t move at all just kind of hovering in one spot.  Other people observed this event as well, my friend/coworker called me today (Tuesday) and was telling me he had caught this strange light in the sky Sunday night on video.  He is going to school for film and graphics design I think, so he really knows what he&rsquo;s doing when it comes to filming.  As I was sitting in my car waiting for my boss to arrive to work (I work at a local retail store) I kept watching the light.  It appeared to me that it was sparkling or possibly blinking the main color was white but it was entirely too bright and large to be a star.  I also heard another opinion from the same coworker that documented the experience, that it looked as if it held some form of being he described it as an &ldquo;angel&rdquo;.  I wouldn&rsquo;t go as far as to report this if I thought it was a star/planet/gas/or aircraft so I&rsquo;m asking for a possible explanation as I think this was possibly something from out of this world. Another worthy mention would be that my manager also seen the light and had noticed it on her way to work as well and we sat there outside of work to stare at it for a moment it was quite odd. It didn&rsquo;t move at all almost as if it was just hovering or watching over us.  The best way I can describe it is a large obviously strange bright object sitting out of place in the sky and it sometimes changed colors even said to look as if it was housing or transporting a being or extraterrestrial being if you will. I got the feeling I was being watched quite an interesting unexpl! ainable experience. That&rsquo;s all I can really say, thanks for anyone who takes interest in this true, even documented event.

Individually each has flickering lights and they hover throughout the night in the same position but move rapidly left-right-up-down and sometimes in circular or semi-circular moves as they continue to hover in the same altitude.Usually couple of hours later 5-7 similar objects/light patterns appear more toward the West, the closest being straight above and the rest of them in some sort of formation stretching few miles apart. These are in much higher altitudes (our guess)50-70,000 ft or higher. These are very well visible once you have trained your eyes to pick each of them out.What is most obvious is that in the early morning at daybreak, the stars start to fade but these are still visible until the sun is almost up. Two days ago we observed a small light travel from Northern direction for about 2 minutes and judging from the altitude must have flown about 10 miles before being absorbed or joining the one parked above our house. The reason it is easy to pick them out is that the lights of all of them align in the same pattern no matter how far they are apart. There is a military base in Key West and we see the military planes fly but lot lower altitude also there are commercial flights.

Our house faces the southeast, and we live in the country (14 miles from town and 50 miles from a big city).  The weather was fair and the sky was party cloudy.  Just before this happened, there were no commercial aircraft directly in view. My 12-year-old daughter saw something unusual in the sky, to the southeast, and asked me what it was.  I watched for about 30 seconds, sure I could come up with a reasonable explanation (yet pretty curious because I didn&apos;t know what it was).  I saw 5 bright red lights (diamond-shaped), which were spaced at equal distances apart and flashed in sequence from right to left (like a strobe light).  After each sequence was complete, the object would move and appear in a different part of the sky.  I use the term &quot;object&quot; very loosely, as we could not see the object&apos;s profile nor did it make any noise.  Although its movement seemed jerky and unpredictable, the flashing lights were always in a straight line, as if the lights were attached to something straight, but the object was moving in a zigzag pattern. Not sure what I was seeing, I called for my son (very much a skeptic and someone who always has an explanation for everything) to join us outside.  When he looked toward the sky, he responded with &quot;What the flying hell is THAT?!&quot;  He had no idea what he was seeing, and no explanation.  We watch the sky for about 5 minutes, as the object blinked and moved erratically across the sky toward the northwest.  The lights never changed colors or patterns, except in the way the object(s) moved.  Whether in, or out of, cloud cover, we could clearly see the lights -- but never a shape.  The span across, from light to light, was MUCH WIDER than anything I&apos;ve seen before.  I have watched commercial aircraft, helicopters, and various types of military aircraft fly over our farmland for the past 5 years, and I&apos;ve never seen anything that could explain this.  Even fighter jets, when they play war games over our farm, are easy to see, move somewhat predictably, and make a lot of noise.  These lights were silent.  No noise whatsoever. The lights never changed color or shape.  There were no other lights, as you would expect to see on a commercial airplane. As the object(s) moved further northwest, and nearing the end of my visibility, I saw see three red lights in a V pattern, but I didn&apos;t get to watch long enough to determine whether the original object was changing shape or if other(s) joined it.  If the lights I saw changed shape from a straight line into a V, I would have to wonder what happened to the remaining lights.  Within seconds of losing sight of this &quot;object&quot; or the lights, the sky was, once again, filled with commercial aircraft (and the noise you would expect them to make).", "While having a ciggy, I saw a UFO move quietly over my home.....was about 5m above the tree-tops......Hi there,  On 12 November 2007 at approximately 21:00pm (East London, South African time), while outside having a ciggy, I saw what I could only explain as an U.F.O. I was facing in a northerly direction, looking out and down my back lawn, when something just said that I should look up, and that&rsquo;s when I saw it. What looked like an ovalish object (because I only saw in from underneath) with a single dimish light in the centre shining out at about 25-300. It was a pretty clear night so I could see the object against the night sky, bearing in mind that it was not very high above me, perhaps 5m above the tree-tops.  It looked dark in colour, I&rsquo;m not quite sure what colour, looked either black or dark grey/silver. It moved from a northerly direction to a south-westerly direction, therefore it did not do straight over the house, it kind of moved off to the left but overhead.  This object made absolutely no sound whatsoever, and this is why I can&rsquo;t explain it as anything other than a UFO. The speed it was moving at was quite fast as it was as quick as I could turn my head to watch it disappear.  I didn&rsquo;t even have a chance to take a picture or call my partner.

The road is called the &apos;gun barrel&apos; because there is a stretch of about 15 miles that is completely straight.  My friend, who has a private pilot&apos;s license, saw an orange light directly ahead of us and pointed it out to me.  We watched it &apos;fly&apos; north for about 5 minutes before we stopped the car to get out and have a clearer view.  After a few minutes we continued to drive west and watch the light.  It would occasionally change from orange to green, and then back to orange in a random sequence.  We stopped the car one or two more times to try to figure out what it was.Our approximate location when we first spotted the UFO was 37&deg;28&rsquo;09.17-N  105&deg;35&rsquo;52.42-W.After about 20 minutes the light was approaching mountains that are west of Alamosa, still travelling north.  With the mountains as a reference we could estimate size, height and speed.  We guessed that it was 200&rsquo; long (it had taken on a cigar shape as we got closer), about 1000&rsquo; above ground level (Alamosa is at 7500&rsquo; above sea level) and traveling at about 200 miles per hour.When it was very near the mountains we suddenly saw a blinding white light and then it was gone.After we checked into our hotel rooms we went into the hotel restaurant.  As we talked about our experience we wondered how many of these kinds of things are seen and never reported.  It was 6:00 PM or so when we decided to call the local newspaper.  The editor happened to answer the phone.  When we gave him an overview of our experience he asked if he could come to the restaurant and interview us.Before he arrived I went to the hotel desk for a Colorado map.  We marked the map with a line showing where we thought the UFO traveled as we watched it.We told him what we had seen and he took copious notes without asking many questions.  When we were through he said, &quot;Now let me tell you what other stories I have heard.&quot;  He then told us about reports from many local citizens including &lsquo;close encounters&rsquo;.  I recall one of the events he told us about was an elderly lady who reported a huge UFO that hovered just above her house for several minutes.  He made it a point to make sure we understood that the other reports were from very credible people.The story about our sighting was reported in the Alamosa newspaper the next day.  My crew was in the area examining two national banks for two days.  We regretted telling our story because we took a lot of grief and ribbing from bankers and other citizens.  As we were checking out of the hotel the owner/manager asked us if we were the bank examiners who had seen the UFO.  We were very defensive by this time, but admitted that we were the people mentioned in the newspaper article.She then told us this story.  Her 8 year old daughter had been visiting a friend&rsquo;s house the day of our sighting.  Her daughter called the police to report a military jet that she saw shot down.  She said that it was chasing a light and the light shot out a light that knocked the airplane down.  Then she came home and told her mother what she had done.  The mother told her that it was not right to make false reports to the police and that she was in big trouble.When the police showed up at their home to make sure everything was o.k.  The police and her mother told the girl that if an airplane had crashed, there would be search parties out looking for it.  Now, here is the part that makes me believe that this was a true report of what the girl saw.  She said, &quot;If they find it -- can I have it, because I saw it first?&quot;  I met the girl briefly and asked her to point in the sky where she saw the light and the airplane.  Her line was shorter than ours, but ended in the location where we saw the blinding white flash.I have decided to report this again just because I am old enough now that I don&rsquo;t care what people think.  I have searched for the article and have not been able to find it.  I was not even sure which year it was until I remembered that the well-known case of Snippy the horse (mutilation) occurred about 2 to 4 weeks after our event.  The Snippy event was September 7, 1967 so our event would have been sometime in August, 1967.If you have a way to access the Alamosa newspaper you will find our story there.  I would love to have a copy of the article if that is possible.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  However, he is correct about the date of the mutilation of the horse in Alamosa.  Reports of other mutilations south of Florence, CO, were circulating as early as June 1967, a fact which I know from personal experience there.

My apartment was situated very near the central part of the Chico, a well lit, bustling with nightlife, college town, suburban atmosphere city in Northern California.  Suddenly from behind my apartment or coming from the opposite direction from where I was looking out, a massive, triangular shaped object flew over my apartment, moving towards the central part of the city.  What scared me almost as much as it&apos;s unnatural appearance, was the fact that it didn&apos;t make even the slightest amount of noise.  There were no lights on it that I could see in the short amount of time it was visible to me, and I believe it was black in color, although I could be wrong as it was quite a dark night.  The funny part of this story, would be that I&apos;m pretty much a non-believer in everything, but my boyfriend, who was in the living room when this occurred, believes in UFOs, aliens, and all of that kinda supernatural stuff.

I noticed a craft flying in from over the ocean and at first thought nothing of it. After taking a second look, I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice the uniqueness of this craft. It displayed lights of a shade of red that I have never seen before on any craft. Also, the initial shape of this craft appeared to be rectangular, and it flew perpendicular to the ground. The more I watched this object, the more curious I became.I picked up a pair of binoculars to get a closer look. I thought perhaps I could discern a clearer shape. However, viewing it through the glasses did not prove any better than viewing it with the naked eye.

Working into the wee hours of the morning I was really tired and left my backyard office to go into the house and get some sleep. I happen to be walking into the house (roughly round 4:30 a.m.) but a light caught my attention as I stepped up on the back porch. I looked up at this light and it was very strange looking as I can&rsquo;t recall seeing anything like it before. The light was just hovering off in the distance toward the East. At first I thought it to be a star or planet or something of sorts but then I noticed even further that the entire skyline in that direction was totally blacked out. No stars, planets or moons or nothing. There appeared to be a high cloud cover which prevented all the other objects you would normally see at night to be obscured from vision. Just that one light up there. So I thought to myself it&rsquo;s kinda odd that one star would show thru and not any of the others. Then I happen to notice that the light I was looking at was getting brighter and then dimming again as in a pulse and it kept repeating, bright, dim, bright, dim. Then I knew something wasn&rsquo;t right about this hovering object and went inside and woke up my wife. I told her about what I had seen and asked her to get the camcorder for me so I could film it. She got the camcorder for me and we both went out on the back porch to see this light. The object did not appear to move other than a slight rocking motion. But the bright, dim thing kept going. I pulled out the camcorder and shot about 4 minutes and 20 seconds of footage when I was just too tired and shaking to continue. There was no sound from the object. The only sound I recorded on video was passing cars on the hwy. I deleted the audio on my footage upload later so the file would be smaller for upload. But I went to the edge of the porch to get the best view and started video recording. My wife had seen UFO&rsquo;s before and she wasn&rsquo;t too thrilled about them so she wen! t back i nto the house. This was my first encounter of a hovering, illuminating light. The skyline behind the object was completely dark. Nothing else was visible in the video as a reference so I couldn&rsquo;t determine size, or shape. It appeared that the clouds had all reference points blocked. I couldn&rsquo;t even see the trees that were located to the left and right of the object in my line of sight. It was very dark.

This was no plane.", "Strange blinking, saucer-like object spotted in San Rafael, CA; apprx. 7:30 PM Standard timeThursday November 1, 2007 I was driving in San Rafael, California with my Fianc&eacute; South on 101(toward San Francisco) and I spotted what we believe to be a UFO.  It looked exactly what you might see on TV or in the movies, a flying saucer. It was very big, I&rsquo;d say about the size of a full moon. It had colorful (blue and red to be sure) lights blinking from the bottom. Then we stopped the car on the side of the road, I was scared and shocked, I wanted someone else (besides us) to see it so, I ran out of the car and asked a man walking if he&rsquo;d seen it. He said no so I had him follow me to a place it where it was very clear to see and asked him &ldquo;Do you see that thing? It is a flying saucer&rdquo; and he replied &ldquo;Yes, I see it&rdquo; he didn&rsquo;t seem as shocked as I was. It appeared to be hovering back and fourth, but not really moving too much. Then I got scared and told my fianc&eacute; to drive but while we were driving I kept my eyes on it until it was hidden behind a mountain. Then about 40 seconds later when we passed the mountain and it was in sight again, I saw it was (had turned into) a blimp. The weird thing is that it looked nothing like what I&rsquo;d just seen. When I got a better look at the blimp it read &ldquo;FOR THE &lsquo;IF&rsquo; IN LIFE&rdquo;. I have never seen anything like that before but-I really do believe that the thing I saw was not normal.((NUFORC Note:  We believe we spoke with this witness, although we cannot be certain.

OR???????????I was back in my hometown for a funeral and was spending the night at my deceased father&apos;s house, which is out in the country near Oglebay Park.  I love the peace &amp; quiet and wanted to go into his field to look at the massive array for stars out that night.Approx 10PM, In the SSW sky I spotted to what I had assumed to be a star, but quickly deduced that it must be a plane because all of the starlight was a &apos;white-blue&apos; when this was an &apos;yellow-white&apos; and was MUCH lower than any star. As a guess I&apos;d say it&apos;s altitude was 5 miles and distance (from me) approx the same. I then realized that it couldn&apos;t be landing gear or lights on the front of a craft because it was moving away from me in a constant SSW direction.  Overhead, a plane passed, coming from the NW--towards the &apos;light&apos; to the SSW. As the plane got to what I would say about a 1-2 mile range, the light went out, then came back on as the airplane vectored to the SSE.  I ran to get binoculars and continued to watch.  This light did not twinkle as were all of the stars that night (it was crystal-clear), rather it was constant.  I will note that another airplane was headed towards it and the light disappeared again, only to come back on another 90 seconds or so later like the first time.  After about 15 minutes, the light then was completely gone as it continued heading SSW. Any ideas?  This was I believe about a week after one could look straight up and see the space station..is that what I saw? Perhaps a satellite? I thought the light going on &amp; off with appraoching aircraft was odd. It was in this exact sky that approx 20 years ago I witnessed, as many people have reported on here, two objects (in the night sky) &quot;playing tag with one another&quot;((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Jupiter??

Just went black.and at the same time, the lights in my apartment went out&hellip;I saw flashing lights  .alot of flashing goin on and I heard like a buzzing loud noise&hellip;didn&rsquo;t understand what was going on so I arose from the couch to take a look.

One of the other kids looked up and said hay whats that,and we all looked to where he was pointing.What i seen was a large dark colored v shaped craft,with 5 sets of lights on it&apos;s under side.The five sets of lights where in groups of three in a triangle pattern,with one group of three lights at the front of the craft and the other groups going down the two sides of the v shape.I am the kind of person that remembers every thing, so my estimate of the size of the craft would be 300 ft wing span and around 200 ft in length.We heard no sound at all and it appeared to be only a few hundred feet above the tree tops directly over the crescent street extension, we were very close to it, i could see the bottom of the craft and it looked a lot like what our modern stealth bombers look like, with a flat black paint look, and different lines that seem to outline access panels. The craft just hovered there for about 2 minutes as we all watched in awe, then it slowly started moving south directly over my house then the millers river, all the time it seemed to keep the exact same altitude following the land as if it was locked into some kind of gps that kept it exactly the same height off the ground.We watched it go down over the river and then back up the other side, then it went up over stans auto body shop and then the jr high school then out of our range of site.the whole time we were walking around for the best position to see it from,so we all got an eye full.  At one point i was directly under it so i seen it well and will never forget it.It displayed flight characteristics i have never seen from any stealth craft. in the way that it just hovered there, and remained completely silent even though i was that close to it ,also when it did move it moved so slow that it could not have been held in the air by normal aerodynamics,it just didn&apos;t move fast enough to generate any lift. Once it was on the other side of the river we could see the side profile a bit better, and there was nothing significant there, just more dark flat black like the bottom,and i would say it was about 10 feet thick,that is,if it were on the ground it would be 10 feet tall. The back of the craft did seem to be an exhaust of some kind, and it looked glowing hot ,but i heard no sound,and the glow was blue not red like i would expect from a jets after burners.I have seen this story on the television show unsolved mystery&apos;s,and those witnesses described it as five planes flying in formation,i can see why they would think that because the lights on the bottom did make it look like 5 plans in formation.But i got real close so i can tell you it was one solid object for sure.but i do believe we seen the same thing, myself and those people in new york that were on unsolved mystery&apos;s((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Seen on 5 different occasions in 5 months.I have seen a particular &ldquo;craft&rdquo; five times in the last five months. I saw it again tonight at about 7:12 p.m. PDT. I would estimate its altitude at about 3,000 to 5,000 feet. The speed seemed to be about that of a commercial passenger jet. The lights on this craft are non-typical. There is a blinking blue-white light at the front. Then there a bar with several lights that are slightly orange (maybe about the color of tungsten lights), just past the center of the craft, that go laterally, and look like cubes placed side by side. They shine towards the front and back of the craft. There are no lights on this craft that are typical of normal aircraft navigational lights. It appears that the craft is black with a tan colored &ldquo;X&rdquo; painted on the bottom side. The ends of the X shape are at the front and back of the craft. This craft makes no sound that I can detect. All five times I have seen the craft it has been moving from North to South, and at different altitudes. My sighting of it have all been at night, shortly after the sun has set and it is complete dark outside. The first time I saw this craft was in late May or early June, and I have seen it four times, about once a month, since then. The first time I saw it, I happened to look up, and it had passed right over the top of where I was standing. It was moving fairly slowly, and made no sound that I could hear. I have not been able to see the actual outline shape of the craft against the night sky, but it appears to be either flat on the bottom, or possibly slightly concave. It is many times wider than a normal airplane or jet. In hindsight I should have recorded the times and dates of the previous sightings of this craft, or made reports on them.

What was really odd was imagine how much tome it takes for an Airplane to course across the sky this thing moved steadily and then disappeared behind the clouds. From ground level it appeared to be the size of a marble but when I saw the one in 1994 it was closer and seemed as big as a house.If there&rsquo;s anyone else who may have seen the same thing in this area please let me know that way I won&rsquo;t feel as though I&apos;ve lost my mind.Thanks for taking the time to read this your time has been appreciated", "bright light / flash streaking accross the sky inMy wife and I were travelling in our van east bound on Whinchester road, approaching Simcoe street in Oshawa.

My friend, Ed Knees and I were going northbound toward Huachuca City (where we both lived off base), at approximately 22:30 hours, when I noticed a golden light pacing us. I mentioned this to Ed, who said it was probably the moon reflecting on electrical or telephone wires. After I pointed out that the wires were on his side, he stopped the van. We both observed the light, which was stationary at this time, until Ed used the spotlight mounted to the top of his van (used for hunting at night). Right after Ed flashed the light at the &ldquo;ufo&rdquo;, it completely vanished. The really unusual thing was, it made absolutely NO sound whatsoever. This base also had rotary and fixed wing aircraft, and I am very familiar with the current US governmental inventory. This occurrence took approximately 10 minutes. Second sighting: July, 1985 - I was sitting in a hot tub with 2 other friends, at approximately 21:00 hours, when we all noticed a oval craft, going over our heads. This craft had green, blue and white lights going in a counter-clockwise circle, around the craft. We were just 2 miles from the Concord Naval Weapons Station (carried nukes) in a town called Antioch, California, and the craft made absolutely NO noise -&ndash;not even a whisper. Again, I am familiar with most fixed wing and rotor aircraft, and this did not fit that inventory! This incident took approximately 5 minutes. Third sighting: August, 1985, same location (Antioch, California).  At approximately 02:00 hours, I got up from watching the TV, to get a drink at the kitchen sink. I happened to look up to see a very large, dark gray triangular object apparently floating in the air, approximately 5000 feet altitude. It had red glowing lights on each point, and a softly glowing white light in the center. This craft also made no noise at all.

I&apos;m getting ready to go in for the night and I notice my shadow and I turn my head to see where the lights coming from.. Thought to myself, &quot;That&apos;s an awfully bright star I don&apos;t remember seeing one that bright before.&quot; So I watch it a little bit and then it begins to move south away from the lake.. By that time I knew it wasn&apos;t a star obviously so I flash my light at it. As soon as I did that it did a complete 180 and was coming my way, I said, &quot;Oh Sh*t&quot; what have I just done! It&apos;s approach was rather rapid and as it got close to me and I knew it wasn&apos;t going to stop  until it reached me I got spooked and took six steps back. By the six step the object stopped..  It stooped as if it knew I didn&apos;t want it any closer.  It was directly in front of me. During this time I noted two airlines flying way above  the object and to me that confirmed this was something rather unique. This craft had no sound to it the only things heard were the sounds of crickets and me saying, &quot;what in the F is this thing!&quot;  The object was a greenish yellow color like I have never seen before. coming form the bottom were at times two to four beams of light that only went to a certain distance and stopped.  At times these beams would rotate. One time they connected and the craft looked like a diamond. I moved out to the end of the dock to get a better look and as I did that the craft moved back keeping the same distance it had when I saw it from the beach area.I like that, a UFO that knows it&apos;s boundaries. Kind of cool huh? :)  After I got tired of looking at this from the dock. I moved to an area next door to me..  As I did that, with in  10 to 15 seconds the craft moved with me and was once again directly in front of me keeping that same distance. So I thought I&apos;d try something. When a cloud went under it I would move again..  After the cloud past over the UFO came over to me again. Keeping that same distance.   The distance was just over cloud level.  One time a cloud went under it and I moved and it shout out from the cloud. This thing was just wild. At one point the craft shot out this green beam of light that came down. half way between it self and the water. I took note that the beam of light did not reflect off the water. The light stayed for five seconds and then traveled back up to the craft. Interestingly enough after the beam travel back up to the craft it left a kind of  mist or residue I don&apos;t know what you would call it but it disappeared within seconds. This residue I speak of I just remebered it..  Also I will admit I did feel slightly sick to my stomach that day.  That&apos;s just something I took note of.. Could be nothing but maybe something.. Sick to my stomach as if I had a mild flue or you could I felt woozy or something.. This event lasted between 2.5 hours. It was daylight before it actually left.. It left after I had, had enough I guess.. I went and hid behind my neighbors house for a minute or two and when I came back it was gone.. It was like the craft was watching me as I was watching it. I have video and pictures of the craft. I&apos;m sending you three of the pictures.. I&apos;d like to know you think of the pictures. I want to try and enhance the others before I send anymore.. I also took video. This video seems like classic UFO footage..What I mean by that is while recording, the image in the LCD screen looks different then what I was actually seeing.. It&apos;s fuzzy or blurry I guess and it does have like a kind of black outlineing around the object.. These green beams I speak of aren&apos;t vissible in the video but they are in the pictures at times that I am glad for. I&apos;m glad those beams are vissible in the pictures.. I have NEVER seen anything like this and it went for 2.5 hours. It was simply amaing.  The lights it gave off I have never seen colors like that.. It was just incredible..

It was so low and moving so slow, that the physics of it just did not make any sense to me. Hwy 20 does not have much traffic (no cars passed the whole time) so I slowed down and rolled down my window in my car.  As it came directly overhead I still could not hear any sound, so I pulled over to the side of the road and shut my engine off. I first just gazed up still sitting in the car with my head out the window.  I then got out and just stood there next to my car.  I kept my eyes up the whole time.  What I remember seeing was a huge rectangle, it was about the size of a football field.  I do remember lights, but not like you would see on a airplane.  The main thing that I was focused on was the size, and how low it seemed to be.  It was a gray color. It was very close to the ground and why it made no sense to me was I could not hear a sound , and by the huge size and how close it was I should hear something I thought. It moved so slowly that it seemed as though it should be miles up, but it was so huge that it must have been close.  I vividly remember the large outline of its shape graying out the sky above.  Nothing made sense about the whole thing.  I did get chills and got back into my car and drove home very scared.  I did tell a few close friends about it, never pushing the idea.  I was watching the discovery channel, and saw the episode about the Illinois sighting.  Having not remembered seeing any of that in the news back in 2000 when it happened.  It sent chills down my back seeing the testimony of the police officers. I have not thought much about what I saw for several years now.  Having started a family since.

Being almost directly overhead they were brighter and more distinct, being orange red in color. I would estimate that each group of lights were numbered at 15 to 25.I yelled at my friend to come see,and he did see the lights just before they disappeared.I was ecstatic, and running to tell my other friend who was down the way I spotted another group of lights.

I was on post and was talking to two of my &quot;coworkers&quot; when the following happened. I had gone to patrol a restricted area and was on my way out when I decided to stop and talk with the sentry.  I was facing a road leading up a hill and into a heavily wooded area when I saw a very large diamond shaped object with large white lights at the points and small red lights inbetween them.  It had a total of eight lights all together. It rose above the tree line, turned, and dove back down.  It reminded me of a breaching whale. What struck me as strangest was that there was absolutely no sound.  For as large as it was I thought there should have been some noise from the engines. I immediately turned to the person I was talking to to ask them if they had seen it, and he was still looking in the direction of the object.  I stayed and we talked about what we had seen for about a half an hour before continuing on with patrol. I headed up the hill and decided to check out a construction site that was in the woods where they were building a new energy monitoring station, to see if there was anything to account for what we had seen.  When I arrived the first thing my partner and I noticed was that the huge stadium lights that were always on were out.

While viewing this sky anomaly, I noticed out of the corner of my eye another object like it but at a slightly further distance.  After about 30 minutes, the 2nd object had completely vanished while the seemingly closer object remained in the sky for another 30 minutes (1 hour total) before slowly disappearing from my view.  The object seemed to transition from a white color to a reddish-orange color and then to a bright blue.

The morning was warm and sunny and the sky was clear. When I first noticed it my thought was that it was a plane leaving a con trail (this was very near the Palm Springs airport) but I could not see any object only a large bright white plume. However, something was emitting a billowing plume behind it. The plume was not like a standard con trail- it billowed or seemed to roll behind the object almost like pulsing out-and also dissapated quite quickly - I would say it dissapated in maybe 2000 feet. Another interesting thing to note is that I could not hear it (I was about a mile from it) nor actually see an object ahead of the plume. Airplanes engines make noise and in this valley you can definitely hear them from much further away. I work around the airport and I am familiar with all the engine sounds that our air traffic makes, but this did not make any sound. Mount San Jacinto is approximately 12,000 feet high and was the background setting as this object went by, close to the mountain, heading west to east at an altitude of approximately, based on the height of the mountain, 8,000 feet. I also used the height of the mountain to estimate the length of the trail. I have to believe that tons of folks also witnessed this but found no mention of it on any of the news broadcasts. I have never seen an airplane leave a con trail at that altitude here nor seen a con trail like it. I had my binoculars in the car, unfortunately not around my neck, so I couldn&apos;t get a better look at whatever it was. But, as I said, I was working at the time and the work was time sensitive and demanding of my attention so I had to focus back on my work.

Then there would be darkness around the craft again and it was not possible to see if the dark sky had clouds or if the object was making the smoky swirling cloudlike haze around it.   It was moving very very slowly, and was very low.  It made no sound.  Then it drifted away and we were unable to follow it since we were on our way home and we live on the lake.

I watched them move until they were both obscured by the lattice barrier on my deck.  This is only part of the events that followed.Since I have a quality IR monocular for night vision, I decided to obtained it from within my house and quickly reentered my hottub.  The events that follow occurred between 6:45 and 7:15. pm, c.s.t. While scanning the visible night sky, I having previously observed two lights moving across the night sky from south to north with the naked eye, observed not two [2], but  eight [8] moving lights in the night sky, but not all at once.  About 6:45, I observed my first light using the night vision scope.  It was headed from north to southeast.  I can observe the sky from about 35 degrees above the northern horizon to about 90 degrees overhead. The lighted object was moving at a good pace to the southeast observable for about 15 to 20 seconds with my scope.  Once out of my viewable area, I continued to scan the area of the sky I could observe for any additional moving lights. Again I was surprised to see two [2] medium intensity lights like a flashlight beam from several blocks away, moving to the north northeast in a right echelon formation at a pace much slower the that of the single light I had observed some minutes prior.  I was able to track them for a much longer period possible 2 minutes duration.  Their physical separation remained constant during my observance of their track across the sky.  Losing sight of them due to obstructions, I continued to scan the night sky for additional objects.  Over the next 15 to 20 minutes, I observed  four [4] additional lighted objects one [1] moving from the north to south in my viewable area and the other three [3] were observed moving from southwest to north northeast. All of the moving lights observed during this time had light intensities as noted above.The altitudes of all these observed lights were estimated to be out of our atmosphere, but well below the stationary star formations observed as they passed by.  I&rsquo;ve never seen so many observable moving lights in all my years of star gazing in just one segment of time today, Friday the 16th of November.  If I have a dependable star chart, I could approximate their track across the night sky due to my very definable and observable viewing parameters.These lighted objects, don&rsquo;t appear to be any military craft and possibly could be various satellites in orbit, but that scenario is highly unlikely, too many in such a short period of time.  Has anyone else observed these moving lights during this time period?  Time will tell I guess.", "6 bright circle lights, 4 in a diamond formation and 2 leading the wayMy dad, my mom and I had been looking out the window at the fireworks. When my dad noticed 6 bright white circle lights moving across the sky. There were 2 lights leading the way, with 4 following closely together behind, in a diamond formation. They moved across the sky for about 5 minutes, then the 4 lights, which were at the back then disappeared. Then one of the lights at the front disappeared. The last light hovered in the same spot for about a minute, then this also disappeared. We are 100% sure, this was not a firework, as the lights had moved across the sky in the same formation and it had lasted 5 minutes", "2 unexplained objects stationary in the sky for 20 minutes, took a photograph.At 17:30 my wife asked me to look at the sky as she could see two distinct objects at distance in the sky.

I decided to do a U turn to watch the light from the closer other side of the road, and when I realized it had already disappeared with no trace.  It is impossible to tell if it diminished or flew away as there were trees in between when I realized it completely disappeared.For your reference, I am including the URL to the map of the exact spot where I could still see it before the U turn, http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;time=&amp;date=&amp;ttype=&amp;q=Guildford,+GU2+8XH,+UK+(Philips)&amp;sll=54.162434,-3.647461&amp;sspn=8.199939,20.500488&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=51.230914,-0.653043&amp;spn=0.017118,0.04004&amp;t=h&amp;z=15&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;om=1", "Disc over my apt complex with a military plane and helicopter (air force i assume)I was on my way driving home exiting the freeway when i noticed a black military plane in the shape of a triangle coming directly from the direction of the air force base towards  my apartment complex. The plane had two black smoke trails, &quot;very thin&quot; and it was also had two to three lights, one on each wing and maybe one underneath the head of the plane. As i got closer to my apt. complex, I noticed one of those long helicopters with the one propellers on each end of it which must have already been in the vicinity that seemed to be interacting with what I perceived to be a ufo. As soon as i notice the helicopter and the ufo right near each other the military plane that i saw coming towards the area when i was exiting the freeway was  clearly flying over my apt. complex then made a very sharp curve behind the disc which was not moving at all, suspended in mid-air as was the helicopter about one hundred feet to the left of the ufo which was only about 200 to 300 feet above the ground directly over the complex. It was in plan view, nothing was obstructing my view at all at this point. I really dont know if anyone else paying attention  but there were people in the area outside in the location.

As we topped a hill heading towards a bridge named Tebo Bridge we all witnessed  a light hovering above the water on the east side of the bridge.  One of the persons in the vehicle made the comment about what that light is.  We continued in a southern direction and came upon the bridge and stopped our vehicle.  All of us exited the vehicle and stood there and watched this light just hovering approximately 50 feet higher than the bridge and approximately 1/8 mile east of the bridge.  The best way for me to describe this light would be is that it is similar to lights you would see on an airplane but it was a constant light, not flashing or anything of the sort.This object was below the ridge line that ran in a east/northeastern direction with the water, so I am confident of the approximate distance from us to the object.  It was very dark out and very difficult to see an outline of the craft.  The weather was calm outside and the big thing we noticed was that there was complete silence.  This craft made no noise.  After watching this object for approximately 10 minutes just hovering above the water it turned and was now pointing in a north direction.  As it turned to the north we saw another light on the rear of the craft.  Being that it was so dark outside it was very difficult to get an outline of the object, but to my best guess it appeared to be an almost triangle shaped.After the craft turned, it slowly started to move in a northern direction.  As the craft moved away from us there still was no sound coming from it.  We watched this craft moving away from us at a very slow speed until it evidentially went out of sight.In 1994 I was a Police Officer and had never witnessed anything like that before or since.  Some of my fellow Officers are members of the Air Force Reserve and I described what I had saw and was told that the Air Force has nothing like what I described.  My thought was that Whiteman Air Force Base is approximately 40 miles from the area where this event took place and the direction the object took was in a somewhat direction towards Whiteman Air Force Base.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  There was a very dramatic event that occurred on June 21, 1995, near Cameron, MO, which was very well documented by one of the police officers there.

We took a break and walked over to a large bay window next to the stairs.  About a 1/2 mile out over the bay was an oval silver craft in broad daylight about 1500-2000 AGL.  It was totally still.  It then accelerated so quickly we could not follow it with our eyes.  It went up at a 45 degree angle and was going so fast it was hard to comprehend, after the initial acceleration we couldn&apos;t even see it anymore.  It did all of this without making a sound. We then called the airport and police to report it but they ignored us, after all we were 12 years old and our parents didn&apos;t even believe us.

Yesterday, at about 8:50 PM, I was driving eastbound on Academy Boulevard (this is a major road of Colorado Springs, and goes right through the middle of the city), when I saw a few lights floating above a shopping center right next to the road. I was traveling about 35-40 mph at this time and got closer to it quickly. Within a few seconds, I realized that the lights all belonged to the same object, and were then slowly moving above Academy, only about 50 feet in the air. It came at an angle towards me (or perhaps I was just moving towards it faster than I thought), and for about five seconds, it was close enough for me to see the details of it. It was the classic saucer shape, with maybe 6-8 white lights around the circular base of it, and one white light at the top. The top, however, was pointed as if a large cone were placed on the top of the main saucer part. It was dark, but I&apos;m fairly certain that the UFO was black or dark grey, and probably the equivalent of 2 or 3 cars in total mass. After about five seconds of it floating only about 50 feet away from me, it banked and did a u-turn, flying away at a much higher speed than it had been before (although it was impossible to estimate the speed at night in those conditions, its accelaration was definately much more than a helicopter could have managed). I saw the lights of it for a few seconds more, then lost it within the glow of the city.I would guess that there were many more witnesses (it was a busy city street, after all) and there should be more reports on the same saucer. Yes, this did happen on halloween night, and I wouldn&apos;t have believed it if I hadn&apos;t seen it so clearly (it may as well have landed and let me walk up and touch it), but it was very frightening because of what I might have just witnessed. Technology like that that we don&apos;t know about scares me and makes me wonder what else the government has in terms of power. I still don&apos;t believe it was extraterrestrial, because the statistical chances of that are improbable almost to the point of impossibility, but the fact that it exists at all is fairly horrifying.((NUFORC Note:  Student report.

My brother in law stepped onto the back deck to smoke a cigarette.  I went with him, just to talk.  While we were there, I noticed a satellite passing above, and asked him if he had ever seen a satellite.  He said no.  So, I pointed in the direction straight above us and we watched as the satellite moved from north to south and was soon out of sight.He was impressed that he had finally seen a satellite.  I told him there are a lot of them in this area and that another one should be visible within a few minutes.  Sure enough, there came another satellite heading from north to south.  It was not as bright as the first satellite, but we had no trouble seeing it.I handed my automatic adjusting binoculars to my brother in law, while I observed with my regular eyesight.  As we watched it approach slightly south of overhead, it stopped!  Both of us lost track of it within the background of stars.  However, we stayed focused on the general area.  Within about a minute, it moved again, very slowly.We watched as it gained speed to about the normal speed of a satellite.  Then, it stopped abruptly and went into a zigzag direction, east and west.  It repeated this several times, and then went into an expanding circular pattern and repeated that several times. It returned to the zigzag pattern several more times before it resumed a straight line southern direction, picked up speed to something extremely fast, (much faster than the speed of a normal satellite), and disappeared out of view to the south.I have never heard of a satellite that can stop or change direction, and mentioned that to my brother in law.  Whatever it was, the &quot;star-like object&quot; was flying high enough to reflect the sun&rsquo;s light like a normal satellite.

They were traveling NW in no specific formation.  I thought the objects were parts of a meteor or satellite that had reentered, but after about three seconds they stopped.  Two of the objects made 90 degree turns and went opposite directions, with the others staying motionless.  The two rejoined the group several seconds later after making some pretty impressive tight maneuvers (that ruled out meteor or satellite pretty quick) and they changed to a SE course.They appeared to be at high altitude and were about 2-3 times the diameter of the stars in the sky.  They stayed the same color (red to light red) throughout the sighting, and no noise or other signs were noted.  I was able to maintain visual contact with the objects for a total of about 15 seconds until they were close enough to the SE horizon that lights made viewing them difficult.", "Amber lightsAt approx 22:00 I observed an amber light at about 30 degrees in the northern sky.  The light was stationary for about 4 sec. As I was watching another amber light moved out from the first.  The second moved for about 2 seconds and stopped. As the second one was stopping the first went out.   (These lights do not just go out but act like someone has put a lid on a candle in a jar, they fade out)  The second light spawned a third light and the process was repeated 2 more times.

It was quite high and still quite large considering how high in altitude it was. At first glance I thought it was an enormous bird based upon how it seemed to be gliding through the air. However upon further inspection I noticed that it was actually shiny and highly reflective. It moved at a fairly consistent pace, and it moved fairly quickly although slow enough that I was able to run into another room (to get a better view out of our sliding glass door) and it was still there. Again, it seemed to be gliding, but definitely not decending or falling. It went behind the large number trees in our neighborhood, and I was unable to see what happened to it from there. Right before it went behind the trees there was a helicopter in the air which passed near it (although the helicopter was quite a bit lower in the air, it passed in the same vicinity...almost right under the object). I didn&apos;t get a good look at the helicopter so I don&apos;t have a description other than it was definitely dark in color. I was mostly transfixed on the other object. We do get a lot of hospital trauma helicopters flying over our house from time to time as we live on the edge of town, so the helicopter didn&apos;t strike me as unusual at the time. I am a 30 year old woman and I have never seen anything like this object before in my life.  I have seen large weather balloons gliding high in the sky and I can tell you this looked nothing like a weather balloon. It was jet black with a highly reflective surface. It appeared oval in shape and moved at a medium, consistent speed. I heard no noise from it...although the approaching helicopter could have drowned out any sounds.

My brother and I were walking along the beach near our parents house at around 20:00 hours. It is not uncommon to be alone on this beach as few people live in the area, this was one of those occasions. We walked only a short distance down from our access to the beach and decided to sit for a while. The low wind and few waves made it very quiet. That was when things took an abnormal turn. As we sat there talking we notice a light at the end of the point which was about 2kms away. The beach is the shape of a crescent moon, the light was at the left point and we where in the middle. We didn&rsquo;t take much notice of it at first because 4x4s use that end of the beach frequently, suddenly the light disappeared then reappeared. Of course we where not scared by this, it was only when the light stared to move around the crest of the beach at tremendous speed that it gain our attention. Attention turned to alarm as the light drew closer and we could hear no sound of a motor. The light covered the distance from the point to our position in around 20seconds. By this time my brother who is an emotional lad was in hysterics running flat out for the exit. I thought it prudent to follow but curiosity got the better of me and I stopped just before the access, as I turned I saw the light had stopped just before the shore line about 20metres from me. As I stood there I saw that this light did not just face forward but evenly illuminated 5metres around it in every direction. I could also see that there was no physical object holding this light up, it was hovering about 1metre off the ground. I got the distinct feeling that it was aware of my presence and it was using caution. By this stage my brother had left the beach and was screaming at me from down the access to run. My one regret now is that I did not investigate further but I gave in to my brother&rsquo;s pleas and moved off the beach. The beach rises quite quickly from the water line to the top of a small dune which stretches the length of the beach with a few trees scattered along the ridge. It then descends into a gully, then up again onto another dune. As I caught up with my terrified brother in the gully we turned around to see if the light was following. The light ascended off the beach to a height that it could be seen in the gully, easily 30 feet off the ground. Almost simultaneously we started moving further down the access and the light descended back on the beach. It then started moving at high speed back the way it came, we know this because we could see the glow along the top of the dune. After a brief period back on the road that leads to the beach access we collected our wits and thought about it sensibly, we realized that it was low tide so any land vehicle would have to have left some sort of track on the beach. So we then proceeded back onto the beach to search physical signs of what we just saw, however nothing could be seen on over a kilometer of beach covered.

We were in the parking lot of the Table Rock General Store, just a few miles from Table Rock Mountain itself. Two of us were visiting a friend who lives nearby and had stopped to check out of the motel beside the store.  The woman who works in the store was outside, pointing her camera phone at the sky. She kept saying, &ldquo;They have no wings and no jet stream (contrail).&rdquo;  I looked in the direction she was pointing and saw a metal aircraft of some type making steady progress, headed in a southwesterly direction. I could not see any sign of wings or any suggestion of a tail. The shape was long, as large as a commercial jetliner or even a C-130, rather cigar shaped, but somewhat wider at the front end and tapering toward the back. At first I wondered if it could be a blimp, but it was not blimp-shaped. It also moved steadily forward at what easily could have been several hundred miles an hour. The body was metal, looking like aluminum glinting in the sun. As we stood there, another of the same aircraft came into view, moving in the same flight pattern as the first and at what looked like the same speed. We watched for probably 15 minutes, during which time the first craft moved beyond our view. It was easy to see because the sky was deep blue and totally cloudless. It was hard to estimate how big they were, but from that distance, they looked about 3/8&rdquo; long if I&rsquo;d held up my fingers to measure one from front to back at arm&rsquo;s length. The woman at the store said she had seen five of them the day before, flying in formation. I believe she said they appeared to be escorted by helicopters, but I may be mistaken. Our curiosity was piqued, to say the least, but we thought a simple call to Air Traffic Control at the Greenville, SC, airport would reveal what they were. Due to their direction in which they were traveling, they surely would have shown up on the radar there. But the friend we were visiting said she called, but the airport radar had picked up nothing that sounded like what we&rsquo;d seen. She was referred to several other agencies, including the FAA, and finally to this site. I and the friend who were visiting are both retired newspaper reporters, with more than 30 years of experience each. The friend we were visiting is also a longtime journalist. We all had worked together at the same large (and very reputable) newspaper in North Carolina. But our friend is somewhat handicapped and by the time she got out of the car to take a look, the aircraft had moved out of view. The third witness is the woman who works in the store. I don&apos;t know her background but she seemed to be a very no-nonsense kind of person.", "Ufo sigting in redondo beach  on a sunday afternoonI  live in redondo beach  off artesia and lawndale i went to cvs store on Hawthorne and Manhattan beach went i was coming back i stop at the stop sign which divides redondo beach blvd and artesia my eyes catch a gleam on the sky and when i  look up i saw a round shape object i hate to repeat what other people say but it was a silver or metallic thing just standing there not moving  it was reflecting light from the sun that&apos;s when i know that it was not a cloud  and the reason that i now that it was not moving was that i could see clouds moving toward it i saw it until the clouds move in i would like to know if anybory else saw it  please report to confirm  what i saw as you would know you feel sily whent you tell others even my husband((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

He said he was walking the dog and she suddenly saw something and got scared.  He looked up and saw a rectangular object with rounded sides in the air (I found out later he meant the sides were convex). It was white with a wide blue stripe and was partially hidden by trees in our yard, but was in front of trees further away in our yard. He described it as waving back and forth, then moving off to the right of his view further behind the trees where he could not see it anymore.  He said it seemed to be about 4 to 6 inches wide and about 18 inches long.  It was at an angle, not perfectly vertical.  He said it made no sound.  It did not give off light. He insisted it was not a balloon, nor a piece of windblown trash or a kite.  There was a very light breeze, but that area of the yard is shielded from wind by trees. I inspected the area a few minutes later.  There was no sign of any debris or trash (which would have likely been snagged in some pines trees, based upon the direction of the breeze). He is a very grounded person and does not make up stories.  I have no idea what he saw, and I am at a loss to explain it. We live in a rural area on a fairly busy highway, but trees isolate our house from the road. Our dog is timid, but the fact she was the first to see something and reacted before my son saw it, makes me think he absolutely saw something real.", "Large and Bright light with Steady Course VanishedWhere I live there is a large amount of overhead commercial traffic. Both myself and partner generally stand at our back door to smoke, as we prefer not to smoke in the house. We are both sensible, yet open minded people. I am ex Royal Air Force so Im pretty used to seeing many things up in the air (I stress that Im not or ever have been a pilot). We both take great delight in watching the skies at night and have witnessed many things but never have I considered any of them to be a so-called UFO.Neither I nor my partner could identify it, so I have labelled it as such.The event is quite unremarkable and possibly has a valid explanation, I was however left slightly confused after the event but by no means will I exagerate anything witnessed.The object in question had no shape (round shaped if any) or visible form other than a very bright white light. It was spotted initially whilst my partner and I were facing South. With any aircraft in the area its very easy to determine distance and height, and additionally you can hear each individual aircraft. This however, was substantially different as it was near impossible to ascertain its real height or distance, which struck me as odd given the intensity of the light. Initially it looked considerably low for any type of aircraft, and I had also assumed at first that these must be lights at the front of an aircraft but its heading (approximately a NW to SE direction) did not confirm this. The object moved in a straight line without any deviation but moved rather slowly. (again I discounted the fact that this could have been a shooting star due to the speed of travel). We both would have discounted this totally had it not been for the end result of this light. After a couple of minutes the intense light seemed to diminish. Not so much fade out but seemed to get smaller very quickly to the point that it resembled a faint and distant star, until at last it vanished. During this time its movement did look constant.I wouldnt have considered submitting this if it had not been for the latter detail, and of course the other facts brought together.  I have discounted fireworks also, given that the course and apparrant height was linear and never deviated.", "Bright Boomerang Object in the Sky in San Francisco on November 3th  It was around 5am on Saturday, November 3th.  I was on my friends roof having a late night night cap.   All of a sudden we both looked up and there was this bright light above us.  It looked like a bright colored boomerang.  It was a clear night so it stood out pretty well in the sky.   We also noticed a redish and green light underneath it.  The object made no sound.  We were so scared that we ran into my friends building and viewed it from her window.  The object stayed outside the window for 10 minutes.

I was a witness to the &quot;Phoenix Lights&quot; on 3/13/97 and for the last 10 years since then, I have been scanning the sky nightly without with camera close by, but have not seen anything since then... until this night.  What I saw is unlike anything I&apos;d seen or heard of before.  It was certainly unexplainable.  It was way about 5 to 8 thousand feet and moving about as fast as a fixed wing aircraft would be flying.  The difference that set it apart from any aircraft is that it looked like a small cloud that was lit up from behind by a white  light.  As I watched it travel high in the center of the sky, it faded to black and then lit back up again. As it flew over it faded out and again and lit up again in perfect rythem as it headed straight southwards.

I was in my aunts garden, bringing in wood from the garden to put on the fire when I then first saw the disk. It was flying at around 2000 ft and seemed to be slowly drifting down from the sky to about 1500-1400ft. It was clearly a disk and was yellow, and was covered in a thin gray haze which to me looked a bit like steam. As I have said, it was yellow with an orange rim. All a saw was the bottom side of the disk which appeared to have small blue lights flashing randomly. I am not sure if they were lights or just reflections. I watched this for about 40 seconds and then it just vanished in thin air, there were hardly any clouds at all. Almost as soon as I had stepped inside, I saw the disk again through the window. This time it was much lower down, probably only 500ft above the roofs of the houses, but a lot further away from me than before. It was also traveling much slower than before, probably only jogging pace. It seemed to maintain altitude and I was able to estimate the size of the disk. I would say it was about 80ft in circumference and around 15ft from the bottom to the top. This time I was partly able to see the top of the disk, and it looked exactly the same as the bottom. The gray haze was still around the disk, but I could not see any of th e blue flashes I had seen before. This time, I was able to see the object for just over a minute. I went outside to get a better look at the disk, I could no longer see it. The sky&apos;s were almost completely cloudless, so I don&apos;t know where it went after that.

As I walked up to the Pickup I noticed an Airplane flying from west to east.  This was nothing out of the ordinary in my area since we live under several Transcontinental Air-lanes between Chicago, Omaha, and Lincoln, going to Denver or LA Etc.  I was tracking the Plane going to the east when I noticed a very bright light in the sky further towards Zenith from the Plane. As I was standing facing North, I checked the sky to orient myself with the Constellations and I attempted to triangulate on the position of the bright light.  I found Cassiopeia and then Camelopardalis and found the bright light was between North star (last star in the little dipper&apos;s handle) and the Brightest Star of Auriga about half way between these two stars, but was not as distant. I would estimate this Light was in orbit, but holding stationary position. Doing a quick inventory of the sky I concluded it was not Venus Saturn or Jupiter because it was too far north and in a totally wrong place to be these planets. To judge the size of this light it would be four times the size of Venus when seen in the South-western Sky at, or shortly after Sunset.  The Brightness was twice the Magnatude of Venus in the Morning Just before Dawn. But as I said this was not Venus. After observing this light for 15-20 seconds it just winked out, not moving in any direction.  What I noticed was while the object&rsquo;s light intensity was dissipating, I could see a round ball in the center, kind of like when a light bulb is turned off, you can still see the glow if the plasma formed around the element for a brief second.  But this was round.  I also thought I could hear something like the sound of what old flash bulbs made in the Camera&rsquo;s of the 50&rsquo;s up to the 70&rsquo;s, that crunching boiling sound as the blue coating fried from the heat of the bulb burning out. I stood there for a few minutes waiting to see if this was all or if it would come back and I didn&rsquo;t see anything else.  I came back in my home and checked the time which was 22:34.

I hurried and got dressed and rushed to school only to find that I was ~45 minutes early.  I thought nothing of it.

This would not be strange except that I clearly remembered her asking me what day it was the day before the event and the date on my watch was correct.  Still I did not think about my nightmare, nor did I suspect anything more than a malfunctioning watch. After school I returned to my home.  When I walked in my mom was in the kitchen.

On 10/15 at around 6:47 A.M. I left the house to drive my husband to the Wheaton/Glenmont Metro Station.  I was traveling south on Layhill Road, and approaching Middlevale Lane, a side street on the left, when I noticed a bright point of light above the trees on my right side.  It was about the same size and magnitude as Venus, except it was in the southwest sky.  I saw that it was moving and wondered if it was a satellite, because it was a steady brightness and there were none of the navigation lights or beacons normally associated with an airliner.However, it didn&rsquo;t behave like I would expect a satellite to.  The point of light moved slowly from left to right above the horizon, stopped, resumed moving and then stopped again.  Though I was very interested in watching it some more and looked as long as I dared, Layhill Road descends sharply into a basin at this point and I lost sight of it behind the trees.

This bright object appeared to be due south at about 12-15 degrees above the horizon.  The bright object was bigger and brighter than any planet I&rsquo;ve ever scene.  It was 3 to 4 times bigger than Venus and incredibly bright.  I convinced myself it was a plane coming directly toward us, just high enough to be reflecting the bright light of sunset.As this pure white, bright circle of light grew slightly in circumference and brightness, I thought this must be one huge plane and it&rsquo;s getting really close, I almost wanted to duck down but there never were any plane sounds.  Without binoculars, all I had to help aid in viewing was prescription sunglasses.  I got in the car to get my glasses and when I stood up again the bright object seemed to be back where I first saw it.  I&rsquo;m guessing that would have been south of Taos, NM.O.K. that was odd, but the real shocker came when I put on my prescription sunglasses &ndash; the brightness was dimmed and I could see 3 distinct yellowish/gold lights - the one middle front light being slightly bigger than the 2 side lights.  There seemed to be some energy or filament connecting or flowing between the center light and the side lights.  I thought, &ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t right,&rdquo; and pulled the sunglasses off my face and there I saw the pure white, bright light again.  What?  How can this be?  I kept taking my sunglasses off and putting them back on again trying to reconcile the two different things I was seeing - a round pure white and very bright light without my sunglasses and with them on seeing 3 separate yellow/gold lights with something blurry between them.In the moment, I convinced myself this was Jupiter and a couple of moons and accounted for the blurriness by remembering I was looking through sunglasses not binoculars, and of course the reflecting light of sunset must be causing the brightness.We stood in amazement and watched the big waxing gibbous moon move along the path of the ecliptic in the southeast while our bright object appeared motionless in the south until our view was obstructed by clouds at approx. 7:45pm.Since Sat. Sept. 22nd I&rsquo;ve researched star charts and found that this bright light could not possibly have been Jupiter, as that planet was in the SSW, on the ecliptic at 26 degrees during the time our object was sighted due south at approx. 12 degrees.((name deleted))((NUFORC Note:  Jupiter?

Several thorough searches have yielded nil.The light moved in a straight path from my field of view, and did not change in brightness, which may have indicated a change in altitude. The object appeared to be at an incredibly high altitude, which is why we thought that it must be a satellite, since even aircraft that are visible in binoculars would be in restricted airspace for this part of the sky. The flight path for National Airport is the SSW, along the Potomac River, and does not cross this field of view.After moving to within 2&deg; of Capella in Auriga, it ceased movement. Just. Like. That.  We had watched it move for about 6 minutes from the NNE to the center of my FOV.  The light remained motionless for another ~3 minutes.  Its appearance in the binoculars was similar to Mars, in that it was a bright pink light that did not twinkle. The light then moved slowly in a southerly direction for about 3&deg; and disappeared.  The &apos;real&apos; Mars was visible in the next constellation over, so the light  definitely was NOT the planet.

It appeared to be about 500 to 1000 feet above ground and it made a slow banking counter-clockwise turn around the field.  It was shiny silver in color with some red on it.  There was no sound or vapor trail from the object.  However, as we approached, we noticed that it lacked wings.  As the passenger in the car watched it continuously, he saw the object disappear before it would have crossed the highway.  The driver and passenger looked all around the sky after the event and could not locate the object anywhere.  It had not landed or flown out of range; it had simply disappeared in mid-air.Both witnesses are familiar with various types of aircraft, such as crop-dusting planes and ultralight aircraft that can be seen in the area from time to time.  This object was not a conventional aircraft.  It had a crumpled appearance, and had what appeared to be a rear fin on its body.  However, it had NO WINGS.", "When I was sleeping In my flat In a city of SP Brasil, In June 2005 something strange happened...But Some hours before I was in a bus traveling from the city of Cruzeiro SP to Cachoeira Paulista SP, It was 18.00 h pm, and during the travel a white light very strong did follow the bus, almost all the travel, from the right side...All the other passengers were sleeping.When i arrive to my flat (It was in the top of a building with 3 steps, without neighbours, and in the flat were windows from the 4 sights arround all the flat...),(the door of the flat was in glass with some place outdoor)... so when I was in the outddors stairs to go to the flat I saw the light again, but more close, and did come to my direction...

Then a couple of seconds later I noticed a second object about a foot and a half behind the first object traveling at the same speed.  The objects appeared to be very high in the sky, possibly at commercial jet airliner altitude, but they were moving much faster than jets do at that height.  It is very quiet that time of the morning around my house and so I listened for the engines but there was not any sound at all. I watched the objects flying toward the north east until they disappeared in the trees on the horizon, the whole viewing lasted about 20 to 25 seconds.The first object consisted of 3 round lights in a triangular pattern, they were fixed white lights, no blinking or flashing or pulsating.  The second object had just one light, it to was fixed, no blinking or flashing or pulsating.  It was still very dark and I couldn&rsquo;t make out the shape of either object.  The distance between the objects didn&rsquo;t change.  I say they were 2 separate objects because I could see the stars between them as they passed over but they maintained the same speed and distance.I thought at first they were helicopters or airplanes but there were no sounds at any point.  Then I wondered if it was the NASA space station and the shuttle but when I mentioned it to a friend at work he said there are no lights on the space station that you would be able to see from earth that would be in that configuration.  So I don&rsquo;t know what they were.

It was small, and bright, like a star, or sattelite, but its movements became irregular.  It was roving quite simply at first, but then it moved down, then back in the direction that it had been moving in, then it zipped over to the right again, then it did something wierd...it zoomed away from the planet, well it went left, really really fast, turbo speed...then it stopped.  Didn&apos;t move for a second or two, then continued to move in a strange pattern, eventually moving out of sight.  Living in an apartment building, I only have a sight view of the sky.  I am not the type to see a ufo.. I am 23, a female and not into this stuff too much, although the FACE ON MARS is nuts...anyway, I read alot about the brain, and once I saw this strange light I read up about what it could be, and decided that I did in fact believe that intellegent life was observing our planet, for whatever reason. After that, I saw another UFO, or whatever it was, that was about a week ago from now, NOV.8 2007, I was looking out the window again, and I thought I saw a grey seagull, riding the wind.  As I watched the &quot;gull&quot; I noticed that it didn&apos;t ride the wind as an amimal should, rather it just moved wiht the same altutde in one direction.  As I looked closley, realizing that I was looking at a dark disk, not very high up, no lights.  It looked very stealth, yet very clear.

Wright Kentucky.  My 15 year old daughter, a passenger in the car, started screaming hysterically that she saw a UFO. I laughed it off, thinking it was lights from a nearby ambulance reflecting off of something. A quarter mile up the road she screamed again, telling me to look to my left, towards downtown Cincinnati. This is when I caught my first glimpse of the object.  It was obvious that it was not something normal, but I was seeing it between trees. As I drove a little bit further up the road it was clear as day to me. The object was lit up bright white with vertical tan marks on it that looked like shadows of some sort.  It was somewhat of a disk shape, with another bubble type disk at the top.  Its size was something I couldn&apos;t comprehend the possibility of it being able to hover in the air. It was easily the size of 3 city blocks squared. I continued on Kyles Lane until I came to the bridge over Interstate 75, where I slowed to a near stop. Here we saw the object was within 2 miles of us, bright as could be, hovering just to the west of downtown Cincinnati.  We were both amazed that none of the other cars seemed to notice it. At this point I was in total disbelief, on the phone with a friend who lived nearby, telling her to stand in her front yard facing Cincinnati and tell me if she saw it.  She saw nothing. Due to traffic I was forced to continue driving. I changed my course by heading south down Dixie Highway towards Covington and the Ohio River. At this point we saw it again, but this time it was much farther away, I&apos;m guessing 30 to 40 miles north of the city. The shape and brightness of it was so distinct there was no confusion as to that being the same object. I sped down the hill on Dixie Highway towards Covington, trying to get near the river, and a better spot. I was hoping to find someplace to park with a clear view. I lost sight of it again while going down the hill, but once at the bottom, going east to! wards Fi fth Street we saw it for the final time. I was now near the river again, only this time it was east of Cincinnati, about 20 miles from the first sighting. Being a non-believer, I have gone over every possible scenario in my head, trying to convince myself I didn&apos;t see what I saw. There is also the fact that my daughter saw it, first I might add, and was completely shaken up to the point of hysterical crying and shaking that I could not console her in the least. I considered taking her to the hospital to be sedated, she was that upset. I also realized that I was shaking while trying to tell the story to a friend where my daughter was spending the night. I spent the rest of the night and the next morning trying to decide whether I was going to tell anyone. I consider anonymously calling the police station and saying &quot;Look, I don&apos;t think I&apos;m crazy, but have you had any reports of a strange bright object seen around the city in the sky?&quot; I watched every news report for several days and scoured the newspapers, but I have seen no mention of anything that could even remotely be what we saw. There was a blimp in town the next day for a football game, but it was nowhere near the right shape and at least 10 times too small.So help me here, please. Are both my daughter and I certifiable insane or did someone else see this also?", "Don&apos;t want to divulge any information that might involve other witnesses of this event without their permission.  Suffice to say that myself and six others, (five of whom I did not meet until the sighting), witnessed an enormous sized triangular craft moving south to north in western Massachusetts near the New York State border.  I discovered several weeks later that the same object was sighted in the Hudson Valley in New York and in White Plains and Brewster.  Am not certain of the exact date this occured but for some strange reason I have been doing a little research trying to pinpoint the exact evening.  I do remember that either the next day or a few days after the sighting that a group of light planes flew over parts of Eastern New York in a triangular pattern in an  effort to explain the sighting to the public. Anyone who had seen the triangular craft, and I have discovered there were literally hundreds, and then saw the planes flying in the formation the next evening would have to be a fool to believe they were one and the same. I was 35 at the time of the sighting. The thought never goes away.

On two different occasions when looking straight up I&apos;ve seen this star sized red light that moves around now and then.  I&apos;m wondering if it&apos;s some kind of satellite.  It stays in one place though and then moves a few degrees and stops and then repeats this moving a few degress from there to a different spot.  I have not seen it disappear, it outlasted me as I don&apos;t have much stamina.  What I&apos;ve done is gone back inside for awhile to rest and then I&apos;ve come back outside to see if it&apos;s still there and I was able to find it quickly and it continued doing its strange stopping and then moving a few degrees and stopping again.It stays completely red the whole time and does not scintilate at all.

I walked out and saw the object. My first thought was it must be a blimp (the speed and the altitude I suppose) but then looking through the binoculars there was nothing between the two lights - no gondala, craft or wings. There was simply a blue space that appeared to be the sky. Observed in clear pre-dawn sky were two lights that appeared to be in the normal flight altitudes of approx. 500 feet. It was traveling SW to NE; front white light appeared similar to a 1st magnitude star (or brighter) and the trailing white light appeared more like a 2-3 mag. star (one witness has a background in amatuer astronomy). I looked closely to see the normal tell-tale blinking lights required for flying craft (the red ones) and there were no other lights on this object. There was just the very bright, white, unblinking lights. We do not know what this object was - no doubt it will prove to be something pretty normal but it was simply very strange and something neither of us had ever seen before despite years of doing amatuer astronomy. Clear sky - little wind (a check with NOAA revealed it was not being carried by the wind as the wind was coming from a more northwest direction at the time). Totally silent. No engine or noise. 10x50 binoculars revealed NO structure behind the lights and NO connecting structure from front white light to back white light. Crossed the clear sky in 3-5 minute to disappear in the dawn glow to the NW. If within flight path speed appeared close to small craft flight speed - if astronomical it was traveling fast. The only lights showing were clear, bright white with no other regulation lighting seen.

Airplanes usually are not in that area of the sky.  We travel this road daily and have never seen an airplane in that spot in the sky before. It was dark out so the exact shape was hard to determine but it seemed like a saucer with a row of lights toward the bottom.

Eventually we couldn&rsquo;t see it any more because we kept driving.

Three sailors disappear off Australia Great Barrier Reef, amid unusual circumstances.Australians still puzzling over yacht mystery (DPA)  23 April 2007  SYDNEY - Friends and relatives of the three crew members of a 12-metre catamaran found adrift last week off the Great Barrier Reef on Australia&rsquo;s east coast have not given them up for dead. Despite authorities giving up the search for survivors, loved ones said Monday that they hadn&rsquo;t lost hope. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got family over there,&rdquo; the wife of one of the missing sailors said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re chartering boats, they&rsquo;re going out looking, ... and we&rsquo;re going to find them.&rdquo;  When the Kaz II was found Friday, the sails were up, the engine was running, a laptop computer was on, the table was set for a meal, and three life jackets and the emergency beacon were still on board - as were the wallets and mobile phones of the three Perth sailing chums. No distress message had been sent. Adding to the mystery were neatly folded clothes at the stern of the luxury boat. The only sign of distress was a tattered sail. Police said they thought the men may have fallen overboard during a storm eight days ago and ruled the chances of finding them alive almost zero. The search was called off Saturday. &ldquo;This is one of those cases in which there has been a lot of speculation, but there is nothing to indicate other people were involved or there may have been some kind of crime,&rdquo; Townsville police spokesman Warren Webber said. &ldquo;We can come up with various ranges and hypotheses and theories as to what may have happened.&rdquo;  A forensic examination of the boat and its equipment has not unravelled the mystery. Sailors point out that a table laid for a meal and neatly folded clothes don&rsquo;t jibe with the rough seas that Webber says may have tipped the trio overboard. David Dellow, a Townsville sailor, told Australia&rsquo;s ABC Radio that he suspected the boat had been boarded by pirates. &ldquo;How do you get three guys to disappear at once?&rdquo; he asked. His scepticism about a weather-related catastrophe was echoed by Whitsundays Yacht Club chief Jeremy Cooper. &ldquo;Even two is explainable, with perhaps one going in after the other. But three? You just can&rsquo;t imagine why that would happen,&rdquo; Cooper said.

It did not have the colored lights on the wings, or really any wings at all from what I could tell.  The white lights that we did see were on the bottom of the object and as it got closer we could see that it was in a triangular shape, with the lights going out towards each angle.The lights reminded me of the flux capacitor in &quot;Back to the Future&quot; - but they did not flash, they were glowing constantly.  And they were extremely bright, like the lights at a night game of a baseball.This was the second time that my girlfriend has seen this object, the first time was when our house caught on fire a little over a year ago - she said the object we saw tonight looked exactly like the one she saw at the fire.", "((NUFORC Note:  Witness fails to indicate the date of the alleged sighting.

I went outside and noticed a bright light almost like airplane headlights off to the east.  I figured that it was headlights from an aircraft until I noticed it dimming and moving in ways that a aircraft couldn&apos;t do.  It was making small circles at one point and then started making more rapid movements to the left and to the right, diagonal, and while it was doing this there were surges of light that made it look like it was flashing while doing this. I continued to go back and observe it for about 30 minutes and needless to say after seeing this I was pretty freaked out.  So I went to grab a video camera to get it and when I got back I noticed that the batteries that had been charging were dead out of nowhere for the camera.  The background was all black because it was up in the sky above the tree line.  All I could make out was the faint outline of the trees and it was right above that.  and through this whole ordeal I also noticed that the lights got closer it seemed and then suddenly everything was gone and I didn&apos;t see it again.

I stared more intently as the object changed directions and accelerated.  It was a relatively quiet night and there was no sound.  I am an aviation professional and am positive it was not an aircraft.  The change of direction and the speed of the acceleration was unlike any aircraft I am familiar with.

As we got closer our mouths dropped open and we both just said &ldquo;what the  ....&rdquo; We were shocked.  It was right above us just hovering over the road.  You could see the UFO almost perfectly.  It had three bright lights on the bottom in the shape of a triangle.  It was saucer shaped, silver a little &quot;bubble&quot; type thing on top.  It was spinning and just hovering.  We pulled over because we wanted to get a better glimpse.  There were about six other cars behind us that were also stopped looking.  As soon as we pulled out the camera it moved upward behind the clouds, (it was a cloudy night) Like I said, it was clearly visible and big but you could tell it was a pretty good distance above.  At first sight it was hovering below the clouds but once people started stopping it hovered up farther into the sky.  It started to move west so we decided to follow.  Once again we pulled over and started trying to take pictures but every time I would move so we could see it would move a little more hiding being the treetops.  We took five pictures with my friend&rsquo;s digital camera.  Then it vanished behind the treetops.  There was a bank parking lot so we decided to pull in the lot and park.  As soon as we parked and were about to get out we started hearing this strange loud noises.  Noises I honestly can not explain.  We have NEVER heard anything like it.  For some reason, as scared as we were we got out because we wanted to see if we could actually see what was making those noises.  It almost seemed like two &ldquo;aliens&rdquo; communicating to one another.  We were both just frozen there so scared and then all of a sudden the noises started going &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; and a dog that was in the backyard where the weird noises were coming from started barking and honestly seemed like it was being att! acked so we jumped in the car and took off.  We both were just stunned and so scared.  Neither one of us really believed in this, until now that is.  After returning home we decided to see what her camera had caught.  All the pictures were gone except one which you can barely see anything.  If you zoom in you can see a white object.

The Beam was brighter than the Lexor in Las Vegas. After driving for 45 mins I could see that the beam was coming from the far west end of Simi, its source was a mile or two from the Regan Library. You could see the beam from 50 miles. The source was in a small valley in the hills at the end of the Wood Ranch Parkway. The beam looked like a blue white laser and shot up five miles with no flaring out or diffusion. I drove to the nearest place I could and found several other cars driving past a guard blocking a fire road into the hills. I asked the guard what was going on, what was that light?  He said they were making a video for MTV and told me to leave.  He had no badge, no plates in the car, no logo on his jeep, he was not a cop.Three days later I walked up that fire road and found a warning sign, &quot;International Security Corp., AMSEC&quot;.

AMSEC was owned by SAIC.What I found was interesting, and a large depression in the dirt, burned grass and an area 50ft x 50ft square of small quarts rocks with perfect 90 degree corners.18 wheeler truck tire marks in the mud and small metal filings.Oh, and a security guard in a white Bronco way up on the hill watching me, and a few cows.I checked with Simi Valley city hall and there was no movie permits issued for any area at that time for any movie or video production.I want to know what this light beam was. It looked to be a 50 foot wide laser beam that went up 5 miles. This all took place 5 or 10 days after seeing a fireball fly over the valley. Why was a spy satellite builder guarding a cow pasture?  Was this a possible UFO crash site and recovery?  Or a test of some kind.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It began at 7:35 PM and lasted until 8:25 PM involving 4 separate objects, each seen at different times during the 50 minute duration. The first object was seen at 7:35 PM as I was leaving for a security patrol. The object was seen by me and my co-worker, then later only by me. The first object came from the south west and moved to the north east. This object was a white ball of light. It stopped 2 times completely, then continued across the sky very slowly. There was a discernable darkness around the object. Though it did not pass over any major stars, there seemed to be a solid object and not just a light. An airplane (a regular commercial airliner), about 3-4 minutes into this, came from the north west. Within 30 seconds of the airplane appearing, the light we had been following simply vanished. I then went on my security patrol. About 5 minutes into the patrol, directly overhead, a small light appeared. It then began to grow in intensity and travel in a southerly direction, reaching a -2 or -3 magnitude, not quite the brightness of Venus. At 8 PM, I reached about the midpoint in my security round. I saw another light, this time very dim, moving from south east to the north east, crossing through the constellation of Pegasus. At 8:10 PM, I went to the same spot where the other security guard had seen a triangular UFO fly over him two nights before. I saw nothing at this point, and left to continue my round. A light caught my eye in the mountains to the north east. A very bright light near the top of the mountain range. I went back to my previous position to get a better look. I am very familiar with this mountain range, even in the dark. More pointedly, the stars rise over this mountain range, giving a clear outline of mountains themselves. If Venus is normally a magnitude of -4 to -5, this was a magnitude of -7 at least. This light/object moved up and down from the top of the mountains, into the sky about a degree or two. It also moved side to side and two times, and twice increased in brightest and moved in such a way that I felt that it was approaching, however, it never did move overhead. After calling the other guard about this object, and asking him to come out, it faded to the same magnitude of the star I was watching rise over the hill to its left. It then increased in magnitude and then vanished. This is similar to another sighting I had on September 29th on an adjacent mountain range. I was able to rule out a motorcycle or car headlight in that the light/object clearly moved above the horizon, something a normal vehicle could not do. Once the other guard arrived, he noticed an aberration in the night sky. He pointed to it, and I saw it as well. 2 objects flying low in the sky. One that seemed to be darker than the night sky, traversing over the background stars and another &quot;ghostly&quot; object behind it that also obscured the stars in the background. These objects came from the areas where the bright light had been and traveled beneath the constellation Pegasus in a north to east trajectory. Not feeling comfortable about being in that location any longer, we then headed back to our office to complete the patrol.", "bright lights ,second sighting, over sudbury area in less than one month did you see it as well?a bright coloured object(light) appeared second time over skies in early morning hours approximately3:30 am nvember second 2007, this is second sighting  witnessed in less than a month over skies in sudbury.light, brightened and dulled swaying left to right in skt at 2 oclock position and proceeded to rise slow and drop as is irratic as if in unstable turbulence in the sky, object hovers and sways back and forth took pictures with camers of first event as this is going on as i type, first sighting approximately the 6 th of october this year 2007.first sighting was on going for hours until early hours of the morning, time duration was at least 5 hours ,from 1 am until530 am when object disappeared, as in this report as well object hovered in the same approx area , dropping and swaying in direction, witnessed by 4 other individuals,first sighting , appeared to be other lights surrounding the larger, as is small stars in a shooting pattern and would disappear when colse to the lighted object", "Grey Circular object seen over southern New jerseyMy girlfriend and I were standing in front of my house facing south/southwest and I noticed a round grey ball high up in the sky approx. 10,000 ft. and 10-20 miles away.

An airliner passed under it and passed pretty close. The airliner was coming from Philadelphia international and was heading east towards the NJ coast.

This sighting took place in 2003 (the exact day is unknown but I believe it was on August 23rd).   The sighting was later verified as having been seen by two Mexican laborers I had working on my property.As you can see by the attached photos (jpegs) of which there are two (2) the sighting was photographed with an old digital camera close by the edge of a street in VOC and shows the same landscape with about a 10-feet difference.  I am sending you four jpegs of the sighting of which two are enlargements of the object in question.For your information, although I would prefer anonymity regarding what I am sending you, my wife and I are known artists, although 30 some years in the past I was, for 14-years, a trained US Army Special Forces NCO and worked in intelligence and communications under the command and control of the CIA.  The reason for my telling you this is that if there is an investigation it will not leave you hanging for a response.  Also, there is the fact that since 2000 I have video-taped a number of unidentified flying objects in and nearby VOC; but enough of the past as this sighting was accidental as at the time my wife was photographing monsoon clouds to use in her paintings and we did not see the object until the photographs were downloaded onto our computer.Even then the object was thought to have been a speck of dirt or other material on the lens.  It wasn&rsquo;t until I began enlarging the photographs that I sighted; on the bottom left of the photo a red spot lighted area upon the ground and above, on the top left, a white spot lighted area on a cloud.  Reflected sunlight?  However, photo nr. two shows, on the bottom left, only a white spotlighted area on the ground.  Further enlargements of the black spot (see corresponding formation of sky surrounding the unknown object) piqued my curiosity when it showed an oval object that looks to be a person in side the object, standing before a vertical rectangular object (control board?).  I will leave it up to you as to what the object is and, if you find it intriguing, enlarge the object yourself.As for the Mexican laborers, they told me they had sighted the same object while changing a flat tire on their vehicle.  They also stated that the object had then approached and landed upon one of the Mesas in the background shown in my photos.  When they returned home and told their families they had been ridiculed so they hadn&rsquo;t told anyone else other than their employer.  Later, while working upon a studio for me I showed the photos to their employer and he then showed it to the two men and they told me that the object was the same one they had sighted.  Unfortunately, I didn&rsquo;t have the two men write down what they had seen and like the unknown day we took the photos I or my wife cannot provide any further information.", "Regarding the 10/7/07 Poplarville, MS sighting reported previously BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SKY  ((NUFORC Note: Probably a star, perhaps Sirius, we believe.

I ran and got my video camera and started to record. I zoomed it to get the best possible view and proceeded to tape over 25 minutes of footage. During the time we watched, we saw it morph shape (size and volume) erratic movements never seeming to move far from it&rsquo;s original position. The lights,blue,green,red,yellow and white were also changing.", "Super-colossal circle of rotating lights perpendicular to the ground &quot;sailing&quot; over major city.To Whom It May Concern,  First of all, let it be known that I am not a UFO &quot;believer&quot; per say. Although this occurred approximately 27 years ago, I thought it&apos;s time to report to various UFO investigation organizations. I hope this is worthy.Thank you. Around the winter of 1980, January perhaps, I just got off work at 9:30 P.M. from the auto dealership. I was a car salesman at the time. I started driving towards the city of Toronto, Canada, on the QEW (Queen Elizabeth Way) eastbound to meet some friends at a bar on the Esplanad (a street lined with nightclubs). I didn&apos;t have anything to drink and didn&apos;t smoke any pot on that day/evening. As I was driving, I noticed a string of lights slowly rotating counter clockwise over the city of Toronto, at about the ten o&apos;clock position from my point of view. This caught my eye because these formation of lights were very unusual. The lights were evidently in a circular pattern with about two thirds visible as the other third rotated out of view. Imagine a pie plate with about 25 lights around the circumference of it. As this &quot;pie plate&quot; would revolve, a third of these lights would be hidden from view as if they were obstructed by a solid body. It was at night so all I could see was these rotating string of lights but they were definitely on a &quot;fixed&quot; platform as the lights were revolving in unison. Although I&apos;ve heard of UFO&apos;s and was curious, at that time in my life, I didn&apos;t really give that much thought about them. I&apos;ve always been interested in nature and especially about the universe. I&apos;ve seen all kinds of aircraft and advertising blimps at night before. I drove taxi&apos;s off and on for fifteen years on the night shift and have seen countless meteors, lightening, satellites etc. On two occasions I&apos;ve even seen extremely bright, slow falling, green fireball meteors lighting up the ground, for a couple of seconds, as if it was daylight . I&apos;ve read, in later years, were other witnesses reported green fireballs as UFO&apos;s. I chuckled to myself thinking how easily &quot;UFO believers&quot; can be fooled by natural phenomenon. Anyway, these circle of lights were slowly descending and approaching towards me (westbound), while I was driving about 115 kilometres per hour on the highway eastbound. These lights were getting closer and closer as &quot;we&quot; approached each other. I recall thinking to myself that this must be some kind of advertising balloon and those lights were letters. As I kept driving, I was paying more and more attention to this object because the closer it was getting, the more unusual it looked. I kept glancing at it, while driving, waiting until it was close enough to read what these letters were saying, still thinking it was some kind of advertising blimp. The closer it got, the more I looked at it. Now at my nine o&apos;clock position, the string of rotating lights started to bank left like an airplane would &quot;turning right&quot; At this point, I realised that these lights were not letters at all. They were different shaped, yellowish white lights. The reason these lights were different in shape was because they were &quot;ingrained&quot; into some body. When the lights were seen head on, they were circular. But as they rotated out of &quot;direct&quot; view, they changed shape like the different crescents of the moon. That&apos;s why they appeared to be all different shapes. Anyway, during the time when this object started to bank left, from my point of view, I was struggling with myself trying to understand whether this was a plane or a balloon. It was flying too slow for a plane, yet, too fast for a blimp. Also, it didn&apos;t appear to be flying or floating. The best way I can describe it&apos;s motion is that it looked like it was &quot;sailing&quot; in the sky. What&apos;s interesting here is that the human brain tries to associate what the eyes are seeing, to something already seen or experienced before. That&apos;s why I was at war with myself trying to decide whether this object was a plane, blimp or a balloon. Every time I resigned myself to what I must be witnessing, I jumped to another conclusion. This jumping from one conclusion to another occurred during the whole experience. I was imagining all kinds of things. For example, if it was a plane, the only way these lights could have been positioned was in a circle because this plane must have had some kind of supporting structure in a circle from wing tip to wing tip. This didn&apos;t make any sense at all. I&apos;ve seen advertising planes before. This was nothing like this. Not even close. Than I was trying to imagine a &quot;Goodyear blimp&quot; with these letters going across it&apos;s side. This was nothing like it either. So here I was, trying to drive and watch this object at the same time. As I was driving, I started to slow down because I kept looking at this circle of lights more than the road ahead of me. In retrospect, I don&apos;t even know how I kept my car on the road because I was so awed by this display in the sky. Here is the killer. As the object kept banking and banking more and more, it eventually ended up totally perpendicular to the ground! The first thing that came to mind was a big ferris wheel rotating in the sky. At this point I slowed down to about 50 KPH (30 miles an hour in a 60 MPH highway for my American friends) and put my four way, flashing hazard lights on my car fearing that another car would smash into the back of me for going so slow on a 100 KPH highway. Here is the shocker. As I was mesmerised by this UFO, a surge of adrenaline hit me like a ton of bricks. I didn&apos;t realize how BIG this thing was. At first I thought it was the size of an airplane fairly close. IT WAS GIGANTIC! At least twice the size of a football field, bigger than an aircraft carrier!!! I don&apos;t know what gave away it&apos;s size. Maybe the reflections of light on the ground. The best way I can relate this sudden realization is like one of those illusions most of us have seen. You know, when you look at a pixel drawing with an image you can&apos;t see until you stare at it for a while? After a period of time, you make out the face of a women or something like that? That&apos;s kind of the transformation I experienced. At first I thought the object was the size of a large plane than suddenly I REALLY saw it. IT WAS HUGE!!! I yelled out loud to my self, &quot;HOLEY F**K, IT&apos;S HUGE!!!&quot;. I DON&apos;T F***ING BELIEVE IT, IT&apos;S F***ING HUGE!!!. I thought it was fairly close at first, than bang!, it was much farther away and larger than my brain first comprehended it. Speaking about this surge of adrenaline. Have you ever had a really close call having a car accident? When your heart rate skyrockets to about 180 beats per minute? That&apos;s what I felt when I realised how GARGANTUAN this object was! I could literally feel my heart pounding like crazy. To be frank, It literally scared the hell out of me, when I realized how big it was. At this point, I rolled down my window and pointed to this giant &quot;ferris wheel&quot; in the sky to the other motorists, but it appeared no one seemed to notice as they screamed by me at regular highway speeds. I remember how cold it was when I rolled down my window. It was something like minus 30 Celsius below zero. After, I don&apos;t know how long, probably only a few seconds of rotating in this perpendicular position, this thing started to climb and right itself and &quot;sail&quot; back to the direction it originally came from. I rolled up my window, turned off my hazard lights, and started to speed up to chase it. Still it seemed other motorists didn&apos;t notice this object. It still irks me to this day. As I was approaching the city limits, this object was in it&apos;s flat position again climbing over the city. Then, all of a sudden, the rotating lights turned off except for a red &quot;aircraft like&quot; blinking light (which I never noticed before). After a few seconds, the rotating lights turned on again. It was like in the movie &quot;Close Encounters Of The Third Kind&quot;. The lights just blasted on. Than after a few seconds they turned off again as it seemed to be right over the city. Strange behaviour. Now I was exiting off of the highway on to Spadina Rd. I lost track of these lights because of the tall buildings. When I was on the street where I was going, I saw a cop parked on the other side of the road writing a parking ticked. I stopped in the middle of the road and ran over to him. He was quite taken aback by my seemingly aggressive approach. I asked him, &quot;how long have you been here?&quot; I forgot what he said, but I asked, &quot;did you see that big circle of lights flying in the sky? He said &quot;no&quot;. After parking my car, I met my friends at the bar, &quot;Baily&apos;s&quot;, and told them what happened but they didn&apos;t take me seriously as they&apos;ve already had a few and were more interested in the ladies. After &quot;sitting at the bar by myself&quot; for a couple of hours I went home. I was living at my parent&apos;s house at the time, temporarily, so when I got home around 1 A.M., I called the police. I didn&apos;t know who else to phone at the time. They didn&apos;t take me seriously of course so after that, I phoned the Toronto International Airport and managed to get through to Air Traffic Control and asked them if they had anyone call in with a UFO report. Nothing. So I called the police again and convinced them to take me seriously as I wanted to make a report. They told me they can send a couple of officers to my house. As it was late and my parents were asleep, I told them I&apos;d rather come to the station the next day to report. Next morning, when I contemplated going in I decided not to, fearing they would think I&apos;m some kind of wacko. As the days went by, scanning the newspapers looking for a &quot;UFO sighting&quot; to no avail, I started doubting myself. I was trying to convince myself that perhaps I was somehow mistaken. Maybe it was something not out of the ordinary at all. Maybe it was a balloon or airplane of some kind. Maybe like thousands of others, I witnessed something that I misinterpreted for something else. And now the conclusion. About a week or so later, on or about the tenth page of the Toronto Star, bottom right hand corner, there it was! A short article. &quot;Dozens of Mississauga residents reported a UFO as big as a football field!!!&quot; I don&apos;t recall the whole article. I&apos;ll never doubt myself again no matter how much ridicule I&apos;ll be subjected to. After about 27 years, I just had to let this out.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "Black Triangle shaped craft with 3 lights on the bottom.

It was a bright light with a long flaming tail.  It kept moving in all directions randomly and sometimes it would &quot;burn out&quot; to a dim blinking (like a normal airplane).  After it continued for over a minute I called my 4 year old daughter to come see.  She thought it was fireworks.  We watched and the &quot;tail sparks&quot; turned into circular lights and glowed red at times and green.

I observed it fly across the entire sky, from my point of view the object seemed to be two hundred feet long at least. I have taken several astronomy classes and have a background in the physical sciences. I am very skeptical by nature, I am however, unable to explain this event.", "((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Sirius??  PD))Colorful, flashing spheres in the Chandler, AZ night skies on 10/05/07My sister has been observing what she called an object or colorful orb in the SE Chandler, AZ night sky for weeks now.  Each night she observed this through binoculars &amp; the object appeared like flashing red, blue, green &amp; white lights &amp; even honeycomb shapes appeared on this object. On various nights this object could be seen in the NE &amp; S Chandler, AZ sky.Tonight, Friday, Oct. 5th, 2007 at approx. 9:15 pm we saw the object from my house in Chandler in the due north sky. This object is definitely not a star as we&rsquo;ve never seen or heard of stars being colorful or that move. Our planet doesn&rsquo;t rotate that quickly. We observed this object with both binoculars &amp; a telescope. We noticed the object was moving rather slowly but on a due east course tonight. The colors were absolutely brilliant &amp; something none of us have ever seen before. Not only was it colorful &amp; sphere-shaped but it seemed to rotate, spin, &amp; turn sideways. It also would move just enough for us to lose sight of it from our telescope without us moving the tripod. We wanted to know what this thing was, so we came in to look up anything we could find on the internet that might relate to this object being seen by others &amp; we found nothing. At 12:15 am we went back out to see just how much further this object had moved, when we were amazed by the fact that not only had this object moved further east, but there were two additional objects exactly the same as the one we&rsquo;d been following all night in a perfect triangular formation. They were not there prior to the earlier observation! We observed all three of them &amp; all were exactly the same. One might say that they were hovering, but you could see them move slightly &amp; yet all remained in perfect triangular formation. We really got a little freaked out, besides being cold &amp; we came back in again. So this was going on for over 3 hours &amp; then some! They are still out there very visible even now. Has anyone else seen anything like this before, or know what is going on in our skies?    Inquiring sisters want to know Chandler, AZ", "A small metalic hourglass shaped object slowly rotating and hovering parallel to phone lines and highwayMy wife and I were driving north on highway 95 near Tensed when we both spotted a small hovering object along the side of the road. The object was no more then 3 to 4 feet across, and vaguely shaped like an hourglass on it&rsquo;s side. It was slowly rotating and hovering parallel to the phone lines next to the highway. It was metallic with silver and red patches on it. It was hard to tell if it was making any sound because the car windows were rolled up, but no sound was heard through the windows over the sound of the car engine. It was moving at about walking speed but its rotation and movements were extremely regular. We only saw it for a few seconds before we passed it in the car. It was such an odd sight that we have a hard time remembering exact details. On later reflection, we both thought it was odd that we didn&rsquo;t stop the car to take a closer look, or to take pictures.", "10/26/07..Philadelphia.Pa..Oval..Silvery..about 200&apos; long, in the Eastern Sky..I was taking some Photos with my digital for an Appraisal Consideration.of a  house...when some children, playing, pointed to the sky and  yelled,,,Look At That..( I did&apos;nt get their names).The kids ran to the next street...trying to follow it....I began to photograph the image...took seven digital shots of it,,,very clear..I would guess that it was about 5000 feet up...as high as a Plane getting ready to land..it was going rather slow..and made no noise...it took about a minute for it to travel about 30 degrees across the sky..I then lost track of it due to trees and houses..I did nothing with this,,because I want the right people to use this,,,Not Cover Up Artist....Photo&apos;s dont lie..I would guess that its the size of a medium sized plane,,,just a guess", "Two Disks or Saucers seen gliding side by side before doing some acrobatic maneuvers.It was around 5:20pm when I was leaving work to go home. As I was going around toward the driver&apos;s side of my car, I happened to look upward at the sky. It was then that I saw two round disks or saucer shaped objects gliding through the air side by side. They did not move any faster than if you were watching a bird fly against the wind. They appeared to be very dark in color, not reflecting any light from the sun which was now setting at the horizon. The two disks were gliding side by side with only what seemed like a yard or two of space apart. They glided over the two story building that I worked at, traveling west to east making no audible noise that I could hear over the sound of traffic nearby. I was trying hard to make some sense of what I was seeing. Not birds...not balloons...certainly not any conventional airplanes. Perhaps, they were very large round kites that got away from someone who was testing them out. But, there was hardly any wind at all. What is keeping them a float and moving along steady without much wind, I thought.  Satisfied with the idea of some new kite invention that went astray, I unlocked and opened my car door. Before getting in, I looked upward once more just in time to see the two disk shaped objects begin tumbling through the air and then occasionally spinning around each other at a very rapid rate of acceleration and then in opposite directions. Obviously, this was a complete shock. Despite the crazy tumbling and rapid acceleration of spining around each other, the disks avoided a collision as though there was some kind of invisible force field that kept them from hitting each other. ALL the while, they still maintained a steady course in an easterly direction.This sighting took place in no more than one minute before it passed out of view behind nearby trees. I would put the height of these objects at the same height you would see most small planes fly. I would give my best judgement that the diameter of these twin disk if at ground level could have been between 9 to 11 feet.The last few seconds of this sighting convinced me that these objects were controled by some kind of advanced technology, because of the unusual accelerations and manuvers of the objects. Possibly, a new generation of nerds working on a special project for a start up company may be behind this. Time will tell!", "((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the source of the report, MUFON/Ohio, for sharing the report with our Center!  PD))Nine spherical UFO&apos;s in the night sky; one came close to scan me!My Sightings  I have had a number of sightings at home and on my property.  I live in a rural area where, for some reason, just about anything can happen.  The sighting I am writing to you about is a fantastic one, although there have been some other pretty incredible sightings.It started one evening on the 2nd of March, 2005. I was walking my cat down to our garage to put her in out of the cold, when all of a sudden, to the left of my view, I saw 7 spherical UFO&rsquo;s flying through the sky. They zoomed into view. They were pale white, filmy sort of objects with a little dark dot in the center. As I watched I was treated to a dancing display of lights, which left me dumbfounded. During the dance, the two smaller white spheres dropped out of the two larger UFO&rsquo;s, and began to zip around in the sky, darting every which way. The two smaller discs then joined back up with the larger UFO&rsquo;s almost as if they were being absorbed into these larger objects. These smaller discs were white and filmy too but with no dot in the center of them. It was as if they were smaller ships, or something, that seemed to scout around even more quickly than the bigger objects. They looked like orbs of light or similar to that. The group continued on, but hovered in the middle of the sky. I was so excited! I had just made a decision about a year before to start looking up at the sky for UFO&rsquo;s. I had only looked up, maybe, twice, that year, for a minute or two; it wasn&rsquo;t anything serious, so when I saw these objects I knew exactly what they were. I had read about UFO&rsquo;s, and how some of them looked, and behaved; there was no mistaking it, this was what I had read about.I quickly ran over to my drive at the gate to get a better look, then to my husband&rsquo;s shop to get my cameras. I had two cameras - unfortunately, only one was fully loaded (as I found out later), but I managed to get a couple of shots. I told myself (inside my head) that I wanted these UFO&rsquo;s to come closer, so that I could get a good photograph. No one would believe the picture that I would get, at this distance. While the second I said that, one of the UFO&rsquo;s started over! It heard me! It had heard what I had said in my own mind; that means they are telepathic! As the object came closer, I panicked and started to run. I had heard and read about what could happen to you if you got too close to a UFO &ndash; you know, burns and radiation &ndash; so I didn&rsquo;t need that. So, I ran. As I ran this object stopped in mid-stream and started back toward the group. &hellip;I stopped and went back to the gate with my cameras in-hand, actually one was strapped around my neck and started to snap pictures of these UFO&rsquo;s, when I realized I couldn&rsquo;t get the flash to work (on my digital camera). Over and over, again, I snapped the picture with no luck. I quickly went to camera B. It worked fine, it was my 35 mm camera.  I got pictures of these objects, or at least, I hoped  I had; it was dark and they were up in the sky and you know how that looks on film. So, I said it again, &ldquo;Please come over so I can take your picture.&rdquo; And, again just as I said that, the UFO started to travel over&hellip;.I was so excited, but I started to run again to my house. I just couldn&rsquo;t stop myself. The UFO kept coming and I kept running, looking up as often as I could. Just as I was approaching the house a white flash went off&hellip;with the sound of a click. I thought, &ldquo;Oh, my camera is working now or they have somehow activated my camera.&rdquo; I kept running. As I came to my house, I took another look&hellip;this object looked like a star traveling pretty fast; it was white with a fiery motion to it, all ablaze in white with a pale yellow front to it. The pale yellow was at the beginn! ing of t he object. Then as I looked - before I was near to the house - I saw the object stand stationary in the sky &ndash; about 15 feet from me and 30 feet in the air. It was in semi-darkness, with light and shadow playing upon it, I could barely make out the shape. It wasn&rsquo;t circular anymore but looked to be sort of crescent-shaped. &hellip;I don&rsquo;t know, I couldn&rsquo;t really tell. Something was rotating&hellip; it kept rotating. Then all of a sudden, a slender milky white arm slinked down from it, about 15 feet down from the object. You know what I mean, like a spider drops down from its web (that sort of motion and look). And it was translucent, gossamer-like, with a curly-cue tail on the end of it. The very last look I got before I dashed into the house, was when I looked up and saw a milky white sphere on the end of the thing. As I was running, it must of appeared somehow on the bottom of the arm. It was attached to this arm. The sphere was see-through, too, similar to the arm. This UFO star-like thing seemed to be in the material world and the arm and sphere seemed to be in another dimension. This was like a science fiction movie.  I couldn&rsquo;t believe it!  I felt like I was being scanned. I was being scanned by this sphere, and my only thought was ... &ldquo;I feel so primitive.&rdquo; I ran into the house and didn&rsquo;t come back out or look out the windows the rest of the evening. I can tell you that I had had a real earth shattering experience; things will never be the same for me. I still look up at the sky, every night, wishing and hoping to see these UFO&rsquo;s.A month or so later my husband and I had another visit but this time from a red/orange (circular) UFO. We actually got a photograph of it!((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The object was all black and made no noise as it just hovered there.  It was also a very windy night and as we were driving down the highway when we first saw the craft it was swaying back and forth but as we drove under the craft it was as still as can be.  This incident lasted only one to two minutes and after we passed under the craft and I looked back to see if it was still there it was gone.  Where we seen this UFO was right outside of town in a semi populated area I don&rsquo;t think there were any other witnesses because the only other car was my mom and she was on the cell phone and did not see it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Shortly after 2 p.m., people across the Twin Cities reported seeing a &quot;metallic&quot; object or &quot;flaming ball&quot; falling from the sky. Broadcasters and emergency dispatchers got hundreds of calls from people who saw the object traveling from the northeast to the southwest. The FAA received no reports of anything falling from any airplanes in the area, leading to speculation that it was a meteor that burned up in the atmosphere, since no crash site has been identified. Residents of Lyon County in far southwestern Minnesota reported a loud boom that might have been connected with the sightings in the Twin Cities. Navy reservist Greg Devereaux, who lives near the town of Amiret, says it shook his house and sounded like a sonic boom from an F-14 breaking the sound barrier at close range.", "It had Smaller Orange/Red colored V&apos;s outlining the main wedge shape.

The Center of the object seemed transparent but the speed and silence of it was unreal. To this day my roommate still thinks im a kook but I swear I saw it. The factors he threw in my face were it was late summer and the Canadian geese were Taking off before the cold hit...My argument to that was they go South for the winter not North and they make a whack  of noise when they are flying around. Not a single sound of a turbine or anything that you would normally identify an airplane with, If you think im kidding..Whatever but so far in my life my eyes havent failed me yet.

As I looked at it, it seemed to be about &frac34; of a mile to a mile away. It moved up and then down and then back and diagonally very quickly and then stopped abruptly to hover.  As it hovered it was swinging slightly from right to left, then it crossed the sky towards the east very slowly emitting a white light.  No plane or helicopter I know of moves that way.

So she tells me that on Saturday evening she was coming home after visiting my folks. She was traveling east and she when topped the hill on 80th  near the police station in Cottage Grove. She notices a saucer shaped object hovering  over the houses off to the right or south. I questioned her about that part because there is a water tower about a &frac14; mile east and south  of the police station, but she said she could clearly see the water tower and the ufo was closer to her and further south a little. She said she watched it til she came abreast of it and continued on towards home feeling spooked and not wanting to stop with our three kids sleeping in the back seat. When she got to keats ave about a mile or so further east she did stop the car and got out to look at it, as it was still in approximately the same position. So she had watched it for about 5 minutes and was as close to it as a half a city block. So our kids are grown up and married and my oldest girl and her husband were over for supper one night many years later.

My wife describes it as about 30-40 ft in diameter and about 8-10 ft tall at the center, she says this because she thought that it was as wide as the houses under it.

Each light seemed approximately as big as 10 stars put together. If I took a quarter and stretched my hand toward the lights, I would cover them with the quarter. The lights were hanging in the air for a few seconds, and then with a fraction of a second they jumped over the freeway (approximately one mile) and started rapidly approaching as. As they moved, we saw that they changed colors (I saw one white color changed to red; however, we could not agree the exact colors).  Then, they froze in the air for a few seconds and jumped back where they came from. Then the lights started slowly twisting around one light and formed a triangle that looked like a starched V (if you connect the dots, it would look like a long arch). Then the lights flipped over and started rapidly moving away to the fields. The altitude was so low, that they would hide behind the trees a few times. Finally, the lights faded away.The whole scene lasted for about 40 seconds. The night was clear (we observed lots of stars). There was no sound (except the sounds of highway). It was no hallucination, because we all described the scene in almost the same words (I talked to each family member privately after we came back home). Also, I looked this place up in the map and I found out there was so called Crow Landing Field not far from where it happened. Two weeks later I called the Modesto County Police Department and local newspaper, but there were no reports about such thing.", "As I pulled out of a gas station, I saw a UFO hover over me.I was pulling out of the gas station and turning on to the main road headed to work.

The lights were circular and appeared to be on each ends of the chevron shape. Then in the middle i noticed a red light not as big as the other light I would say about half the size of the other light which appeared to be about the same size as the wing.For a minute i thought maybe it is a plane or maybe it&apos;s just a helicopter so i rolled the window down but no noise. Certainly if it was one the 2 aircrafts i would hear something. Then I noticed it was flying way too slow to be an airplane or helicopter. It almost seemed as it was hovering over but it was moving.I drove under it and lost sight then I looked in the mirror to see it because I was still coming to grasp with what I saw. But when I looked in the mirror I didn&apos;t see it. I thought maybe the angle I was at didn&apos;t allow me to see so I turned the car around, and to my suprise it was gone completely from the sky.

One was always brighter than the other, and when one got brighter, the other dimmed. This happened again and again, but not flashing, more like pulsing, the lights never quite disappearing.I told my husband to pull over so we could have a better look.  About a minute later, I couldn&apos;t find it in the sky, and realized it had jumped quite a distance from the west to the east, but I never saw it move.

My son and I were returning from a Houston Astros baseball game the evening of Sept. 28, 2007.  We were traveling north on U.S. 59, and at approximately 11:00 - 11:15 p.m. as we neared Humble, both of us observed a flying object that surprised us regarding how the object looked and the apparent speed of travel.  We observed it somewhere between Jetero Blvd. And FM 1960. The object was traveling on a heading of about 45 degrees, and appeared to be at a fairly low altitude, and also appeared to be losing altitude.  The object was bright and appeared to be streaming material behind (my son thought it might have been on fire).  We drive this freeway often and see planes crossing overhead the freeway (east-west) all the time on final approach to Bush Intl airport.  What primarily caught our attention was the speed, direction and altitude of the object.  We watched it continue in a northeast direction, until it either got too low to see or disappeared over the horizon.  Afterward, we were very confused about where the object went and thought perhaps it just appeared close but was actually a meteorite burning up in the atmosphere much further away.

I was a teacher in a small school and rented a house there.One morning I woke up for school.  I can&rsquo;t remember exactly which time it was , but I know it was between 6:30 and 7:10 AM there.  It was still dark.  I stepped outside to walk to the outhouse in my backyard and as I did so I happened to look up in the sky and  noticed something that seemed out of place there.It was a green ball of light, moving slowly in all directions (up and down, right and left).  It wasn&rsquo;t just an insignificant spec in the sky but big and bright enough to have a true presence there.  I knew immediately that it wasn&rsquo;t a shooting star, an airplane, a satellite, or a meteor because I had seen those things before and knew how they moved.  This object moved deliberately, covering wide distances in the sky in only seconds, as if somebody were moving a laser pointer dot all around on a blackboard.  Then it sped away and disappeared.That day I went to school and told colleagues about it.  These were Uzbek nationals.  One friend, a young woman my age who was my counterpart, was skeptical and treated me like I was crazy while my director told me had seen something similar years before.  I also told another friend whom I didn&rsquo;t work with-- a young female teacher at a nursery school.The next morning I woke up again around the same time and just like the morning before I stepped into my backyard on my way to outhouse and saw it again.  This time for only a split second before it sped away.Later that week the nursery school teacher I had told my story to told me that she had seen the same thing while outside at her house, only late in PM hours.Months passed.  Later, in the Spring, my counterpart at school who had treated me like I was crazy when I told her my story apologized to me one day, and told me that she and her family had all witnessed the same object in the sky over the weekend, late at night.  Her sighting took place for an extended period of time and witnessed by more than at least three people  I have no opinion as to what this object was, only that it wasn&rsquo;t normal and that it was definitely worth reporting.

Soon enough it actually flew over the restaurant, and I was dumbfounded and in disbelief at what I saw. It was a rather large, silvery metal saucer, and the flashing [white] lights were on the outer rim of the saucer.

While traveling north on Scott Blvd, my S.O. pointed to the 4:00 position, as viewed through the front windshield and said, &ldquo;Is that a UFO.&rdquo;  It seemed to be approximately &frac14; mile or less from our position and moving very slowly (drifting) to the west, very low, less than a 1000 ft. altitude.  I have been an aviation buff my entire life and have observed anything that flies at one time or another in all types of conditions.  This was close and strange, no sound, appeared spherical (i.e. best guess 60 &ndash; 80 ft. diameter), flat metal or gray color and four small lights, my S.O. reported that the lights changed at one point, however, they all appeared red to me, which was my first clue that this was something odd (i.e. not standard aircraft lights.)  I attempted to follow the craft, as I was in somewhat in shock, I was actually looking at something I couldn&rsquo;t ID.  I attempted to follow it as it drifted west, I turned off of Scott into a neighborhood trying to follow it, but it eventually drifted behind a tree line.  I then thought I would try to get on highway 70 west in hopes of seeing the object out in the open, however, it took a few minutes to get to 70 and it was just gone.   My fianc&eacute;e previously adamantly disbelieved in the possibility of UFO&rsquo;s, in fact she made fun of my interest frequently.  However, as I was driving and trying not to wreck the car, she got a better look than I did and couldn&rsquo;t deny what she saw, she was actually sick after the event and somewhat in shock.  We were both sick, as we couldn&rsquo;t believe what just happened.  Extensive vehicle traffic was present, I expected people to be parked and watching the object, however, the traffic just kept flowing.  Other people had to have seen this, we just don&rsquo;t want to ask anyone because we both work in a professional field.  I know I saw something I couldn&rsquo;t ID, I want to know if other people saw it.  Even though we both saw it, both of us h! ave some fear that we are crazy, neither of us slept last night, things were just strange.  I always had hoped I would see a UFO,  but driving home from a baseball game, in the middle of traffic and in a populated area, it caught us completely off guard.  I desperately want to talk to someone about it, we both still feel a little sick.  As the event happened last night and I missed part of the local news, I don&rsquo;t know if it is in the Columbia News or paper, I will monitor throughout the day. Additional note:   Before the event I was at a little league baseball game on Scott Blvd, a mile or so from our UFO event.  At 5:50p.m. approximately, a C130 flew over the field fairly low, maybe 3000 ft. or less.  My S.O. asked me to ID the plane, I told her, she said , &ldquo;why is a military plane flying so low.&rdquo;  I didn&rsquo;t think it was anything strange until after the event she mentioned the C130 again, might be nothing, but just wanted to include.  Also, as I was driving, frantic, trying to watch the UFO, it&rsquo;s possible my directions are off, but I did review a map of the area after the event and I do believe the UFO was drifting to the west.

It did not go behind a cloud.  From this, I gathered that it was a reflected light and the object dimmed as it moved into the earth&apos;s shadow.

The object was moving from SSE to NNW, almost directly overhead when I began observing it.  It moved in a straight line at a constant speed and didn&rsquo;t do anything tricky.I watched it for approximately 20-30 seconds.It was completely silent ...that is, I could hear nothing coming from it.  There was some road noise from El Dorado, which was close by, but jets that were flying at a much higher altitude (apparent altitude &ndash; see below) could easily be heard over the few cars that were passing, and when there  was no traffic I strained to hear something coming from the object but could not.It had an angular width of, I am estimating, 2 or 3 knuckles on my fist held at arm&rsquo;s length.  I am aware that people overestimate the both the actual and apparent size of things they see in the sky and it is not impossible that its angular width may be less than that.  But it was not tiny in appearance &ndash; it extended over enough of the sky that it was plainly visible.I am not certain of the shape of the object, but I had the impression at the time that it was chevron-shaped and heading in the direction of the pointy part &ndash; like an old Northrup Flying Wing, but more angled than that.  I may be imagining its shape.  I have seen reports of triangle-shaped UFOs, and that is not out of the question.  The sky was dark but not completely black, and because of the light pollution of the DFW area there is not a highly populated starfield in any direction, but there was plainly some kind of silhouette that blocked out the sky and the few stars behind it as it moved through the sky.What I am certain of is that the object exhibited a series of orange disks in a shallow V shape (as though along the leading edge of the chevron), perhaps 6-8 down each arm.  They were distinctive but their &ldquo;glow&rdquo; was so dull that I am speculating that they were not self-lit but were reflectors picking up the lights from the ball fields.  Their round shape was very clear and not fuzzy or sparkling, as might have been the case if they were lit up.  The lights were very dull; I would never have noticed them if I weren&rsquo;t looking right at the object when it came into my field of vision.  The lights were not moving around &ndash; they were apparently affixed to whatever was moving through the sky.There were no flashing lights or other typical aircraft running lights on this object.Size and height:  Very hard to say.  Any estimate is complicated by the lack of any points of reference.  In fact, even if there had been buildings or trees in the field of view it would not have made much difference because there was no auditory cue to distance.  That there was no audible sound coming from the object suggests great height.  The orange disks were, although not bright, very distinctive and clearly circular, with hard edges.  And the object was had a fair angular diameter, which suggests closeness.  So either the thing was far away and enormous, or closer and smaller.  Put another way, It had a much greater angular width than the numerous jets that are approaching DFW and that were flying over Frisco at that time, so if it was flying at that height it was very large.  My unsupported &ldquo;feeling,&rdquo; however, was that it was not flying that high; the clarity of the shape and outline of the two rows of disks suggests that it was not at a great height, but neither was it anywhere close to the ground or nearby treetops.I&rsquo;m not sure how it disappeared, except that it did not speed out of sight.  It just kind of winked off (although not so abrupt as a winking), as though it had gone into a cloud bank (but the sky was cloudless).  This would be consistent with my speculation that the dull orange disks were reflectors, and that the angle between the object and the lights of the ballfields had become such that they no longer reflected my way.  I will say that the reflection theory suffers from the fact that I was generally between the field lights and the object, which was moving away from the field, so there was no angle-of-incidence = angle-of-reflection thing going on if the reflector were just a flat surface.  If the disks were reflectors, they were complex enough to pick up the field lights and reflect them slightly backwards towards me.  And they could have been picking up the many other light sources of Frisco.If I had to make a guess as to a terrestrial origin of this thing, it would be a large private aircraft flying at medium altitude with an engine quiet enough to blend in with the noises of the night at that height, with reflectors on the underside of its wings.  Not a blimp.Thank you for the opportunity to make this report.", "A metal disk &apos;blinking&apos; moving up and down.LOoking off a friend&apos;s deck we saw a metal disk with a blinking light floting up and down for about a hour.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

At first, I thought they might be Orion&apos;s belt, but it occured to me that they were too bright, too far apart, and in the wrong part of the sky to be those three stars. I watched the three strange lights for about 3 or 4 minutes. I got the impression that these lights were quite low to the ground and closer than I had previously thought. In a blink of an eye, the three lights formed a triangular pattern and began to move in perfect unison to the west towards the Prescott National Forest.  The triangle it formed blocked out the stars like a big black shadow.  Within seconds, the lights had disappeared.  I looked around the sky and recognized several jets darting about in the area where the lights had been.", "Stationary twinkling lights .At around 10 pm while taking my dogs out before going to bed I noticed an unusual &ldquo;star&rdquo; in the northeast. It was flickering red and green lights and was unlike any other stars in the sky. I called for my husband to come and see and he was just as perplexed as I. We watched it for 30 to 45 minutes and it did not move. I used a pair of binoculars and got a good view of the lights but couldn&rsquo;t make out a shape. I will be purchasing a telescope or stronger binoculars very soon. The next night I looked to see if it could&rsquo;ve been some type of tower or something that I had never noticed before. There was nothing there.A few years ago I posted a sighting that happened many years ago in 1975 in another state. Because of that sighting I became very watchful of the night sky. My husband on the other hand has always been a skeptic but even he said the lights in the sky couldn&rsquo;t have been a plane because they were in one spot for so long. He is becoming more interested.I am a factory worker and my husband is a truck driver locally for a major carrier. I have 2 grown sons.

The formation was about one hands worth of area if you helf your hand up to the sky. The red lights were a vibrant red, changing from a intense white/red to a red glow to no light. The lights were not in sync and seemed to be inconsistant in their flashes. The lights were moving towards the pacific ocean at a moderate to high speed. There was no noise what so ever even though the lights passed directly over my head.  The formation seemed to be very tight with no specific shape or leader.

However, we were lucid enough that I would have felt comfortable going out into public without fear.  We were teenagers at the time (ages 19-20), and I am now a responsible adult (an Air Force veteran and a college graduate). With that being said, here&apos;s my account of what happened.  The three of us (I am female, my two friends were male) were standing around in my friend&apos;s driveway talking while I was smoking a cigarette.  The area we lived in was VERY rural.  I will refer the friend who lived on this property as W2 from this point forward.  W2&apos;s home was on a dirt road that ran for approximately ten miles.  The road housed approximately twenty homes, most of the land was used for either corn farming or growing pine trees for a local paper mill.  A river runs paralell to most of the road, the river lies approximately 1.5 miles north of W2&apos;s home which faced north. While talking, I noticed three bright green beams of light that originated to the north, almost directly in front of us.  I would estimate that their origin was somewhere between W2&apos;s house and the river that I discussed previously.  If they were any further north, it couldn&apos;t have been by much.  Also, the area past the river is more populated (relatively speaking), and there is a mountain there.  If the lights had originated in this area, they would have appeared more elevated than they did. I noticed the lights, and attempted to ignore them for fear that it was some sort of mild hallucination.  However, a few minutes passed and our conversation fell dead silent.  It was at this point that W2 stopped and asked &quot;Okay, what the hell is that?  Do ya&apos;ll see it?&quot;  At this point, myself and W3 responded that we did. Once we established that all three of us were seeing it, we discussed it for the rest of the duration we were outside (maybe three more minutes, we watched the lights for abotu ten minutes total).  The lights looked like the spotlights that are used at business openings, except there were three of them and they were very bright green.  The middle  light was pointing straight up, and the other two lights flanked the middle light at perfectly matching approximate 30 degree angles.  The lights never moved.  We were spooked at this point, and went in the house. These lights could have been the powerful lights used by hunters, except I can not imagine one of those lights being that bright from such a distance.  Also, these lights were green and at perfect angles to each other.  Using spotlights to hunt deer is illegal, and I can&apos;t imagine any hunter wanting to draw such attention to his illegal deer hunting. Please note that the date and time given is approximate.  I know that it was in the late summer of 1999, and I know that it was after dark but before midnight when it happened (we didn&apos;t stay over at my friend&apos;s house past midnight).", "Four  bright lights over Atlantic Ocean flying in rectangle formation, changed to orange cones then orangle cirlces with black core.Gazing into a black sky over the Atlanta Ocean from our condominium balcony.4 extremely bright lights flying in a rectangle formation with a light at the corner of each &quot;point&quot; of the rectangle.  Then, to our amazement each of the four lights turned into &quot;orange&quot; cone and appeared suspended.

There was in no regular pattern between the colour changes; both in time between changes and the actual colour changed to. Object appeared close to the horizon but distance was impossible to tell &ndash; aside from it being very distant (5km or more).

To give you a timeline it was about 2 minutes total: [10sec] ball bounced right to left, [45sec] still sky, [10sec] ball circled and shot into sky, [45sec] still sky, [10sec] ball bounced left to right.  Also I&rsquo;d like to add this event looked to be quite far out over the ocean and took place at night.  To give you a relative distance, look out over the ocean from the Outrigger Maui Eldorado property, measure the distance between edges of the beach that you can see and about &frac14; of that distance was the total distance the ball moved left to right, right to left, and left to right again.  I hope that&rsquo;s enough details, I looked online a bit to see if I could find a similar experience because I&rsquo;m not sure what it was, if it was a UFO or an energy source I have no way to explain the event in my head.  There isn&rsquo;t any way it could be a ball being thrown or a human craft, nothing could move as fast as it did and as far as it did, I&rsquo;ve compared ideas with my girlfriend as well and neither of us can think of anything that it could have been.  If anyone has a better explana! tion of what it could have been PLEASE let me know, I can&rsquo;t say I know 100% that it was a UFO but I know nothing on our planet at this time can move like that did in the air, and absolutely nothing man made could move that fast.

My brother who is the other witness is 19 years old.  I have seen UFO&apos;s before, but nothing like this.  It was about 7:15pm, the sun was down, but it was still a little light out. I was driving back home on 35W with my brother and I noticed a bright light in the sky. I&apos;m so used to seeing jets and airplanes around here, I know what they look like in the sky, but this light was much different. Well as we were getting closer to home I noticed another light, then a couple seconds later another one appeared and I noticed they all formed a weird triangle formation. Well trees got in the way and I couldn&apos;t see the UFO&apos;s any more. Well about ten minutes later my jaw just dropped to the floor, because I saw five lights all spaced out equally and they were in a slight V-shape formation. Right away I thought of the Phoenix Lights, because I do remember what they looked liked. Now I knew these had to be UFO&apos;s and I got all excited. I told my brother to look and I told him that there is no way that those are jets, because they were too close together. My brother was just as amazed as I was and he wanted to take some pictures, so we took our exit and went straight to this service road that brought us closer to the lights. We pulled in a parking lot since it was uphill and we could get a better view. I noticed two other lights as I pulled into the parking lot but they were not part of the formation. We got out of my car and I took a couple pictures with my cellphone. We were facing north and we could see Downtown Minneapolis from where we were.  The UFO&apos;s were hovering above or at least along the banks of the Minnesota River, it was hard to tell. The whole formation was about a mile across. That&apos;s my best guest. I noticed that there was one UFO that was brighter than the rest and it was right in the middle. The color was a very bright golden-white.  I could see three seperate lights from that UFO, but the lights were so bright it looked like one. The rest of the UF! O&apos;s were n&apos;t as bright as this one, but they were of the same color. The UFO&apos;s didn&apos;t move forward or backwards. They just stayed there for five minutes or so and then they moved up or down, but just a little bit. We watched them for about 20mins and the formation changed a couple of times. Then all of a sudden one UFO that was on end of the right side moved out of formation and was moving slowly toward us. On this UFO I could see that it also had about three lights. I almost thought it was a airplane because of it&apos;s size, but then the lights weren&apos;t flashing and it looked like a boomerang? My brother got scared thinking that we were going to get abducted by this UFO and he wanted me to drive out of there. We got back in the car and I drove back home. I wanted to go back there and take better pictures with my digital camera. We only live five minutes from the parking lot, so I figured we would have some time to see them again. I got the camera and we went back to the parking lot. Sure enough they were still there! The time was around 8pm and there were just four lights. Now the brightest of the UFO&apos;s, the one in the middle drifted off and did it&apos;s own thing for a minute or so and then it went back to the middle again. I used my camera to take some pictures, but it came out crappy. I also video taped it, but that didn&apos;t come out as nice either. After I felt I couldn&apos;t get any good pictures from where we were, I decided to drive closer. I went back to 35W going north and as I was crossing the Minnesota River I looked to my right and I could see the UFO that was once in the middle of the formation, the really bright UFO I mentioned before. Since I was closer to the UFO I could see that the color of the light was a super bright white, the brightest light I have ever seen in my life. The best way I can describe the brightness is that it was like stadium lights. It also was hovering very low near the river. To me it looked like it was searching for something, because it was so low. I later heard from my mom that some t! ime in t he afternoon some people around the Twin Cities reported a metallic or flaming ball in the sky and some reported hearing a loud boom. My other brother has told me that some UFO&apos;s appear during or after a meteor?? If anyone is interested in my story or would like to help me figure out how I could get my video and or pictures in better quality, please contact me! Thanks! P.S. The two pictures have not been messed with and they are small in size since I took them with my cell phone and as for the video, I used my digital camera. I hope to at least get the video in better quality.  P.S. The whole UFO event lasted about an hour and a half.  From about 7:15pm to 8:45pm.", "Moving planes, or stars -- STOP and just hang there, for over 20 minutesOn my way to a neighbourhood coffee shop, (which I do fairly regularly on Saturday mornings) I noticed the planet Venus, as I had seen for the past month.  Venus sat sort of low in the eastern sky.  As I walked, I noticed higher up in the eastern sky, lined up with Venus was what I believed to be 3 stars or distant planets.  I stared at them for a minute because I thought they looked so &ldquo;cool&rdquo; lined up like that.  Before I knew it the two (planets or stars) on either side of the middle object (planet, star, or whatever) started in unison moving away from it.  Then I said to myself &ldquo;Oh those must be jet planes.  They moved an one inch away (from my vantage point), then stopped.

My son and his girlfriend observed a large green soundless circular orb in the sky that moved slowly over the city then faded away. A friend of theirs across town called and reported seeing the same phenomenon that also coincided with a power outage at his location. The power was out about 45 seconds. There was some chatter today on local radio about this sighting. This is no hoax. Although some logical explanation may exist, my son can think of none that match his current scope of knowledge. He is 22 years of age and he and I are both skeptical yet fascinated by the possibility of &quot;visitors.&quot;  He informed me that this was the &quot;real deal&quot; and an incredible sighting of a very large craft.

One man noticed that some lights were moving peculiarly in the sky a short distance off. The party moved to where the lights could be observed more clearly. It appeared that the four moving lights made a boomerang arc and then met in the middle and disappeared briefly, then made another arc, in varying directions. They seemed to shine through the light cloud cover, and it was much past dusk. The lights moved west very slowly for about 15 minutes.  A poor quality video was recorded by a sober woman on a camera phone. The seven people got in vehicles to see if the neighbors were doing anything suspicious.  A helicopter or plane was spotted much farther away and lower than the lights, but it continued in a straight path. The helicopter or plane did not seem out of the ordinary. The red lights were standard. Down the road about an eighth of a mile from the residence the lights still moved persistently.  From the truck the same woman attempted to make another video, but all of the sudden the lights disappeared. They were a faint greenish-gray and oval shaped.

Not even 10 seconds later, it appeared miles (again i don&apos;t know the distance), from where I last saw it, but still very visual.  It emitted two orb like looking things that came from what I think were the sides, that shot out, and went directly up into the air.  I have absolutely no reason to believe that what I saw was commercial, nor was it military.  Proceeding, there were several what looked like jets scrambling towards it, and away from it.

To be honest my memory of this event is sketchy but I can tell you what I remember. It was either 1999 or 2000 within the first few months of the year.  I think it was February.  I was an undergraduate physics &amp; astronomy student with Central Michigan University and I was with a group of two other students and our instructor.  We were taking advantage of some time with the NURO telescope on Anderson Mesa near Flagstaff, AZ. One night we left our control room to go outside and look at the stars.  I don&rsquo;t remember what time it was unfortunately.  As we were standing there after a few minutes we noticed a &ldquo;V&rdquo; pattern of lights  flying in a counter-clockwise circular path that took it overhead, then to the north(toward Flagstaff),  toward the west at its other extent, south and then back up overhead.   This triangle was being trailed by a red light (not blinking) that was a good distance behind.  Too far behind to be attached to the tail of an airplane.  This red light was noticeable when we first took note of the formation but after 2 to 3 minutes it vanished while the formation was due west of us.  The triangular pattern continued its circle.  I do not recall the color of the V pattern lights. If memory serves me correctly I counted twenty lights, ten to each leg of the &ldquo;V&rdquo;.  I ran in and grabbed a pair of binoculars and upon viewing the lights while it was directly overhead  I  saw the silhouette of an airplane with wings swept back at an approximately 45 degree angle and the lights were on the leading edges of the wings.  The silhouette looked strange to me.  The wings were attached to the fuselage about 1/3 of the way forward from the tail with the &ldquo;nose&rdquo; making up the other 2/3 of the length.  While some of the details are foggy in my memory, I remember these proportions as they seemed quite atypical of any plane I&rsquo;d seen.  The body was slender and the wings were slender and relatively long. I don&rsquo;t remember what ultimately became of this plane.  As to whether it flew off or the lights went out I don&rsquo;t recall.  Now at the time I was unfamiliar with the &ldquo;Phoenix Lights&rdquo; but was familiar with UFO sightings of triangular / V shaped light configurations.  My opinion at the time and even now was that this plane and its trailing light were, for whatever reason, deliberately trying to appear as such a configuration.  Hearing of the Phoenix Lights makes it seem even more plausible. Now it could have been an aircraft in a holding pattern around the Flagstaff airport which is south of town and was to our west.  This is a possibility, however it still seems strange that it would have so many leading lights, would have a red light trailing quite far behind, and in the middle of the night would have to continually circle a small regional airport which according to my professor no longer received any commercial flights and has sparse traffic even in the daytime.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The last pair, the one in the lead went off map north and the other caught up and turned 90 degress to the right after it had appeared to stop. They moved at an extreme rate of speed.

Its edges were perfectly formed and it seemed to be low in the sky and perhaps as much as a thousand feet in length. It remained perfectly motionless and radically unnatural in a cloudless, clear blue sky.  As I drove toward it in heavy traffic I debated pulling onto the shoulder of the road to take a photo.  The road dipped into a valley and the object was hidden by trees.  Determined to take a photo the moment I caught sight of it again, I raced the car forward. By the time I reached the next hilltop, the sky was perfectly clear.  I never saw it again, nor have I ever seen anything like it at any time in my life.

I have tried writing this a couple of times but it seems to start jumping so I figured this format may be best.HOW:  I am a smoker and go outside several times a night to have a cigarette and watch the sky.  I have been doing this for years and have never seen anything like this.  My wife was the first to notice this but did not want to say anything to me for fear I would think she is crazy.  Since the first sighting I have seen this on numerous occasions for the past few months.  I have seen as many as three at one time in the sky but never very close to one another.  They do not appear in the same location in the sky every time.  And at times they are in different locations in the same night.  They do tend to disappear at some point in the night but not always.DESCRIPTION: Star like objects which change colors, Red/Green/White.  There move in ways conventional aircraft are unable to.Now I&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;re interested in this or not.  I have had several individuals witness this with me.  On the first occasion 5 people watched the object for over an hour.  I have tried to rationalize weather balloons, satellites and helicopters but none of these seem to fit.  So here I am.

I am genuinely scared and would appreciate someone to collaborate or explain what I saw.This new house I am renting doesn&apos;t allow smoking indoors so I went outside my window and sat on the roof enjoying the smoke. I saw 2 things just minutes apart which I cannot explain nor forget.It would have been around 1:00 or 1:05AM when I sat up and barely noticed something off in the sky. It looked like CGI or artists drawing of a comet. It had that leading umbrella like front that a comet does, but it had no tail. It looked like it had a wedge shape but you could only make out a front and the &quot;back&quot; wasn&apos;t visible. It moved from right to left from in the sky and was all but invisible against the sky. I only noticed it because it was moving and it seemed very far away and was very faint. As its view crossed across a streetlight it was obscured (washed out by the light). When it came back into view its wedge shape seemed a less of a point and much more rounded in front. It didn&apos;t do anything specific and very well could have been a comet, but I doubt it as it would have had to move across the sky line in 1-2 minutes. I took 2 pictures with my cell phone but nether show anything except that light across the street (it was that faint).I was pretty freaked out and called my friend in VA and talked to her about it and while I was on the phone something else happened and now I am scared in my room. I was on the phone with this girl and getting anxious about what I saw and was about to walk through my window when I saw 3 lights VERY CLOSE. If anyone is familiar as to how low the planes fly over Arlington, VA (above the buildings and high rises) when flying into National Airport, it seemed to be about the highest height the planes take before they drop altitude for final approach. That is to say it was so close that I would have heard something.It moved from right to left and was very very close. This defiantly had a triangular isosceles shape (from the 3 lights being in the corner). It was nearly straight above me and moved in a straight line or maybe it had a slight curve to its path. The lights did not illuminate a body of any sort but kept a perfect triangular shape. There was no blinking, NO NOISE and no fucking way I want to see it again. It was fast, but if it was as close as I think it was then it wouldn&apos;t have been as fast as the faint/far first object I saw.My friend on the phone was panicing because I was panicing and I woke one of my new roommates but he didn&apos;t want anything to do with it. At least he saw the fear I had.If anyone has any idea what it was or can collaborate what was in the sky please please post it.BTW, I have been in Austin less then 24 hours and I am almost willing to pack the car and move back to DC... deposit be damned. I won&apos;t be sleeping tonight until my roommates wake up, it isn&apos;t as though I&apos;m a coward, far from it. I just can&apos;t explain what it is. If I could explain it or understand it or even deny it I&apos;d probably feel a lot better right now.Thanks,", "Object appeared in a photo but not spotted at the time.  I did not see the object but the photo made front page headline in the local newspaper, the Levin Daily Chronicle.

It was nearly in the middle of the road, facing the road, almost as if left on display. We stopped, and I approached the carcass with the intention of doing an amateur forensics discussion for the benefit of my friend, essentially to show that the power of deduction and observation could be handily used to determine the likely cause and time of death. As I rattled off my observations to him like some amateur Quincy Jones, I realized with horror that this was NOT a poached animal, nor the victim of any predator I had ever seen or heard of. Close examination of the manner in which the vertebrae were severed indicated that neither metal laceration nor laser could explain the nature of the cuts. I had only seen these types of seperations of tissue with one device- and a very expensive one- a sonic scalpel.We then discovered the second deer carcass, at the edge of the forest line, and then the third, further into the forest, each two meters from the last, all in a strait line pointing to the middle of the south end of the Carter Moutain ridge.  All were turned inside out, all had their upper abdomenal organs removed, all the rib cages were so denuded of cartilage and flesh it appeared that they had been vacuumed clean, and the tiny spot of blood the size of a quarter or a dime underneath the carcass left on the road indicated a state of congealment indicative of the kill being no more than a half hour previous to discovery.  Nevertheless, the stiffness of the first deer half propped upright on the road was almost as if it&apos;s flesh had been highly stiffened by some kind of freeze-dried process, though, of course, there was no freezer burns. I cut the flesh with a pocket knife to ascertain if blood would emerge and investigate the stiffness of the flesh itself. There was no blood, the flesh cut easily.In the weeks that followed, I began to lose an enormous amount of weight and began to suffer from a rapid deterioration of *every* system of my body. I barely survived, but by the next February, my weight and health returned.This was a highly lethal, highly advanced technology used to mutilate those deer in Charlottesville Virginia.  This needs to be examined and reviewed.((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

I turned around to look at the incoming flights (possibly to Newark airport), and saw a large round, noiseless object come into view very shortly after one of the arriving flights.I shook my wife , and we both observed the silver disk silently glideing by.The disk proceeded into a cloud and never came out of it while we were looking.Directly behind the disk came another jet liner in a landing pattern.

I was about to start breaking to pull into the driveway and all of a sudden this white light flashed right in front of me. The only way I can describe it is a HUGH sheet of the whitest white i&apos;ve every seen. Lasted about 15 seconds, if that. My vision was very blurred and I couldn&apos;t adjust to the night. I was really freaked and my dogs were clearly spooked cause they took off running and barking. I stayed in my car for about 10 minutes not wanting to get out. The next day it was all over this AM radio station that talks about this kind of thing, from people around the USA, that saw the same thing.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))", "Bright white oval of light moving slowly towards groundI was driving west on a main surface street in Baton Rouge when I noticed a large oval of extremely bright white light in the sky to the west of my location.  My initial thought was it was on a tower, but I realized there are no tall radio towers in the area where this light was.  Besides which, I make this trip several evenings a week and had never seen the light.  My next realization was that it was moving, very slowly, appearing to move from west to east (towards me) and coming closer to the ground.  The light appeared to be about 2-3 miles distant, but this is just a guess.  It was not landing lights on an aircraft-I have lived by airports before and am familiar with these.  Plus the light was much larger than landing lights would be, and the airport is in a different direction.  As I drew closer, I started thinking that perhaps it was a series of large bright lights, as opposed to 1 large oval light.  I thought it might be a helicopter, but the light(s) was too wide to be on a helicopter.  By this point I had been watching the light(s) as I drove for approximately 5 minutes.  The light(s) was getting lower and lower.  There was nowhere on its line of decent for a helicopter to land, so if it was a helicopter of some sort, I don&apos;t know what it was doing.  Of course, I don&apos;t know what a UFO would be doing landing in a residential section of Baton Rouge, either.  At this point I had to make a turn in order to reach my destination, and as I was already late to pick up my daughter, I chose to make the turn and lose sight of the light(s).  When we returned to that road about 5 minutes later, the light was gone.  As I said before, I have lived near airports before--both military and civilian--and did not recognize the shape of the light(s). I was more than a little bit spooked.  The road I was on was not crowded at this time of the evening, but it was by no means empty.  Other people had to have seen the light(s) too.", "5 bright orange square lights over Southeast SDOn October 24th, at around 8:25 that evening, I was driving out of a valley and upon cresting the hill; I noticed one square orange light in the sky well above the tree line.  While I was looking at the light, another light lit and then another until there were 5 square orange lights lit making a bright rectangle.  Then the sky went black.  Then again the lights came on in succession until 5 square orange lights were lit and then the sky went black. I pulled my car over and got out to see if I could hear a helicopter or plane.  I heard neither.  There was nothing up there and I could hear nothing.  This all lasted around 3 minutes, if that long.", "This made me an alcoholicOn Wednesday, October 24th, I and a coworker had an experience on Highway 33 outside of Roca, NE (about 3 miles west on 33).  My coworker, who has since quit, will not contribute to this report so I will not use his experiences although I would prefer as they are more &quot;colorful&quot; than my own. A little background here; I am (or at least was) happily married and prefer to stay that way, and my wife will not listen to me and DOES NOT support my reporting this but after researching online I feel I must do this.

I was ahead of my coworker, when we turned a bend in the highway, ahead there was a black square in the sky. I don&rsquo;t know how else to describe it, there were no lights or sounds, just a square floating.  I nearly had a heart attack when I saw it, keep in mind-and this important-that it wasn&rsquo;t there when I came around the bend, it just appeared. It was low and almost on the road and I locked up my brakes.  My truck is heavy and admittedly we speed, so I was all over the road. I came to a stop and got out.  All I saw was this black square. I am not trying to sound dramatic.  But it was simply a black square, moving very slowly-hardly moving-to the south. This is when thing get weird, cause my coworker gets out of his truck and his face is white as a sheet, and he says ((deleted))all this for selling ice cream door-to-door.&quot;  I am staring at this black floaty thing, and then suddenly my coworker is gone. I mean thin air gone. Suddenly from the cornfield about 50 yards ahead from the south comes my buddy screaming bloody hell.  His eyes are so big it&rsquo;s like all I can see are his eyes to this minute, and all I can see to his right is this dark square, and as he is running to me, his arms out wide as if to hug me, and there comes this horn, ya know like compressed air you have on your boat, and I duck. My coworker jumps into my truck and shuts and locks the doors, and here I am prying on the door handle screaming like a school girl and I look behind me and see a guy, like a little skinny guy  along the ditch, and this is where I become a drinker, cause the guy is looking at me all menacing like he is coming to kill me and he is skin and bones with a big ass head.

It entered into my view from the edge of the roof of my house. So its appearance was constant, unlike a meteor that generally appears out of nowhere as it enters the earth&apos;s atmosphere. This object was within our atmosphere. I did not believe that it was a meteor because meteors generate a straight line as they pass and dissapear. This object changed direction. I was amazed that the speed it was travelling was similar to a meteor. It turned west and dissapeared out of sight. Not sure if anyone else saw this object. The object also generated a small propulsion tail as if it was powered. Maybe someone knows what it was. I find it hard to believe that we have technology to travel at this type of speed.

What I had observed near the old Broadmoor Golf course, Pine Island wooded area sout west of the Erie Lackwanna Bike trail in the woods was utterly fantastic ON 11-07-2006. While I was heading due south on the bike trail I had began to smell static electricity ozone. As I got off my bike I began to wipe myself off and it was as if I had been charged or something but it was the smell that got me, it was just like the smell you get when you pull off a fuzzy sweater over a cotton shirt but it was so strong and popping all over my body even by my ears and hair as the fillings in my mouth felt charged or something ,it was so uncomfortable.

I compare it to looking in a cave in the sky with warm colors swirling in a spiral like pattern , this thing sat still as I back tracked north on the trail to get another perspective on this thing as I saw it go down below the tree line then back up a lil higher than it was when I first saw it.Next then for like 5 seconds it looked like it was leaking molten liquid magma or something(wierd) its perimeter turned really bright like it was being eclipsed than blinked up leaving a streak in the sky . what it was I will never ever know. but this thing was no airplane or bright planet Like Jupiter,Mars or a star .

When I was approximately one mile East of Lost Mountain Road, I observed a row of bright white lights that were at an unknown distance ahead of me and appeared to be heading east. From my perspective these lights were slightly above the tree line. As the aircraft got closer I observed what appeared to be a large, light blue lamp on the bottom. This lamp blinked slowly, unlike strobes on other aircraft that I have observed. At this time, I estimated the altitude of the aircraft to be to be 4,000 to 5,000 feet and it was slightly to my left. This is when I was able to see that the aircraft had a distinct triangular shape. The surface was dark compared to the sky above, which was a lighter shade of gray. The fuselage and the wing were one in the same. From this perspective, almost below the aircraft, there was one white light at each corner of the triangle. The forward most angle of the triangle was slightly greater then the two angles that were equal in the aft section of it.

There are railroad tracks that run perpendicular to the hi-way, and I usually did not like heading to Maxwell on that road as the trains always ran with their front light on (they only had one at that time) and I hated that cause they were always on high.  But it was early and still light out so I thought it would be fine if there was a train, as it would not blind me then.The weather was cloudy and grey, and it had been misting all day and was cold out.  I can not remember why we were making it an early day, but I think we had a test the next day for school.As I started out of town we were just talking and I noticed that there was a train coming towards us and I immediately thought &quot;Crap, a train with it&apos;s light on. I hate that.&quot;  Then as we got a little closer to the &quot;train&quot; I noticed that it looked like a really tall train, as the light was twice as high as it should have been, but still did not think anything was strange about it.Then as we got even closer I realized somthing was not right about it and saw that the light was high above the tracks and my friend stopped talking and I said to him &quot;What the hell is that?&quot;  Moving very slowly along the tracks was a football shaped craft the the ends coming to a flat point.   The light was on the front pointing straight ahead and there was another I could not see at first pointing directly down onto the tracks.  It also had several small coloured lights at different areas on it.I had pulled over nad actually got out of the car and walked towards it trying to figure out what I was looking at.  My friend was freaking out and wanted me to get back in and drive away.  The car never quit running and I did not notice any electrical problems either. Good thing there was no traffic as I probably would have gotten run over! The object did not make any noise at all.  It was dead silent.  I stood there and watched it glide down the tracks with the light shineing down on it.  The size of it was about a train engine and a half long, it was a fairly big craft.  It just faded into the grey mist out of sight.Finally the cold rain sort of snapped me out of the daze I was in as I watched it and I got back in the car and started off towards my friend&apos;s home.  We did not say anything for a while and it was sort of like being in a dream.  When we did start talking it was like we were trying to make some sense of what we had just witnessed.I should also mention that this was in sight of the airport which is just south of the hi-way and there are electrical lines that cross the tracks at several points so anyone flying an aircraft along them would have been very foolish and crashed doing so.  Also the Union Pacific does not check the lines that way either.The whole sighting took only about five or six minutes even though it seemed like hours, but when I dropped him off and got home it was actually four hours later.  Maxwell is only fifteen minutes up and fifteen back.  We left town at around 18:30 hours and I did not get home till after midnight.  I still do not really know what to make of that.The next day when we saw each other, he said to expect the Ne State Patrol to contact me cause his Mom called them after he told her what happened.  I was freaked by that cause I just knew that everyone would think we were nuts or high on something.They called the airport to see if there were any planes coming in at that time, and there were none and they saw nothing on their radar either.We never discussed that event again for years till he asked me to recall the whole thing and I did.  Unknown to me he was recording me and he played the tape for a friend of his who said our story&apos;s were identical.I know this happened many years ago, but it is  still fresh in my memory just as the day it happened.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

We are about 5 minutes from the theater when I first noticed  a strange looking object flying overhead.  It was around 9:36pm and the sky was getting dark enough to see the FAA lights on the aircraft, but still bright enough to make out the shape of nearby helicopters and airplanes coming from the nearby Denver International Airport.The object appeared gray in color, no lights, no visible vapor trails, and no sound emitting from the object. It caught my attention because after looking at the flying object for a few seconds, I realized I couldn&apos;t pinpoint what type of flying craft it was.  It seemed to look as if though it was flying in a straight motion, but had the appearance it was rotating and changing its position within the flight path. At one moment I thought I could see wings, but it would quickly change into an unrecognizable shape. I also thought that it could have been a bunch of balloons banded together, but i&apos;ve seen those before. And helium balloons travel upward, this object was traveling in a &quot;straight&quot; pattern, never escalating its height.Another odd factor was that caught my attention was that it was not making any sound. I&apos;d say it was maybe 700-750ft off of the ground, close enough to be able to hear an aircraft sound. I would know that, because other aircraft pass overhead at much higher alltitudes in Denver, and the sounds are easily distinguishable during the time the object was witnessed. And I say 700ft, because the largest building in Denver is the Republic Plaza, which is at 714&quot;ft. And this object was definitely within that range..The Object traveled silently , and eventually just disappeared out of site. That too seemed also a little strange, because the visibility was still clear enough to see aircraft coming too and from the nearby Rocky Mountains. However this craft seem to loose visibility. As it would move farther, the shape would also still keep changing.This will have been my second time seeing UFO in two different States.", "traiangle seen over cheshire uk  nov 07it was quite a simple sighting. we were driveing home after a day out when we noticed a red and blue light quite far apart they looked long and thin in the middle of them was like a strobe moveing from side to side as we got a bit closer we noticed a light at the front of the object it was a triangle with no doubt it passed over us quite high up and it was a triangle..as we pulled the car over it seemed to stop and then start moveing backwards (flying backwards)it was moveing pretty fast aswell..so it was like.. the light at the front was now at the back...", "Five &apos;star like&apos; intellegece operated craft observed by 2 people in North Texas.I live in suburbs of North Dallas , Texas. I am a State Gaurd for the State of California , an American Red Cross first responder , a 2 year member of the Air Force Auxillery , Cival Air Patrol and my father was a pilot for over 10 years. I am not an expert at aircraft , but am credible to tell you what I witnessed was something unexplainible and very real and not capable of being any current aircraft that any goverment possess.A college friend and myself had gone out for a cigarette after watching a late movie on television. The sky on this night was extremely clear and there were no clouds visible. Constilations and stars on this night were excellent to observe. At around 5 am in the morning , still dark , both of us caught with our peripheral vision a change in a consilation visible in the North West sky. Two stars had appeared in the sky , at least they had the appeance of being stars. More than this they were moving at slow pace , like that of a satelite . The pair moved as a unit , buts coordination was beyond that of even the most expierianced pilot. They changed direction slightly twice , remaining perfectly in sync with eachother. The light they gave off dimmed slowly over time until finally disapearing. My friends thoughts on the behavior of the lights explores the possibility that these crafts were moving upward and out of our atmosphere causing the dimming effect. My first reaction was that these were military crafts , with advanced aero - navigational computers or something that would explain the way they manuvered. I continued to observe the sky and the area where we&apos;d witnessed the strange distant lights. Theyre were a lot of meteors also in the sky that night , a naturaly occuring meteor shower resulted my Haley&apos;s Comet. I was not expecting what followed as with most UFO sightings that Ive seen on TV programs , or read about in books there is only one sighting. Five minutes had past since the disapearance of the first two craft. We both suddenly observed a bright flash from just south of the prior mentioned constilation. The flash was as bright as a camera flash light. Immidieatly after the flash another single one of the &quot;moving stars&quot; craft was visible moving in a Northern direction for several seconds before fading like the first two. My friend and I now knew that we were observing something very real , and something that needed immiediate looking in to. I told my friend to remain outside and observe the sky for more activity. I went inside to check all local news stations , and national news , in fear that this was a test of the missle defense system or that another national attack had happend causing the presence of these possible advanced military craft. There was nothing relevant on either press outlet. I went back outside only to find my friend just about to call me , and in time to witness a third and forth craft. The following sighting remains to me the most signifigant in that it dis-proves any of the theories I had that these craft were man-made or modern. This sighting also disturbes me on a deep level. What we saw was a passanger jet , probably out of DFW International , heading north , with one of these star like craft following it from a higher altitude and several hundred yards behind. It shadowed the airplane for a good minute in a half , maintaing the same distance and matching the speed of the airline. It then accelerated and moved directly over the plane before abruptly vanishing. At the same time as this first craft disapeared a second light appeared from the origional area that the origional craft had been following the plane at. Several hundred yards behind the plane. This sudden appearance of this craft startled me enough , that I actually fell backwards on the ground. The craft was visible for no longer than several seconds buts direction was twoards us as I clearly remember seeing the light tracer caused by the fast moving craft. These second pair of craft were much closer to the ground than the origional two viewed in the constilation. These two also moved quickly and appeared and vanished abruptly instead of a gradual fade. I felt a strong fear for the safety of the passangers on the plane , and was very uncomfortable with the way these unknown lights interacted as if there interest was with this jet. Both my friend and I now knew that what we were seeing was unique , and something that we were not supposed to see. Ive seen meteors , shooting stars , satelites , and nearly every kind of signal light on a plane from both sky and ground and can possitivly identify these crafts as none of the mentioned. The last sighting occured near 07:40 . We had remained outside for over thirty minutes patiently watching the sky and going over what we had seen , trying to make reason out of any of it. Morning had come and the only now visible stars in the sky were two off to the south west , and a very bright (maybe northern star) star to the west. As we turned around from watching the fading of the two stars to the east , and the area of sky where we saw the other crafts , a new pressence startled me. A new , non moving , very bright light was now visible to left of the remaining one star we had noted before. Its size and amount of light it produced was a complete mimic of the single star to its right. It remained for 6-10 minutes , long enough for both of us to begin questioning simply overlooking this light , and begining to accept that it was also a star. Without warning , it ever moving , and completly dismissing it as a fading star , it simply faded inwards , as if it was moving directly away from us at some great unthinkable speed. Within the amount of time taken by a eyelid blinking it had completly gone leaving the morning sky cloudless , single star remaining, and becoming lighter as the sun was now up. This last star gives me the oversure impression that it was singled in on us and was observing us. It did not move or show any other sign of possible cause , other than its looming pressence above us , and the feeling that we were trapped and being watched by something that we could not explain and thought could be threat. Whatever these objects were , they were true &quot;unidentified flying objects&quot; . As to whether being extraterrestrial in orgin , I can knowingly testify that there is no possibility that these were man-made or navigated by a conventional pilot . This is taking in to account the possibility of classified expierimentals. These things moved , appeared and vanished , and interacted as if altitude , time , and matter simply didnt matter , and that using these crafts could manipulate and contradict even our most basic laws of physics and far supercedes modern aero science potential. I have accepted that there are no explinations to what I witnissed and that the account that both of us saw will be laughed at , misunderstood , and not believed. I however feel a sense of self , and look at it as being something very special that I was able to witness , and accept a very real unknown that we as Americans or any persons should press be investigated and monitored. My friend , of christian upbringing, found the expieriance to be the most religious , awakening , and realization as to the importance of having witnessed such things , a life changing expieriance as well as both of our single most important moments of our lifes. Being able to witness these crafts and observe , if only shortly , travelers of space , and things capable of seeming to bend reality. I had no access to a video camera to record the lights for evidence. Also , after much discussion decided not to call the police at the time. Whether a public record or press involvment will be made by myself or friend remain to be decided.((NUFORC Note:  We cannot be certain that this is intended to be a serious report, but we post it, nevertheless.

It seems to be more the tight cluster while it is standing still and when it is moving on a steady line to my left or right.

What I saw was a large, glowing orange ball of dim light. There was(what I thought to be) a rectangular shaped craft floating some ways above the orange ball. It was to the right of the orange ball, hovering vertical to it. Then the rectangular craft slowly floated vertically towards the orange ball. Then the orange ball floated slowly away, then took off faster than anything that I have ever seen. That is when the rectangular ship stopped, and began floating over my house.  As it turns out, the ship was a huge triangle like ship, with three lights at each point. The light in front was blinking blue, and the two in back were blinking red. The craft was completly silent, except for a small buzzing noise. It flew over my house at about tree level, so it was very close. Then it turned right, and began flying away from my house. That is when I noticed that the craft had three massive rocket looking things on the back, which were glowing a dim, bright, neon color. Of course, I ran inside of my house, telling my family what I just told you. My family is of the skeptical type, and me and my brother are the only ones in our family who believe in this stuff. So then I ran back outside, to see that it had turned back, and was flying over my house again. I ran back in the house, searching for a camera, to find out that it hadn&apos;t been packed yet. When I returned outside, the craft had disappeared. I don&apos;t know what it was, all I can say was that it was very strange.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It made no noise and had no lighting coming from it.  It just appeared as a dark, triangular, shadow.  When I stood up to get a better view I could no longer see the object.  After that I went to the angle I was when I was laying on the ground and I could see it again.  It had changed direction from east to south.  My friend had seen it too.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was located on the NE corner of 34 st &amp; 8th Ave. in NYC. This object appeared at times to glisten in the sun, but would emit a bright light that would change in color from white to red, that gave the appearance of a spot light. At this time, I notice a North bound airliner which had generated four contrails south of the object in question. When the distance between the AC and the object closed several miles the object changed this tract to a southern direction, and appeared to pass the AC on the port side and pass through the contrails.  The object(spot light) would continually change in color from a bright white to red, but the object still reflected the sun. The Aircraft continued on its path, but I would think that they must have observed it also due to its proximity to the AC. I lost tract of the object shortly after it passed through the contrail. The object did not generate any observable contrail which I also found unusual. I have checked Heavens-Above for possible irridum flares, sattilites for that time and found none.", "In the summer of 1972 my family and I witnessed many UFO sightings above and around Folsom Lake, California.I am 59 years of age now and my two brothers and three sisters still talk about the spring and summer of 1972.  I was 23 years old then and my older sister lived on three acres, less than two miles from Folsom Lake.  The area she lived in at that time was very wooded and remote.  Many evenings and well into the early morning hours she would phone either me or one of my brothers, excited or even frightened over what she was seeing in her pasture or in the nearby fields.  Her horses became restless, dogs barking, and upon looking out from her large living-room window she would see one or more orange objects often glowing bright and then dimming.  Upon her phone calls, my two brothers and I would drive out to her house, often during the middle of the night.  Many times we would see the objects before arriving at her house.  There is simply too much to relate in this posting, but I will say that what we witnessed during those spring and summer nights of 1972 were without question neither airplanes nor helicopters.  We drove our parents out there on a few occasions and they too were completely baffled as to what these objects were.  There were never any sounds coming from the objects.  Among a host of reports I could now relate, I will focus upon my two most memorable sightings:  1) Standing outside of our car at the edge of Folsom Lake and observing one or more bright orange objects moving erratically then pausing and hovering motionlessly without a sound.  One such object actually shot a high beam or light directly onto the water.  It was a very dark moonless night and I remember that we spoke of how easily we could see the ripples of the lake water once the beam of light penetrated the lake.  It was so strange since there was absolutely no sound coming from the object.  These objects maneuvered, as I say, erratically, often pausing, disappearing, and reappearing almost instantly in another location.  At times they would seem to fall and rock from side to side reminding me of a lightweight falling feather. 2) On another memorable occasion we (my brothers and I) drove back out to the Folsom area after receiving a phone call from my sister.  This time we were parked atop a bluff on Sierra College Blvd.  We witnessed several bright orange objects in the distance.  I cannot make any estimates as to how far they were or how high they were; all I can say is that they appeared to be about the size of goftballs from where we were.  I recall how truly amazed we were as we witnessed six or seven smaller objects slowly moving toward a large orange object.  It appeared to us that as each smaller object neared the larger one they actually disappeared, as if they entered the large object.  Not saying that they actually entered the large object, but this is the appearance they gave.  As the last smaller object entered or disappeared, suddenly all six or seven smaller objects would reappear and begin the entire process over again.  We watched this phenomena repeat itself for nearly an hour as I recall. I could write several pages on all of the UFO activity that we witnessed in and around Loomis and Folsom Lake during that particular summer long ago.  To my knowledge nothing of that magnitude has ever occurred there since that time.  No members of my family have ever reported it until now, 35 years later.  During that summer we read absolutely nothing in the newspapers of these mysterious orange glowing lights over Folsom Lake.  What we saw was certainly not ball lightning, aircraft, swamp gas, meteors, or anything that is easily explained.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I had my daughter at the park and some balloons we released. When watching one of them drift off, I could see a sliver of something in the distance. It seamed to be really far away.

I could not figure it out, I had my eye on it for at least 5 minutes, just watching when a plane flew by, you could clearly see that this craft was much higher than the plane. We are pretty close to Orange County airport, so we always see plane traffic. As I continued watching it, it made a very fast directional move, I lost eye contact with it. I continued looking in the same direction and saw it once again, it kind of moved side to side like a ping pong ball.

Then we noticed 3 (what we thought was stars) they started moving back and forth and 1 went down then back up. at first we thought it might be planes. But it was really different. I had my camera so I put it on night setting without flash, just tring to get pictures of the stars. We did NOT see these shapes in the sky.We did see a flash of red, and yellow.

It moved swiftly covering about half the sky in a second.Within minutes I saw a similar object about half a mile east of me.I went inside and woke my girlfriend and told her what I had seen. I tried to assimilate what it could have possibly been. Ranging from a glider to stealth planes.I noticed my neighbors outside and told them what I had seen. Within minutes we saw it again. 3 groups, the first looking like what I had seen, then two more groups. Oddly, the last two groups appeared to be birds. One group had 2 &apos;birds&apos;, strangly and eerily glowing in the night. I could barely discern &apos;flapping&apos;. The other group had maybe 3 &apos;birds&apos; in it. But they moved so swiftly.I tried to compare mentally the differences in what I had seen before and after I had witnesses, and it seems they looked more like birds after I talked to the others.The disparity in viewings comes from the apparent speed of the objects as they flew overhead. I cannot seem to shake the feeling that these are not birds.Oddly enough, as many times as I have went outside to smoke cigarettes at night. I have never noticed these &apos;birds&apos; in any season. Let alone the three shooting stars I have also witnessed in the sky this night. I have never seen so many shooting stars in one night, let alone my whole life...and 3 ofthem within an hour along with these sightings.

Immediately, I realized that it made no sense as the sun was out.  After several seconds the star appeared to turn off its light and the round shape of what appeared to be a craft appeared for a few seconds.  It was clearly not a star.  I though it must be a satelite or the space station, but it was totally stationary.

They appeared hundreds of feet in the sky, not thousands. Three of the lights began to spin around in circles, at one point coming together in the middle of the point they were circulating, but for a moment, and then moving out apart again where they continued to rotate. The three circulating lights appeared to chase each other independently in an almost triangular configuration around a central light as they were nearly an equal distant apart from each other during most of this spinning &ldquo;dance&rdquo; in the clouds. Never in my 40 years have I seen anything like this. The lights appeared to emanate from the clouds, but I noticed no objects other than the strange lights. I was about to grab my camera from the house when I watched the lights dart off to a point in the southeast part of the sky, pause for a few seconds, and then blink out as simply as if one were turning off a light switch. Before blinking out, the lights appeared to be nothing more than a crack of light in the clouds. I&rsquo;m willing to believe that this was somehow manmade, but I am at a loss for how it was accomplished. This was no ordinary lightshow. Unfortunately, although this is an urban neighborhood, I didn&rsquo;t see anyone else outside at the time to confirm what I saw. Considering the urban nature of where this took place, I&rsquo;m betting others might have seen this but I&rsquo;ve read nothing in the local press.", "Stationary object.Wednesday, October 17, 2007.At approximately 12 noon EST on Tuesday October 16th, at Latitude 43:55:00 N, Longitude 078:43:00 W, looking South, at an elevation of 45 degrees, a white circular stationary object was observed for a duration of 10-15 minutes.Unable to determine estimated distance or relative size, the object was above cloud cover, as clouds passed by occasionally obstructing the object.

The speeds seemed very slow, almost as if they were sattelites, but they were definelty at a lower altitude. The north bound light disapeared suddenly at about 1 minute into the sighting.

On the night of october 3, 2007 8 30 pm ish, I walked out my back door for a cigarette.  Right over my yard, and I will have to guess at the altitude, 1000 ft, perhaps only about 500, as i am not good at judging distance at night,, I saw a bright light, very similar to how a street light looks, only it was traveling from south to north very slowly.  In my mind, I was thinking that if it were a plane it should have flashing lights, and as close as it was, I would definitely  be able to hear it.  this was absolutely silent.  As I was watching, &quot;they, meaning the pilot(s)&quot; turned off the &quot;light&quot;.  It did not instantly go dark, but it gradually dimmed.  Sort of like when you turn off your tv at night, it &quot;glows&quot; for a few moments, before going black.Thats what this thing did.  And during the 4 or 5 seconds it took from going from bright light to dim then dark, I could clearly see it make a sharp turn to the east, and continued in a eastward direction before it completely disappeared from my sight.  In my opinion, it disappeared from my sight because it was no longer illuminated, as I believe that it continued to travel to the east, rather than disappear &quot; up into space&quot;. I was actually quite shaken by this, as I was by myself, but I was not in disbelief, because I have seen similar unexplainable flying objects on several other occasions.  This was different in that it was very close, and also directly over my back yard.

A couple minutes after stepping out my back door, I saw a VERY bright &quot;meteor?&quot;, or what looked like a meteor, or falling star, except VERY close to the earth, and &quot;fell&quot; from northwest, towards the southeast, and left a very long tail.  This fell, not down from the sky, but fell or traveled horizontally to the earth.

Around 15 yards away I found it being very odd and I yelled out &quot;Hey, what are you doing?&quot; the light object stopped moving and then looked toward me with crisp blue eyes and a bright flash of light occured. Squinting a bit the light disappears. I ran back up to the house and lock the door. Next morning before work, I went outside to view tracks.  Nothing whatsoever.  I been around hunters all my life and know all animals leave something behind this creature left nothing not sure what I saw but I know it wasn&apos;t human. Thanks ((name deleted))", "Odd, distinctively shaped craft seen at 21,000 feet east of Manteca by two commercial pilotsThis sighting occurred while I was acting as Captain during a routine cargo flight in a BE-1900 from OAK (Oakland, CA) to BUR (Burbank, CA).  We had leveled-off at FL210 and were cruising just south of Manteca VOR (a navigational aid near the city of Manteca, CA). Traffic at this time of night is usually very light and quite easy to spot at ranges exceeding 50 miles.  ATC (Oakland Center) routinely advises us of traffic in our area. While on a mostly southern heading, I noticed a somewhat unusually colored light off to my nine-o-clock position (east of us).  It appeared to be close to our altitude, but many miles distant (over the foothills of the Sierra mountain range).  Normally, lights seen at that altitude and distance appear to be of a clear white color&hellip; usually the recognition or landing lights of another aircraft descending into the Bay Area for landing.  This light was exceptionally bright and very yellow in color. I pointed it out to my First Officer, in passing.  He also remarked on how bright it was.  I&rsquo;d seen unusual lights like this one before &ndash; both out over the ocean and on descent into the Bay Area over Concord, CA.  They&rsquo;d always turned out to be oil refineries/rigs burning off gas.  This light did not flicker as those had. As we continued our flight to BUR, we&rsquo;d occasionally look out to the left to watch the light &ndash; which, over time grew both larger and brighter. After about five minutes of observing the light, it began to take a definite shape and seemed to be paralleling our course.  The top portion of the light was semispherical, and the bottom portion formed a clear &ldquo;V&rdquo; shape coming to a point at the base.  Over time, this &ldquo;V&rdquo; shape with a pointed-bottom became larger-and-larger. Our curiosity piqued, I asked my F/O to call Oakland Center and ask if they had any traffic on their radar at our nine-o-clock, same altitude.  They replied saying that the only traffic in our vicinity was an opposite direction King Air descending out of 13,000 feet (which both I and my F/O already had in sight).  No traffic at our nine-o-clock was seen on radar. We continued to watch this bright yellow light grow in size over the next ten minutes, until it filled about a four-inch square through the window on my side.  It was impossible to accurately gauge our distance to the object, or its true size, since we didn&rsquo;t have any other visible references against with to judge it. Anecdotally, all I can say is that it was both LARGE and of a VERY unusual shape and color.  Other aircraft lights (while flying at night) uniformly appear to be circular points of light, and are all in standard colors (red, green, white or white strobe).  The light we saw did NOT appear to be a light ON an aircraft &ndash; the light appeared to be the entire outline of some sort of aircraft. As I said before, the light appeared to be paralleling our course and coming closer (i.e., remaining in the same relative position even though we were moving south at around 300 knots over the ground, yet getting larger).  Please take that observation with a grain of salt though.  Without being close enough to see details on the craft or compare it against a ground reference &ndash; it could just as easily be something very large seen at a great distance.  Things observed at a large distance do not appear to have any relative motion. We continued to watch the light until it appeared to take a northern course away from us at great speed (both decreasing in brightness and size, without changing altitude). Both my F/O and I have 5,000+ hours of experience &ndash; most of which was gained under similar circumstances (at night, over California routes)&hellip; and we were both flabbergasted by what we saw.  We both admitted it made the hair on our neck stand up.  To be honest, I was spooked by the experience, but have chosen to not bring it up with our airline or the FAA out of concern for being judged a nut-job. I&rsquo;m not saying the things we saw were of extraterrestrial origin &ndash; but I am saying we saw something that (in both of our professional opinions) was nothing like any other aircraft we&rsquo;ve ever experienced in our careers.", "Triangle object  with red lights above WinnipegObject appeared to travel from north to south at 4000 to 6000 feet above ground level and have red lights emitting from its underside the shape was of a triangle and speed was 250 to 300 knots.

The object was a silvery white. The wind was blowing hard at the ground but this thing did not move, sway or rise like you would expect a balloon to do. The rod looked metal. We watched for about 15 minutes then it began to move north. Then the object disappeared. The single engine plane was only there for the first 5 minutes then it flew away.", "Crash cover up?The helicopter was military (out of Tullahoma).

All of the sudden, we could hear a low humming sound coming up the street.  It was lower than the power lines and trees.  Then we saw a beam of light coming up the street very slowly towards us.  We watched as it got closer.  All you could see was the light on the ground, no visible shape or object and no where to see where the beam of light was coming from.As the light got within a few feet of us I told my friend to run and we ran into our own houses.  I told my family at the time, but they didn&rsquo;t believe me because sometimes I would make up stories to get a reaction out of them.  So no one ever believed us.  After I had time to think about it, I realized I had initially thought it was a helicopter overhead.  But it was too quiet and too low.  I wondered about it my whole life.  I wondered what would have happened if we had let the beam actually reach us and shine on us.  Too bad I was young and scared and ran away.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

My speed was maintained at or near 75 mph throughout the incident.  Skies were clear.  Over the span of about five minutes, I gradually became aware of an unusually-bright whitish light visible intermittently through the trees at about my 9 o&rsquo;clock position.  It must have been blinking in and out, since the roadside woods do not obscure the eastern horizon continuously along this stretch of road.  Eventually, this phenomenon began to strike me as something extraordinary, and I focused my full attention on it.  Soon I came into a long stretch of road where the horizon was clearly visible.  The light had nearly the hue of a sodium lamp, but was much brighter&mdash;more so than Venus, and comparable in magnitude to that of the incandescent landing light of a large aircraft viewed from a mile away, but having a much different quality.  It blinked intermittently, sometimes flashing with a period from 1-5 seconds, sometimes remaining visible for 20 or more seconds at a time.  The appearances and reappearances did not occur instantaneously; rather, the brightness grew continuously over a short period of time, say one third of a second.  Shortly after coming into the clear area, this light was joined by two more showing identical behavior with regard to blinking in and out of view, etc.  Each light was associated definitely with a certain area of space&mdash;that is to say, after disappearing, a new light would appear very near to the original location, so that the impression given was of three separate objects translating through space and periodically flashing in and out of visibility.  During this entire incident, the lights (when there were three) showed what would be interpreted, had they been connected, as a slow counter-clockwise rotation, the motion of each light relative to the stars not exceeding about 3-5 degrees per second.  This seems to indicate that they were either near and transla! ting wit h my vehicle at about the same speed (which seems unlikely, as they were extremely bright, but did not at all illuminate the fields and tree lines past which I was driving) or that they were far away and moving at some unknown speed.  The formation of lights occupied about a thirty degree sweep of sky, extending from 20 to 50 degrees above the horizon.  After about two to three minutes with three lights visible, all abruptly blinked out of existence and did not reappear.", "Craft sighted at a nucular power plantI am an employee of pg&amp;e corp.  I ( we ) have never reported this incident to anyone except our buddies at work and family friends, I suppose in fear of our job, would be the reason or our collectivly not being able to describe what we saw. dcpp is a nucular power plant, each year we are constantly trained to be the best in our fields. I am currently a plant insulator, but was a plant operator for a time. On the morning that this observation occured we , myself and 3 fellow insulator/coating spealists, were to clean and recoat insulators on a transformer located at the north end of the plant. While waiting for a qualified electriction ( for safety purposes) an airplane was observed coming from the horizion toward us. As it came closer to our position I, we, all noticed that it was not a normal airplane.  It had no sound coming from it&apos;s engine and no wings, as it came closer(2000 feet away) we noticed that it also had no lights. This being just after daylight was easy to see.  The speed of the craft was approx. 300 mph.  It then disapeared behind a knole approx. 1/4 mile north of the plant. We continued to watch, for a crash and flames, but in 30 seconds it reappeared heading out to sea, West, again at approx. 300 mph, but picked up speed and disapeared over the horizon at a very fast speed. Our eye level was at 90 feet above sea level, so we were able to see quite far out to sea.  Visability was exceptional. The craft was not large, probably 100 feet long and 20 feet in diameter, my best guess. It was shaped exactly like a cigar, color of silver or bright white.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It is so dark out there that anything in the sky could be seen very easily. It was cigar shaped but it was so tiny. Like a star. The color was green. And the light strobed. As it moved, the strobe made it look like it was skipping across the sky. They all looked like this.  At first we saw just the one. We walked out into the driveway to get a better look of the entire sky and saw two more. Each one of them flew erratically. They flew in all different directions and would come back and go again. My step mother and niece came out to see what the commotion was and they too witnessed it all. At one point, one of the lights split into three and each of those lights went off in separate directions, then would come flying back and join together again as one. You would think as fast as they traveled there would be a collision, but there wasn&rsquo;t one. And the main shape never differed, not even when they broke apart and rejoined. We watched this for two hours that first night. Until eventually they just one by one flew off over Pettit Jean Mt. Toward the east.  We saw these lights for 10 nights straight. And on the 10th night, straight out in front of my fathers house, there is a valley and we watched these lights fly over that valley when they disappeared.

Today, 11/16/07 I visited your site again since 8/7/07 and was happy to see my first posting up, so now I would like to post the second one. The summer of 1990 my extended family was visiting from overseas, and we decided to vacation in Ocean City, MD.  On or about July 20, 1990 after a long day shopping and enjoying the beach weather, my brother and I walked down to the beach for a smoke.  We sat on the shore and talked, when I noticed a set of triangular lights that seemed to dance around each other in the night sky. At first I just thought they were stars, but I also noticed they would blink every now and then, as if they disappeared and reappeared again.  At first I thought, the motion of the waves might have influence over balance, and perhaps on a clear night stars really do twinkle, so I quickly dismissed it as just a quirk. Then suddenly I saw one light dart away from the other two. At first I had hesitated in telling my brother what I had seen, but noticing that the other two lights had now followed the stray light from East to West, I asked him to look up in the sky and tell me what he saw.    My brother then affirmed what I had seen, and we began to speculate as to what it could be, he was the first to say it might be UFOs.  This went on for about 30 minutes, it was definitely not something that was just momentary, it seemed as if the three lights danced around each other, followed each other, and perhaps signaled each other.This is my second sighting, both of which I&apos;ve witnessed with two different family members, who can verify my stories.I would like to further add that coincidentally on August 1977 I became psyschically intuned with departed loved ones through dreams.  I just find it fascinating that my first sighting which was a direct encounter with a saucer might have enhanced these abilities or are directly attributed to them. Since my encounters I&apos;ve read many books, including the powerful Edgar Cayce on Indigo children which represent a new evolutionary human society.

I was very scared because they were so calm! I decided to see what they were seing so i looked at the sky ut didn&apos;t see anything but tried looking harder when i saw it it was very far, my first thought was maybe its a bag, but there was no wind i tried thinking what it can be then, it started to move back and forth then stop in mid air! At that moment i thought this is not a plane it can&apos;t be, after looking at it for 10 minutes it moved east very fast i ran inside to the front when i looked i could bearly se it.

PD))Nine spherical objects in the night sky, one  flew overhead, changing into some sort of flying machine!  My Sightings  I have had a number of sightings at home and on my property. I live in a rural area in Ohio where, for some reason, just about anything can happen. The sighting I am writing to you about is a fantastic one, although there have been some other pretty incredible sightings. It started one evening on the 2ndof March, 2005. I was walking my cat down to our garage to put her in out of the cold, when all of a sudden, to the left of my view, I saw 7 spherical UFO&rsquo;s flying through the sky. They zoomed into view. They were pale white, filmy sort of objects with a little dark dot in the center. As I watched I was treated to a dancing display of lights, which left me dumbfounded. During the dance, the two smaller white spheres dropped out of the two larger UFO&rsquo;s, and began to zip around in the sky, darting every which way. The two smaller discs then joined back up with the larger UFO&rsquo;s almost as if they were being absorbed into these larger objects. These smaller discs were white and filmy too but with no dot in the center of them. It was as if they were smaller ships, or something, that seemed to scout around even more quickly than the bigger objects. They looked like orbs of light or similar to that. The group continued on, but hovered in the middle of the sky. I was so excited! I had just made a decision about a year before to start looking up at the sky for UFO&rsquo;s. I had only looked up, maybe, twice, that year, for a minute or two; it wasn&rsquo;t anything serious, so when I saw these objects I knew exactly what they were. I had read about UFO&rsquo;s, and how some of them looked, and behaved; there was no mistaking it, this was what I had read about. I quickly ran over to my drive at the gate to get a better look, then to my husband&rsquo;s shop to get my cameras. I had two cameras - unfortunately, only one was fully loaded (as I found out later), but I managed to get a couple of shots. I told myself (inside my head) that I wanted these UFO&rsquo;s to come closer, so that I could get a good photograph. No one would believe the picture that I would get, at this distance. While the second I said that, one of the UFO&rsquo;s started over! It heard me! It had heard what I had said in my own mind; that means they are telepathic! As the object came closer, I panicked and started to run. I had heard and read about what could happen to you if you got too close to a UFO &ndash; you know, burns and radiation &ndash; so I didn&rsquo;t need that. So, I ran. As I ran this object stopped in mid-stream and started back toward the group. &hellip;I stopped and went back to the gate with my cameras in-hand, actually one was strapped around my neck and started to snap pictures of these UFO&rsquo;s, when I realized I couldn&rsquo;t get the flash to work (on my digital camera). Over and over, again, I snapped the picture with no luck. I quickly went to camera B. It worked fine, it was my 35 mm camera.  I got pictures of these objects, or at least I hoped  I had; it was dark and they were up in the sky and you know how that looks on film. So, I said it again, &ldquo;Please come over so I can take your picture.&rdquo; And, again just as I said that, the UFO started to travel over&hellip;.I was so excited, but I started to run again to my house. I just couldn&rsquo;t stop myself. The UFO kept coming and I kept running, looking up as often as I could. Just as I was approaching the house a white flash went off&hellip;with the sound of a click. I thought, &ldquo;Oh, my camera is working now or they have somehow activated my camera.&rdquo; I kept running. As I came to my house, I took another look&hellip;this object looked like a star traveling pretty fast; it was white with a fiery motion to it, all ablaze in white with a pale yellow front to it. The pale yellow was at the beginni! ng of th e object. Then as I looked - before I was near to the house - I saw the object stand stationary in the sky &ndash; about 15 feet from me and 30 feet in the air. It was in semi-darkness, with light and shadow playing upon it, I could barely make out the shape. It wasn&rsquo;t circular anymore but looked to be sort of crescent-shaped. &hellip;I don&rsquo;t know, I couldn&rsquo;t really tell. Something was rotating&hellip; it kept rotating. Then all of a sudden, a slender milky white arm slinked down from it, about 15 feet down from the object. You know what I mean, like a spider drops down from its web (that sort of motion and look). And it was translucent, gossamer-like, with a curly-cue tail on the end of it. The very last look I got before I dashed into the house, was when I looked up and saw a milky white sphere on the end of the thing. As I was running, it must of appeared somehow on the bottom of the arm. It was attached to this arm. The sphere was see-thru, too, similar to the arm. This UFO star-like thing seemed to be in the material world and the arm and sphere seemed to be in another dimension. This was like a science fiction movie.  I couldn&rsquo;t believe it!  I felt like I was being scanned. I was being scanned by this sphere, and my only thought was ... &ldquo;I feel so primitive.&rdquo; I ran into the house and didn&rsquo;t come back out or look out the windows the rest of the evening. I can tell you that I had had a real earth shattering experience; things will never be the same for me. I still look up at the sky, every night, wishing and hoping to see these UFO&rsquo;s again. The next day something very unusual and strange happened at the License Bureau &ndash; no less,  of all the places. I had to renew my license and had to take the vision test. I don&rsquo;t need eye-glasses to drive, so I was looking into this vision-testing machine (it was a new one) and the weirdest thing happened. In the beginning of the test, I saw a series of patterns that I was to relate back to the clerk. I did that, and as the test progressed the clerk seemed to tell me that I wasn&rsquo;t seeing the board properly. Or I wasn&rsquo;t getting it right, somehow. I told her that what she was asking me to look at just wasn&rsquo;t there; that that part of the board pattern was there, but the part in the middle was not. I said to her that I think the machine is broken. She said that it had worked all morning and that there wasn&rsquo;t anything wrong with it. I gave her the machine (for her to look into) and she began to draw what she saw. She said that this is what is in the machine, at the moment, and this is what she needed me to describe. I looked at her drawing and recognized the pattern, immediately; I had seen this pattern and column at the very beginning of the test. I quickly looked into the machine so that I could see this pattern, too, and I was flabbergasted. It wasn&rsquo;t there! The column in the middle, the one she was talking about, was gone; it was blank, now - when I  looked into the machine -  with a white background. Her drawing with the column in the middle and the symbols on it, was not there. I started to realize then that there was something going on, and it was inside of me. It had to do with my unusual experience the night before &hellip;. I just somehow knew this. She didn&rsquo;t laugh at me or anything, just directed me to another building where I cold take another vision test with a different machine &ndash; the older type machines they had had the last time I visited the license bureau. This time a police officer was at the helm and I passed the test quickly and got my license. I know that this had something to do with my UFO sighting the night before. It&rsquo;s almost as if the individuals who controlled the UFO were telling me that they could come into my mind and change what I see&hellip; change what I see through my own eyes. Intriguing. They made me NOT see what was there at the license bureau clearly that day on the machine&hellip;.and, possibly, just maybe, they made me SEE something that might not have been there, the night before, with the UFO&rsquo;s. Who knows what it was I really came upon that night? The UFO experience seemed like magic to me. I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;maybe it was all hallucination&hellip;or maybe I did see something the night before, a real UFO, and then the individual controlling the object (probably from afar as I didn&rsquo;t sense a being in it) showed me that he could get inside my head and change my vision. The individual or controller of this experience, my experience, is God-like. &hellip;.Maybe all this is just me doing all these miraculous things, mentally bringing these things about. But what about the UFO my husband and I photographed a month later? My husband and I witnessed another UFO and actually photographed it! It was a different type UFO, in that it was a red/orange sphere&hellip;but that&rsquo;s another story to tell.", "A bright silver circle shaped object that made a u-turn in the shape of a J ,went out of sight to the south of my homeI thought it was a star at first, but it was moving real slow, all at once it made a U-turn looked like a big J.

The thing is that there appears to be another object just above and to the right of the entry point of the main object. Also, the point of first entry, just above the explosive car, remains visible during the event. It IS very interesting and understandable that it might not have been noticed by the camera crew or others at the time. It is moving at an incredible speed.

It  wasn&rsquo;t extremely bright or large&hellip;..It hovered past us at a very decent speed&hellip;. I couldn&rsquo;t see any shape really, but as this white light past and I was looking at what could be called the back of the object/light.

I think it was the same one&hellip; It was moving in short and very fast spurts in all directions/diagonally. When it would move, only the white light was visible.

The reason for the untimely reporting is simply because I had no idea that there was even a place to report these things to.  It wasn&rsquo;t until I encountered a second sighting of a completely different object (which I will put in a separate report) sometime during the first week of October that I started researching for a place to report.  Our local airport manager gave me phone number and web site.I live about 700 or 800 yards from the Oregon coastline and the western sky is over the coastline and the Pacific Ocean in general.  Approximately 8 PM, I was standing on my front porch looking at the recently darkened sky when I noticed movement to the northwest which appeared, initially, aircraft like.  A white and a red light in the sky, moving, at first glance, typical aircraft.  As I looked closer I thought to myself, &quot;That&rsquo;s sort of odd.&quot;  What I saw didn&rsquo;t really look like an airplane.  I thought possibly a blimp but I could hear none of the familiar noise that travels with the average blimp.  As the object moved slowly toward a more westerly position from my porch, my view became clearer and the object started looking nothing like an airplane or a blimp.  Looking due west from my front porch, I first sighted the object at approximately a 45 degree angle to my right in the northwest sky and seemed to be running parallel to the coastline.  Our local airport would be at approximately 35 degrees assuming due west was 90 degrees and zero was to the right.  Often time, jets leaving the airport take a similar flight path.  As the object reached its due west position, I could tell it was many times larger than any of the largest jets I&rsquo;ve seen here or even the blimps that fly over the area fairly often.  It also now appeared to be further out than I originally thought.  The object continued in a southerly direction until it reached approximately 120 degrees (my left) where it started to angle slightly more eastward and also began to angle more upward into the sky.  Until this point, it had been traveling more or less horizontally along the coast.  It continued this upward path until it flew out of sight.When I first sighted the object, all I could see was 2 lights, a very bright white light at the leading end and a less bright red light at the trailing end.  The white light did not appear to be particularly directional and seemed to create a soft glow or haze near the leading edge.  The red light was probably 30-40% dimmer but crisper with less haze factor.  As the object got to a more westerly position its shape became more apparent.  It looked to be tube like with the white light fairly centered on the leading end and the red light seeming to sit on the upper side of the trailing end.  Although we do get some thin to thick fog along the coastline, this night was clear and so fog was not the simple answer for why the upper and lower edges of the tube did not appear particularly crisp.  The crispness of the tube edges seemed to fade in and out slightly and if, indeed it was further out than it appeared, then thin, not quite visible fog could have been the reason for this.  The size of the object was kind of hard for me to tell but was quite large, maybe hundreds of feet long.  I would say that it was probably 8 to 12 times as long as it was thick.  The side clearly appeared to have the roundedness of a tube with the light that seemed to glow very dimly along the side from the leading end, almost highlighted like.  I thought possibly (?) reflected light from the town.  At no time did I ever hear any noise or sound come from it.When the object reached its roughly due west position is when I called my wife out to see it.  She came out and caught the last 3 or 4 minutes as the object angled up and away from the coastline into the upper part of its path where it flew out of sight toward high, thin clouds.  It did not appear to reach the high clouds and seemed to just disappear 20 or 30 miles out to the south and east.  The entire time of my sighting was probably 10 to 13 minutes.  It flew quite slowly for the first 7 or 8 minutes and seemed to speed up some (to not quite as slow but not fast by any means) after its flight path changed upward and inland.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I then called my wife and son to look so I would have witnesses.  As they looked the craft came closer and I could see that it was triangular in shape.  It was just above the treetops and made absolutely no noise.  It was approximately two football fields away from my house.  During this time we phoned my mother and she also saw the craft.

We were going to have pizza. Ahead of us the houses thin out and there was a section of about two city blocks where there were no houses, just grass lots. Beyond that was a small unused strip mall,some fast food and other types of stores. Beyond that was Interstate 57. As we talked we noticed a string of red lights appear above the dark strip mall. We could make out a form that was darker than the night sky.  To me seemed round with the lights ringing the middle. I would say it was about 30-40 feet across.The object started to move very slowly to the north west. I remember we talked about what it could be, One of my cousins said it must be a helicopter to move so slowly and hover like that. About that time the lights went out. a few moments later a small private airplane crossed the sky to the south east. We could plainly hear its motor. That ruled out a helicopter. The object could still be made out as a dark spot in the sky. It moved west until it reached the interstate highway at which it moved lower and went north along the highway. We could plainly see the traffic moving under it. It went north along roadway until just about the exit/overpass at which time it tilted skyward and in a blur was gone. We were shocked and at this point we knew it was nothing we could point a finger at and say &quot;that was it&quot; We talked excitedly and ran to the pizza place.

I spent a couple of days trying to learn to use it and took it out the following night. I didn&apos;t really know where to start or what to look at so I just decided to check out the surface of the moon. It was really amazing to see all the surface features, craters etc. About an hour had went by of gazing and trying the different powered lenses. I zoomed in on the moon using 25mm eyepiece which will focus on a 3-400 sq. mile area of the moon. I started noticing that about every minute and a half or so, sometimes one but mostly in pairs little black dots would go by as if it were some type of plane orbiting the moon (the moon was full). At first I thought that it was satellites that circle the earth passing in front of the moon, but then I realized that this would have to be something orbiting the moon itself due to the multiple times that these objects traveled the exact same path. The next night I decided to look at the moon again oddly enough I saw the same black dots mostly in pairs and slightly staggered but sometimes only one. I watched this for about 30 minutes, probably 12-13 times. These were very clear black dots and any satellite between here and the moon would not be this clear and so small. So I wrote some emails to astronomers and asked, thinking it would be something easily explainable. The response I got back stated that anything orbiting the moon would be too small to be seen in a telescope and also they knew of nothing currently orbiting the moon. I&apos;ve looked at the moon a dozen or so times since and have not seen anything.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

There is a very large window in my second floor apartment.  I turned off the television about 9:30 p.m. and went to the window to see if I could discover whether the clouds had cleared. These &quot;clouds&quot; had been in the making all day by the double-barreled tanker planes that produce chemtrails.  I was checking the sky because I was hoping to be able to open the windows to let in some fresh air.  Since I just recently found information on chemtrails and am still learning about this, I wasn&rsquo;t sure that it was safe to have my windows open if the &ldquo;chem-clouds&rdquo; were still there. While I was peering out the window into the dark sky, trying to determine whether I could see anything, a very large mass of light passed behind a chem-cloud showing me that, in fact, the chemtrails were still there.  I would call this a &ldquo;ball&rdquo; of light, except the mass was diffused behind the chem-cloud so I couldn&rsquo;t see any precise shape to it.  But my guess was that it was a &ldquo;ball&rdquo; of light. It didn&rsquo;t make any sound. This wasn&rsquo;t like anything I have ever seen before.  Stars and planets and planes all have small points of sparkling light that are either stationary or traveling in a mostly straight path.  This light was many times larger, like a huge cotton ball sliding down a winding path in order to stay behind the curved chem-cloud swooping like a giant bird, covering much more distance than a plane.  Its motion appeared almost playful. It appeared in the east and swooped to the west.  As soon as it was gone, about 5 to 10 seconds later, another one appeared in the east and swooped to the west like it was following the same identical winding path to stay hidden behind the chem-cloud. When that one was gone, about 5 to 10 seconds later, another appeared.  It finally dawned on me that I should start counting.  So I can&rsquo;t be positive, but I think that there were approximately 6 in all and identical in size, light, and path--except for the last one.  That one surprised me when it got to the west side, because it turned slightly and came back a short distance before it disappeared.", "While I was driving north towards Plattsmouth, NE, between 2:30 and 3:30PM, I looked up to about 1:00 in the sky and saw a big, bright streak of flaming ball.

It appeared for only about 3 seconds and also appeared to have possibly disintegrated into the air before it reached the tree tops. I think it was probably space junk.The appearance of it seemed to be metallic because I briefly saw a bright glare from it as if the sun behind me were reflecting off of it. The size of it was big at first and then seemed to shrink in size before disintegrating. It didn&rsquo;t leave any smoke trail after it disappeared.

Then I saw a flying object silently and slowly flying across on the top of our house. I was immediately struck at how low it was flying and how quiet it was. Our house was located at the edge of a hill, so I immediately ran up to the rooftop, which was easily accessible through the upper room. I grabbed a small, juvenile telescope from the upper room and tried to examine it more closely from the rooftop. By the time my brother and I were on the rooftop, it was slowly hovering across the town towards south and then quickly sped higher into the cloud and disappeared little later. Here is the description of what I saw through my telescope.It was completely silver in color, and it was an upside down T-shaped flying object.  A drawing would be better to explain how it looked like, but it looked like two large cylinder pipes stuck together to form a shape of letter T. The ends were rounded off. Although it was somewhat hard to tell how far it was from where I was standing when I started examining it with my mini-telescope, I think it was at least 12 feet in diameter at the base. There were no windows, doors, or any blinking lights. However, some black letters were visible across the bottom of the flying object. I still remember how the characters looked like, and even to this day, I have yet to see any human scripts that resemble those characters. I have gone through http://www.omniglot.com to find any scripts that may look familiar, but I couldn&rsquo;t find any.I have kept this information to myself over all these years, because whenever I would tell someone about it, I was made fun of, and even my younger brother, who was with me at the time, seems to recollect very little about it. That&rsquo;s probably because I was the first one with the telescope and by the time I gave the telescope to my brother it was farther away and he had trouble locating it on the view. I decided to make a report on this website, because I have not seen any other UFO sightings where letters were involved, and in this type of shape.

It had a strange light pattern, three solid, bright white lights in a nearly equilateral triangle pattern, apparently two wingtip lights and a nose light, with a square formation of four dimmer fuselage lights immediatley behind the nose light in a perfect square box pattern. It also had one red and one green light, and at least one of those was flashing. It was definitely a jet aircraft because we could hear the quiet rumble of jet engines, but they seemed much quieter than they should have been for an airplane that sheer size and low altitude. Despite the size, I couldn&apos;t tell anything about the fuselage shape because there was no moon, and the fuselage lights didn&apos;t seem to reflect off of the plane at all (black paint?). It appeared in the north and flew approximately northeast to southwest slowly and steadily with no deviations in course and no contrail. We thought it was a stealth bomber.

The sightings occurred at approximately 4:30 p.m. The crafts remained visible to the naked eye for about five minutes before disappearing. We were in the downtown area of Palm Springs when the sighting occurred. I was the first to notice something unusual. I was looking up towards the moon (which was clearly visible to me at that hour) when I spotted an elongated boomerang, or triangular shaped craft flying in a southwest direction. At first, the object appeared to be flying in a straight line like a normal aircraft. It also seemed to be at about the same altitude that a commercial aircraft normally flies while at cruising altitude, approximately 25,000-35,000 feet. From that distance, I would estimate the size of the craft to be similar in size to a small to medium sized commercial aircraft. While watching the unidentified craft for a minute or so, I noticed that it started to move in ways that normal aircraft don&rsquo;t. It slowly came to a stop, suspended in midair like a helicopter. That&rsquo;s when I pointed it out to my partner, who saw the object as clearly as I had. The craft then moved around its location sluggishly and, in what appeared to be, a somewhat erratic fashion. All of the sudden, two other identical craft came into view in close relative proximity to the fist craft. The three objects began to slowly &ldquo;wobble&rdquo; towards a center point. For about four or five minutes they leisurely moved around and, on occasion, become completely stationary. Once the objects reached their center point destination, they vanished from sight.It should be noted that the sky at that time of day was perfectly clear with exceptional visibility. Each craft was identical in size and shape to one another. Another unusual attribute of the crafts was that although they were shaped like a boomerang, they flew with the curvature to one side. In other words, the objects flew &ldquo;sideways&rdquo;.About the witnesses: I am a 47 year-old marketing executive and creative consultant to the motion picture industry.

They looked stationary, which seemed odd, so I got my 30 power binoculars out and went out on my deck to get a better look.  I watched these two lights for about 5 minutes which stayed at the same altitude (I&rsquo;d guess about 2,000 feet) and parallel to each other.  They were rock solid and did not move up or down and stayed the same distance from each other.  I&rsquo;d estimate they were at least 100 yards, maybe further, from each other and very large and bright.  The light emitted seemed elongated on the bottom side of the lights, so maybe the light of both was being directed downward.  There were no other lights such as colored navigation lights, strobes, etc. I thought this was very odd.  I am very familiar with all kinds of aircraft lighting as I was an aircraft maintenance specialist (jet over two engines) in the Air Force.  This was no plane or helicopter(s) hovering.  All of a sudden, after about 5 minutes of observation, both lights slowly dimmed down to about 20% of the original intensity.  Then they began to move, one going lower than the other as if a very large craft in a banking turn to the north east.  It then moved to the east and I was amazed that this appeared to be a single craft, not two individual ones.  The lights still kept the same relative distance from each other and sped across the horizon in a matter of seconds, it was totally gone in 4 or 5 seconds.

I was doing the usual thing before turning in, which was searching the skys for anything unusual. There was an object that was brighter than most in the sky, directly above me. The object was stationary and did not change in shape or brightness.  My scanning of the skys contiued for about 45 minutes when suddenly the brighter object, directly above begain to move and excelerate Westward.

I pulled a chair over to the window, which faces North, and opened it all the way. That night the moon was almost full and it was fairly bright outside.  The aircraft moved out of site to the west and turned around and began flying east toward the Sandia Mountains, but this time I noticed a faint orange light was leading the pack of aircraft.  It was very small, very faint and I could make out no shape, which was odd because the moon was almost directly above.  The shape of the aircraft was quite clear and they also had 3 white blinking lights underneath them.  I continued observe the jets and the orange light fly towards the mountains for app. 30 to 45 seconds, at that time I was observing them from behind the line they were in.  When all I could see was was the white lights on the jets an extremely bright light shot out in front of them, It was orange but extremely bright, so bright that it appeared bigger in size. It moved up at a 55, 60 degree angle and curved straight up.  Afterwards the jets continued to fly towards the mountains and out of site.

It was very high, I would now estimate that it was 75 to 90 degrees high, and had no contrail, no sign of movement.  It&apos;s hard to estimate how long it was, as it was very high. It was not a blimp or a weather balloon either!!  We lived very close to H&amp;H Guest Ranch, which had gliders and skyjumping on weekends, but this was a weekday and that was NO glider!

About 50 feet to my right, two Las Vegas police officers had someone in custody, possibly for illegal drugs.  My eyes were directed upwards and I observed an aircraft streaking overhead.  The flight pattern resembled a conventional aircraft, but this aircraft was a perfect triangle in shape. I have never seen a triangular shaped aircraft.  The next day, my friends told me that it was probably the latest in Stealth technology.  This craft had three lights, one at each end of the triangle and one light in its mid-center.  I glanced toward the police officers, and their attention was also directed towards the object.  One of them said, &quot;Wow, look at that&quot;.  They then turned back to the subject they had in custody.  As the object passed, two very bright white lights were flickering at the rear of the craft.  I don&apos;t believe I heard any noise emitting from the aircraft.  I am not able to accurately describe the size of it or how high it was in the sky.  I was not able to confer with the two police officers about further descriptions because they were busy.", "I remember seeing lights over North Bergen, NJI am watching a show called The Unexplained on Bio.  This show is regarding UFO sightings over North Bergen, NJ.  If I had not seen this show I would never report or admit to seeing anything flying over anywhere. In 1997 I was on my porch in North Bergen, NJ with my mother and as we were chatting we seen a group of green lights that suddenly appeared over the street in front of us.  If this was a craft we did not see the actual body but the lights (about 8-10 orbs)were lined in a circular formation and perfectly oval shaped. The lights were perfectly stationary for about a minute and then suddenly, whatever it was, tilted on an angle and just as quickly as it appeared it disappeared.  I broke the silence by asking my mother if she saw what just happened and she said it was probably the airport or some type of light show. She was clearly shaken as she started to go inside. Neither explaination my mother gave me seemed reasonable since Newark Airport is miles and miles from North Bergen and light shows after midnight are not likely either, however, seeing UFO&apos;s is probably just as silly so ever since we&apos;ve never talked about it.

As soon as they reached the highway, they abruptly made a 90 degree turn and started flying eastbound over Jacksboro Highway.  I could see them start to sway from side to side, first by raising the right side of the craft and then raising the left side of the craft. I continued going westbound and I looked in my side mirrors and saw a very bright light in the center above the four lights.  It illuminated what appeared to be the sides of a domed top. I could not rationally explain what it was that I saw because it wasn&rsquo;t like anything I&rsquo;d ever seen before.  I did not hear any noise coming from the flying craft above me, so I eliminated the fact that it could have been a helicopter.

There were no clouds at the time of the sighting.The craft was moving from North to South.  It caught my attention because of how fast it was moving, which at first was in a straight line, but kept my attention because it started making very sharp, random turns.  All of the turns were very immediate, with no time spent changing directions.  Although the overall movement of the craft stayed north to South, its zigzags were alternating east and west.  It also appeared to be moving at a constant velocity during these turns, until I lost sight of it a few seconds later.  The speed was faster than a commercial jet that was also in the sky and was constant.The parts of the craft that were visible to me were the three faint white lights.  These lights did not change intensity, color, or position relative to me during its flight.

This was located around Ione Washington about 10 miles south July 27. There were 9 of us that witness this sighting. We were all camping and it was in the evening, and getting ready to go to bed.When out of the corner of my eye I saw 2 bright green balls they seemed glowing neon like. At first I thought that it was a huge fire work ready to go off then I looked over and realized they weren&rsquo;t blowing up and they seemed huge about 2 times the size of a basketball. When I first saw them, they were in between the trees. I said, &ldquo;OMG Look at that!&rdquo; to everyone and I started to kind of freak out. I said, &ldquo;We should get the cam.&rdquo; but they started too move out of sight. So we all ran out into the drive way out of the tree line and there they were just hovering going slowly up and down and back and forth no real formation. It was kind of bouncy like, hard to explain. There was no sound at all. They started to slowly go further into space. This lasted about 5 min. or so. They were very bright in the sky even as they got smaller in size. They started to look like a star. Then my dad said, &ldquo;Look, there&rsquo;s a red one&rdquo; it was going across the sky pretty fast but it seemed it could have been a satellite at first, but it then stopped and went the other way. It then turned around and went out into space following the other two. Then they all disappeared together. We didn&rsquo;t get pics I am so upset cause they were in the sky for so long.

Almost forgot this part:  The next day we were at the beach, and then there was this super loud sound roaring like, when all of a sudden there was air force jets flying really low and really fast.

It was about 5:30am and we were traveling north from Monroe to Matthews on Old Charlotte Highway. We had just passed the Bakers vacinity and were passing over the railroad tracks when I looked over at her (she was driving) to say something, and saw what I first thought was an enormous reddish-orange moon hovering on the horizon. I remarked that it was the biggest moon I had ever seen in my life, and she glanced over too and agreed. She was not a person to get excited about ANYTHING, so she just kept driving. I leaned down to get a better look, and instantly realized this was no moon! It was the size of a garbage can lid held at arms&apos; length at that point (enormous!), and it was perfectly round and glowing red/orange like the the color of lava. Because we were still driving, I couldn&apos;t tell if it was moving or just stationary. All this happened very quickly. I knew this was something very strange, and tried to get Aunt B&apos;s opinion, but she refused to look at it or comment on it (she was just that way, ignore it and it will go away). She said, &quot;It&apos;s just the moon&quot;. I thought it was awful strange that it appeared to be &quot;on fire&quot; and yet, it was not lighting up the entire sky like a glowing red fireball probably would. Instead, it appeared to be just glowing, as if it had an inner light source. Nothing else looked unusual about the landscape or weather. It was very clear and cold that morning. I looked around to my side of the road, thinking everything should be orange colored, and looked up at the sky and panicked when I saw the real moon way up in the sky, white as snow, and the shape of a tiny fingernail! I begged her to stop the car so I could get a better look, but she silently just kept on traveling. I again looked out her window, saw the giant sphere glowing in the sky beside us, and suddenly, we passed by a stand of trees that blacked it out for a moment, and when we emerged, it ! was gone ! I tried to find a explanation for it, but nothing worked. It wasn&apos;t the upcoming water tower (she and I both agreed on this) as it was yet to be in view, and it was on the wrong side of the road. To this day, she has never discussed it, and gets furious if I bring it up. I did report this to MUFON by email, and they responded that it was probably a &quot;ball of gases&quot; since there is a fault line in the vacinity. I don&apos;t believe that for one second! This was perfectly shaped, brilliantly colored, enormous and didn&apos;t appear to light up anything else around! I couldn&apos;t hear anything, but then again, we were still going up the road.

Then I noticed that it would just sit still for a few seconds then dart very quickly in different directions. I then thought that it was very strange so I went in and asked my girlfriend to come out and see what I was witnessing. At first she said that it wasn&apos;t moving then all of a sudden it started darting around again. The light would change from red to a yellow white, and then to a greenish color. She said that it must be some type of military special plane or something that was making all of the darting movements and then hovering. She went in and I stayed out. All of a sudden it disappeared. I sat there for a few more minutes looking around and then a little further south and in a lower trajectory from me in the sky i saw what I thought was the same one but had just moved. After about 5 min. of watching that one I looked where the first sighting was and the original one was back. I watched both of them for a few minutes and the second one disappeared on me. The original one was moving up and down almost like it was dodging something. I thought maybe it was a comet that was changing colors due to temperature changes.

I saw what appeared to be an airplane light. It was much brighter than the stars, at first I did not think anything of it, but then I noticed that the light was not moving across the sky like it should have been. I also noticed at that point that it seemed to be flashing an almost red/blue/white alternation, except there seemed to be no pattern. It was kind of sporattic. So I started to get a closer look at it. At that point I decided to go outside into the driveway to get a clearer view. After examining the light for about 10 minutes, I noticed that it was not a stationary light. My first thought was that it may have been a helicopter. I do live near a Naval Submarine Base, so it may not be uncommon to have helicopters in the area. But this was not moving like a normal aircraft. It seemed to bob up and down fairly gently and occasionally side to side. As if it was moving toward or away, but it never moved. I called one of my roommates out to look at it, he shrugged it off, said it was probably a helicopter, and went to bed. I also called a friend of mine who lives closer to where the light was coming from, but his house is surrounded by trees, so it was hard for him to see anything. After about 45 minutes I decided to see if I could get any closer. It looked pretty far away, but I decided to give it a try anyway. I drove south toward the St. Marys River, which separates Georgia and Florida, just across is Fernandina Beach, Florida. I could go no further, so that&apos;s where my journey ended. It looked as if I got no closer, so I drove back home. When I got back to my house, I looked at it, and while on the telephone with a friend in California, I noticed that the light had moved slightly to the right. Before, it was a bit left below Orien&apos;s Belt. If you drew a light through the three stars in the belt and took it down to nearly where the trees meet the sky from my point of view, it was to the left of the line. When I got home, it was further to the right, on the right side of that line. So apparently the light moved, however it was such a slow movement that I didn&apos;t notice as it was happening. At around 01:00 I got tired of watching, and came in to write this up. As of 01:07 the light is still there, and still is &quot;twinkling&quot; and bobbing ever so slightly.", "Moving sphere in the skyI saw one sphere overhead to the left of the moon.I thought it was venus at first but it started to move south.It continued down until it disappeared in the shadow of the earth.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

They looked like shooting stars, except they were sitting stationary at what I might estimate to be over ten thousand feet. They were quite small due to distance. I saw three lights that would move around each other, darting back and forth, making quick right angles, starting and stopping. This lasted for about five minutes before they all disappeared, as if the lights were suddenly turned off. They moved very quickly, and then would stop suddenly, move slowly, then dart about. When we got home from our walk, I excitedly ran to tell some of my friends what I&apos;d witnessed. They had just returned from a bush party were quite excited as well. Before I could open my mouth, the group of friends were telling me they witnessed 10 to 15 lights that were darting back and forth, before disappearing after about ten minutes. Many people saw this event. I wish I could remember more specific details, such as an exact date, but this event took place over ten years ago. I should have reported it back then. If need be, I am still in contact with my friends that experienced this phenomenon. It changed my perception of reality. Having been in The Royal Canadian Air Cadets, I&apos;m extremely familiar with all manner of man made aircraft. This was no man made aircraft, nor was it a satellite, nor a cluster of stars. These were &quot;Unidentifiable.&quot; They were alien.((name deleted)) Montreal Quebec((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was flying out on an airplane at 6 am, ready to leave. I saw a ball of light out the windown and thought it was an airplane going over. I kept watching it, just observing it. The ball of light came toward me, getting bigger and bigger. I kept watching it. There was no noise. It kept getting bigger till it was about 7 or 8 feet across and at that point I realized it could not be an airplane. I was very afraid so I ran out of my room down to another part of the building I was staying in. I went back to the room about an hour later and of course it was gone, sun was coming up.  It was a clear day, no storms.", "Some thing go from West to East durning the shuttle launch.On 10/23/2007 we had some friends down for a visit and they wanted to see the space shuttle lift off before they left to go home.  I decided to take them to KARS Park on Merritt Island, Florida.  This is a park for Kennedy Space Port works and family.  It is about as close as you can get with out getting on KSC, 10-15 miles away.I was taking movie pictures with my camera and the shuttle had lifted off.  About one to one and a half minutes after the launch I pulled away from the camera and look up and saw some thing going from West to East at a high rate of speed.  It was bright and looked like a flying saucer shape but you just saw a yellow light.  I asked my friends and some other people around us if they saw it and they said that they did see some thing.I first thought that it was a chase plane to take pictures of the shuttle but quickly decided that it was not a chase plane.  They have land base camera&rsquo;s that can give you better pictures than a chase plane.  Also if a plane is in the launch area they will not launch the shuttle.  I have seen many shuttle launches since I live close to Cape Canaveral.  I have never seen any thing like this before.  I retired from the Air Force and have seen F-16&rsquo;s, F-15&rsquo;s, SR-71 and F-18&rsquo;s flying at all altitudes and this was none of those.I tried to get a movie of the UFO but it was so bright I could not tell if I was getting good pictures.  Once I got home I downloaded the movie onto my computer to see if I got any thing.  I found that I had about a second of the light but I could not tell what it was.  I looked at each frame that I had and each frame was different.  It was not a good movie you can not tell any thing from what I have but a light in the sky.I was so sure that the news would have some thing on this but no one reported any thing about the ufo/light.  I don&rsquo;t understand this at all.", "While staring at the sky from my bedroom window trying to sleep, I saw a object with light on, it disappears after a couple seconds. I thought it was just an airplane. But it came back couple seconds later. I took a close look. It was a circular object with 3 bright white lights attached. It was moving within a small perimeter. It was not spinning or blinking. It appears and disappears in couple second cycle. When it disappears, it seems to disappear completely.", "Orange lights appearing one at a time in a circular motion at a stand still.At first it was just two orange lights in the distance then as we were driving closer to our home it appeared agian but this time closer and low. The lights lite one at a time in a circular motion, the object was at a stand still, then it went away. It was nothing i had seen before but my father has seen it three times now within the last 6 years and he has experience as a pilot and there were no strobe lights or the ablity for a craft to move at that type of distance in such short time without hearing it. It was the most shocking thing I had ever seen or been through, personally I cried I was so scared, I just got this really bad feeling in the pit of my stomach.It was just west of Madison Kansas.", "Driving in upstate NY, I noticed what looked to be a plane without wings stoped in the sky lower than what planes fly it was stoped on our side of the mountain. When we stoped the car to get a better look it turned with out banking, it just turned and flew to the other side of the mt.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I could not see the exact shape as it was among the clouds, however it was so bright it was as if on fire. The object did not seem to be moving but just hung there. I was on the phone to my sister at the time and asked her to turn on her TV to see if there were any news reports about it but there were none. I would guess it was in the direction of Seattle some where down in that area, it was hard for me to tell. It must have been big.I am a health care provider.", "UFO sighted in Milton, VermontToday on the bus, I was talking to my girlfriend and she looked out the window and said &quot;is that a shooting star?&quot; I said &quot;no, its just a jet&quot; We then kept looking at it and I noticed that the tail of smoke which the jet left behind was staying the same length and was only a small white line... Another thing I noticed was that it was at about a 30 degree angle titling upward but it slowly moved horizontal and not in the direction which the line was pointing.  It then slowed down at times and sometimes would appeared that it jolted backwards for a second... It slowly moved into the clouds...I also noticed that there was no jet in front of the &quot;jet smoke&quot;. This sighting happened at about 7:25 AM. I am convinced that it was a UFO...((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate. Possible meteor??

Even at age five, my reaction was &quot;maybe police&quot; (and perhaps one of the adults actually said something to that effect). My brother-in-law and I ran out from under the cover of the trees to see and over the house next door was a large disk hovering or slowly drifting with a humming sound.  It moved over our friend&apos;s back yard and shown its light down once again, taking off at a high rate of speed (faster than any jet I&apos;ve seen). My &quot;uncle&quot; (parent&apos;s best friend) insisted that this event be recounted at his funeral in 2004 to make a point of his witnessing it.  He was an assiduously honest scientist who wanted the report to be made known.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

My daughter came running in all excited to tell me she had seen a shooting star (which she has never seen before).  I replied that was wonderful.  She said &quot;No Mom, come see it, it&rsquo;s great!So I went outside, knowing full well that the shooting star would be gone.  Well, I didn&rsquo;t know what to say.  The object was a pale orange ball, at least 3 times larger than a star, moving from west to east in a straight line.  It was sort of glowing.  It flashed bright at least twice.My daughter was upset when we got outside because she said it had been streaking across the sky, creating a trail behind it.  Her girlfriend who had remained outside, said it stopped and just started going slow.  We watched it for some time, until the neighbors tree obscured it.  I ran out front to the street where I could see it clear again.  It suddenly stopped and I watched it for a bit before it just vanished.", "Digital pictures of alien ship in Leicester NCI was staying at my sister&rsquo;s house in Leicester, NC.  Her house is on the side of a mountain with the eastern view from its side and front.On the night on Oct 28th, I was walking my dogs and saw an orange half ball in the sky, at fist I couldn&rsquo;t make out what it was, then I realized it was the moon coming up. It was such a perfect half circle in a bright fiery orange , I went inside and got a picture on my digital, there were white spots above the moon, which I took for stars, it wasn&rsquo;t quite full night, it was approx 8:42pm. Then I turned to the side of the house and the stars were so bright there I took pictures also, the next couple of days I also took pictures of the sunrise And captured what I thought were stars.
