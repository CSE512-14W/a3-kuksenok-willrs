["I also saw a fireball the night all the unusual activity was reported in AR.On March 9 of this year, I was driving my route. I am a courier for a pharmacy. This night, I was on my way from Little Rock to Blythville.  I saw a fireball that looked to be around the size of a baseball or softball...and was moving the same direction as I was...southeast to northwest.  I saw it out of my driver&apos;s side window...probably for about 3 to 5 seconds.  I had already seen it when I called my daughter that night around 8:30pm.  This means I had to be close to West Memphis when I saw the thing...and the time must have been between 7 and 7:30pm.  The more I try to remember the exact time and place I was...the more I can not...strange, considering I checked the clock when I saw it so I would remember the time...but It was fully dark.  That would have had to put me within a few miles of the town.  It looked like someone had thrown a ball of lava through the sky...and was losing bits of itself...these bits of what looked like molten rock formed a tail on the thing. This is the first time i have seen something this unusual.  I have seen meteror showers and shooting stars...this did not look like anything I have seen before...but whatever it was, I am glad that I did see it!!", "I saw a bright green light streak across the sky, leave a small white spark behind and dissapear before my eyes.I was at my desk this morning, I caught a green light in the corner of my eye. I thought it was a helicopter, it was moving very fast. I said &quot;look at that helicopter.&quot; But as I watched it streaked by i realized it was not a helicopter. It left a small white spark behind the light and dissapeared. It was not a meteor, it left no trail. Except for the small spark. It was definately a green light. This was at 3:30am and I also noticed helicopters flying around the area. I wondered why they were flying around that late at night. it was odd seeing that bright green light streaking across the sky. Again it had no tail or trail.", "Rumbling SoundRumbling Sound - At 21:30 EST, I was coming back from the Dairy Mart here in town, and as I was getting out my car, I hear what I first thought were four loud shot gun blasts, but they echoed, they sounded nothing like a sonic boom.  We have been have thunder storms tonight, and at first I thought it was some odd thunder, (but there was no flash) then I hear immediately following the &quot;Booms&quot; this rumbling sound, it sounded exactly like what we used to use in the theater to make thunder sound, (a sheet of steel that was shaken).  This sound continued for several seconds, again it was no thunder.  This sound traveled from West to East as it passed over head.  There was nothing to see due to the heavy cloud cover.  It definitely sounded man made and very &quot;metallic&quot; in nature.  The second it started I thought about the descriptions I heard last night on Art Bell&apos;s show.  The one woman said it sounded man made and I think I know why, it sounded like steel, very distinctive.", "no light and moved very slowlyI was looking outside of my window at work and saw a light blue metallic blimp shaped thing, moving very slowly.  It was very close to my window, 4 flights up and much smaller than a blimp.  On the bottom, near the back, it had a stick, kind of diagonal, and small.  This was in Manhattan where we never see anything.  I never found out what it was, do you have any idea.  I don&apos;t know the date, but it was 6 or 7 years ago.  Thank you.", "very bright light, large, no defined edges, no sound,changed directions.A large, bright white light, circular in shape went by me, coming from the left (the north).  It seemed like it was only 500 feet away. It changed direction and continued going in a westerly direction.  My friend and I were standing outside his house when this happened, and we both saw it.  The time it was visible was about two minutes.  It made no sound while it traveled.

It was above the trees, not really high up, maybe like a high kite can go.  It was perfectly round and was solid light grey exept for a thick band, almost like a belt, that went around it horizontally.  This band looked like it was made out of metal, and it had round green and red lights on it.  The craft slowly moved across the sky, and I lost it behind the apartment buildings. This whole thing lasted about 30 seconds, and was also seen by the other person at the bus stop.  He didn&apos;t know what it was either.  I know the date and time because I had researched this topic before and so documented it on my clipboard.", "Bishop planetarium ,luner eclipse, telscopes were set on saturn,jupiter and the moon.We were sitting under a covered set of tables when my friend  exclaimed &quot;WHAT THE HELL IS THAT!&quot; I then turned to the east  and looked at the sky to see a red object with a tail across the sky suddenly lost the tail,turned white,blinked and disappeared.There were about60-75 other people there but only the 5 of us saw it.one object with a tail was seen by 5 people, myself, my friend,and 3 other people in the eastern sky moving quickly,dropped the tail turned white blinked twice and disapppeared.Whatis ironic is that we were at Bishop PLanitarium for the luner eclipse with a news crew and all and they were just looking at a different area of the sky. My friend got up after seeing this to talk to people but I just knew the other people were too involved in looking at the planets and did not see the object we saw zooming across the sky.My friend is a nurse and I am a retired machinist.", "We were in our garage and looking south over the Santa Rosa Mountains a bright light was hovering at a great distance it appeared to have red, blue and green lights rotating.  we looked around and found there to be 5 other similar objects in different locations in the sky each displaying different lights in a circular motion. first red then green then blue.  I got my digital camera out and took a picture of the night sky there was a full moon and was able to capture two images one shows up green and the other blue.  when I pointed my camera at the objects and zoomed in they each appeared to bob up and down on the camera screen.  I was not able to capture any stars on camera for comparison so these objects were much brigher and had colors.  planes were flying by so we knew they were not planes and when i came out 2 hours later from the initial sighting the lights over the mountains were gone but the other lights were still in the sky. the lights appeared to move in an oval direction around the center but the objects were very far away from us and couldn&apos;t tell except that they were changing colors.  my husband, myself and our daughter all saw the objects as well as my daughters boyfriend.  we are college educated and teach middle school. my daughter is graduating from college and her boyfriend is a manager.  I believe in ufos but my husband is the biggest non-believer until last night.((NUFORC Note:  The objects are not inconsistent with twinkling stars, but that is a guess.

However, the glowing trail could be observed, looking like a &quot;glowing worm&quot; for at least a few minutes longer. Then nothing but pitch black sky could be seen. There was no sound at all. No vibration at all. and no electrical problems were noticed. This was seen from a car as we drove past the I-95 bridge and went towards the coast. I am e-mailing a map of the area for clarification. I am a registered nurse. I have never seen such an object in my life. My mother also saw this and even drew a pictue of it when we reached our destination. There was a nearby airport; perhaps they could have seen this on their radar. Whatever it was was burning up, slowly, as it traveled.", "inside the house, but could tell it was above usthis is so long ago to tell about, but who knows. it was a long time ago and dont know the exact date, but it happened roughly around september to november of 1997. I was at a friends house and we were playing video games. We were in the middle of the game when the electricity went off briefly, flashed back on, and went out again and stayed off for the duration. Several seconds after losing power, a very bright bluish light came in his front windows. My first thought was that a power transformer had exploded outside and the light s were fling sparks. It continued for about 30 seconds to a minutes slowling flashing on and off. It was actually bright enough to cast beams on the floor as the moon would. At the same time that the light was going on, a low &apos;humming&apos; sound was heard. It actually felt as though it was vibrating my body slightly. At the same time the &apos;sound&apos; cycled in time with the lights. Fading and picking up. When the incident stopped, the power returned. The game we were playing was actually &apos;saved&apos; and was not deleted when turned off. It  was not saved. The incident was quick enough that we observed it inside, but afterwards we went outside to seeif there was anything left. His neighbors were all outside as well, and nobody knew what happened. There was no exploded transformer, and nothing on the power poles that could have produced the light. All that I actually witnessed was power loss, light, and &apos;noise&apos;. Several days later, I talked with my brother who lives in Festus MO. Without telling him what happened, he went on to tell me that the same night, he saw something strange while in Arnold MO. (about 15 miles south of the city limits, 20-22 from where I was) He said something to the effevt that he saw whar looked like &apos;colored lighning&apos; in the sky to the north of where he was. Like I said, I did not see much, but the entire incident was very unusually and left a mark on my mind. The friend I was with and I continue to refer to it as the&apos;unexplained phenomenon&apos; when we speak of it. I wonder if anyone else reported anything that night. Like i said, other people on the street were outside afterword, and we all wondered what had happened. I never heard anything in the news.((NUFORC Note:  We have requested a clarification on the date, since the witness indicates that 15OC97 is an approximate date. The events seem reminiscent of the dramatic sighting that occurred over western Illinois and St. Louis, MO, on 04JL97.))", "Black diamond shaped object with two white circles in the center and red blinking lights rotating around those white lights. Object had a sharp silverish outline.  It was going from SW to NE.

Object made no noise.  Travelled at close to 60 mph (est) which seemed slow for an airplane, but thought could be &quot;Stealth Bomber&quot; since Richards-Gebauer Airbase was in KC.  This made no sense though, since AB is way south and west of this location.  AB does not base the B-2.  They were later deployed to Whiteman AFB.  I have seen and heard the B-2 since then, and can tell you that what I saw was not that.  I would estimate size as roughly front to back 50 ft side to side 150 ft. No blinking strobe, no navigation lights. I experienced no electrical disturbance, no time loss.", "Noticed a off grey triangle shape object moving from south to north just above horizon.Noticed a off grey triangle shape object moving from south to north just above horizon.  Object had faintly illuminated corners almost as if reflecting surrounding city light. Area between corners was dark but yet a different hue than the surrounding sky.  As object passed in front of stars or mountains it blocked them out. Object was traveling approximately 4-6 miles away in a line that appeared to be over the wasatch mountains.  It was traveling fast but not at break neck speed.  It moved in a straight line and made no sound at all.  I lost sight of the object as it passed behind a small group of trees.  It did not come out the other side of the trees.  There is a small canyon that is in a line behind where we were standing and the group of trees.  I figure that it must have turned up the canyon or changed direction fast enough that we would have been looking in another area than where it actually was.", "Triangle shaped craft hovering about 70ft at old kings and baymeadows-quiet hissing sound.A friend and I were driving East on baymeadows and saw four lights from what we thought was a plane. There are C-130&apos;s that fly around here so that&apos;s what i thought it was. But we got closer and the lights weren&apos;t moving. At the light of lod kings and baymeadows we noticed that the object wasn&apos;t moving. There&apos;s a bridge just East of the light and I stopped near the top in the median. I turned off my radio and rolled down my window and heard a quiet hissing, like engines but almost like rushing air. My friend and I looked at each other and I yelled &quot;Do you see that! Do you see that! It&apos;s HOVERING! It&apos;s not moving!&quot; He shook his head and continued to watch in disbelief with me. I proceeded to say it wasn&apos;t a harrier cause they&apos;re smaller and much louder and that was the only plane that I knew of that could hover. I at first thought it was a bomber because of the size but it was hard to get a good look cause it was dark out and I believe the craft was too. Would make sense. There were 4 lights in the front but they didn&apos;t help with seeing the rest of the ship. My friend said that it looked like a tringle, more like a bomber and I said yeah but they don&apos;t hover. After about 2 min it started to move away slowly westward. We continued on our way lokking back several times but lost site of it within a minute. It was approximately 70 ft in the air and we were as close as a football field, actually closer. I asked the person at the establishment that it was over(a couple days later) if anyone had mentioned anything and they said no, not that they knew of. When we had gotten to our destination the night of, we talked to a couple officers and told them what we saw and they said they thought they heard a similar sound but couldn&apos;t find the source.

At this/that time viewing the objects, they were seen at approx. 1 min. appart.The objects were comming from the South Southeast heading towards the Northwest.  As it came in just above me, the object made a Northern turn then it started to dim its lights.  This accured with the first 3 objects.  But the 4th object came in from the Northwest heading towards the Southeast.  This object also started to dim its lights. This is not the first time I had seen an object do this.  As a matter a fact it was totaly the opposit.  In 1990 at approx. 5:05 a.m., (at that time we had a full moon presint)  a strange object came about from the South.  The object would be about the hight of a tower with red lights blinking so that the plains would not fly so low.  Before the object took off,  it turned on its lights before it shot itself into space.  Apporox.  10-15 min. later, another object did the same thing.

A few minutes after the last of the boats seemed to be away from the storm, my friend said &quot;look a flare&quot; we thought a boat was in trouble, my friend who first spotted it said it came up from the water so we thought it was a flare. It was red, It stood still about 2 klms out to shore, it kind of sat there for about 30 seconds to 1 minute then did little zig zags then it went up on about 45 degree angle then flew a straight line until it went out of sight behind the nrth cliff of the beach yet it was still a fair distance away, the cliff just obstructed our view. We were excited as 2 of us believed in ufo&apos;s and the other 2 do/did not yet we could&apos;nt explain anything that flew that way or at that speed. After about 5 mins of shaking excitment we decided to go back to our campsite as we got up and turned around, there it was only this time the red light was flashing on and off as it seemed to be resting on top of the mountain/hill approximately 600 metres in front of us, then we noticed it was not resting it was hovering and slowly ducking behind the mountain/hill as we screamed out in excitment to the 5th person in our party, funny enough it&apos;s haze could barely be seen once he joined us. He kind of riddiculed us but we were shaking uncontrollably so I guess he kind of believed our story. It even seemed as though it did&apos;nt want him to see it cause the second he joined us you could barely make it out. We are no longer in contact with him anyway. The next morning my friend who did&apos;nt believe in ufo&apos;s (which to me gives the story credability b&apos;cause I know too much of these things to have u believe me, as my mother is an active speaker in this country on ufo phenomena and even regresses abductees) said &quot;I had a dream about those aliens last night&quot; I jokingly replied &quot;then you were abducted b&apos;cause abductions usually flash back as though it were a dream&quot;, what threw me is that she then said &quot;then you were abducted too b&apos;cause you were on board the ship with us&quot; Well that gave me the chills and I asked her to tell me all about her dream.....which sounded to me like a classic abduction but I don&apos;t know if u r interested in that part of the story, but to me it&apos;s the most important cause she described things that I knew others had described in other abduction cases yet I was&apos;nt the one that remembered it was the non believer who had no knowledge of abduction case histories. I was carefull not to feed her information as I have knowledge of people who are drama queens and make these things up. And I really wanted to hear if she spoke of things she had noway of knowing such as the appearance of the tall blonde female, who showed us writing that made no sense to us, on a board, yet we were shown this for some reason my friend said. She, my friend said the boys, (our boyfriends) were not with us it was just us 3 girls.", "Witnessed a object, first mistaken as satalite, until it changed direction.Myself and a friend were riding my ATV when I stopped to smoke a cigarette, We sat and talked as we watched the large cumulus-nimbus clouds roll west towards the horizen ,leaving clear sky behind them. I pointed out the north star, then turned. In the south-east sky I noticed a small white light moving quikly south-east, I pointed it out to my friend and told her that it was a satilite, as I have seen many of them on clear nights. I had just pointed it out when it suddenly made a 90 degree left turn. Which suprised me, because I have never seen a satalite make a 90 degree turn. At that point the object slowed to a stop. Then, took back off in the same direction, north I believe, then slowed to a stop again before fading into darkness.", "Identical to that described Thursday 4/6 on Art Bell.  Intense overhead close noise shaking the earthThis was my second experience with this type phenomena.  I was working in my office around midnight and heard what I thought was a huge storm approaching.  Thunder, lightning, wind - - yet when I looked out all was quiet and the stars and moon visible.  I am usually terrified of thunderstorms, yet when this came near I felt a sort of excitement.  I went into the yard and the sky was totally black above me (as it had been in an earlier experience at noon some months before.  I stood in the yard with this blackness above and lightning flashing to earth in a circle around me.  The wind was terrific winding my cafton about me like the streamers on a maypole.  The sound was deafening, a steady roar.  The thought in my mind was of a movie I had seen years before where a mother had drawn a circle upon the floor and sat, with her son, huddled within it while something like this was happening.  I thought about drawing a circle in the grass, but did not.  I felt amazement at my feeling of joy when by all rights I should be scared out of my wits.  I stood there and raised my arms.  The next morning I awoke on the daybed in my office.   At breakfast I casually said to my husband &quot;That was some storm we had last night, was it not&quot;  He said that he had not heard anything. I was leaving for the week so did not ask anyone else about the storm. The following week when I returned home my husband wanted to talk about the storm, but I felt a strong need to deny that it happened.  He said that when he went over to town (2 miles away)that the people were asking him what had been going on at our home in the night.  That the whole town was shaking and people were rushing outside and from their location they could look across at our home where something huge was over our house.  (We are located on the second ridge with a deep valley between giving visibility.)   He also said that our neighbor up the hill from us had come wanting to know what had been happening.  She said that in the night their house had lifted from its foundation and shook like it was falling apart.  The children were all screaming over the roaring sound and the family fled outdoors convinced that the world was coming to an end.  It was an old rural area with but few houses.  For Sale signs went up quite promptly and the people moved away.  The bulldozers came in scraping off the signs of habitation and a new subdivision began.  I have often wished I could relocate some of these people to get a description of what they saw over our house from a distance.  In neither case did I see anything. In the earlier case at noon on a bright sunny day it suddenly became eerily dark with the wind and roaring.  That lasted about four seconds before everything clicked back to normal again.  The night experience was similar in that the moon and stars disappeared while the noise and wind continued.  I do not know how long that lasted.  My viewing of it was probably as long as a minute and a half.  That was the length of my memory or the happening.  Obviously to arouse a town of people plus my neighbors and get them out of their home in the middle of the night it must have lasted somewhat longer.", "On 11/16/99 at approx. 7:04 pm, I saw a green/orange &quot;fireball&quot; streaking from west to east...it spit out 5 or so smaller round objectsOn November 16, 1999 at approximately 7:04 p.m., I was turning into my driveway which faces north when I saw a &quot;fireball&quot; moving across the horizon at approximately 30 degrees, west-to-east, streaking green/orange across the sky--a predominantly green head and mostly orange tail.&nbsp; When it got almost to the eastern horizon, it went poof-poof-poof-poof-poof, roman-candle-like from the BACK of the &quot;fireball,&quot; spitting out 5 or so smaller, roundish objects--all orange and green.&nbsp; I didn&apos;t see what happened after that because my house and trees were in the way.&nbsp; What I saw lasted probably less than 30 seconds--but I&apos;m not sure because I was a bit mesmerized by the whole thing!&nbsp; The moving object was about the width of 1/2-to-2/3 of a full moon.&nbsp; It was the most spectular thing I&apos;ve ever seen in the sky--which includes Hale-Bopp and northern lights!

The results of the analysis can be found on our website.))", "Low hovering &apos;ovoid&apos; circle of lightsThis investigation was a joint MUFON of Georgia and ISUR (International Society for UFO Research) project.  The investigation and interview was conducted on 17May97 by this writer, Tom Sheets, then Chief MUFON Field Investigator for Georgia and ISUR FI. A supplementary visit to the witness and area was made on 7July97. The witness was found to be a professional educator, female, 56 YOA, residing in Upson County Georgia.  Witness holds a degree in Education from Emory University in Atlanta, with various other educational certifications and advanced qualifications for teaching science subjects.  Witness was found to be highly intelligent, observant and seemed to react to stressful situations in a calm objective manner. Her home appeared to be well managed and immaculately decorated. Witness indicated her personal interests ran to historical reading and various sewing projects.  Evidence in the home indicated same. The witness stated that she observed the below described event during the summer of 1987, but had not discussed it outside of the family.  Her elderly mother, now deceased, was also a witness to this event. The witness stated that on an unknown night during the summer of 1987 she went out to look around the neighborhood for her cat which had not returned home as it usually did. About 12:30AM, she drove back into her driveway and parked at the end, adjacent to her house.  As she walked toward the rear of her vehicle, she noticed an ovoid circle of lights hovering over a utility/security light/transformer pole which is 75 feet SE of her driveway, in the side yard. The pole is 29 feet high.  She added that the ovoid circle had about 50-100 or possibly more orangish-red lights around the edge. Witness estimated that the size was about that of a child&apos;s portable wading pool, about 6+ or so feet in diameter.  She stood at the rear of her vehicle watching and noticed no sound and no other discernable effects.  Within a few minutes, the circle rose up a little higher and slowly moved a few yards away, over and then down behind some adjacent trees.  She could still see it thru the trees. Within a short time, the circle returned to it&apos;s position over the pole for about 20 minutes.  She stated that she had the impression that the lights surrounded some solid structure that she was unable to see.  Finally the circle of lights rose up into the sky quickly and flew off to the east at what the witness said was an incredibly fast burst of speed, vanishing in the distance.  When asked, the witness indicated that if she had blinked her eyes while it flew off, she may have missed the departure, it was traveling that fast. She further described the lights on the circle as appearing to be about the size of a quarter, and with a continuous glow.  No EM effects were noticed in the house or with the security light. At one point during this event, the witness ran inside the house briefly to alert her mother who became frightened and began locking windows and doors.  Her mother strongly protested when the witness went back outside. Local authorities could provide no information concerning similar cases from that time period.  The witness also polled her neighbors the next day, finding no other witnesses.  She added that the weather was clear and warm on that particular night, with no appreciable wind that she recalled. This writer found the terrain in the community to be mostly flat and rural, with Georgia pines predominating. An examination of the woods adjacent the utility pole on 7July97 during a follow-up visit found the normally expected number of stumps and dead pines in the same vicinity with healthy trees. The witness related that within a few years of this event she developed serious cancer, with major surgeries allowing her to survive. Her eyes also became weaker, and she was fitted with reading glasses.  She did not attribute any of that to the event described. During the whole of this investigation, the witness seemed completely truthful and forthright, and it was obvious that she was relating the truth.  In fact she was one of the most credible witnesses this FI has encountered.  All indications pointed to her being a highly respected and productive member of the Upson County community.

This fireball was headed from east to west into the setting sun, but no reflection was visible. I looked very hard at the leading edge and saw no type of craft and the fireball appeared to burn out or disappear into thin air. No sound at all. The amazing part was it traveled totally horizontal, was at approx. 45% in height, just above the tree line of neighbors house, and seemed very close, approximately 1-2 miles. Upon reflection, i wonder if this &quot;thing&quot; was taking off instead of burning out? The size and length of the &quot;firetail&quot; was the size of a cigarette, held at arms length.

I quickly realized that this was not a comet for it was not moving in a horrizontal or vertical position and it also did not have any of the usual traits of what I know of a comet.  This object was brilliant gold in color. Had a ball shape on the left side followed by a long cone shape tail or body (needle like) that continued to a point on the right. Given the distance observed I would guess the length at around 200-300 ft. Object did not appear to be moving left,right or vertically. I observed this object for at least 00:45 realizing that yes this is a very strange shape, brilliant gold in color and not moving. Without changing direction, shape or color the object then seemed to just vanish by fading into nothing.  The weather was clear, blue skys with an occasional puffy cloud.((NUFORC Note:  The report is a bit unclear to us.  We do not know if the witness implies a duration of 45 minutes, or 45 seconds.  Also, the sighting is not inconsistent with a contrail, seen in the distance, but that is only conjecture.  We do not know what the individual was witness to.  PD))", "We were drivin along then bam! orange light sooo close to us the military sez it wuz a missile yeah an orange missle floating.", "Very bright white to yellow lights lasting 5 to 15 seconds at various positions in the skyAt approximatly 20:30 hours I went out to my front lawn to check on my barking dogs, as I stepped off the door step I saw a bright yellow light about half the size of a basket ball at approxtimatly 45 degrees above the horizon, it lasted about 5 seconds and dimmed out only to return in about 3 seconds. This time it had moved down to where I had to look through the tree tops to see it and it lasted for another 4 or 5 seconds and went out. As I stood out side for a while (15 minutes) I noticed 2 military type jet aircraft at high altitude which seemed to be involved in some kind of dog fight training, as I watched these aircraft I saw the light again and several more times through out the next one and one half to two hours. Each time I saw the lights they (some times 1, sometimes 2) appeared a few seconds after the jets passed over and due to the apparent size difference the lights were either a lot closer or a lot larger than the jets, the jets appeared only as a small speck of red light (pea sized) while the white or yellow lights appeared as half the size of a basket ball. The duration of these lights varied from 5 to 15 seconds and 3 times the light went out for 2 or 3 seconds and then came back on for a few more seconds. My impression was that of flares but I can&apos;t understand why fighter aircraft would be using flares at least in this area which is extremly dry right now and prone to fire. I have wittnessed similar lights in this general area on 3 other occasions with-in the last 4 weeks but did not notice the jets on the other occasions. I am a 48 yoa disabled  Army veteran with 7 years 9 months as a military policeman another witness is a 25 yoa construction worker and his 23 yoa wife, all witnesses are high school grads.    Since this seems to be an on going thing I now have a camera and will be taking photos", "Witness and I both viewed an object which appeared very close then moved across the sky changing shape, then moved off slowly out of siteThe object appeared close at first(less than 200 m) it looked like maybe a bag floating in the wind, when it came directly overhead we could see that it was on a very consistent path. The object now appeared maybe 300 m overhead. It was eliptical in shape and perhaps turquoise in colour. It appeared to change shapes several times, like jello. It then continued away from us appearing to increase in altitude. We tracked it for at lest 1 minute until it dissappeared at very high altitude. We were having a conversation about what we were watching and could not come up with any reasonable explanation. We had shot a fireworks show that night on the beach and joked that maybe we caught someone&apos;s attention in a very remote part of the world. The sky was black and clear with a 20 km/h tradewind inland.", "Saw arrowhead shaped object, no light, pass near the area of sky with the moon.  Object was lit by moonlight or would not have been noticed.Saw arrowhead shaped object, with no light, pass very near the area of sky with the moon.  It took about 2 seconds to cover the distance of the diameter of the moon.  The object was moving approximately from west to east.  There were no clouds in the sky at the time. Object was lit by moonlight or would probably have not have been noticed. I would have thought it was a cloud by the general coloring and appearance if it were not for the fact that it was extremely symetrical, it did not change shape or fade, and there were no other clouds present in the sky.  The size of the image was about 3/4 of the size of the image of the moon in the sky.  I&apos;m just curious if anyone else saw something that night in the Pittsburgh sky.  A few seconds after witnessing the event I did hear what sounded like a loud jet, but I live in an urban area with a great many noise heard from multiple sources.", "Witnessed an amber/orange light silently fly over, stop for 3 minutes, moved again and stopped only to release 2 more smaller orange lights &amp; then vanish.My wife &amp; I were taking our son &amp; daughter to Chuck&apos;E Cheese in Lake Forest to celebrate our son&apos;s 11th birthday. It was a little past 8 p.m. when I was driving south on El Toro road. I had to get gas first so I headed for the Arco gas station near the 5 freeway. One block before I pulled in I saw a bright orange ball/light slowly moving South East. I told my son to check out the light. I saw it because it was in front of me at about 200 feet up &amp; 1/4 mile away &amp; it was a clear night. I continued to glance at it until I got to the gas station. After I pulled in my son &amp; I got out of the van &amp; ran over to see it. My wife didn&apos;t care to see this. The orange light slowly drifted in the same direction over our heads &amp; then stopped. At this time I was facing south. It was silent. The light stayed there for 3 minutes &amp; started drifting to our right (south west) which placed it above the 5 freeway. At this time I was telling my wife to please see this &amp; she wouldn&apos;t budge. The light stopped again &amp; then it flickered &amp; two smaller orange lights came out of it about 2 seconds apart. After this happened the light started to move away &amp; then flickered out. It&apos;s as though it released some scout crafts &amp; took off. When it disappeared it was like turning off a light bulb. A few minutes later I saw two military aircraft flying at top speed in the direction of the UFO. I figured that the UFO saw the military jets, launched some scouts &amp; took off before they reached them. My son &amp; I were very excited. This was an amazing event that took place. I knew this wasn&apos;t any craft that we have because it didn&apos;t have any other lights that are required for aircraft &amp; it was silent. In 1987 while I was in Miami I remember seeing this same type of glowing orange light silently drifting south &amp; when it was overhead it became brighter &amp; then released four smaller orange lights which flew in a &quot;V&quot; formation with the brighter light in front. It continued flying until it was out of my sight. I use the words &quot;light&quot; or &quot;ball&quot; to describe! what wa s viewable. I would have loved to see the craft itself.", "When leaving for work, I saw two orange, glowing objects in the sky. They were in the shape of a cylinder with lights in the bottom that formed an x.When I was leaving for work at 06:00 I saw two orange glowing objects in the sky.  They appeared to be about 3/4 of a mile away and about 200 feet off the ground.  I am a commercial pilot and flight instructor and can judge altitude and speed well.  they were in the shape of a cylinder much like a soda pop can.  I judged them to be about 15 to 20 feet in height and 10 feet in diameter.  The bottom had lights on it in the shape of an x.  The bottom stayed stationary while the top oscillated in a circle.  It was moving at about 10 miles per hour at first, but as it got higher, it,s speed increased.  It climed to an altitude of about 1500 feet above ground level and a speed of about 40 to50 miles per hour.  I watched it through my 10 power binoculars for about 10 minutes.  Finally one disappeared and then about a minute afterwards the other one disappeared from sight.  It was very cloudy and could have gone into the clouds.", "Silent black triangle the size of a 747. More acute than equilateral in shape. 2 strobes toward the back; rapidly flashing in perfect tandem.  Also red and blue-white lights around edges with &quot;tail lights&quot; in back.I was driving home from my part-time weekend job at about 12:20 am on 4-24-00.  I noticed to the south what appeared to be an airliner flying with a pronounced yaw from the south to the northwest.  What struck me was the speed, the yaw, the light patterns, and the altitude for the size of the object.  As I got closer I noticed that the &quot;plane&quot; wasn&apos;t progressing past me toward Hartsfield Airport to the North.  Finally I drove right beside/underneath it, and found it to be in a dead hover or maybe a very slow drift.  It appeared to be ~1/4 mi directly to the west, at an altitude of ~1000 to 2000 ft. At that point I really perked up.  This thing was the size of a jumbo jet &quot;parked&quot; silently over high voltage power lines just north of a trailer park.  As I looked closer, I could make out the shape of a black triangle that was more acute or narrow than an equilateral triangle.  Also the lights were not conventional.  To the best of my recollection there were red and bluish-white lights around the edges and what appeared to be red &quot;tail lights&quot;. One feature that I remember without question is that their were two strobe lights positioned toward the rear, but not in the corners of the triangle.  They strobed rapidly, in short flurries, and in perfect tandem.  As I was traveling south and the object was traveling north, I pulled off at the next exit and got out of my car to look.  I had traveled away from object at 70mph for a full 60 seconds and it was still roughly in the same position and only appeared slightly smaller in it&apos;s angular view.  A jet would have moved on much farther north. I have never seen something so &quot;out of place&quot; and unusual in the sky in my life.  I am a 34 yr. old college grad; married, father of two.  I have a spotless reputation in my community.  I am dying to know if anyone else saw this thing.  There were cars on the interstate and people in the trailer park that this thing drifted over.  My mind is still trying to come to grips with what my eyes witnessed.  I should also mention that I have lived in the flight corridor for Hartsfield all of my life and conventional aircraft don&apos;t even register in my mind as noteworthy.  I am an amateur astronomer and am well aquainted with celestial bodies and atmospheric phenomena.  This was neither.  I&apos;m at a loss as to what this was.  Feel free to contact me with questions.", "Ball of light eminating several red &quot;beams&quot;.As I ws heading west bound on I-40 I saw movement in the sky towards the south. I saw a brilliant light near the Monzano mountains. It seemed to just hang there momentarily then four &quot;beams of red light seemed to come out of the bottom and strike the ground. These red lights lasted only a few seconds. The object then accelerated off in a southwestern direction. I found this quite curious. The day before i had seen several &quot;black&quot; helicopters in the same location. Strange indeed.", "Large sphere, surface covered with different colored &apos;domes&apos;, so that no smooth surface was visible.In 1973 and 74 there were many sightings in this area of strange things in the sky.  On this particular evening I witnessed a red ball hovering above the ground off to the east.  It was slowly moving around, drifting to the south and then to the north.  I was wondering how I could get it to come closer.  Believe it or not, I decided to go in the house and get my shotgun, thinking that the bright flash and loud noise of a shotgun discharging at night might attract it attention.  Well, I shot off a round, and the object started drifting closer!  It kept coming closer until I lost sight of it behind some trees in the cow pasture behind our house (we lived in a rural area north of Wooster).  Trying to locate the object, I stepped over the electric fence that bordered our propery and stood in the pasture looking around.  The object then drifted out from behind the trees and past by me, no more than 20 yards away from me and only about 10 feet off the ground.  It is hard to explain what it looked like, and it was 26 years ago, but I&apos;ll do the best that I can.  It was about 12 feet in diameter, a perfect sphere.  It&apos;s surface was completely covered with &apos;half-spheres&apos;, or domes.  Kind of a popcorn ball effect. The domes were different colors, red, blue, and green.  What I remember the most is how perfect those colors were.  They were just so pure.  The sphere did not make a sound.  It drifted by me, and then angled up to go over the telephone and electric lines that ran down the road to the west of our propery.  It slowly disappered as it drifted to the west.   I&apos;ve always wondered if anyone else has ever seen anything like this.", "Waiting for the lunar eclipse at Bishop planetarium,I noticed it in the sky due east and didn`&apos;t realize it wasn&apos;t a plane at first.On the night of the lunar eclipse a friend and I went to the Bishop planetariumto observe it.  They had set up many lg. and sm. telescopes to see the event.  All of them were trained either on Saturn, Jupitor or the moon.  The night was chilly and very breezy and they had set up an area apart from the &apos;scopes with tables and chairs and partial cover to sit out of the wind.  My friend and I had been sitting there for a few min., I was facing east, she west. Approx. 9:30 I was looking at the east sky and noticed a red light thru the branches of a palm tree on the edge of the property.  At first I thought it was a tower light.  Then I noticed it was moving and thought perhaps it was a plane.  When it cleared the top of the tree I noticed it had a tail behind it and at that point remarked to my friend &quot;Look at that&quot;.  She turned and exclaimed &quot;What the hell is that?!&quot;.  This was echoed by the other three people sitting near us, a mother and her two teenage sons.  The five of us watched this red ball of light for approx. a minute.  It seemed to be heading southwest.  After that the tail disapeared and it turned dullish white and seemed to change its direction to a much more West. Then suddenly it was gone, but only for a few seconds.  It came back in the same spot it had been and continued on for a few more seconds then disapeared.  After talking about it for a couple of minutes between us, I walked over to the group by the &apos;scopes and asked random people if any of them had seen it.  No one had.  They had all been looking at the moon or planets.  I find this really ironic because had someone with one of the smaller &apos;scopes seen they could have gotten a real good look at it.  Also the local television crews were there covering the eclipse.  THE OBJECT: It looked approx. (proportion in sky) to be about 1 and 1/2 cent. with a tail about the same length.  It was reddish/orange in color then dull white.  It never glowed like a distess flare and definetly wasn&apos;t one.  Also it traveled over land not water.  It als! o was no t a meteorite.  I have watched the last 3 showers an others before that it it didn&apos;t even vaguely resemble one.  The entire event only lasted a couple of minutes, 1 of the min. I didn&apos;t know what I was looking at, the other min. with the five of us observing and still not knowing.  MY FRIEND AND I:  She is a retired plastics molding machine operator and I am a registered LP&Ntilde; in good standing.  PETER, I talked to you last night 2-17 about 3am.  Heres the promised report.  I spoke to my friend and she will probably send a report of her own in the next day or two.  You can reference it by the name FLORIDA SIGHTING. For the next questions: The object glowed about the same as a dim star.  It had a tail but did not leave any kind of trail.", "I witnessed a elongated, triangular shaped object glide/float across a nearly full moon.While standing on the back deck of my home, which is on the South side of the house.(the house sits perfectly facing North) At approx. 1:30 AM I witnessed a elongated, triangular shape glide or float across my view of the moon from roughly a SW to NE heading. I am located at roughly 35.717N Latitude/-86.5060W Logitude. The moon at this point was roughly 75-85 degrees from my field of view and I was facing SE. This object glided eerily and slowly. Each point of the triangle was covered in vapor or cloud-like material and the object was translucent. As the object crossed my view of the moon, it obscured the moon as if looking at heat waves down an asphalt highway during the summer months, but the moon was still visible. I also detected a faint oscillating or sound pressure alternating sensation in my ears. The wind was blowing gently that night as well. It was a partially cloudy early morning and particularly cool, approx. 45 degrees. I didn&apos;t report this incident earlier as I had dismissed it as an illusion of the elements (clouds, moisture, temperature) but after seeing Eric Martin&apos;s GIF animation, that&apos;s (more or less) exactly what I experienced, except not against a starfield specifically, but against the sky as it was that morning. I don&apos;t necessarily have a need to be contacted, I just wanted the data to be included. I have no objection though and I&apos;ll leave that up to whom it may concern.

We presume that they are flares, or some type of ordnance, used at the Avon Park Firing Range.  We are uncertain, however.))2 yellow stationary lights floating above Lake Jackson in Sebring, FL multiply in diagonal formations.Driving northbound on US 27, my husband and I saw a bright yellow light glowing above Lake Jackson. Suddenly another light appeared next to it and one of the lights began to fade. Seeing that no tower or plane sound could be seen or heard. We stopped and parked to study the lights. The lights were between 5-10 thousand feet above lake surface, on a clear night sky. One of the lights faded and suddenly reappeared and multiplied into 5 separate lights in a diagonal formation. The second light did the thing minutes later, upward and then downward diagonal formations. Both lights dimmed and reappeared at different points above the lake. We saw a small streak of light shoot out of one of the glowing lights to the ground. We took pictures but they did not come out. A helicopter passed by the lake while the lights were stationary and must have seen them.", "3 orange lights hovering in the sky east of Rockford, IL, on the outskirts of town toward Belvidere, IL.I was walking a friend&apos;s dog on New Year&apos;s Eve outside a home that sits high on a hill in the country, on the outskirts of Rockford, IL. I was marvelling at how clear the skies were, and noticed what I thought were airplanes stacked-up to land at O&apos;Hare airport (about 80 miles away). I asked my friends to come out and see this, but of course no one budged. I didn&apos;t think anything more of it until the next day when CNN reported that most major airports across the US ceased operations by about 9:30pm because of Y2K concerns. O&apos;Hare was one of the airports mentioned by name. The next day, I started hearing reports of lights in the sky over Rockford. What I observed were three lights with a glowing amber/orange color that seemed to hover in a triangular formation.", "Grey box-like craft, no lights, silent, being followed by a helicopterI was over at my mom&apos;s house after we&apos;d gone to see a movie. When we got back she had messages on her phone message machine and returned a call. I was sitting on the couch when I heard a very loud helicopter. It was so low it sounded like it would land on the house. Mom couldn&apos;t hear the person on the phone anymore it was so loud, and she hung up. Meanwhile, I ran out of the house to take a look. The chopper was just passing overhead flying from E to W. In front of it, and off to its left side, was a grey, box shaped craft. It had no lights. It was 7:30 p.m. and very clear that night. It was easy to see the color because mom&apos;s house as the crow flys is about 3 mi. from the strip in line with the light that comes up from the Luxor Hotel. The only noise I heard was from the chopper and there were lights on it. The object appeared to be about twice as wide as the helicopter and about half the length. But as it had already passed overhead I can&apos;t be sure about the length. By then my mom came outside too but the craft and helicopter had already passed over the neighborhood and out of sight. I was so upset that I hadn&apos;t run out sooner when I first heard the noise. Also, I wear driving glasses (for distance) which I wasn&apos;t wearing and wish I had been so I could have seen more detail of the object. I watched the news and papers but never heard anything about it. I wonder if you received other reports on this date from this area.

I was 19 years old and a first year college student at Northern Oklahoma College. I was plowing late at night because of the hot days.  I noticed a new radio or TV like tower at the west end of the field but I didn&apos;t notice it at the beginning of the evening.  The tower had three red lights and a white light at the top, none of them were blinking.  Then alittle later I saw the tower at the north end of the field, but I blew it off thinking I was confused and lost my since of direction in the plowed field because of the darkness. Then just a short time later I saw the tower floating and traveling horizontally across the sky with the white light in the lead.  The tower slowly circled the field I was in once and then it moved out of sight. I once turned the motor of the tractor off, a 930 Case with a four bottom plow, and listened but could not hear the lights or tower making any noise at all.   The tractor is a diesel and the throttle has to be turned down all the way to stop the motor, I did not however turn off the head lights. It had also moved out of my sight while I was busy with manuvering the tractor and I did not notice the direction it went. I remained in the field working until the tractor was low on diesel fuel then unhooked the plow and started home.  I exited the field to the north on a one lane sand road which cut through another field before it crossed an asphalt road running east and west. Then the same road turns to a north-south county road.  But the most interesting thing happen on the sand road just as I was leaving the field I was working in. A single large white light came over the trees north of me at the asphalt road and came at me like it wanted to stop me on the road. The light was the brightess light I think I have ever seen, it was almost like a thick liquid and I could not see anything else. I was going north and the large white light was going south. I was traveling about 20 miles an hour but, I do not know the speed of the white light. I kept waiting for the light to stop but it didn&apos;t and I waited too long. I thought we were going to wreck so I started to turn to the right and run through the shallow ditch and take what might come in the rough plowed field. That is all that I remember about that night.  I awoke the next morning in my bed and the tractor was parked next to the 500 gallon fuel tank in the driveway ready to be refueled for work like it always was. I do not know how I or the tractor got home that night. After breakfast that same morning when my Uncle and I went out to refuel the tractor, two F-4 Fighter Jets flew over our farm so low we could see the pilots looking back at us, they were going south toward the field I was in.", "And lo, the star which they had seen in the west suddenly went before them and came to rest over the place...On the morning of the first day of Folk Life Fest (1996), I was at the Seattle Center checking out the stars--one in particular, low on the horizon to the south suddenly sped west to a spot possibly over the Naval Submarine Base Bangor in Bremerton.  It moved too quickly to be a conventional jet, and since it had been stationary, accelerated rapidly and then returned to a stop, it defies what I understand about current satellite technology.  The oddest thing about it was that it must have been rather low in orbit since it produced sound similar to that of a jet, but without any sonic booms.  Shortly after its sound passed, a jetliner passed overhead from the opposite direction, and its sound trail was positioned only slightly behind it, whereas with the supersonic object&apos;s sound trail didn&apos;t reach my position until the object had already stopped.

It was a huge Boomerang craft. Totally silent. It was going so slow I thought it would fall out of the sky. I have time loss and had an implant so I assume I was abducted but have no memory of this. I have proof of the implant. But something made me throw it away. My dentist has Xrays of it. It came out when I had teeth next to the sinus. I do not remember the craft going away. I have since lost contact with the 2 others. But last I knew one remembered it the other did not. This is very odd since she was the one to tell me to run outside to look at it. Maybe she just didnt want to remember I dont know. This craft was moving from the south going north.

It did not leave any trails, nor were there any signs of propellers.  It made no noise and strangely did not cast a shadow as planes do.  It disappeared in the blink of an eye but i was able to observe it for a few minutes.  It did not appear to have any lights and as it was not dark you can see plane lights even in the daylight that is why i thought that was terribly wierd.  It almost appeared to hang in the air.  Not blimp like moving.  It was sortof just hanging for a few minutes and then shot off.  I was on my way to work at Stantec Engineering.  It was flying lower than a plane would fly.

I had used some distant city lights from his hilltop ome, and had then turned the telescope East to run a test against the brightest object in the Eastern sky.  The brightest star (I could probably figure it out on sky charts) visible through the city lights stood about 30-35 degrees above the horizon, due East. As I positioned the scope so that the target came into the cross-hairs of the sighting scope, my son exited the house and stated that it was 9:23, and he needed to get home to study.  At that precise moment, two faint lights, similar to stars traversed the field of view, due North to due South, of the sighting scope above and below the target star.  Using the moon as a reference of 5%, I would estimate that the two lights were about 2 - 3% apart, with the leading light about 1% below the trailing light.  When they passed above and below the target star, the target star did not blink out. I looked around the sighting scope to see if I could pick up the stars with my naked eye.  I was not wearing my glasses, but could make out a slight, dull blur about where the two lights should be.  I returned to the sighting scope and picked the lights back up once again.  They continued to travel in the same direction and at the same speed.  I called my son over and pointed up to the are where the lights should be, hoping to take advantage of his better eyesight.  He could not find the objects before they disappeared behind the roofline. This house sits right amidst the approach lanes into John Wayne Airport in Orange County.  At the same time, about 6 airplanes were in the sky for comparison.  If these were aircraft lights, the aircraft would have to be at 30,000 feet  (not the couple of thousand that is typical for that close to the airport), be two planes flying in locked formation (to maintain position with respect to one another) and not one (because the target star was not obscured by their passing), and each would have to have a single warning light (white) in operation. Has I been able to see the objects from horizon to horizon in open land, it would have taken the objects about 30 - 45 seconds to travers the entire sky at their observed speed.", "Caught in binoculars:  two glowing triangles cruising in formation in silenceI am a skeptic and still think there is some explanation of what I saw. I was laying down on a bench in the backyard with my feet twards the west. I was looking through my binoculars approximately 15 degrees SW from the star Vega (My hobby is star gazing). Suddenly right through the center of my view though the binos, I saw what I thought was a large satellite. I followed the object to examine the details. There were 2 triangular shaped objects in formation one following the other. It crossed the sky in a steady pace. Much faster than a jet, but slower than a meteorite. What shocked me was that when it crossed a patch of clouds, it was on this side of the clouds! I could see its shape much clearer against the cloud. It had a dim orange-yellow glow twards the center and they were not more than 50 feet apart from each other. It countinued in a straight and steady course dead silent from south east twards the north west. It looked like two F-14 with the wings retracted. F-14 are loud. I waited for a sonic boom but heard nothing. After about 5 or 6 seconds I took the binoculars off of them I couldn&apos;t see it anymore. A lot of things crossed my mind as to what it May have been. From birds to fireballs. But birds don&apos;t glow and don&apos;t cruise at that speed. Plus, I know a bird when I see one. These were definite triangular shaped, no wings. Fireball or low flying meteors? But with no flash or tail, in formation, at a satellite&apos;s pace, under the clouds. The clouds were altocumulus. I looked at my watch and noted that it was 10:48pm Anybody else witness this? This was Very strange.", "Large glowing cylinder object don&apos;t know what it was, don&apos;t wanna knowI was driving down 7th standard road heading for the Buttonwillow &amp; I-5 truck stop. When I turned down Tracy to head for the truck stop my car died on me. I slowed to a stop &amp; heard a strange electrical type humming sound, I looked up &amp; there was a cylindrial shaped glowing object out &amp; over my cars hood. I was scared but I had to get a better look at it so I got out of the car &amp; I looked up at it &amp; then I got a flash of symbols &amp; crazy pictures in my head. Then the next thing I knew it started to take off, slowly at first then it took off fast. I was so scared after it took off that I got in my car &amp; drove it at a speed of 120 mph to make it too the truck stop. When I got there I noticed it took me 20 minutes longer than it usually does to reach the truck stop. My watched stopped when I reach the truck stop &amp; looked at, it still doesn&apos;t work even with a new battery. All I know is this took a lot for me to write let alone remember cause I hate remembering it, &amp; I NEVER want to see that thing again.", "Two Stationary Bright Red Lights Over Phoenix AreaAt approximately 8:00 pm I was taking a walk with my children when two very bright red lights drew my attention.  These lights were stationary and appeared north of Chandler toward the airport.  The lights were extremely bright red and one was slightly higher than the other.  Suddenly the one that was highest just disappeared and a few minutes later the other also just disappeared.  I did not see it move at all.  Apparently quite a few people noticed these lights as it was on the nightly news.((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the time to correspond to &quot;8:00 p.m..&quot;  Source elects to remain totally anonymous.

Being in the flight pattern for Phoenix Sky Harbor, I lke to point out the low flying (descending) aircraft to my son. When this particular light did not have the usual accompanying white and blue lights like the other aircrafts, I kept watching it intently. I also thought it was strange and unusual because it was moving from NW and heading towards my home which is SE. The airport would have been to the object&apos;s West position. It appeared to be hovering as it moved, without any up or down movement. It stopped just above my home and shined like a brilliant red star. It didn&apos;t appear to have any body, however, the object was too bright to see a dark shaped fuselage of any type. I had my daughter get my camera and I took several (4) snapshots of the object with other commercial aircraft in the frame. After observing it for approximately 20-25 minutes, it disappeared.", "Formation of seven moving lights, curving quite fast through the night skyA friend and I were laying on the beach in the early morning, watching the stars when we saw a very strange set of lights.  There were seven lights in total, and they were flying in a perfect formation, it was a formation similar to a &apos;V&apos; which ducks fly in, one side of the V had 4 lights, and the other had 3.  The object or objects seemed to be quite high, the lights were about the same intensity as the average star.  I pointed out the lights, and we watched as they flew across the sky at a very fast speed.  I am not good at estimating speeds, but I can tell you that it was at least 3 times faster than an airplane; it was very fast.  Also, the craft curved through the air, it did not go straight.  It curved in abuot the middle of the sky, and proceeded to go a different direction, about 45 degrees away.   The formation made no sound which I could hear.  Please inform me if there have been similar reports. -", "A well lighted object seen from my window...In August of 1994, near ten pm, I awoke and looked out my window, and i saw something out of the corner of my eye. I saw an object that looked like an un-sharpened pencil, on its side.  It was moving very slowly, and &quot;towing&quot; another craft similar to itself, but smaller in size.  they were both glowing with a light that was somehow blurry, while nothing else in my sight was blurry.  After about ten seconds, it changed its course, and after about ten-15 seconds of that, it sped off at a mind-boggling speed.

We could see no other lights on port or starboard side.   Then it moved in a zigzag pattern again East Northeast for approx. 20 seconds, hovered again, And then it seemed like it shut off its lights and was no longer visable.

At about 1:00 oclock high, the jet was heading  north.  It had six star-like objects following it.  Moving at a rapid pace.  I called my daughter outside to see them.  The size of the objects were about the size of a ping-pong ball.  They were following the jet.  The duration of this sighting was about one minute.  My daughter and I went back in, and were in shock.  I kept looking out the windows for more objects,but none.  At about 11:00 oclock a.m., my daughter had finished the dishes, and the water had to be pumped back up again from the well.  As soon as I opened the door, there, at 12:00 oclock high were anywhere from 150 to 200 of these objects.  Star-like, shapes varied in size and shape.  This time however, they were lower down about 100 feet.  The objects went up and down and side-ways.  Time frame of sighting to finish on this group was aproximately 20 minutes.  These were bright lights, and they appeared at times to dance across the sky.  One object came fairly close to my daughter.  Within 20 feet.  She saw a metalic like center in it.  Since then, she has had several medical problems.  One being no thyroid function.", "20 foot, Tan, Oval object covers exspance of the visible sky in 5 seconds&gt;No noiseI was standing outside with my brother sometime in March when I saw an object moving in the sky, I focused my attention on it...It was a Oval Tan object (No lights/windows) and it stood out very clearly aginst the dark background of the sky so I saw it very clearly, however not as clearly as I would have liked to because it was moving so fast that I had little more than maybe 5 seconds to witness it, It covered the distance of the sky that I could clearly see, before I lost it behind a house in that time, I would estimate (this is only a guess) that it was about 300 to 400 feet from the ground and about 20 feet long and maybe 15 feet wide...The most noticible thing was of course that it moved very quickly and there was NO noise at all to be heard, It was very quite outside that night so I am pretty sure I would have heard it.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The sky had patches of fog.The first object was just a white starlike light that I viewed flying fairly high into the fog. I continued to watch for a number of minutes to wait for it to reappear on the other side of the fog. It never reappeared. The second object I viewed just about 3 minutes later was cylinder shaped and was flying much lower. It had flashing lights so I assumed it was a plane but it traveled in the clear (not foggy) part of the sky and I expected to watch it pass by until it was out of view yet it turned around smoothly and flew just a little bit more then it completely disappeared and never reappeared. I did not take my eyes off it for one second while I was watching this. A few minutes later a normal plane came by and traveled normally across the sky in the same path as the cylinder with the lights. It possibly was following it.

PD))Silent craft within 3 miles comes to with in 1/2 mile, very close to ground; observed for 23 minutes.07/07/2000 My wife &amp; I were just up at Red Rock Nevada and saw a UFO. We were at the area where we have gone for years (and never seen anything but stars) and we saw a Satellite. I said, if we check the time, we can see it again tomorrow night. So I turned on the car key to see the clock. It read 9:21, when I turned off the key, I looked out the front window of the car. I said, &quot;What the hell is that?&quot; and my wife said, &quot;what?&quot; I continued looking at it and said, &quot;That!&quot; she looked up and saw what I was looking at and grasp my hand. We just stared in disbelief. There was a bright slice of light. It was in a perfect triangle. The source of the light or light bulb like thig was about 10 feet around. No light traveled up or to the sides. Just straight down and it had a sharp crisptness to it. It was sweeping the ground traveling from south west to north east. The light was about 1/4 mile in the sky, just over the tips of the mountain closest to us. It was about three miles in front of us, coming toward us. The light swept the ground in about 1/2 mile swath. The light was sharp. That is, It didn&apos;t travel past the sharp edge of the triangle shape pointing toward the ground. There was a greenish blue glow to the east of it about 60 feet from what appeared to be a craft.  The glow appeared like phosphorus in the sky. All we could see of the craft was a blackness. Kind of saucer shape and kind of oval. It appeared to be thick It looked as though from the bottom of the craft to the bottom edge of the light that it would be about 6 feet. The light was like it was out over the front edge of the craft, pointing down. The blackness behind and under the light looked to be about 50 feet around and kind of like a saucer but a deep saucer dropping below the craft like a belly. The light, like I said, was a perfect triangle as it swept the ground. No light was behind the light and no light in front of the light. In othere words, it was not like a spot light that has an oval shape on the ground. The light was extremely bright and! we coul d see the ground where it was pointing as if noon day sun. But absolutely white. No yellowish tint. The devise / saucer seemed to be creating some kind of fog. but it just kind of radiated from the craft. It didn&apos;t blast away from the craft and the light left no trail in the fog it was creating. The valley behind it was glowing a bright white and we could clearly make out the shape of the mountain. The light behind the mountain appeared to be from another source and shown like sun rays out of the valley. Whate sun rays. The light continued toward us very slowly with absolutely no sound. It got to within a half of a mile of us and then in the blink of the eye, the craft and light were gone. But the fog stayed. The fog didn&apos;t sweep up with the leaving of the craft. It just hung there. The glow in the mountains continued for 10 minutes after the source was gone. The phosphorus greenish blue stayed for 23 minutes. After the craft left, the ground where it had been appeared to show brighter. I mean it was like the sun came out for a while. We could see the field in front of us and the side of the mountain that was behind it. This light faded as the greenish blue glow faded until it was gone. About 10 minutes after the craft left, a helicopter flew over. The racket that made, made us realize how quiet the saucer was. No noise at all. About 5 minutes after the craft left, all of red rock cayon filld with fog. The temprature out there was in the 96. We sat there for another 1/2 hour, after all signs of it had left and the fog remained. We pulled out of out spot and drove over to the fog and it was completely gone.

On Olgeby road there are a few house, and a Large Milk plant, most of the houses are farm houses and are surrounded by corn fields.  It was Early spring so th fields were just soil. I had made the trip to her house, dropped her off, and was on my way back home same path back just in reverse, I turned onto olgeby road and started to head down it, thise road is only about 2 miles long before it hit&apos;s S.Main.  It has so small hills heading up east and would be heading downward west.  So the road was higher in places, well as I topped the largest hill, I slammed on my breaks, because to the right of me about 35 feet tall there was this HUGE and I mean Huge Orange sphere hovering above the ground over the empty cornfield.  I stood there gazing at it out my passenger window.  I wasn&apos;t really scared just shocked that there it was just hovering there, there was no sound, and the light from it was lighting up about 50 feet around it.

Worth, Texas twenty three years ago.The date of this even as listed above was never recorded, and even the year 1977 is uncertain.  The witness to this event was driving a station wagon containing his wife and three young children - all of whom were asleep at the time, which was around 1:00 AM.  The vehicle was headed east along IH-20 about mid way between Ft. Worth and Dallas.  After passing some low hills located not far north of the highway the vehicle came to an area which was relatively flat and which perhaps sloped slightly downward from IH-20.  Immediately upon passing the hilly area the driver&apos;s attention was called to a location about one mile distant where  a series of lighted orange globes were rising up from the earth - one behind the other - in an arc which brought the string of orange globes to a flight level with the earth at perhaps 1000 feet altitude.  The orange globes were 20 to 30 feet in diameter, around 300 to 400 feet apart, and seemed to be moving at about 30 MPH.  When first seen, there were two globes rising along the arc following five already in single file behind one another.  A new globe arose about every 6 to 7 seconds from the same spot. The area from which the globes were rising seemed to be part of a large wooded residential area, but the witness could not tell what kind of buildings were present because of the trees and the distance.  However, there were no structures evident which were higher than a two storey building. The globes were about the same color as the orange color on a package of Hewlett Packard black ink for printers.  They seemed to be solid and rigid (unlike a balloon), and they were completely round with no appendages, attachments, windows, portholes, or other features.  The orange color was uniform over all the object, and the objects seemed to be lighted as if the surface of each globe had a dim glow.  They DID NOT appear like a balloon with a light source inside.  They appeared to be lighted from within their surface, and NOT as if lighted from outside the globe.  The globes travelled in straight, constant-speed flight - not moving up or down at all. No attempt was made to stop to observe the globes because it seemed dangerous to stop along that segment of IH-20 where there were no houses or businesses, because it was around 1:00 AM, and because the witness was tired from having driven for the previous four hours.  Because there were some major aircraft industries in the Ft. Worth area the witness at first assumed that he was witnessing the testing of some kind of air craft which carried a large light of some type.  But it now seems the orange ball itself was the craft being tested.  But why so many?", "2 craft - fast moving - strange design - unconventional motion - red light pulse mobilising the craft - would raf allow new jets in urbthe two craft i observed were 2 cylindrical shaped craft that were brown/red/black mixture of colours. the most significant part of the craft was the front of the craft which had a bright red light that physically rolled in side to side at the front of the craft and it seemed to be contained by a metallic or steel bar formation like the front bulbars of a jeep type vehicle - the red light was extremely bright and seemed to be propelling the craft which moved in a shifting motion from left to right as if designed to avoid radar observation inconjunction with the obvious light refraction at the front - both craft had this peculiar wobble motion effect which could indicate a quantum design because there is no other reason on why it should move in a non-specific way. before the crafts arrived there was a loud sound which lasted ten to fifteen seconds then the craft arrived one in front of the other about 1 minute apart the sound was like a metallic rattle which effected the trees more than any other objects - there was a gust of wind which seemed to pre-empt the crafts sudden appearance on the horizon- the craft headed south - leaving massive vapour trails which did not seem to dissipate for3 to 4 hours - the sky was clear and light blue because it was shortly after dawn - i watched both craft from my window looking north and the second one was closer and both moved at high speed much faster than any passenger airplane despite their unusual shifting wobble movements", "20 yr old paraplegia and 48 year old father.

I saw a small object make a straight line course down the valley, from the NE to the SW. It was below the tops of the hills on the other side of the valley. The object was very small, my initial impression was that it was a seagull, which I see a lot of around here, but this appeared to be traveling in a straight line, the altitude did not vary, it did not change course that I could see and it was much faster than a seagull. My impression was that it was closer to the other side of the valley than the side I was on. I can&apos;t say the object glowed or reflected the last of the daylight, but it appeard to be white. It did not appear to make a sound, but I-5 is nearby, and if the object were quiet, I could see how the noise from I-5 could drownd it out. The whole incident could not have taken 7 - 10 seconds. It was too fast and small to be a propellor driven airplane, obviously it was far too small, and also too quiet to be a jet plane, really too low to be any sort of plane, too quiet to be a helicopter, too fast and flying too straight to be a bird, going horizontal so it couldn&apos;t have been a balloon or meteorite, so, what was it?

However, tonight, again as I stood out on my back deck waiting for my dog to come in from defecating, I looked to the area over the foothills (approx. 1/2 mile from my house) where I had witnessed the light phenomena last night.... I did NOT see the light at this time, however it was 2230 hours, and I had visualized the phenomena at 0100 hours on the 29th.... However, as I scanned the night sky, almost directly overhead i observed what i immediately thought to be a &quot;satellite&quot;..I am familiar with satellites, in that I have witnessed them as a very small, non-blinking white light that moves in a straight path across the sky... It is my opinion that it is almost HARD to actually get the chance to SEE a satellite, as they are small and are not always in your area of the sky... However, I witnessed this small, white, non-blinking or color changing light fly overhead north-east to a south-west.  I verified that it was flying east-west via (3) methods:  #1.  The foothills I have spoken of seperate my region from the coast and the San Simeon/Hearst Castle area of California..The foothills are thereby to the west of me.   #2.  I have an online map program that verified MY address and located San Simeon to be (as the map verified)to my exact West...The object flew overhead and to the south-west slightly....Within about 20 seconds I saw a second, identical object fly in the same trajectory as the first (as if following it)...and within about 30 seconds, a third, also identical object passed along that same path/trajectory... I immediately thought that this was unusual because satellites do not tend to be so close together....For the next few seconds I did not watch the objects, but then when i looked above to approximately the same area i had first observed the first object, I noticed that there were now (3) objects (I believe them to be th! e same a s the objects I just mentioned), that at first came together (As if they might collide) then they began to do what i call &apos;dance&quot; around one another in a figure eight type or elyptical pattern... I watched the objects about another 30 seconds (I had already been out watching them several minutes TOTAL by then), but I began to become a bit frightened, as I had NEVER seen any planes, etc. perform circling/figure-eight type movements around one another...I went back inside and tried to inform my husband, who, again, was unable/unwilling to confirm my sighting.  I made an immediate call to your report line, and this written follow-up is consequent to that.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at some length with the party who submitted this report, and we found her to be an exceptionally good witness.

The object was a bright aluminum color with a domed shaped top and a flat bottom. It was about twice as high as the diameter and was in the shape of a cylinder.

He directed our attention to the object, which made no sound.  As it rose from the North, it continued it&apos;s path in a Southerly direction.  The speed at which it was traveling was that of a satellite.  It traveled about the length of the big dipper, stopped, then proceeded in a North Easterly direction. It didn&apos;t turn, it stopped and changed direction.  Initially, it was a reddish color, but when it began travelling Northeast, it&apos;s color changed to a grayish color.  Throughout the siting the object was not focusable, it was blurry, but it did seem to have a saucer shape.  As it travelled Northeast, about half the distance of the big dipper, it faded completely from our view.  My sister-in-law was a sceptic, until she witnessed this siting with the three of us.  This was a bonafied UFO.  If anyone else witnessed this, please document it on this website.", "Please respect my privacy.  The object was bright and changed directionsOn Sunday May 29th or 30th.  My mother, my brother, my newphews and nieces and me all watched a light in the sky.  I first assumed autmatically that it was a plane, but right away I knew it wasn&apos;t.  It moved slowly across the sky.  Then it changed directions and moved back.  It went north and then east.  It seemed to be harassing the planes that passed by.  Then it looked like it was looking for someone.  I then went in and grabbed my camcorder.  I filmed all over the sky.  But didn&apos;t see anything on camera.  Later when I put the tape in the VCR the object showed on film.  I was suprised that I had filmed it.  The object goes slow across the sky.  It changes direction in the film.  It also changes shape.  I do not want any publicity or our privacy violated.  This is why I took so long in reporting this.  This is the first time that I got a good look at something like this. It resembled the light a plane gives when flying. But once you see the film you know it is not a plane.  It seems to have an intelligence.  Like it knew what it was doing.

It suddenly appeared starting out as a tiny dot much like the Mir,  became larger up to the size of what Jupiter would look like, then suddenly began to become smaller and smaller and then disappeared altogether.  It went from North to South.  I thought at first maybe it was the Mir as my wife and I watch the stars at nite and are familiar with occasionally seeing satellites go by.  I have a little science background and to me, it looked as though a satellite had somehow begun to dip back down into our atmosphere, and then went back up into its orbit, however it never blinked, changed color, or looked like anything other than a satellite.

PD))Dear Sir:At midnite on June 24, 2000 myself and two others witnessed a flying objectthat exhibited controlled flight characteristics.  As a commercial pilotand flight instructor, I know what is and is not an aircraft. Given theextremely poor weather conditions, its location and direction of flight,the complete lack of any sound or proper lighting, and its&apos; very lowaltitude at a high rate of speed, I thought it would be proper to submit areport to your offices, which we did in July, although for some reason ithas not been posted in your reporting database.What is of extreme interest to me personally is the following report:Occurred : 6/25/2000 00:45 (Entered as : 06/25/00 00:45)Reported : 6/29/2000 09:02Posted : 7/11/2000Location : CALGARY, ABShape : Unknown BRIGHT LIGHT TRACKS FROM WEST TO EAST IN SOLID OVERCASTAT 12:45 AM A LIGHT DECSENDED INSIDE SOLID OVERCAST, THE LIGHT WAS SOBRIGHT IT LIT UP THE CLOUD.

IT DID NOT COME OUT OF THE CLOUD,AND STAYEDON AN EASTERN TRACK UNTIL I LOST SIGHT OF IT. ALSO THERE WAS NO SOUNDEMITTED FROM THE CRAFT. I CALLED AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL AND THEY INFORMED METHAT THERE WAS NO SCHEDULED TRAFFIC IN THE AREA AT THAT TIME.

He is correct on the wx at the time:  Calgary&apos;saltitude above sea level is 3439 feet, with solid overcast about 1000 AGLin heavy rain and lightning.  The object we saw was below the cloud deck,moving at about 300+ knots, was lit white, had no visible nav lites, madeno sound, and carried out two course changes before leaving the area. Itwas too fast for a helicopter, too low for a jet, and far too quiet.

As soon as we stopped, craft moved towards us..approx. four stories above us. As we got out of car, craft went over our heads, emanating a low humming sound/vibration. It was triangular with six or more white lights constituting the shape of the triangle and a red and green light in the middle.  Next, the craft slowly moved over us accross valley, turned all red, crossed valley in southerly direction, then moved east along mountain ridge, then disappeared behind trees. We got back in car and drove futher up mountain. Pulled over again, looking accross valley floor and saw several more lights moving along ridge, some east-bound, some west, changing colors from red blinking to white, disappearing, reappearing, swelling and contracting and moving spasticly.  Suddenly, another craft of same appearance as first- but much closer- moved directly over our heads. We were calm, excited and in awe. Craft moved out over valley joining other ones.  Some seemed to be circling back toward us at higher altitude and further away. Later, one- and then another- went over our head at slightly higher altitude than first two.

Abilene was behind me, and I was on one of the emptier stretches of the highway between that city and Ft. Worth. I happened to look up into the sky at some point when I noticed a large number of lights moving through the night sky. I saw many such lights over the course of the next several minutes. I saw lights on objects that seemed to be shaped like tops, and I saw lighted cigar-shaped craft. However, since it was dark I assumed these objects were simply normal aircraft (i.e., helicopters or planes) that I couldn&apos;t see very well. Then, I clearly saw two craft which immediately caught my attention. I could see them clearly, as they flew low relative to the other objects. They were cone-shaped, with the flat end at a slight angle. The flat ends had several lines of lights on them. These lights were steady (they did not seem to blink or flicker). They seemed to be gray or a dull black in color. The lights were white. One craft followed the other, flying in a straight line through the sky. I could only see them for a short while before I had travelled too far along the road and lost sight of them. They flew &quot;fat end&quot; first.", "Tear shaped object seen crossing the sky over Mineola, New YorkAt approximately 10:20 p.m., north of the North Star, we noticed what appeared to be a very slow moving tear-drop shaped fuzzy object that glowed very dimly and appeared to wobble back and forth as it moved from the North West to the South East.  We hurriedly retrieved binoculars from the house. My brother looked first.  He was apparently taken aback by what he saw, and exclaimed in a shakey voice that it was a &quot;UFO.&quot;  Nevertheless, I was sure he was looking at an airplane that was out of focus; so I took the binoculars and zeroed in on the object.  I could not believe what I saw.  It was not an airplane.  Rather, it was a tear-shaped object with a dim, fixed light at the top, and several lights at the bottom, seemingly surrounded by a haze, that moved together in an irregular fashion in a wobbly circle.  It appeared as though the object were tumbling across the sky.  It then turned some 30 degrees to the right, and eventually disappeared into the haze. We looked at the sky intently for another half hour or so, but did not see the object again.  I did, however, notice what I think was an iridium satelite.  It was a pinpoint of light moving steadily north to south that briefly flared in brightness and then disappeared. At around midnight, I continued to look at the sky, but only saw a solitary meteor cross the Big Dipper&apos;s Handle.  Although beautiful, I retired to bed curious at what I had witnessed. Today, I read several articles about an orbiting gamma ray observatory that is in the process of descending through the atmosphere, eventually crashing into a remote section of the Pacific Ocean on Sunday.

WE watched it for at least two or three minutes before my  wife started to call here sister on our cell phone and as she did so the orange light slowly began to change it&apos;s corse and began moving toward the south and eventually moved into a bank of clouds.

When my wife and I where married in 1994 in Los Vegas, Nevada we took a side trip to the North Rim of the Grand Canyon.  Unforunatly, because of our time of deparchure and the distance from Utah to the North Rim, It was getting dusk just as we arrived. As we headed back up the long plautue North in the dark pines suddenly a very bright white light pasted us through the trees going in the opposite direction of our travel. There was no sound, and when I looked in the rear veiw mirror I saw nothing but darkness.

After backing out of my driveway and turning the car north (I was not yet moving forward which would count out a reflected light on my windshield) I observed a pearl white lighted sphere descending down at a 45 degree angle about 15 degrees off to my left from geographic north.  Most city roads in Utah are laid out on a precise north, south, east and west grid so my car was pointed straight north and I observed this apparent sphere for about two seconds before the view of it was blocked by the roof of a neighbor&apos;s house.  In describing it over the phone I was given the option of describing it in comparison to a star or the full moon and it seemed to me to show a distinct spherical shape about one fifth the diameter of the moon from my position.  I have seen meteors numerous times and this was moving much slower than a meteor and much faster than any aircraft I have ever seen but it did travel in a straight line.  The light was not bright and the object did not leave a trail.  The object seemed to be moving north while descending into Salt Lake City but without having any reference points to judge its size, I can&apos;t say how far it was away from me.

I can&apos;t say I am a trained observer but I have had some experience and my overriding impression was that the object was over the west side of Salt Lake City.  On the chance that it might have been a meteor, I checked the Comets and Meteors website at http://comets.amsmeteors.org/meteors/june_radiants.html to see if there was any activity for tonight.

It was not (in my opinion) a regular airplane because there was no wings.  I seen this craft cruising around 5 m.p.h. seemingly because of its altitude.  I grabbed my camera and managed to take three pictures of it before it vanished.  This craft was flying in a straight south to north direction The second craft was see while again waiting for a city bus at the corner of S.W. 5th ave and S.W. Washington Street.  This object was much closer to the ground and appeared to be cruising at about 5 m.p.h. also, this craft had no wings.  I could see more detail but was not able to tell that much about it because I was not wearing my glasses at the time.  This craft appeared at around 3:52 p.m. and both objects were seen over Downtown Portland.  I was not able to get pictures of this craft because I was viewing it between buildings as it was flying.  Both objects did not emit sound.", "This time I went out to a hill to try to video tape the UFO again. And it came back at about the same time. I video taped the red UFO for this time for about 10min. This time I caught a shot of the thing that was better than the night before. It was a red UFO over the city, and then it was gone.((NUFORC Note:  This witness is experienced in photographing anomalous events, and works with another party in Glendale.

The weather was hazy with only a few clouds at several altitudes. We were at 22,000 feet when our radar facility called and informed us that they had a primary target south bound at 350 knots approximaely 150 miles west of Tampa Bay. We were vectored to the target as we decended out of altitude. The radar center informed us that they had checked with all the military bases along the coast in Florida, Mississippi and Louisiana and noone could identify the unknown target. My aircraft is equiped with an F-16 fighter radar and FLIR (Forward Looking Infared) sensors. Shortly after being given vectors we locked up a south bound target at 390 knots, 300 feet off the water. We were established on a head on intercept with the target at 55 miles. As we closed and off set the target, it made a 90 degree left turn east bound and exited our scope in a matter of seconds. I turned right to reaquire the target and again locked it up at 25 miles heading east at now 670 knots. I initally thouhgt it was a radar glitch but every turn, speed change, and heading change was verified by 3 different radars. My aircraft radar, and 2 other radar systems. The target slowed and we closed to within 15 miles of it, it then stopped, reversed course 180 degrees and then made an imediate 90 degree right turn north bound again and accelerated to 1100 knots. It stopped made a 120 degree heading change and accelerated again to close to 900 knots coming at us. I tried to manuver our aircraft to keep it on radar as much as possible and to get a flir image on tape but due to a haze layer it was impossible. The radar image taping system was non operational on this aircraft at the time of the incident. This chasing around the gulf went on for 25 minutes or so and the last call I got from radar was that the target was heading east bound accelerating. I turned and locked up the target east bound accelerating through 1100 knots and climbing! at a ve ry high rate of speed till it just blew off the aircraft scope. That was the last time I saw it on radar. We never got close enough to get a visual on the object. There was never a mode squak from the target and the manuvers were something like I had never seen. I have been flying since 1976 and have extensive military and civilian experience. I waited this long becasue of the reasons we were out in the gulf and why we were where we were.", "i saw a red light in the south eastern sky it was stationary for 3 minites &amp; then appeared to land this light was diffrent than the one i saw on 7/12/00 it was in close below the clouds it appeared to be coming tward me &amp; than it decented  at a rapid rate this could have been a flair", "Looked like shooting star, but then changed direction by 90 degrees as it flew across the skiesI was lying in bed and looking out at the sky when I saw this big shooting star, I watched it go across the sky, very fast, then it turned 90 degrees(from south heading north,) then turning and flying directly east.

We all looked up and saw 10 &quot;stars&quot; moving together West-bound coming from the Atlantic Ocean at incredible speed. We all immediately saw them and began tracking them. they followed each other in a very tight group, and then suddenly burst into different directions. Several went below the light horizon for a while, but the others traced circular patterns in the sky. Thinkng they might be birds reflecting light, we broke out the binoculars and the telescope that we had, and through them we saw that they were too high and far to be birds, and that they were emitting their own light, not reflecting other light. They then rejoined and &quot;flew&quot; southward and disappeared. 10 minutes later they reappeared in the same place that they originally entered and broke into three groups-two groups of three and one group of four. They all traveled in a generally northern direction, but not all at the same time. after 15 more minutes of watching, only three were left visible.

As I watched it, it travelled east across the sky until it was beyond the eastern horizon. The event lasted about 90 seconds, allowing me time to get binoculars from the trunk of my car and watch it travel. The altitude remained constant throughout my observation as did the object&apos;s speed. The object appeared to be very far away, orange in color, with a &quot;tail&quot;. The object appeared to be very hot or burning because as I looked at it through the binoculars it appeared to have smaller pieces falling from the &quot;tail&quot; and they too would create a tail, but they would drop in altitude.

I observed a round shape approach from the west moving to the east.  The shape was glowing a dull red and was the size of a dime held out at arms length.  It gave the impression of being at very high alltitude.  The shape moved at a rapid rate towards the east until it was approx. 3/4 across the sky then made a sweeping 90 degree turn and headed south.  The shape showed no sign of decreasing speed when it executed the turn, the manuver took no more than 1-2 seconds.  As the shape moved off to the south it faded away.  There was no sound associated with the shape.  The shape also showed no navigation lights or strobes as would be displayed by an aircraft, there were no lights other than the dull glowing red color the was evenly distributed over the entire shape.

When looking out of the car window we observed a single orange, flame like object in the sky above the Burton Dasset hills in Oxfordshire. It was approximatley 2 miles distance and was heading in our direction. As we watched it grew into 2 orange lights which appeared to be travelling at high speed. It was below cloud height and above the Burton Dasset hills which have been known to have unusual occurrances in the past. After a couple of minutes one of the orange lights just disappeared and then the other. There was no logical reason for the lights to be there as the area was rural with no houses or other buildings in the vicinity. There was no sound but it appeared that the orange light was emitting an auroa around itself before it disappeared from view.((NUFORC Note:  We presume the witness uses the European convention for a numerical date.

The craft was silver metallic in some areas and dark gray metallic in other areas.  There was no center light on the bottom.  There were small lights on the bottom and on one row in the side of the craft.  The lights changed color in intensity and in hue, but not dramatically.  There were no green lights and there were no red lights.  The craft was a perfect square as seen directly from the bottom.  The craft was a flattened diamond shape as seen from the side.  The craft clearly had three or four levels on the bottom and on the top, each section smaller than the larger primary section which formed the main body of the craft.  There was absolutely no sound.  There was a feeling of static electricity in the air close to the craft.  The craft came upon us fast.  Then it hovered over our heads, about thirty feet away.  Then it slowly moved away, returning in the same direction that it had come.  The craft appeared to be about 50 feet X 50 feet square, each side being about 50 feet long.

The weather was clear and warm, and the sun had just set.  As we were driving past the &quot;Mud Bay&quot; area north of White Rock, I gazed out the passenger side window and saw a bright light in the sky to the southwest.  At first I thought it was a plane on approach to Vancouver International Airport, or maybe a very bright star.  However, as we got closer and I watched it the object appeared to be immobile, and was closer than I had at first thought.  It was a bright, white light and was hovering over the bay, between where we were driving and the Pt. Roberts area.  I am not good at estimating height but I would say it was no higher than 1,500-2000 feet off the ground.  The light reflected into the bay.  I strained to look for any other lights that would indicate it was an airplane or helicopter, but it simply was a very bright ball of light.  It looked like a very bright star, just very low and very close.  After I had decided it wasn&apos;t an airplane or helicopter I pointed it out to my husband.  He was driving so couldn&apos;t examine it closely, but we both observed it hovering silently for at least 10 minutes until we had passed it.  We could still see it in the rear view mirror until a hill obstructed its view.  We wanted to investigate further but were late getting home to the babysitter.", "A small, white object followed a plane about to land at the Charlotte airport.I was on a flight from Houston to Charlotte when I saw the object. (since I live in Houston, I have no idea of the zip code or county) It was egg shaped except that it had a flat top. I was able to make a good determination of its size by watching it fly through clouds. The result- 5 feet tall, 2 feet wide. I only observed it for a minute, but it seemed to be flying parallel to the plane. Whenever the plane would turn, it would stay in the same place. It sped up sometimes, and I lost sight of it about 30 seconds before we landed. I was able to determine that it was a real object (because of the clouds), but it could be a strange remotely piloted terrestrial craft. However, I could not determine the object&apos;s propulsion system, and I don&apos;t think something that size can fly that fast. I made sound observations, and there&apos;s no question in my mind that I saw a solid object that wasn&apos;t an airplane. But here&apos;s the problem- I was reading Above Top Secret by Timothy Good on the flight. I don&apos;t think it impaired my ability to see, but Phil Klass might say otherwise.", "I saw a round metalic object that had indentations.  It was moved slowly across the sky.  the object appeared to move under its own power. It was moving too fast and travelling in to deliberate fashion to have been a balloon.

It was an almost pure white,but had a little silver. It didn&apos;t look as though the object was moving so I kinda thought it was a balloon but the winds were strong outside so if it was a balloon it would have moved faster, but in the sky it was the size of a balloon about 50 meters up...when the coulds moved towards it I saw that the clouds were below it and not above!! that&apos;s when I knew it had to be big,and that it was not a natural craft that you see above the clouds!{it looked about the distance a large jetliner would normally be above the clouds}..I tryed to show my family members but when I looked up I had lost it! and I knew the cloud that it was behind..so it had to move fast when I was not looking for the 5 seconds!!((NUFORC Note:  Please see report from Ketchikan, AK, for same date.

The light was the color of a car tailight, larger than any planet, star, or airplane light, and was approximately 30 degrees above the horizon in the north sky.  The light drifted slowly upward for a couple minutes.  The light then began to dim and brighten slowly, eventually flickered and disappeared.  After, in the northwest sky (near Sky Harbor airport) just above the houses, we saw another light of the same description.  Over the course of approximately 15 minutes the light drifted slowly eastward and upward to a similar position as the first light.  The light then dimmed, brightened, flickered and disappeared just like the first one.  During this time the air traffic in the area was greatly decreased.  A couple weeks before, one of the six witnesses stated he saw a similar light (unknown time).  On Saturday 6/10/00, I was outside about 8:15pm when I witnessed the same light in the north sky, this time approximately 45 degrees   above the horizon.

Made my coffee and went out on my porch to drink coffee and smoke a morning cigarette. From my apartment I have a good open view. As I did a pan view I saw a dark grey object just to the right but a good distance in back of the closest tree. When I first saw it, I thought what the hell is that. I sat there and stared at the object seeing if it was moving. It might have been slightly but maybe not at all. I thought maybe I should grab my camera, But like a fool I figured maybe it is just a balloon from a carlot or something like that.

The event lasted for over 2 hours and continued even after we left the park when it closed at 10 pm. The lights were rising in altitude about 25-35 degrees off the horizon, hovering, and descending below the dunes as they changed formation. They seemed to remain only in the southern quadrant of the sky keeping the same distance from us. There was no noise and only once, for 10 minutes, did I notice 2 circling aircraft (that seemed very small compared to the lights) in their vicinity. It could have been some desert military exercises with helicopters, but I never saw any strobes or nav. lights, and the movements/formations seeemed unusual behavior for helicopters unless they were practicing for some blue-angel air-show event. It just didn&apos;t seem to be the way helicopters would support ground troops at night. The movements were not quick, but deliberate, and seemed to be precisely mathmatically coriagraphed. The lights seemed to have two stages, shaped like an hourglass, self illumined, not attached to any structural object, very intense, unwavering, steady, piercing, never did they turn off and on, turn away from us, they were always on, face to us, and only disappeared when descending below the dunes. The diamond formation was especially visually pleasing, and overall the serenity of the twilight&gt;night white sand afterglow, starlit, clear desert sky with the dancing lights made for a serene, spectacular, and awe inspired evening. There seemed to be no unusual concern, outside of the 2 briefly circling jets, from Holoman AFB five miles to the east of white sands, and after watching the strange lights for a couple of hours it just seemed as no big deal for us either, almost as commonplace as the sunset, and as beautiful. This did occur strange to me the next day when thinking about it.

Possibly a second sighting.I have pasted the sighting information I am referring to at the end of my account regarding same.  I respond to this as a possible additional witness to this event, my account is as follows:  I was working as a long haul truck driver and viewed this &quot;thing&quot; from the north bound New Jersey Turnpike, off and on, between Newark International Airport and exit 3 where I was to exit the turnpike, and proceed west to my destination.  My reference to seeing the object &quot;off and on&quot;, has to do with observing it, and continuing to drive the vehicle, not that the object would disappear and reappear.  I too am unsure of the exact date, however, after coming across this, I will be digging out my old log books to pinpoint it precisely. I was able to view it consistently for about 3 or 4 minutes when I had to sit stopped in traffic at exit 3.  It was at this time I was also able to further verify, in my mind, that I was seeing something, I did not know what it was.  I even tried to see if the event was being reported on the FM radio in the truck by hitting the scan button, as well as a radio scanner I had in the vehicle, finally, of course the C.B.  My search of the airwaves on the radios yielded nothing out of the ordinary.  I also wondered if any one in New York City was looking up that day since I was not hearing outside news of this event. This &quot;thing&quot; was egg or blimp shaped and dull silver in color.  It was, from my vantage point at exit 3, hovering then moving slowly forward and back, in front of the World Trade Center Towers.  As I observed it during my travel from where I first saw it, (Newark International Airport), until I got stopped in traffic at exit 3, I figured it was a small blimp, or balloon used for advertising.  When I got stopped in traffic at exit 3 and able to study the object closer, IE: with out distraction, I assured myself it was NOT a blimp or a balloon.  It had no fins, no control gondola, no appendages of any kind that you would expect to see on a balloon or blimp, nor did it have any advertising on it.  As I continued to watch this &quot;thing&quot; a white Bell Jet Ranger helicopter approached it, and appeared to be in close proximity to it.  The object would have been about 2.5-3.5 times the size of the helicopter that was approaching it.  I was unable to see what happened next, as the helicopter continued to approach, since traffic started to move.  When I was able to again direct my attention back to the object, a minute or so later, it, and the helicopter, were gone.  The weather was clear and sunny that day. This is not the first time I have seen an object like this, the last time was in 93 just west of Deming NM, and south of I-10.  At least I have one nagging question answered regarding this, if we did indeed see the same thing, at least I was not the only one looking up that day!

Then it flew  low over my house and I heard the UFO.Off in the distance, north/west a jarting lighted object was seen. Stop, jart forward then stop. In a back and forth movement. This object was observed by my 2 children for 3 days. I wouldn&apos;t look until the 3rd day because I thought the kids were making it up. They watched it and kept yelling for me to look. Finally on the 3rd night, I looked and saw it jarting back and forth. Then the shock! It flew right over my house. I could HEAR IT. It whooshed, quiet sound, just like that a whoose. It was right over the house, it looked like a bonnet, the top was flattened and where it flatted to meet the brim, were the lights. All around the brim were individual lights, yellow, blues, and whitish yellow. The lights seemed to go from low beam to high beam constantly, like pulsing lights. When it flew towards my house, I was in shock and got scared. When it was above the house, it was hard to tell the size,it was more than 3 houses long and a block wide, and I could hear it. I called the police when I saw it off in the distance, but they treated me like a moron. This siting was never in the news or the papers. 8 years later in the local paper, someone asked about seeing it, and the reporter said, yes the whole town had reported it. So, maybe you have other reports of it. I have for years been trying to find someplace to report it and hope to god, I have found the right spot. This was definately, a UFO, and hearing it is something I have not heard anyone else report hearing, only seeing. The sound of this UFO was a whoooooosh, a quiet sound, no motor sound, not an airplane sound. More like waving a stick in the air, but this was quiet, hugh sound. It&apos;s speed was fast, it moved from the distance to over my house in a split second. Yet, slow enough for me to see the lights, and hear it. All my windows were closed, not double paned windows, so sounds can be heard. Amazing, frightening and I am very angry at this city repressing the sighting. If you were to question this city, I know you would hear from everyone that saw it.

It was moving straight across the sky very slowly. Slow from our perspective, but probably traveling extremely fast, just far away. My friends instantly saw this as well. We decided it was a satellite and continued to watch it when suddenly, it changed course and headed downward, completely about face from the course it was heading. At this point about ten seconds had passed. then it began to move horizontally in a jerky start-stop motion. coming to complete stops with no gradual slow downs. next it began to make jerky half circle motions, clockwise then counterclockwise visa-versa etc as it travelled on its path. it made occasional complete circles. it continued these unpredictable course changes periodically and  continued its bizzare loops and dashes. untill it appeared to become almost stationary far on the opposite side of the sky from where it had started. nearly five minutes had passed...that is an agreed upon esitmate. we watched for about ten more minutes or so...occasionally it moved...we were more or less freaking out trying to rationalize what we had just seen and at the same time trying to calm down one of my friends who was already 10 minutes late for her curfew. the two girls I was with were basically hysterical as they fed off eachother&apos;s fear. i really wanted to stay and watch in case something else happened but my friend had to be home for her curfew( it was now about 2:40 am) and she was the one driving us around so i had to go. I was dropped of at my car where i raced to my home 20 minutes away and woke up my parents to come look for what i had seen. They were not amused. I watched the sky from my backyard for about another hour and gave up. this was no airplane or meteo! rite. it was a faint, blue dot in the sky doing the most amazing maneuvers i have ever seen. once again i emphasize how it changed course directions instantly and jumped about in the sky. what would do this i ask? i have never been a believer nor skeptic towards UFOS. I am convinced someone else out there besides my friends and I saw this, for it couldnt have happened on a more observed night than a meteor shower like this one. I wish I wish i could give points of reference like constellations, stars and directional coordiantes..but im totally clueless when it comes to those types of things.  I was referred to this site from somebody in a UFO chatroom on aol where i went looking for other people who may have seen this.

I was driving west on I90 at the border of pensilvania and New-York.  I saw what I first though was a plane landing. It had 2 white lights and one blue light. After 2 minutes, I figured out that it was taking too long for the plane to land.  At that time I also realized that it had no flashing light like a normal plane.  I slow down and observed the craft more carefully.  It was on my right. I then understood that it was moving very slowly.  I pointed out the triangle for the 2 other witnesses in the car. One of them told me that it was at set of fixed light on the electric towers.  I agreed, but I stop the car on the side of the road and observed the craft more carefully.  We confirmed that it was moving very slowly toward est. At that time, the blue light that was pointing away from us shuted down and a blue light on the other side of the craft turned on. That gave us the impression that the craft was not trianglular but rectangular. The blue light turned off and the craft continued to move to est.  The two white lights remained on until we lost sighting behind the tree top.  Total 1 min of observation from the side of the road.  Evaluated distance of travel for the 1 minute observation : 800 meters. We could not evaluate for the presence of sound or not because of the highway noise. We could not see any part of the craft exept for the lights because of the darkness. We were inside of a zone of tunderstorm, but there was no rain at the time of the sighing.  There was lightning. The ceiling was very low, and there was no fuzz on the light suggesting that it was flying below the clouds.

I immediately (triping over my son) lept to the window in about 5 strides. Where I saw it passing west to east through the view of the tri-angluar window. I then ran to the east side of the room to a doorwall that had partially opend curtins where I saw it disapear. My son was confused, at first at why I was running around the room while and claming a plane is crashing, untill he saw what I was talking about. Then  I went to get gas and two guys pulled up next to me and asked if I saw the comet? I went on to my brothers house in near by romulus (south of the airport) for my niecses&apos; birth day. When I arrived needless to say the topic of conversation was the &quot;fire ball&quot; in the sky. Both my brothers inlaws and his oldeest daughter and her husband  saw it in seperat incedents. I thought they would say they saw it to the North, going from west to the east, but they too saw it to the south(they were further south of where myson and I witnessed it.This indicated to me that whatever it was, was a lot higher in the sky, and a lot larger than I had antisipated. I found out the next day that two people in my &quot;American History&quot; class I was atending at Eastern Michigan Univ. also saw it. One of these people is a girl that said she was heading down I-94 east bound Just west of I-275 when she saw it pass over, off to her right.

It looked like Venus does when it is at its VERY brightest in the western skies---same size and brightness. Perhaps a bit bigger and brighter,in fact. But it seemed odd to me to expect to see another object such as that or Jupiter,etc,there at that time. It did not move. It just &quot;hung&quot; in the sky. Then,suddenly,it started scintillating more and then it began to dim until it &quot;dimmed out&quot; so to speak. As if it had gone into a fog bank. But it was crystal clear out. All other stars were visible even though much further and smaller,of course. There was no mist nor a single cloud in the entire sky. No objects such as towers or mountains in the way. I&apos;ve lived in the area for over 50 years(all my life)and am quite familiar with the night sky and terrain at all hours of the day and am a frequent traveller at that late/early hour on that highway. There were no aircraft in the air and this object never displayed blinking lights nor red or green running lights at any time. My son,the driover,did not see it in time because he was leaned back in his seat watching only the road while I (as I often do) was leaned forward and purposely observing the awesome night sky. He noticed how intent I was looking at something,so he asked me what was up and by that time the object had dimmed out totally.

Sunset was 9:04 tonight. I thought it might have been a hotair balloon but there was not sound and you can sometimes hear them as the fire up the balloons.   The other idea was that it was one of those kid balloons that use a candle to make rise but I haven&apos;t seen one of those since I was a kid.", "They both went outside and as my brother in law discribed it was the typical cigar shaped shining object lower than the planes flight.June 8th 2000- my son was looking out the back window about 11:00 am and saw something in the sky and asked what it was. I was busy in the kitchen and didn&apos;t look. I was assuming it was dog wood puffs flying around.

PD))", "Two completely different objects floating in the sky near Van Nuys CA.Exact location from where I had the sighting was in the parking lot of plaza located on the Northwest corner of Reseda and Nordhoff in the city of Northridge CA. about 25 miles North of Hollywood.   There is a grocery store hooked to a chain of other stores in the shape of an L. In the corner of the plaza is a resturaunt called the Hot Wok Cafe.  I was walking through the parking lot towards the Hot Wok cafe which means that I was walking towards the Northwest, just before I got to the resturaunt I looked just above the roofline of the plaza and saw perhaps a few hundred feet above the ground  maybe two or three hundred feet away what looked like a plastic bag being carried around by the wind. The first thing to come to mind was a scene in a movie called American Beauty that focused on a plastic bag dancing in the wind that seemed to have a life of it&apos;s own.  I thought it was interesting that a plastic bag could be carried so far in the air even though I could not really tell if it was actually a plastic bag or not, ot only behaved like a plastic bag being spun and carried slightly back and forth in the air.  I was about to dismiss the sight alltogether since I was meeting a friend in the resturaunt and did not want to keep them waiting when I realized that this &quot;bag&quot; had pretty much stayed in a very small area.  If it was a bag then the wind that kept the bag in the air also caused it to flutter in float in the same spot for about three minutes.  At this time I couldn&apos;t take my eyes off of it, I had to see it either fall or flutter away but it stayed in pretty much the exact spot. After a couple of minutes I decided I need to go into the resturaunt and meet my friend, nothing was happening with the &quot;bag&quot; and I only had an hour for lunch.  I went in and looked around and saw that I had been stood up, or my friend had not arrived yet so I ran back into the parking lot and resumed my examination of this object in the sky that was still there in the same spot, fluttering in the exact same manner. Only now there was a small, fuzzy, light colored sspherical object right next to it.  I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me since I don&apos;t have the best eyesight in the world and I have to stare at a computer screen all day.  I looked away and looked back again and the little dot was still there right next to the &quot;bag&quot;.  I watched for maybe about three or four minutes and noticed that the new object, the &quot;dot&quot; was very slowly moving out of sight.  It took about a minute before I couldn&apos;t see it anymore.  The &quot;bag&quot; remained in the same place.  I watched maybe anothe rminute and decided to inquire in the resturaunt if there had been anyone in there within the past 30 minutes meeting the description of my friend.  The attendant at the front said no so I gave up and decided to get some cheaper food across the parking lot and walked back out.  I looked into the sky again and saw that the object was gone.  I scanned the sky and saw nothing else.  This occured on what I remember to be a clear and hot day.  I would be very interested to read reports from any other witnesses that might have seen something similar in the same area that same day and time.", "A few minutes after my husband and I saw the first set of amber lights, I waited outside and later saw another set.  Starting in the North (looking towards Prescott area) and travelling NE towards the Harquahelas,  a series of 5 extremely bright amber lights appeared and disappeared, one at a time in a straight line with a very faint object in front of each.  Travelling several hundred miles an hour lasting about 8 seconds total.  A very faint object was seen just after the second light appeared that I followed with my eyes and a light would appear after an intervel. The lights would appear about a second apart and you could just see the object move between the appearances.  The object did not flicker nor blink like an aircraft...more like watching a satellite going over head but this was just above the horizon and faster than the commerical jets you can see.  No sound.((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful to the two observers, husband and wife, who have submitted these two reports from near Bouse, AZ.

It was moving to the east as this happened. The mostion was extremly smooth, and it wwas perfectly silent. At first I thught It was a firework od the sort that shoots in the air and comes down on a parachute, but it dropped in several short, quick bursts, unlike the glide of a parachute. Its possible that someone was flying a kite with a light abd propeller attached, but it looked to be at least the altitude of a short range private aircraft, and there wasnt any wind on the ground and it moved too fast. I dont think this is outside the scope of an elaborate hoax, but if it was a hoax it was a pretty fucking good one (it also must have been moving away if it was as high as it looked because it disapeared behind the treeline. my friend:I was looking over the shoulder of my freind and I happen to see a star like object yet much brighter.I slowly watched this object move in the northeast to the east. As i watched I lost site of it over the trees.", "cloudy sky light kept going round in circles over edinburgh hidden behind clouds clouds app 01:15 09/08/2000 police were reporting lights seen over edin- burgh/midlothian.", "QQ Silver shining sphere traveling towards sun, radio reception scrambled, vanished into thin airI was traveling south on Hwy.19 from Cuba to Steelville. I noticed a silver shining sphere like object to the west of the noonday sun. I watched the object move east towards the sun at the rate of speed of a comercial airliner.  I had to keep  glancing up as it moved closer to the sun due to the glare.  At the same time I noticed the reception on my radio became poor and scrambled.  I also noticed the vehicle traveling ahead of me had slowed down and appeared to be watching the object also.  As I descended the hill into Steelville the object disappeared.", "Unexplained lightAt approximatly 2105 08/25/00 I went outside to smoke a cigarette when I noticed an object very high that resembled a star, but it was moving. There were no blinking lights on the object which would indicate that it was an airplane. The object came from the north an traveled towards the southwest. I listened for sound as the object moved away but there was none.I would estimate that the object had to be at a minimum of 30,000 ft.", "Clear night observation of lumenescent object leaving a trail from east to north.I was playing basketball between 2100 and 2200 on a cold October or November clear, star filled night (no moon) with two other youths.  The court was illuminated by service station lights just south of the school yard basketball court.  The object appeared from the east behind trees to directly overhead making a 90 degree change in direction to the north and went out of sight behind a church to the north.  Approach azimuth was approximately 20 to 25 degrees and the eparture azimuth was about 20 degrees.  It was in view seven to eight seconds.  The object was a little larger than a pea held at arms length with a two inch tail (arms length) that can best be described as the animated &quot;Tinker Bell&quot; wand.  It was sparkling and luminescent while fading about two inches behind the object.  I yelled at the other two guys and pointed to the north as it disappeared behind the church.  One of the other guys saw it just before it went out of sight.  This is as I remember it some 44 years ago!", "A fast moving silver ball following the New Jersey Turn PikeI work for a moving company and was driving on the New Jersey Turnpike this morning with a co-worker. Everytime we pass Newark airport, we watch the planes land and take off , sometimes we get a really good view. We were watching the planes land and come in as I passed the airport. As we traveled we saw a few more planes coming in, like always from off in the distance- no big deal. As we got near exit 11 going south I saw the sun glint off another plane in the distance and looked away. It was traveling north toward us to the left of the north bound lanes. It glinted again so I looked at it. Another plane I thought. As we got closer I thought oh, its a helicopter. As I looked I could see it was round in front but it didnt look right. As we got closer I started asking myself in my mind, &apos;What the !@$%#@! is that? &apos; It was just a big round silver ball. After thinking this about twice I said outloud ,&quot;Bob, what the !$#@! is that??? &quot; I was surprised to hear my own voice in a igh pitch to. He was staring at it to. It was round like a ball and silver and about -he said three miles to our left- I think it was closer about two miles away. It just kept traveling toward us and passed us on the left moving faster than any plane we have ever seen going to Newark airport.  I was driving, and as it passed us on the left I got a real good view. It was silver and round about the size of a helicopter- there were no windows- lights- nothing on it at all and heres the part that got us , it moved in a perfect straight line as it traveled -no wobble- no up or down no side to side or spinning motions. It just went straight. There was no noise no smoke nothing. To us it looked to be made of a solid metal,it glisted real bright from the sun off in the distance which first got our attention- Bob said thats when it turned- I didn&apos;t see it turn. Right after we say it the radio had static on it - we were listening to CBS 101.1 FM. I didn&apos;t pay much attentio to this because of what we saw. Bob said he saw it glint and watched it and it turned to go north following the NJTP. I saw it glint and took my eyes off of it and only saw it go in a straight line after watcing it after the second glint. We agreed that it was up about 2000 feet and the only clouds were way off in the distance far away. The sun was out and the sky was very clear. So it moved about five to seven miles toward us in a straight line followig the NJTP going north. The whole event lasted about 30 seconds or so. When I first saw it we must have been doing about 60 mph -I know I slowed down during the event but probably didnt go under 50 mph.  We both had the same thoughts - its a plane - no its a helicopter- what is it???? I looked at the time and it read 10:24 (AM) right after this happened. Allot of people had to see this thing. The NJTP was packed as usual and the sky was perfect. This thing was going much faster than the planes that go to Newark airport . Maybe you can contact someone and see if it was picked up on radar. A few minutes after the event I thught it might have been some type of ballon. But - could a balloon travel that fast?? And the part that reall gets me! Can a ballon  travel at &apos;helicopter level&apos; in a perfectly straight line? I mst have watched it travel for several miles and thought it was an aircraft until it got within a mile or so. I know other people saw this. If its a government device - I say this because it followed the northbound lane the way cruise missles followed highways during the Gulf war - why did they test it under clear skys during the day i such a very busy area? And there was a plane coming in not to long after it- I bet they saw it to.", "MY father and I were looking at the stars and we saw a triangle UFO with 3 white lights on each corner and 1 red light in the middle...My father and I were in our lawn, I was looking at the stars asking him questions and this triangle shaped object appeared. It had 3 white lights, one on each corner and one red light in the middle. The body of the UFO was dark gray or black. My father was in the military and first thought it was a B-2 bomber but he looked closer and found it was not. It was in the sky for about 2 minutes or more then sped up to about 200+ MPH and disappeared out of sight. Peolple in our area also saw a triangle object as we did that night.", "Two disc-like objects, first appearing as stars, do rapid zig-zag-like manuevers in the western sky above Los Angeles, CAOn Sunday evening at 7:00pm, here, 30 miles east of Downtown L.A., I was looking west towards the sunset and I saw two bright white stars. At first I thought they must&apos;ve been airplanes flying to LAX or wherever that were reflecting light from the sun. If you were to place your middle finger &amp; index finger in a &quot;peace sign&quot; formation and held them against the sky, that is the distance that these two bright &quot;stars&quot; seemed to be apart from each other. If you drew a line between these two objects, you would have a perfect horizontal line. At first, the left &quot;star&quot; which was bright started to dim a little bit, like an airplane flying away from you. Then it regained its original brightness. Then I saw the right &quot;star&quot;, which originally wasn&apos;t as bright as the left &quot;star&quot; start to become brighter also. So I knew then that these were not airplanes. Immediately I saw the left &quot;star&quot; dim slightly. When this happened, it appeared to reveal it&apos;s shape which was like a slim disc. It all of a sudden started to zig zag downward very rapidly. After that, it zig zagged upward back to its original position. Immediately after that, the right &quot;star&quot; also revealed its disc-like shape and did a zig zag motion downward as well but diagonally to the right. This right object revealed its shape in better detail. It sort of resembled , if you&apos;re familiar with the movie &quot;Star Wars&quot;, the rear end of the Millenium Falcon ship as it would launch of any given surface. What I mean is it resembled the orange glow given off by the rear rockets and the exact detail of the rear end of the Millenium Falcon. Anyway, when this was apparent, it appeared to dive slightly to the left going downward. It looked exactly like the Millenium Falcon when it would change direction and dive left. It did this motion at the speed that an airplane would. Then it quickly jumped back to its original position. Then, the left &quot;star&quot;, which now appeared as a disc, also somewhat resembling the millenium falcon, zig zagged rapidly downward diagonally left, staye! d there for a moment, the zig zagged back to its original position. These two objects now appeared to be bright stars again. All of a sudden, their brightness dimmed, then disappeared suddenly. As far as my personal background goes, I&apos;m a 24yr old graphic design/web design student here in West Covina.  I was not under the influence of any alcohol or substances at the time of the sighting. I come from a family of four who all carry on w/ typical work/school lifestyles and who don&apos;t suffer from any history of mental disorders. I do stargaze and look at the sky from time to time but this is my first time seeing unidentified flying objects and am really excited now.", "Strange light moving over Vegas at a great speedAt or about 10:40 PM while I was letting my dogs out for their nightly ritual I looked up into the sky to the north - northwest.  I caught a glimpse of what appeared to be an airplane moving slowly across the sky, as it moved over head I then thought it was a satelite due to the extreme altitude and that the light never blinked.  Just after the light passed directly over head it increased to a speed four times faster as it headed south. It made no sound, left no contrail As I moved out away from my house to keep sight of it, 2 airforce jets flying in a tight formation flew north to where I first spotted the light, then turned south hard towards the objects flight path.  I ran through the house and out the back door the object was pulling away from the jets at an incredible rate.  The jets broke off and headed back north.  I have lived in Las Vegas for 13 years and I have been to the edge of Area-51 and seen things in the sky that I could not explain but never have I seen something fly over the city and display speeds of this nature.  This object was at an incredible altitude and the speed was remarkable.  Can satelites increase their speed?  Did anyone else see this?", "From my bedroon window I saw an obejct with seven white lights and one red pulsating light underneath it move from south to west.The object appeared to be moving from south to west approximately 15 degrees above the horizon.  There were seven white lights equallly spaced around the object. It appeared to be banking slightly as I could easily see a bright red pulsating light in the middle of the underside of the object.  It disappeared behind many large douglas fir trees and was not seen again.  The red light appeared to pulsate at one second intervals.  The apparent size of the object in my field of view was approximately one inch in diameter.((NUFORC Note:  The witness, an experienced UFO investigator, is well known to NUFORC, and is a serious-minded individual.

I was surprized when my father was calling us outside from the front porch saying: &quot;Do you want to see a UFO?&quot;  I then rushed outside after my sister and mother onto the porch to see several orange-white balls of light approximately 40o above the horizon, in the north-west sky.  From our vantage point, they were about the size of 1/4 the size of a dime held at arm&apos;s length. Some increased in brightness, then decreased or went out, and right next to it another ball of light appeared.  We&apos;re not sure how many there were,  because they appeared to hopscotch each other vertically to the left and right, we saw perhaps 5 or 6 as they were appearing, disappearing and lighting.", "Glowing globe arcing over Wellington and disintegrating in atmosphereOne golden glowing fireball traversed an arc of 25 to 30 degrees in the atmosphere above the suburb of Ngaio in Wellington. The visible size from the observation point was a glowing orb shaped craft of 1 to 1.5 cm diameter. It appeared as a circular fireball without a tail nor corona. The craft seemed to disintigrate in the atmosphere rather than disapear, although the craft did not change shape. The height above gound and the arc being traversed suggested it would crash into the ground, had it not disintegrated. After this sighting, both my 18 year old son (who did not see the event, and myself started to experience body somatics, itchiness and aching in the joints. I experienced some minor pain in my eyes,and some slight nausea. Going outside the house tended to increase itchiness.

One night at the end of my yard out in the woods we saw a wierd bright light a solid one no blinking like plane. and no sound. so we observed it.  My girlfriend was amazed it was  jerky in movement and it would stop for about 30 sec. and keep moving. it would go up a little and move wierd no plane can do this .then finaly it was out of our sight. So we waited and it didnt come back so my girlfriend went in the house. I stayed out and waited maybe it will come back..so i waited it didnt come back. So i was looking up at stars for a wile  and i notice one moving and i thoght maybe a satilite but over more i saw an airplane flying. And i noticed 3 stars start moving after the plane flew buy them . What ever they were they seem to be following the plane. And ive seen 5 at once  moving in many directions.

It seems like its looking for somthing or studying that area. friday 5/26/00 i was useing  my girlfriend fathers digital camcorder.I saw it again then it was gone same thing as always but maybe about 90 min later i saw it coming from over the tree a distance away so i ran down to the end of the yard and notice ther was another one closer i was shocked i turned on the camcorder then the one closer disapeared  no noise at all from neather one.

Even though it occurred eight years ago I remember it like it was yesterday.  I pulled into a shopping center parking lot after first observing this while sitting in traffic.  I got out to look and follow it as it moved.  It was perfectly square-shaped with a textured surface.  It was probably about 300 feet or so up and it was moving in a straight line from south to north with no deviation from the wind.  It clearly was under controlled flight.  It slowly flipped end over end as it moved.  It was not travelling quickly; it was going at a slow, steady pace.  Even as it moved to the north and I began to lose sight of it I could still trace its path by the fact that the sun glinted off its trailing edge as it continued to flip end over end.  From the ground it really looked almost two-dimensional; it did not really have much bulk to it.

Actually, the stars were out directly overhead, but the horizon was still in that twilight blue phase.  I became aware of a movement in the sky in the west horizon, moving slowly in my direction.  I sat up to get a better view, and noticed that the movement simply seemed to block out the sky where it passed . . . there were no lights of any kind.  I was able to figure the shape of the object by observing the omission of sky/stars as it moved.  It was roughly in the shape of a chevron (or boomerang), but seemed to be filled in as well, which aproximates the shape of a triangle.  It was only after a few seconds that I realized that the &quot;craft&quot; was not a distant object, but was actually VERY close.  It was flying over the neighborhood.  By the time it was over the nearest house to my backyard, I was able to estimate height,size and speed.  It was aproximately 50 feet wide, gliding silently at about the height of two telephone poles, and traveling at only 30 mph.  As it went directly over me, I heard a very faint mechanical sound, somewhat akin to squeaky wet rubber.  It was at that point that I became extremely uncomfortable-- sensing that something was defintely &quot;off&quot; in the normal scheme of things.  As the object passed out of my sight over my house, I felt the overwhelming need to run into the house, but was petrified that the &quot;thing&quot; might have landed in the front yard!  I banged on the back door, but realized that everyone was downstairs and couldn&apos;t hear.  I ran around to the front in spite of my fear, and rushed into the house.  I was trembling as I ran downstairs.  I could hardly recount what I had experienced.  Having adequately frightened my younger brothers (unintentionally . . . this time!), we locked the doors to the house, and closed the blinds (like THAT would help).  I took a scrap from a grocery bag laying on the kitchen table, and w! rote dow n everything concerning what I had seen, while it was fresh in my mind.  I have kept that scrap ever since.", "There were three fire balls, one over top of each other, which had three smaller dots around each in a triangular shape.I was standing on the back porch to my house when I looked across the field behind the house and I saw three distinct fireballswith smaller red dots around each, one over top of the other go across the field for about 2 miles it seemed and then they just seemed to fade into thin air.", "Three star like objects seen in broad daylight on two seperate daysI was sitting underneath a tree at lunch today and saw a strange object.  It was nearly straight up, moving VERY slow to the north.  It looked like a star.  It kept its course going north, I figured it must be at 30,000-40,000 feet.  About as large as one wing of a commercial jet flying at 35,000.  I watched it for about 10 minutes in which it had traveled to about 45 degrees above north horizon.  Then it got close to a cloud and changed course to the WNW.  I was able to follow it for about 3 more minutes before it was to far away to see.  Broken clouds where at I would guess 10,000 feet and moving to east.  There was some cotton seeds blowing in wind at I would guess 100 feet, they where moving north also.  Then about 10 minutes later I saw another one!  This one appeared slightly to the northeast of direct above.  It was moving slightly faster and to the west.  There where more clouds and when it went behind one it actually was in front of it.  The strange thing is it went from a star light like object to dark, it showed up against the white cloud!  When it came out from in front of cloud it was still white/star like.  It changed course after about 1 minute and started moving NNW.  I watched it pass in front of some more clouds and lost sight of it as it got to far away.  I do not think it could be a balloon because it was at a lesser altitude than the clouds yet they where moving in different directions.  I&apos;ll never know what it was, but it was not a airplane or helicopter.  It was like a &quot;light&quot; than just a white object.  Must not have been to large since it was at a lower altitude than I first thought it was. You won&apos;t believe it but I saw it again on Tuesday.  I noticed it almost straight up slightly to the east.  Did not move for a couple of minutes.  Then started to drift SLOWLY to south.  Then started to move slowly north.  Meandered to east.  At this time it &quot;faded&quot; but was still visible.  It brightened back to original intensity.  Then picked up some speed, although still very slow, began moving NNW.  Then WNW.  Followed it to around 30 degrees above horizon.  I had to ask myself if I was imagining it.  This time I tried to keep my head still to see what kind of movement I could detect.  It seemed, although I can&apos;t be for sure, that it would meander back forth to and fro.  It is bright enough that if you pointed it out to someone they would be able to see it easily.  I have no explanation.  There where no clouds.  Still saw cotton seeds at lower altitudes.  Does anyone know if they gather into huge balls?  I have seen small clumps like 10 joined together but they are not in a perfect sphere.  This is Wednesday and I did not see it today.  I am going to bring binoculars tomorrow just in case.  I followed it this time for 20+ minutes.  Do not remember which direction wind was blowing.", "At approximately 9:30 pm (9:30-10:00) I was standing on my porch looking South.  There was a pulsing light with red strobing suspended stationary in the sky.  It appeared to be quite a distance away and was there longer than the 20 mins that I observed it.  I had seen a similar light the year before only the light was due East.  My son actually observed this with me and we watched it approximately 20 minutes.  Interestingly, the on both occassions the light was missing at the same time the following day.  I assumed that it was a &quot;blinking&quot; star at first but it did not move nor did it seem to travel at all during the time that I was watching it. There was no 2nd guessing the second event because it was directly in the middle of two of my tall trees.  I would not have had difficulty finding it again but it just wasn&apos;t there the next night.((NUFORC Note:  The description of the first sighting seems consistent with a &quot;twinkling&quot; star.  However, we have no explanation for why the object did not appear the next night.  We receive many reports like this, and our only guess is that the celestial object is in a slightly different part of the sky at the time the witness attempts to look at, or for, the object a second time.  Most non-scientifically oriented observers are not very experienced at looking at the night sky, we observe.  Just a guess, however.  PD))", "Starting at 18:05 I witnessed at least 7 rounded/circular/oval objects in approx. a 140 degree arc approximating a line southeast to northwest, the center of the arc in close proximity with the location of the FCC Center in Auburn, about four blocks as the crow flies from our residence. These objects were whiteish to yellowish in color, at an obvious very high altitude, (I can recall no aircraft flying that high.) My wife brought out a pair of cheap binoculars and I was able to find two of these objects of the same color and just slightly larger size.At about 18:20 two of the objects that were quite some distance from each other started  on a line toward each other at a much increased speed.(Up to this point the objects seremed to be lazily traversing in random courses.)The two objects seemed to swerve at the last moment to pass by &quot;closely&quot;. At 18:25 the objects dissappeared from my view at which point I went into the house to obtain the UFO reporting telephone number. I returned outside about two minutes later, looked upwards towards a thin whisp of &quot;cloud&quot; and was greeted with three of these similar objects, closely grouped in the shape of a triangle. Putting the binoculars on this grouping it was cleasrly three of the aforementioned items,spaced closely yet with some distance apart to enable viewing clear sky behind them. It appeared that there was &quot;something brown&quot; that they were grouped about. About five minutes later the sky was again &quot;clear&quot; of objects. My wife observed a portion of this but is somewhat lacking in far vision. Do you have any idea what this could have been? We were thinking of a mass release of weather balloons but when the two changed course to close in on each other we began to wonder just what we were looking at ((personal information deleted))", "Two bright red lights moving slowly in the sky at high altitude,  then quickley,  one blinking,then disappearing.Two red lights moving north to south side by side, slowly at first over mesa - gilbert area of arizona.

I am a licensed pilot,an aviation historian,a UFO/paranormal researcher and am extremely well versed in the area of aircraft identification. Other witnesses included an engineer and several school teachers. All of us were attending a cave restoration camp sponsored by the park service. During a nightly stargazing session, we observed a triangular formation of three pale white lights moving at an apparent extreme high altitude at a high rate of speed. These lights gave the appearance of a dim, moving constellation or a formation of satallites. Their intensity was a little less than the surrounding stars.The lights were arranged in a perfect triangle, but moved sideways against the starfield. (imagine a flying wing moving sideways, with one wingtip as the leading edge). The objects were in view approximately 3-4 minutes, moving in a continuous arc directly overhead from north to south at the approximate same rate of speed as other man-made satellites I have observed. The formation did not waiver, change position, change color or move erratically and stars were clearly visible through the formation, giving the appearance of three vehicles, as opposed to a single solid object.I observed one object with binoculars before it was lost in the moon&apos;s glow. It appeared as a single point of light, with no apparent structure. The whole formation appeared slightly smaller than a business card held at arms length. No sounds were heard, although there were several commercial airliners in the area at the time at a much lower altitude. I am convinced that what I saw was probably unassembled U.S. space station components, the Mir Space Station , or some other type of orbital debris. However, since there was a meteor shower on the night of the observation, I am curious to know whether anyone else observed the same objects, as there were probably many people sky watching on this particular evening. Thank you for this opportunity to comment.((NUFORC Note:  We believe that this may be yet another sighting of what we assume to be the U. S. Navy N.O.S.S. satellites that are reported to us from time to time.  They were first reported during the summer of 1995 or 1996, and they seem to reappear every year or two.

As the formation was flying, the 90-degree angle was in the lower-left position. These objects were certainly in space and possibly satellites, only if there are satellites flying in such formation. Since I am unaware of any satellites flying in a perfect triangular position, I am contemplating the possibility of UFO&apos;s. From Earth, the objects looked similar to orbitting satellites.

My first thought, it was an aircraft, and the sun was reflecting off the wings, but it would have to be in a steep climb... since the object was perfectly horizontal... but it is not gaining or losing altitude.  If it were the fuselage that was reflecting the sun, I should be able to see the tail, and if it were the wings, the body of the aircraft should be visible.  It is not getting larger or smaller, as an aircraft would, if it were headed toward you, or away.  It is shining, it is stationary, it appears to be &apos;floating&apos; or suspended, it is silver and reflecting the sun, for a few seconds, then it turns &apos;dark&apos; as if shadowed, but it is the same size, in the same location.  Then after a few seconds it &apos;vanishes&apos; from the same location, never changing it&apos;s size or position?  NOT what I would call ... normal operating procedure for standard aircraft?

The lights did not blink. No other lights on object. Object moving with one light forward and two corner lights in back. Could not see a fuselage or wings. Sound of some type of propulsion could be heard, but it was very muffled sounding. Did not sound like jets that go over our house often, and was not nearly as loud as the ones that would be 2000-3000 ft altitude.  If it was a regular jet passenger plane, judging by what we saw, it would have been flying at about 1000 feet or lower by the relative distance between the the three points where the white/red lights were. Craft not moving very fast. My wife saw it first. Said &quot;look at that, John&quot;. She noticed it through our trees coming toward us, NW to SE direction. I looked up, and could see it through the trees, coming toward us, and I then moved in the direction where I could get a better view.  The speed of the craft was very slow, that if it was a jet aircraft, it would not be doing any faster than 50 mph, relative to the altitude it appeared to be at. (We also see the police helicopter go over our house often, and I&apos;ve seen it go over or by us much quicker than this total sighting took.) We were just on our way to go for a drive with our two great nieces. They had already gotten into the car in the garage when my wife first noticed this sighting. I called to them to come see it after I first saw it.  They didn&apos;t move fast (the kids), and I wanted them to see it, too.  But, they still climbed out of the back seat of the car, and the car is a two door - that when they got to the driveway at least 30 or more seconds after the craft was first noticed, they could still see it before it went over the trees to our SE. I would not report this, except I can not explain this sighting as a normal aircraft because: (1) the sound was too quiet for most jets that have passed over our house, (2) the wingspan, or distance between the corners of the triangle, would have made the craft size very large even for a 747, (3) the craft took a long time to move across our viewing space, (4) the lights on the corners didn&apos;t blink, (5) I&apos;ve never seen jets going in on a landing pattern for the Eastern Iowa Airport in the direction of NW to SE, though I did see a small jet go over a little N-NE to S-SW just the same day, about 6:30 PM., and (6) I have never seen a passenger jet come in to our airport at that time of night.  Most of the normal traffic seems to die out after 8:00 PM. Because I can give an close time, plus or minus 5 minutes, and because I also believe that local radar would show a blip for what we saw, I think that this sighting would be easily verifiable if was a normal craft or not.", "roomate saw three stars in the daylightI was in the process of taking a few pictures of a rainbow, and while looking and centering my shot, my roomate, who&apos;s deaf was commenting on the stars in the sky.

The object gradually lessened in intensity and almost seemed to disappear but then I noticed it had not disappeared but had slowed and was hovering east of my home and was now about the same brightness as the surrounding stars. In fact, I thought I had lost it at first because it looked so much like a star. Then, the object began to grow brighter and brighter until it reached approximately the same color as it was when I initially saw it and zoomed off to the east.

I considered all the possible explainations for what I had just seen but could find no explaination for what they were. There were no port or starboard recognition lights or beacons on these craft, they made no noise and they travelled at a very high rate of speed.

I was driving West on Hwy 190, coming from Belton Tx. While I came down a long sloping hill. I saw a bright light came in from the South and was going to the North over Fort Hood Texas. It came in fast and at high arch. It left no trail like a Metor. It was just a bright dot of light. It looked to have stopped and went out over Fort Hood. It was moving too fast to be an aircraft. Est. distance it traveled 60 miles in 2 sec.", "4 spheres approaching 2 people, turning a rectangle of light over the vehicle, and up at 80 degrees  in spiral -white,quiet,fastWhen travelling East along the Ottawa River, saw 4 lights in formation, pointed out to passenger and rolled down window. The objects travelled without sound, and were white lights. I thought they were hang gliders, but then they travelled very fast in an arc towards my vehicle. One was over top of us while moving at 60 Km/hr and the others were on either side, circling each other. The object over us which was just a rectangular white light at that time then travelled to the right and participated in that circular fashion arournd one of it&apos;s mates. I came to a stop light and stopped, by this time there were just beyond my eyes focal length. They stopped with me. When the light turned green, I accelerated to get a look at them, but they then proceeded to go essentially vertically up, and disappear one at a time, in a corkscrew fashion. The following day, and independant witness was discovered and never gave much care to share details. I since stopped communication with the other friend as well, but know both of them. Only sighting ever, but for very high velocity huge orange object (girlfriend witnessed also) -- for a fleeting second, 3 objects in total, one circular, and 2 angle like fins seperated, but with large gap between sphere, and contoured to match it&apos;s circumference. Again in Nepean Ontario but approx Sept 96, also strange lights in that area on 2 - 4 occasions. I have never seen an alien, nor any detail of ship, simply lights, though the most dramatic experience (first mentioned) when I strained to see the ship when the white rectangle was over us, I thought I could make out a trailing light, outlining an arc to what looked sherical. ie. a perfect sphere? with a perfect rectangle of white light, it seems to me the lights which I saw prior to that rectangle (the spheres) were less white, perhaps yellowish - I am reporting this 13 years later.", "A bright red circular object was falling slowly down in a straigt line leaving a trail of smoke brhind it.I live in Missouri and i am currently  working for the Census Bureau. Saturday evening, on my way home from work, i  witnessed a strange occurance, which I have described breifly  below. I was driving down C highway  (Hillsboro), heading towards Y highway(Hillsboro, DeSoto) @ about 7:30p.m. To  the left of me was a series of  large fields And behind them were large  tree--covered hills   In the sky high above the hills was a  single object, a bright red perfect circle, moving slowly down in a straight  line, a; leaving a trail of smoke behind it   As it feel it never seemed to gain  speed, the circle grew bigger and brighter, the trail of smoke also grew. It  finally descended behind the trees leaving the trail of smoke.    I never heard any sounds and although  I looked for it, I never saw it again, or determined what it was.   The entire ordeal took about 10-15  minutes the object was visible for a long stretch of the  road. My question is, do you have any idea  what this could have been? It was definately there. I ruled out fireworks,  because there was no noise and it moved very slowly. I have never seen an  airplane go straight down, either crashing or landing; besides, if it had been a  plane crash or something like that it would have been on the news. The area is  outside of city limits, and mostly farm land. The closest airport (which is very small) is two towns away (Festus/Crystal City)", "At about 3:45 am we witnessed 2 objects in the sky. Each flashed red, green, and blue tones in a random pattern.  They remained relatively stationary but moved in spirals.  About 45 minutes after we first sighted the objects we heard two aircraft.  One was a prop and the other seemed to be a low flying jet.  Within the same time period we saw what looked to be a shooting star that arched close to one of the flashing objects.

Then out from around the same place another oject super high and white in colour moved in a side to side motion then disappeared upwards into the atmosphere. But one of the ojects kept going in a north west direction.  This did not look like anything i have seen before.  It was a very clear night and a few clouds you could tell the object was very high because of how much past the clouds it was. And at the height it was moving at unbelieveable speeds.", "Object traveling south suddenly makes an immediate change of direction 45 degrees to the left, speed increased threefold and disappearsSaturday evening around 12:35, I noticed an object in motion just to the east of Polaris. It was moving directly due South, approximately 5 degrees per second. At first I thought satellite but immediately dismissed that as it was too late and the sun too far West to illuminate an orbiting object. I then thought meteor as it seemed to have an orange or amber glow. I discounted that as there was no trail and the level of illumination did not change. As it came closer to overhead, I noticed the object was made up of 5 separate lights in the shape of a baseball diamond. The lights did not strobe or blink, but they flickered. I felt this was probably atmospheric disturbance. I tracked the object as it sped due South. I finally reckoned it was some aircraft with a non-regulation lighting arrangement when suddenly, without changing speed, the object made a 45 degree &quot;IMMEDIATE change of direction to the left (southeast).&quot; (THIS WAS NOT A &quot;TURN&quot;) and at the same time, the object increased it&apos;s speed threefold and disappeared. I&apos;ve never seen or imagined anything like it. This was absolutely NOT a natural phenomenon. It was also NOT anything am familiar with or aware of.", "When I was 10, both me and my brother saw a triangular-shaped UFO floating in front of our house.When I was 12, me and my brother were playing in our back yard at night. Suddenly I looked up and saw a bright, triangular object floating above our house, moving from left to right. Both me and my brother saw it. It moved about as fast as a car, and was about the size of our house, maybe a little smaller. It never made a sound. We ran to the front yard to get a better look, but it was gone. Of course, no one else ever believed us.", "Cigar shaped, moved slowly.My son for several nights demanded I look out the window to see the &quot;UFO&quot;.  I refused. I had seen one in 1967or so and it had freaked me out so badly that I didn&apos;t want to look.  Finally one night he just would not be quiet so I looked. I saw a small in the distance cigar shaped object moving slowly.  I got the binoculars and saw that it had three colors, I think.  I remember red or orange and brown, possibly white. It just slowly moved out of sight. It was NOT a plane.  It looked like a cigar.", "observed 2 dull brown cigar shaped objects travelling very fast from east to west in a staggered parallel formationI was watching the perseid meteor shower from my back garden, it had been a reasonable display and i was getting cold so i decided to turn in. As i stood up 2 objects appeared in the sky to the east. They were dull brown in colour and cigar shaped, very close to each other in a slightly staggered parallel formation. They were moving very fast across the sky from the east to the west and dissapeared over the western horizon. The entire duration was about 7 seconds. I really don&apos;t think they were meteors. I observe meteors as a hobby, i check out all the annual showers and was in Tenerife in Nov 98 for the Leonid fireball show and 99 for the fainter meteor storm so i have seen a lot. These 2 objects didn&apos;t look like any meteors i have ever seen. Very puzzled by this 1.....", "Long Conta-trailI was standing outside my work van when I heard 3 explosions in the distance, at first I thought it could have been bombs, but that didnt make no sense. I looked up to the sky and I saw a contra-trail from as far as my eyes could see southwest to the northeast. It was a rather interesting trail...

The object was on the eastern horizon in the early evening.  It appeared to be a few miles away.  However, by far the most salient feature was the light coming off the craft.  It came in long rays - just like you might see in the movies or on X-files.  We could see these rays come from the craft to us - kind of like we were being scanned somehow.  The rays were very long and surprisingly s-l-o-w.  This continued for 10-15 seconds.  The rays were transparent but slightly dark - kind of like long veils of silk. The craft kind of dissolved into space after this &quot;apparent&quot; scan.  Over the time it was in our sight it covered about 10-15 degrees of arc.  It was probably at a height of several hunder feet but not above the clouds. This experience was shared by myself and a friend.  We were shooting baskets in the schoolyard. It was unforgettable.

When it flashed back I nearly fell on my back.  My family all watched and witnessed the mimicry of my flashes by this bright light.  This continued for about six mins and then suddenly the light moved direction as follows: Up/down/up/down then stopped. The movement was over a relatively short distance. This continued for about another 10 mins and suddenly the light grew bigger and brighter and then smaller and switched off completely.  There were no clouds that night and the other normal sky lights(stars etc) did not dissapear.  To this day I ask myself why I had that urge to flash my torch at the sky and why at that particular light in the sky when the african sky (in July) is absolutely filled with millions of stars.  Once again, there is nowhere in S.A to contact re UFO sightings.", "Driving South along Interstate 15My Fiance and I were returning home from moving my things from Chino and we were driving South on I15 I looked up to the night sky to see the stars that were very bright during this particular stretch of freeway.

It was the size of a star moving North at a stady rate of speed.I thought it was a plane at first, but half way across the sky it faded out.Maybe it was a satellite.", "I was fortunate to have witnessed 2 unidentified objects over a 15-20 minute period in Western MA around 1970.This incident occurred years ago, but it&apos;s fresh in my mind. I saw the following from the front of my tent while on a Boy Scout camp out at October Mountain in Western Massachusetts. The date and time information is only approximate since I didn&apos;t record that information at the time. However, the weather was calm and the night sky was clear. A white light came in from the horizon rather rapidly, however, no quicker than a jet. The light wasn&apos;t spectacular or anything; something you&apos;d expect from an aircraft. It then slowed down once above the camp area and continued along until it went out of site. There were no sounds heard from the object. A few minutes later, another light came in rapidly from the horizon just as the first. My first thought was that it was an Air Force interceptor investigating the original object. However, it gradually stopped and hovered above the camp area. It was fairly high up, perhaps 500 feet (it was difficult to know exactly). There were no sounds from this object as well. It hovered for a short while until the next event occurred. The original object came back from where it went out of site. It stopped and hovered fairly close to the most recent object; perhaps within 50-100 feet. This went on for about 20 seconds or so. The 2 objects then went off together and went out of site to where the first object did. About 5 minutes later, the two objects came back and hovered above the camp ground again. Suddenly, one object moved out of the way a bit and carefully adjusted it&apos;s position. It then accelerated vertically. I could follow it for about a second. Then it suddenly picked up tremendous speed and literally bolted into the heavens. At that moment, I knew I witnessed a very special technology in action. I didn&apos;t know what it was, but I knew it was very special. The other object went to the same takeoff position about 5 seconds later. It then took off in an identical fashion. I don&apos;t know what these objects were. However, I&apos;m glad I saw them and will never forget them.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

As they traveled West along Tx Hwy 44, they saw an oval,  bright yellow light in the  distance.  They watched it for several seconds as they continued to travel at a speed of 55 mph.  As they topped a small rise, the women saw what at first they thought was an accident scene, with ambulance and police car lights flashing red in the night.  As they approached the scene, Mrs. X became frightened and crouched down in the front floorboard area of the passenger side of the car.  Mrs. Y stopped her car opposite the scene in the brush.  The circular object, which appeared to be hovering just above tree-top level (about 15 feet).  The object was round, aluminum in color and was circumvented with flashing red and green lights.  There was a spike on the top of the object with another red and green flashing light.  Mrs. Y said the object, which she estimated to be at least 50 feet in diameter, made absolutely no sound at all.  She flashed her car lights in an attempt to see better and at that time the object began an upward movement, slowly at first, giving Mrs. Y the opportunity to see a large, black &quot;spot&quot; in the center of the bottom of the object.  The object then shot out of sight at a high rate of speed.  Mrs. Y continued her trip into Freer, dropping off her friend (who refuses to speak about the incident at all) and arriving home about 03:15 CDT.  It was at this time that Mrs. Y became frightened, realizing that she had seen something totally unknown to her.  Her daughter, a woman in her mid-twenties, became concerned at seeing her mother&apos;s pale, wide-eyed appearance and asked her was wrong, thinking the older lady had been in a wreck.  When Mrs. Y related the sighting to her daughter, who insisted they call her brother in Arizona. The brother, Mr. Y, is a retired AF Lt. Col. interested in the ufo question and a lay astronomer.  He was awake, star-gazing, when the call came. When the &apos;phone rang, Mr. Y was afraid there was trouble at home.  He was relieved to learn there wasn&apos;t, and excited to learn of his mother&apos;s UFO sighting.  Later that morning he contacted NUFORC, who contacted me.  I am Doris Upchurch, Asst. State Director (for S.Tex) for MUFON.  I called Mr. Y, verifying his excitement and obtaining his mother&apos;s &apos;phone number.  I then contacted the Y household, talking to the daughter, who related to me the appearance of her mother upon her arrival.  It was agreed that I should contact them again when I reached Freer, approximately 3 hours later.  I called Susanna Washburn, a MUFON field investigator, and we left within the hour.  We could not contact the Ys by &apos;phone when we reached Freer, so returned home to Corpus Christi.  I talked again to Mr. Y, who told me that his friend, R, had visited the sight and believed there to be some physical evidence of a landing, although this did not agree with the report from his mother.  R had also e-mailed Mr. Y a drawing made by Mrs. Y of the object she had  witnessed.  I talked again to Mrs. Y, who told me the same story as had originally been related to me by her children, stating that she believed God had allowed her to see something special.  Mrs. Y is a quiet woman, who neither reads nor writes English, learning to speak (quite well) the language when her children entered public school. To satisfy the investigative attempts, the Live Oak County State Section Director, Connie Churchill, was asked to do a follow-up investigation.  She was in contact with Mr. Y by &apos;phone and was told that Mrs. Y was expecting her call about 15:00 CDT on Thursday, June 15, 2000.  She was equipped with map co-ordinates and descriptions of the area which had been received from Mr. Y.  Again, there was no response from the Y household when our investigator got to Freer.  She proceeded to the intersection of Tx Hwy 44 and FM 3196, near where the sighting took place.  She found nothing to indicate a landing had occurred. During the following week, I received another excited e-mail from Mr. Y, stating that his friend R had found an alien face etched into a rock outcropping in the dry creek bed at the site.  I asked our newest field investigator trainee to accompany me back to Freer, arranging this time to meet with R upon our arrival.  When we reached the intersection of 44 and 3196, I called R, who came right out, leading us west for 4/10 of a mile.  We examimed the area carefully, noting the natural flood water drainage area, the dark, clay rock bed and the high voltage power lines (main supply lines between Freer and Laredo, Tx).  Neither myself nor my trainee John Richardson found anything that looked remotely like an alien face etched into the clay.  As we prepared to leave the aarea, Mrs. Y and her daughter drove by, stopped and talked to us.  Mrs. Y again related the same story she had told me on the &apos;phone, pointing out where the object had been hovering and re-affirming the fact that it had not been on the ground. She said that the dark area on the bottom of the craft looked like a hole.  (Mr. Y had told her he thought it was a doorway, but she didn&apos;t know if it was or not.  Just that it looked like a hole.)", "U.F.O. sighting was astronomic in size as to blot out the sky on all horizons.The U.F.O. was enormous in size as to blot out the sky in every direction.The  ufo in question was gray/silver in color, the bottom side of the craft seemed to be flat closest to the ground, and seemed to bevel upwards towards the ends ... even though you could not see the end of the craft because of its size. It had little lights on its underside in colors of Red, Amber,White, Blue/purple. I remember bolts of electric current bouncing of the bottom arching at will.

A number of BRIGHT (almost phosphoresant) little lights rose above a tree south of us. They were very close together, and I thought they were residual fireworks from the Fourth. It rose a little higher in the sky, and I realized it was a craft of some kind. We live in the LAx and Ontario flight paths, so we are used to crafts of all kinds. This thing was a bunch of little blinking (random) very white, almost tranluscent lights. It came north toward where I was sitting. It got close enough that I could vaguely determine that it was almost like an octagonal shaped cylinder. The funny thing was that it was very hard to get a depth perception on. It made NO SOUND at all. I was able to determine that it was lower than the planes to LAX and higher than the ones to Ontario. It came north and then made an exact right angle turn to the west. It rose higher in the sky,as it proceded west. A plane going to LAX was coming up behind it, but it was very, very difficult to judge the height or depth of this thing. It was eery. As I was trying to figure out exactly how high above the plane it was, the jet turned on all of it&apos;s lights right behind it!!!!  It followed it for about five seconds, and then the thing just disappeared, leaving only the jet to LAX in the sky. I called LAX, but of course got nothing.

It was approximately 2 miles away. It slid through the air sometimes fast and sometimes very slow, occasionally begoming fixed.

I saw in the north sky, again at the bottom of the massive cloud the orb thing. Like the other, it went into and was obscured by the storm.

It was the summer vacation between my second and third years of law school; at the time I lived in New York City where I was attending Columbia University School of Law. A friend of mine from law school had to get his car back to California before the registration expired; he&rsquo;d invited me to drive across Canada and down the West Coast.  Thus it was that on August 10, 1972 I was seated in the passenger seat of a car travelling west on the Trans Canada Highway in the western portion of Saskatchewan headed towards the Alberta border, a long and quite-deserted stretch of road. It was the beginning phase of sunset: it was still basically full daylight, but the western sky was already glowing a reddish orange. I was gazing northward out the passenger side window when I noticed a metallic object shaped rather like a long slightly squished football but more pointed on the ends (see&rdquo;P.P.S.&rdquo; on last page).  It was approaching or arriving, coming down out of the sky which would have been to the northwest of me (it was in the upper left portion of my passenger side window); however, although it was arriving, I had not seen it do a full entry from the sky -- no starting with a tiny speck getting larger -- it just seemed to show up out of nowhere albeit at a distance from which it then approached.  It came in on a trajectory rather like that of a plane coming in for a landing (except that it wasn&rsquo;t a plane and had no wings): it curved down and out to the right (east) and leveled off flying eastward parallel to the flat horizon. It was going quite fast, faster certainly than any airplane would have, but the speed wasn&rsquo;t astonishing or attention-getting at that point. I called my friend&rsquo;s attention to the bizarre object.  Since he was driving, my friend had less opportunity to watch the object; and since we were on a hard-driving schedule to get the car to California, we never considered stopping.  But as we continued to drive, my friend would pose possible explanations as I, who was observing nonstop, would report back contradications as I saw them.  My friend posited several falling object possiblities, such as meteorites, space debris, etc. beginning when I first called his attention to the object. I remember my reply was &ldquo;How many meteorites stop dead in their tracks?&rdquo;, for indeed the object&rsquo;s approach and fairly fast eastward movement ended abruptly with the vehicle suddenly, and without first slowing down, freezing dead still in the sky! The object stayed stopped in this position, which was at that point either north or northeast of me, appearing to hover.  It then fired what appeared to be a tiny jet or other propulsion off to the right (east) and reversed its direction from its arrival and moved parallel to the ground to the west, moving at what seemed to be a fast yet somehow unrushed speed in that it wasn&rsquo;t as fast as its initial arrival speed. # It then repeated these maneuvers in reverse:  an instantaneous stop, hovering, then a tiny firing to the left (west) initiated movement in the opposite (this time easterly) direction. The object, which by then I was calling a UFO because of its humanly impossible movements, stopped and hovered for a third time.  Then once AGAIN it fired what appeared to be a propulsion firing, off to the right (east), and reversed its direction a second time, except that this time the propulsion firing was slightly larger and instead of just travelling along the horizon, the UFO swept left (i.e., westward)and away (i.e., a bit northward) and UP, DISAPPEARING ALMOST INSTANTANEOUSLY up into the sky in the direction from whence it had first come!  The speed of this disappearance flight was mind-boggling -- 1,2,3 and it was gone.  Comparing it to even our most powerful end-of-the-century rockets&rsquo; launches, where the rocket is visible for quite some time, this UFO had propulsion man hasn&rsquo;t begun to come close to.  Ditto on the incredible in-air maneuverability which included fast speeds, fast stops, and hovering apparently at will. To focus on the object itself as opposed to its movements, the object appeared to be metallic and shiny and appeared to be brightly reflecting the reddish-orange of the setting sun. (This would account for the object being called a &ldquo;fireball&rdquo; in the next morning&rsquo;s newspapers, though it definitely was not a fireball -- it was bright fire-colored light reflecting off metal.  This would also account for varying reports as to its color being red, blue, or orange -- the daytime sightings and/or sightings at a different angle would not have picked up the red-orange reflection of the sunset&rsquo;s light.) I have never hazarded a guess as to the object&rsquo;s size or its distance from me because I have lousy size and distance estimating skills and because even if I had better skills, there was no size or distance frame of reference out there in that vast, flat, and empty plain.  I can only say that it clearly was neither super close (not on top of us and not close enough for me to have observed any specific features on the vehicle if there were any) nor super far away (not a speck on the horizon -- MUCH more visible and observable). I can&rsquo;t say whether the UFO made any noise.  I heard none, but I was far enough away that there could have been noise I didn&rsquo;t hear (plus the car windows were up), although I probably WOULD have heard it if it had been as loud as, say, one of the U.S.&rsquo;s rocket launches.  What also strikes me after the fact is that despite the incomprehensible speed of the departure, there was no sonic boom.  Humans&rsquo; jets moving at a small fraction of the speed make dramatic and highly noticeable sonic booms. I have always been clear that the above-described object clearly was a UFO and was of extra-terrestrial/not-man-on-earth origins.  The various &ldquo;explanations&rdquo; offered in the newspapers the next morning (copies of two attached hereto), from meteors to other falling objects to fireballs to sunspots, are laughable and don&rsquo;t come CLOSE to fitting the facts -- such objects do not stop in midflight, hover, and then zoom back up into the sky from whence they came. And it&rsquo;s inconceivable that it was a secret government vehicle like the UFO&rsquo;s that turned out to be tests of the Stealth # plane:  since then we&rsquo;ve been so thrilled at creating a space shuttle that could return to space -- although it had to be towed back to its launch site and put back on a rocket, and we had our problems getting that technology to work; that doesn&rsquo;t sound like a government with a vehicle that can return to space instantaneously at will from a standstill in the sky!  Plus I&rsquo;ve already mentioned the dramatic difference in our rockets&rsquo; launch speeds and this UFO&rsquo;s blinding &ldquo;launch&rdquo;/disappearance speed. Plus the lack of a sonic boom. However, some time after the UFO disappeared, my friend and I did observe two other strange events which I&rsquo;ve always said could have been unrelated to the UFO and could have had unrelated earthly explanations -- but I&rsquo;ve always wanted to learn more because it was so strange that these next two bizarre events followed so closely on the heels of what was definitely a UFO appearance. After the UFO zipped back up into space and after the sun had set, my friend and I were still driving westward on the Trans Canada Highway, probably pretty much at the Saskatchewan/Alberta border by that time.  It was a VERY dark night and the road was pretty much deserted.  As I had all day, I was gazing out the passenger side window (northward).  Eventually a group of phenomenally bright lights, on the ground, came into view:  at that point the plains had some roll to the land, and coming out from behind one of these rolls, so that I couldn&rsquo;t see the source, was the most dazzling display of bright white lights that lit up all the land and sky around it.  It wasn&rsquo;t too far above (i.e., north of) the Trans Canada Highway. It was rather like a huge display of klieg light opening up a gigantic glitzy new shopping mall in Texas, except that the klieg lights I&rsquo;d previously seen made specific spotlights in the sky and often were moving back and forth or around in circles -- these lights didn&rsquo;t have that spotlight effect -- it was more of a huge, constant, and unmoving, light display. At the time my two guesses were a government installation or a landed UFO; why else would this city-appropriate light display be out there in the middle of nowhere?  When we finally got to a bigger town, Medicine Hat, where we stayed for the night, we asked numerous citizens about the huge lights out on the plains just east of town and just above the Trans Canada Highway, but nobody had a clue what it was, and everybody was clear it wasn&rsquo;t any permanent building or installation.  I still totally reserve judgement and work on the assumption that the lights were there by the hand of man. In August 2000 I did learn that the Canadian government was rumored to have at one point had a UFO-attraction experiment out of an air base located just north/northeast of Medicine Hat, which project included trying to attract UFO&rsquo;s with bright lights (Project Lure, described at www.aufosg.org/kijek/page 90 and page 87).  Although the government claimed to have ceased the project prior to 1972, my current best guess as to the massive klieg light-like display I saw is that perhaps either the government or some other private project was trying to attract back the UFO that had appeared near there earlier that evening.  But it&rsquo;s an open question, of course.  Nothing so clear as my first event. # Now to the third event, which was TRULY strange.  It happened almost immediately after we&rsquo;d passed the huge bright lights and once again had our dark sky and deserted road.  I looked out the car&rsquo;s rear window and saw a small cluster or cloud comprised of tiny dots bigger than the water drops in regular clouds or hazes:  the tiny dots were tiny, glowing, neon or fluorescent green lights.  The cloud was small (though big enough that I couldn&rsquo;t have gotten my arms around it) and amorphous and slightly changed its contours or overall shape from time to time.  Most of the time the green light cloud was just immediately outside the car -- any closer and it would have been touching the car -- AND IT WAS FOLLOWING THE CAR!  It kept its distance behind the rear car window (and slightly up) constant. We theorized that perhaps the car was throwing up a dust cloud and for some reason the dust around there was glowing and green and fluorescent.  But then the cloud moved around to the side of the car and travelled along with us just outside of my right passenger side window!  (By the way I&rsquo;m from Minnesota and have canoed in Canada -- I definitely know Northern Lights, and this had nothing to do with Northern Lights.) On my next &ldquo;observation&rdquo; I do own that I could have been imagining things, but I definitely had the sense of an intelligence in this green light cloud, and it seemed to be an intelligence evaluating me, perhaps to go with it. Until very recently I&rsquo;ve almost never mentioned this impression to anybody, including the friend with me in the car, because it just seemed so far-fetched (now it seems less so -- see below). In any event I tried to &ldquo;send&rdquo; no-don&rsquo;t-take-me messages to the cloud just in case.  Then the cloud moved back to its original position just up and behind the car&rsquo;s rear window and stayed with us until the lights of Medicine Hat started to become visible, at which point the cloud started to hang back more but was still travelling with us.  Then we made the turn off the main road into Me! dicine H at and the cloud pulled way back and up and finally left us -- it seemed not to want to go into the town with us. As with the klieg lights that immediately preceded the green neon light cloud, I&rsquo;ve always said that there could well be earthly explanations -- I&rsquo;m certainly not ready to swear to unearthliness on a stack of Bibles the way I would vis-a-vis the first event, the flying object. I am, however, intrigued and amazed by my recent (August 2000) reading of documents concerning a pilot and plane that disappeared in 1978 off the coast of Australia after being harrassed by a UFO very similar to the one I saw in Canada in 1972 and just after the pilot reported seeing a green light while the UFO was hovering above his plane (pilot named Frederick Valentich; documents found at www.bermuda-triangle.org/Investigations/UFO_Incidents/Summary_Report). Also, an October 27, 1966 article in the Saskatoon Star Phoenix reported two different people who said they had been followed in their cars for miles by an object which repeatedly shone a spotlight on their vehicle as it was driving (copy will be attached as soon as I get it).  AND recently in Nevada a UFO was seen to generate a greenish blue &ldquo;fog&rdquo; 60 feet away from the vehicle (www.filersfiles.com/files/2000/FilersFiles29). (On August 10, 1972 it was a very dark night, the windows were closed, and I was looking only to the north.  I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have noticed if anything had approached from # behind -- e.g., I didn&rsquo;t notice the glowing green light cloud until it was immediately outside the car&rsquo;s rear window.) The morning after our sighting, August 11, 1972, the newspaper stands were full of many different newspapers, all with headlines or front page stories about the August 10, 1972 UFO.  We couldn&rsquo;t stay in Medicine Hat to learn more because we had such a pressing deadline to get to California.  I do regret not keeping the various newpaper articles we found that day.  I have recently obtained the August 11, 1972 articles from the Medicine Hat News and the Calgary Herald (copies attached hereto).  These report that the object (which they keep calling a &ldquo;fireball&rdquo;) was seen that day in scattered points, first throughout the Western U.S. and then in southeastern British Columbia and Alberta; these sightings were said to include one by &ldquo;a jet fighter pilot flying over southeastern Washington.&rdquo;  I haven&rsquo;t re-found the account yet, but I do also remember reading in one of the newspapers that morning that the same object had also been seen throughout the week or weeks preceding August 10, 1972 throughout the Great Plains of the U.S.  I also remember reading that morning that a U.S. Air Force jet pilot had tried to chase it but couldn&rsquo;t catch it and that he had clocked the object as going a speed beyond man&rsquo;s capabilities. ((name and contact information deleted))  P.S. I&rsquo;ve left my friend&rsquo;s name out as he was upset about at having to admit he&rsquo;d really seen a UFO and he didn&rsquo;t want anyone to know he&rsquo;d seen it, and I have no idea whether he still feels this way about it.  RS Atts.: (1) two Aug.11, 1972 articles from Medicine Hat News (2) three articles from the Calgary Herald (one=Aug.11, 1972) (3) 1966 reports of spotlights following cars in Saskatchewan P.P.S. I have always described the shape of &ldquo;my&rdquo; UFO as being a squished football but with more pointed ends.  After seeing photos and sketches of various UFO&rsquo;s, I realize that what I saw could just as easily have been a disc or classic saucer if tipped slightly away or towards me. # Your form doesn&apos;t allow me to paste in the full description that I had already written!

I usually sit and watch the stars when I saw an unusual white light.There were no other lights on the object and I could not tell the shape. It was about as bright as a star. I was facing the west and the light was about at 30 deg from the horizon and about 30 deg to the north of the constellation Taurus. I cannot tell how far away it was, but from my best guestimate it would have been some where between Placerville and Lake Tahoe, moving in a north-westerly direction. The speed wasnt as fast as a satellite would be but it wasnt as slow as a plane. I saw the light for about 15-30 seconds then it slowly faded out. I kept watching it thinking it was a plane but there was no sign of any strobes, which if it had been a plane I would have been able to see. I can definately say it wasn&apos;t an airplane.", "Two cylinder shaped objects moving quickly across the sky making no noise.I saw two cylinder shaped objects in what appeared to be close formation. They were moving across the sky to the southwest. The sun had just gone below the horizon and the objects seemed to be reflecting sunlight. I&apos;m not sure of their altitude but it must have been at least ten thousand feet for them to still be reflecting sunlight. My first thought was that they were large military aircraft flying in formation, but as they passed overhead the trailing object seemed to break formation and continue in a more southerly direction. They moved fairly quickly and made no noise.", "A VERY bright light doing impossable turns, then dropping to a pinpoint of light ...We were looking at the clear dark sky when we saw a VERY BRIGHT LIGHT appear very high in the n.e. sky. It had a glow around the bright light and was moving N.E. to S.W.  After about 10 seconds it stopped and the light went from VERY BRIGHT to a small pinpoint of light, and changed course 45 degrees in 1 second!! It was now going from High N.E. to due East.  After about 5 more seconds the light flashed twice and was gone.", "6 of us saw three bright lights appearing next to each other for about 1.5 hours, several crafts appeared to be searching for it.Six of us were on our oceanfront vacation home, and saw 3 lights appear in a line one at a time, and stayed lit for about 3 seconds, then one light would appear for a few seconds and then dissappear, then reappear hundreds of yards to the right or left seconds later.  Sometimes we could see a very dimly lit light after the bright lights went out.  This went on for about 1 and a half hours, and there were people in the house behind us and a few houses down that were also watching this go on.  During this a prop plane came out and flew down the coast line 15 times around the area that we saw the object.  A coast guard craft? also appeared out in the distance and moved very quickly several times down the coast.  There was a fishing boat that was right underneath the object when it first started appearing, it moved very quickly out of the distance during the activity.  In the sky behind us we saw 4 Military jets? moving extemeley fast, 3 had red lights and they looked like they were escorting a forth craft that was had a white light. They quickly dissappeared into the distance.  At 11:00pm was the last time we saw the bright light appear over the ocean, we estimate it maybe a half mile from our porch over the ocean.  We saw nothing the next two nights.", "slow moving &apos;star&apos; that morphed into incredibly bright series of white lights, then back and disappearedthis is a copy/pasted report that i just stumbled across....i saw the same thing but further away, so, as to your notes, now you know at least one other person witnessed this &apos;craft&apos;...my own notes can be found below theirs...here is their post: Occurred : 6/4/2000 02:00 (Entered as : 06/04/00 02:00) Reported : 6/11/2000 00:21 Posted : 6/21/2000 Location : Milwaukee (South), WI Shape : Disk We saw a bright row of lights in the sky attached to a saucer-shaped craft. We saw the craft land in a nearby street and approached it We saw a bright set of lights in the sky (like stadium lights) that appeared to be about 1 1/2 away. The lights dimmed. The craft made a sharp turn to the right and hovered. We ran to our car. We saw the craft land through the bushes. It landed almost like it was going down stairs.

The object was moving very slowly across the sky, travelling approximately from the north to the south, and in a path that was almost over my street.  I was amazed that it was completely silent.  It&apos;s difficult to guess how big the object was or how high, but I would estimate it was about a hundred feet up and maybe 25-50 feet long.  When the object was almost directly overhead, I thought to run back into the house to get my telescope.  When I returned, the object was still moving slowly in the same direction, but was nearing the crest of the hill beside my house.  Before I could find it in the telescope it had disappeared over the hill.  Since it was so long ago, I don&apos;t remember the exact date or even the correct year, but the details of the sighting are still vivid in my mind.

What made me focus on it was that it was moving towards a long bridge structure and it was moving pretty fast.(I have since found out that the only bridge that it could be was the San Mateo Bridge) The dark object had a diameter of about 100 feet and naturally as the plane I was in was climbing it got smaller in size. Unfortunately, I was not able to see what transpired when the object approached the bride as the wing impeded my view. No turbulence was notice in front of the object nor behind it as it moved swiftly. Therefore, I concluded that it had to be underwater but how could an object move that quickly underwater without churning up water and leaving a trail. I also considered at the time it was happening that it was a shadow but it was moving perpendicular to our flight path.((NUFORC Note:  A second, slightly different version of report was submitted by the same witness.  PD))I was in a plane just seconds after take-off from SFO for Canada when I looked out from my window seat onto the water below and saw a dark circular object moving rapidly at right angles to our flight path. It was headed for the San Mateo Bridge coming from the northwest direction. (I have since looked on the internet what bridge is closest to SFO as I am not familiar with San Francisco at all). The object caught my attention as it was moving rather quickly for something on the water though it did not have any turbulence associated with it. My initial immpression was that it was a shadow somehow created by the airplane however, I have been in enough airplanes and seen the shadow of the plane I have been in to know that this was not the case (usually wings and tailfin are recognizable). During the experience of watching it I concluded it that had to be an underwater object. Looking at what direction it was going in I could see that the eastern end of the bridge was in its way; it had to either change direction, slow down or emerge from the water and hop over the bridge structure as this end of the bridge is solid underneath. Unfortunately, I was not able to witness what happened as the wing of the plane blocked my view. The reason why I am logging this sighting is to find out if anyone on the bridge at that time saw something emerge out of water.", "Strange glowing objects and a fireball.At about 22:50 I went onto my patio to smoke, I noticed strange lights to the west of me over the Olympic mountains. There were 4 of them very bright orangish in color. As I continued to watch them I could tell they were moving down very slowly. When the second to last one was gone I saw a bright flash behind the mountain, like an explosion, about 15 minutes after the last light was gone. I saw a bright streaming orange fireball coming from the south to the north, I first saw it around the Mountain called The Brothers. This light had a tail on it, unlike a com trail though, it stayed directly behind the object as it moved and never decreased or increased in size and it was moving to slow ot be a meteor, As it moved to north and its altitude decreased it decsended behind the other mountain that the other lights were behind. At this time I noticed a helicopter in the area. At about 21:30 the helicopter flew away from the area and flew directly over my town at an altitude of about 500 feet.

The moon had already set, so the sky was very dark. The milky way was glowing, and as I was looking up at it streaching from South West to North East I saw a blue light pass over at a very high altitude. It moved very slowly and I figured that it was a satelite in orbit. It was moving along the milky way and as I watched it, the object did something which I have never seen a satelite do! The color of the object changed from a star blue to a brilliant white light and increased in magnitude. It then dimmed back to the star blue. After that it again changed to a brighter blue and dimmed again. I know that it was not an illusion caused by clouds as it was a very clear sky!

I just finished reading a book and went to the kitchen to get some food and for some reason I went outside and looked up at the stars and thought I hope I see a UFO and when i looked up again I saw two flashing lights above a mountian across the vally from my house one red and one green naturally at first I thought it was a plane but I couldnt hear it and it wasnt moving so then I thought it could be a planet but I noticed it was swaying and moving unsteadly not smoothly like a plane and I have never seen a plane stay in one place for a long ammount of time before I kept watching for about five more minutes and came to the conclusion that its nothing and it was a plane and I must be soupid to think it was a UFO. So I ran inside and got my brother who was watching tv at the time when he saw it he told me it was a planet until it moved again back and forward very slowley the thought of it being a plane didnt really enter his head because we know what a plane flying through the night sky looks like we watched for about ten more minutes and I was still trying to get my head around what I was seeing. My brother told me to go and get the telescope so I ran to my bedroom and grabbed it I hadent used it in ages so it wasnt assembled as I proceded to assemble the tripod my brother caught it on the telescope and told me it defanitly wasnt a plane or planet he said it looked like a triangle of red,blue,green and white light. It hovered there for about five more minutes and thenvanished just as I got the tripod assembled jez I was pissed. We deciced to stay outside for a second chance of seeing it again and about three minutes later we saw it on the other side of the vally we were so happy to see it again but it was further away this time and moving slowley across the vally we decided to go and wake my mother up. She came out to have a look and said it was a plane and about ten minutes later a plane flew past we all laughed and we could hear it was a plane we then went inside and set the telescope up inside we all stood there watching it for a while and then my mum went to bed my brother and I caught it in the telescope. It was so cool through the telescope it looked like a dome but it had no apparent shape at one stage it looked like a red fireball and then a five cent coin. The colours were clearer through the telescope and were very beautiful it was mostly blue with green,red and white flashes with a hint of orange the colours kept changing as well. It didnt look like it was very steady moving around viontly my brother went to bed at about 1:35am but I stayed up watching it fly so far away that I could hardly see it I fell asleep before it dissapeared. It was one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen.

There were a few ships out to sea but they were anchored as their night lights were not moving at all.  The two bright lights were positioned one either side of a large ship but then moved towards eachother slowly and then suddenly flew apart at a great speed to stop in prev position.  The lights then flashed alternately and continued in this fashion for a few more minutes. At first we thought the lights to be pilot boats but when we saw their speed and manouvering we knew this to be impossible as no boat or helicoptor on earth can move in such a manner and speed.

After about 20 minutes it moved further northwest out of my view, but reappeared in about 5 minutes, heading east. That is when I observed 2 more objects, at a greater distance, but w/same features.  Some of the time, they were covered by clouds, but they slowly moved due east towards the ocean (approx 15miles from where I live).  The sky was beginning to brighten, and they were too far away.  I called the sheriff&apos;s office, but no one else had reported these objects.", "A string of 5 to 9 lights flying in a horizontal formation nearly equidistant apart then turning abruptly away to their left.Exactly 55 Degrees (Magnetic) North by Northeast from the village of Redfield my wife called me out on the back porch to see a string of lights about 5 to 8 miles away at an angle up from horizontal about 10 degrees. The lights were some white some amber and some red. They were flying toward us at first as if they were flying side by side and then they turned abruptly to the east (their left) and when they did it looked as if they picked up speed then the lights were gone. Unless they were closer than we think, it appeared as if they were accelerating faster than any helicopter. I say helicopter because that is my only explanation for lights at night in this wild area. There is a large wilderness area beneath where these lights were. It is known as the Tug Hill Plateau which is a large blank area on most maps of New York State to the South and slightly east of the city of Watertown. If it wasn&apos;t a group of 10th Mountain Division troops from Fort Drum conducting some kind of night exercise then I have no explanation. We have lived here all of our lives 45 years and have never seen any 10th Mountain Division helicopters flying at night. I also should mention that there was no noise at all, either because of the distance or that the craft didn&apos;t make any noise. The night was still and quiet as there are few active people around here that time of night and no traffic at all. We wanted to call an air traffic control center in Syracuse at Hancock Airport but there is no number to call and we couldn&apos;t find any Fort Drum numbers. If anyone knows how to get a quick report from a radar center or something I would appreciate it so if we see anything again we can call someone and ask if they can identify it. Thanks.", "4  of us saw the object while living near Prescott ArizonaHi, I am not very good at expressing things  in writing, please bare with me (.am not sure of the exact date, know it was  October 1975) I was a teenager ,staying with some  friends near Prescott ,AZ with  a family  of  4, the husband worked in Phoenix, would come  home on the weekends, but  the  Mom, her 2 kids and I were  awoke one  night (had to be on a weeknight , husband was in Phoenix.) to our dogs  barking, very loud  and  as if they were affraid, expecting to see a bear or mountian lion, loose dog or horse, but what we saw scared the daylights out of us, ( were all  4  sleeping in the same room, as they were building their house) at the time, we looked out the window, because was  unsure  pof what it was but over in the distance (may have been 3/4 of a mile ? not  sure)  on a hill, was a circular  shaped  object, with lights  going in  motion around the bottom, it looked as though it had landed on the side of the  hill, Well none of us was about to go all the way over their to get a better look  (TOO AFFRAID), but it was their  appx  30 min, just staying in one place not moving up or down or side to side, then  all of a sudden it just  went straight up  very fast and disappeared??? but the next day ( DAY LIGHT)  we did ride the horses over their and  on the side of the hill it was pretty rocky in some spots but some areas were soft enough to leave a partail impression, of a round print in the ground??? While living in the Prescott  Area,(Spring of 1995) my mom and I used to see  Cigar shaped, Disks,- (small and Large) in the skys even in broad daylight, my dad used to tell us we were seeing things, until............. He started seeing them too, he said one morning just before the break of day  a saucer shaped craft, was just over the mountain, maybe a Mile? and it had turned up so as to look at it  from the top , and he said it sat their for a few min, then  just went  up and out of sight, then the sun came all the way up, but he said he had enough light to see, it was not a plane ,or helicopter balloon, like  the Government  always try to say they are, he also saw Cigars shaped too. I in my life time  have probably seen  15-20 different  UFO&apos;s, We never got any pictures, though, we were seeing them so often, we would run back in the house to grab the camera and by the time we would get back out side it would be gone, or to far away to get a picture then  we thought we got smart- started carrying a camera, but  it always seemed as though buy the time we got it out of the bag and  ready  aimed to shoot  the object would be gone, some times they would only stay in one place for a few seconds very disapointing, because I know it was none  of the above mentioned man made craft.. Thank You", "On June the 5th 1999, one week before my wedding, my best man along with my friends and brothers surprised me by hosting my stag at a comedy club where that particular evening myself with a group of others were to be hypnotized.  The evening went great and I had a wonderful time, and yes during the show I was one of the &amp; subjects who was hypnotized. Trouble is just before my wedding date, I believe it was the Thursday, I started having dreams of a very different nature.  I dreamt that I was awakened (as if I were right there in my body at that very moment  not like myself standing by my bed watching me wake up, rather I was in my body within my dream.) and there were two short people with huge eyes and what I found funny about that was that they did not have any eye lids or eyebrows.  It was hard to tell what they really looked like because it was dark in the room.  I cannot say that they forced me as much as I volunteered to follow them.  They spoke oddly without opening their mouths and before I could talk they would answer me.  I don&apos;t remember much after that until the time that I was sitting on a very low chair, the kind you would find in a kindergarten classroom.  Then I remember talking to them for a while and them telling me stuff about where they come from and then I don&apos;t know how the conversation started, but the next thing I know is that whatever the hell it was I was seated in became transparent on the upper half and I could see earth below me.  Then we swerved extremely fast, just like you do when you go around the corner on a roller coaster, except that I did not feel much of the turn.  Just then (I know it sound stupid) I felt like I was turning into water except without the water.  It or I was like what you feel when you get a mild electrical shock, except that it did not hurt and it felt warm.  The thing was it wasn&apos;t just me turning watery or melting which I think is more of an accurate description.  Everything melted too  the sun, stars, earth, and the next thing I remember is that I was hovering over some planet with domes on it.  I remember asking if we were going to go down there, but they said no, and then I remember nothing. I was not forcibly confined unlike the stories you hear, and at all times I remember the feeling of free will.  Yes I know what I am saying sounds crazy, but I cannot forgo the sounds, smells, touch, of every part of my senses.  Since last year I have read that you can remember more under hypnosis, and I am willing to go a truth test and be hypnotized again.  If I did experience this, I am sure my dreams of this are somewhat fantasized of what actually happened to me, if anything at all.  But then I have been drawing stuff like triangles within triangles.  I asked my friends if at any point the hypnotist even suggested to myself or anyone that we were on a UFO, but all of them said that that never happened, also I remember everything from the comedy club.  My guess is that the best scanerio is that we can actually find out where they live, and the worst case is that I am pronounced as a stupid fellow with nothing better to do with his time but to dream the fantastic and scream wolf!  If you wish to call me I can provide you with references upon references to who I am, and if you actually believe me (I don&apos;t believe it myself) call me.

PD))Very strange, luminous blue &quot;cloud&quot; at around 8:pm.My girlfriend and I both witnessed a strange neon blue cloud in the sky, just after 8:pm.  Cloud is the best word I could use to describe it, but its shape was too strange and defined to be an actual cloud.  At first it looked sort of like a beam from a flood light, only with no origin.  It had defined edges, like from a flashlight, but at the end of the &quot;cloud&quot; it changed direction, with a sort of triangular point.  The sky was not totally black yet, but there were no other clouds in the sky what so ever.  This &quot;cloud&quot;/thing was definatlly luminous.  It didn&apos;t move or do anything else strange, but in all my life I&apos;ve never seen anything else like it.  My girlfriend agreed that she&apos;d never seen anything like it.  The next day at work, two co-workers said they saw the same thing, but one of them said they saw something in addition.  In her desription, she said she first saw a bright light in the sky, brighter than the moon and about as large as a basketball.  It put out three beams of light, one from each side and one from the middle.  She went in her house to go get her mother to see it, but when she came out it was gone, and all that was left was that blue neon &quot;cloud&quot; in its place.  I looked in the local newspapers the next few days, but saw no reports of this strange occurence, which made me delay in make any report myself.  I&apos;ve never made a report before, but this was that strange.  Even stranger was that two days in that same week, prior to the blue &quot;cloud&quot; I saw some strange things in the sky at a far distance.  Both in daylight hours, and one of the times with my girlfriend their with me while we were washing the car.  She is also skeptical about ufo&apos;s and things, but she agreed on both occurences that what we saw was clearly unidentifiable.  I&apos;ve read only one report the was very similar to the luminous blue &quot;cloud&quot; I had seen, which is partially what made me give mine as well.", "I was driving home late at night an observed 3 columns of green light in a field.Location: West Wyoming, PA. I was driving home at about 10:30 pm on a Sunday evening on approximately 11/15/95. This part of the town is a wooded area with no street lights. A light caught my eye to the left as I was driving and I looked out of my driver&apos;s side window. I continued to drive for about 30 seconds and there was a clearing in the woods where a house stood nearby. I saw the light very cleary. I pulled my car over to the side of the road to get a good look. I remained in the vehicle the whole time. I saw three (3) distinct vertical columns of green light. Each column of light was perfectly cylindrical and tapered at the top and bottom. The lights were about 30-40 feet high, 5 feet in diameter and approximately 10-15 feet equidistant from each other. They were about 5-10 feet from touching the ground. The color was green and  somewhat muted or hazy, almost flourescent-like. I rolled down my window to make sure that it was not a reflection or glare on the window. I observed the lights for about 1 minute. I did not see a physical craft above the lights. There was no movement of the lights and no sound at all. I continued to drive home dumbfounded and this is when it really hit me that it was something unusual: About 3 minutes later I saw the same lights higher in the sky (about 1000 feet) but they were moving in a south-west direction and increasing in altitude. I was also traveling in a south-west direction (same direction as the lights) and I continued to clearly observe the lights until they were totally out of sight.  This continued for another 5 minutes.The lights stayed in the same shape (3 columns of green light) as they moved off until they were so small that I could no longer see them. The total time from when I first noticed the lights until I saw them disappear was about 10 minutes.

They were flying as if they were searching for something,but as i stood in the back yard they started to fly not from north,south then east,west but in a large circular area.As they flew in this pattern i noticed they were regular aircraft but had two bright white lights on them like headlights. By now my mother had gotten out of bed to see why i had not came inside. as she was leaning out the back door i showed her  what i was watching. Then out of nowhere came this huge object. It was approx. 300ft. wide and 175-200ft. long. It was completely dark, no lights,or sound,and was flying very low&apos; around 250ft. It headed north rather slowly and i could hear the air coming off of it .As it went to the north it then slowly turned to the east and drifted out of sight. Then the other aircraft took off in the same direction. I wanted to see if i could spot it again but it had shaken my mother to the point she wanted me to come inside.I have never seen anything like it since and will never forget it.", "Peter, Got news of a crop circle formation around Hwy. 93 between Kalispell and Whitefish, Mt. was seen by a pilot flying over a wheat field. this formation was at the corner of Hwy 93 and Church Drive.

It was a clear night and you could see all the stars, so I stepped off my poarch and into my front yard to look at the stars, when I turned and faced the house, (looking East N.E.), I noticed 4 stars together.  As I started to look to my left I noticed that one of the 4 stars appeared to be growing in size and changing color, but it was stationary.  The color was very similar to that of the planet Mars as observed from the ground at night.  I simply thought that what I was seeing was simply a planet or twinkling star, that is when I glanced back at the other 3 stars in the group and noticed that this &quot;object&quot; was now 2-3 times larger than the stars that it was next to and had completely change color from a white &quot;star&quot; color/appearance to an orange/yellow color.  The &quot;object&quot; began to suddenly move to my left in a straight line paralell to the horizon.  It moved at a rate of speed like that of an airplane for about 10 seconds and then stopped in the center of the star group.  It stayed stationary and both its size and color returned to that similar to the stars around it.  It remained stationary in the star group for about 30 seconds and then it changed both size and color again and began to move to my lower left (at a 45 degree angle to the horizon).  At this point it change shape from a circlular appearance to an elongated appearance, but its speed actually slowed until it pasted the star group that I was using as a reference point.  Once past the stars it increased speed and made a sudden change in direction to my upper left, (at a 45 degree angle to the horizon in an upward direction). At this point the suddenly disappeared.  There were no visible clouds in the sky.  I first suspected a planet, as I said, but ruled it out with movement.  I then suspected a satelite until the object stopped moving the first time.  After the shift to the lower left and both color and shape change I suspected a shooting star, but was completely surprised when it changed direction and moved in an uppward direction and disapeared.  I suspected that maybe it might be a test of some type from Redstone Arsenal here in town, but after realizing that it was in the opposite direction, I gave up on ideas. Can you help?

I had previously seen a U.F.O. through my 13&quot; aperture scope. You would have to ask me about that one!", "After noting a communicaitons failure, we observed a large glowing sphere hovering over the ship.This encounter occurred in 1971, while aboard the aircraft carrier, USS John F. Kennedy CVA-67 (now CV-67) in the Bermuda Triangle, southeast of Florida. I was assigned to the communications department of the Kennedy and had been in this section about a year. The ship was returning to Norfolk, VA after completing a two week operational readiness exercise (ORE) in the Caribbean. We were to stand down for 30 days, after arriving in Norfolk, Virginia, to allow the crew to take leave and visit family before deploying to the Mediterranean for six months. I was on duty in the communications center. My task was to monitor eight teletypes printing the &quot;Fleet Broadcasts&quot;. On the top row were four teletypes each printing messages from four different channels. On the bottom row were four more doing the exact same thing except the signal was carried on different frequencies. If one of the primary receivers started taking &quot;hits&quot; I would be able to retrieve the message from the bottom one. I also notified Facilities Control of any hits so they could tune the receivers. On the other side of the compartment(room) was the NAVCOMMOPNET (Naval Communications Operations Network). This was the Ship to Shore circuit with the top teletype being the receive and the bottom as the send (known as a duplex circuit). Next to this was the Task Group Circuit for ship to ship communications (task group operations or TGO). It was in the evening, about 20:30 (8:30 PM) and the ship had just completed an eighteen hour &quot;Flight Ops&quot;.  I had just taken a message off one of the broadcasts and turned around to file it on a clip board. When I turned back to the teletypes the primaries were typing garbage. I looked down to the alternates which were doing the same. I walked a few feet to the intercom between us and the Facilities Control. I called them and informed them of the broadcasts being out. A voice replied that all communications were out. I then turned  and looked in the direction of the NAVCOMMOPNET and saw that the operator was having a problem. I then heard the Task Group operator tell the watch officer that his circuit was out also. In the far corner of the compartment was the pneumatic tubes going to the Signal bridge (where the flashing light and signal flag messages are sent/receive). There is an intercom there to communicate with the Signal Bridge and over this intercom we heard someone yelling  &quot;IT IS GOD! IT&apos;S THE END OF THE WORLD!&quot;. A moment later we heard another voice yelling. &quot;There is something hovering over the ship!&quot; As we looked up, we saw a large, glowing sphere. Well it seemed large, however, there was no point of reference. That is to say, if the sphere were low; say 100 feet above the ship, then it would have been about two to three hundred feet in diameter. If it were say 500 feet about the ship then it would have been larger. At arms length it was the size of a beach ball. It made no sound that I could hear. The light coming from it wasn&apos;t too bright, about half of what the sun would be. It pulsated from yellow to orange slowly. We didn&apos;t get to looked at for more than about 20 seconds because General Quarters (Battle stations) was sounding and the Communication Officer was in the passageway telling us to get back into the Comm Center. We returned and stayed there (that was out battle station). We didn&apos;t have much to do because all the communication was still out. After about 20 minutes, the teletypes started printing correctly again. We stayed at General Quarters for about  another hour, then secured. I didn&apos;t see or hear of any messages going out about the incident. Over the next few hours, I talked to a good friend that was in CIC (combat information center) who was a radar operator. He told me that all the radar screens were just glowing during the time of the incident. I also talked to a guy I knew that worked on the Navigational Bridge. He told me that none of the compasses were working and that the medics had to sedate a boatswains mate that was a lookout on the signal bridge. I figured this was the one yelling it was God. It was ironic that of the 5,000 men on a carrier, that only a handful actually saw this phnomenon. This was due to the fact that flight Ops had just be completed a short time before this all started and all the flight deck personnel were below resting. It should be noted that there are very few places where you can go to be out in the open air aboard a carrier. From what I could learn, virtually all electronic components stopped functioning during the 20 minutes or so that what ever it was hovered over the ship. The two Ready CAPs (Combat Air Patrol), which were two F-4 Phantoms that are always ready to be launched, would not start. I heard from the scuttlebut (slang - rumor mill) that three or four &quot;men in trenchcoats&quot; had landed, and were interviewing the personnel that had seen this phenomena. I was never interviewed, maybe because no one knew that I had seen it. A few days latter, as we were approaching Norfolk, the Commanding and Executive Officers came on the closed circuit TV system that we had. They did this regularly to address the crew and pass on information. During this particular session the Captain told us how well we did on the ORE and about our upcoming deployment to the Mediterranean. At the very end of his spiel, he said &quot;I would like to remind the crew, that certain events that take place aboard a Naval Combatant Ship, are classified and are not to be discussed with anyone without a need to know&quot;. This was all the official word I ever received or heard of the incident.", "Returng home about midnight I encountered a meter diameter sphere hovering about 10 ft over the road.While returning home about midnight in mid summer 1975, I turned the corner in a suburban district of Ottawa and I say a spherical object about a meter in diameter hovering about 3 meters above the center of the street.  The object was bobbing around slightly and it surface seemed to be radiating multi-coloured light that was rotating around its perimeter.  The light was of very pure colors of orange, blue, red and white and seemed to be rotating in patches all over its surface.  I stopped to observe it for a few seconds and then began to approach slowly in my vehicle.  I got to within about 60 feet and the object began to rise slightly and move off toward the right side of the street.  It floated behind a tree and between two houses in the direction of the next street over.  I went around the block and once again saw it hovering above the middle of the next street.  This time as I approached slowly, it moved immediately in the same manner and direction without letting me get closer than about 150 feet.  Once again it floated between houses in the direction of the next street.  Again I went around the block and for a third time it was hovering over the middle of the street.  This time I accelerated towards it and it took off like a shot.  I have been present at military live fire trials at night where tracer rounds were being fired and this object moved considerably faster than a bullet.

I watched it for at least 5 seconds while it moved slowly north.  One second it was there then it was gone. It made no sound and there were no aircraft in the sky.  It was perfectly round.  The edges were very distinct.  It appeared to be a light, but it did not have a beam of light or any rays around it.  The color wasn&apos;t gold like glitter gold, but a muted golden color. This is the third sphere I&apos;ve seen.  The first one was in the fall of 1995.  That happened on a cloudy day and the globe/sphere was below the cloud deck.  It performed the typical slipping through the atmosphere with the zig zag motion of a saucer (if there is anything typical about a saucer).   I was on a hill and was a little above this object when I observed it around 7 pm. The second time I saw a sphere/globe was January 4, 1996.  I was watching for meteors because that is supposed to be a peak day for a meteor shower.  This one was exactly as the first description, except closer.  There was no tail and no flame. It was doing that slipping through the atmosphere, well air.  It wasn&apos;t that far away and again I wasn&apos;t looking up.  I was level with it. It did that zig zag movement,also.  At the time I thought it was just a strange meteor, because I didn&apos;t know better.  Soon afterwards I got online and began my own personal investigation of UFOs.  I soon learned that it wasn&apos;t a meteor. Since the recent sighting, I thought I should report what I&apos;ve seen.  It may coroborate someone else&apos;s sighting.  These separate sightings are not very important by themselves. There were no witnesses to any of these sightings.", "I observed a shiny, transparent disc with multi-colored lights over power plant in Pottstown, Pa.I was observing the night sky from a hill in Berks County, west of Pottstown. Above the Limerick Nuclear Power Plant, I saw a disc shaped object moving slowly and silently from south to north across the sky. The sky was clear. The object appeared to be at approximately 700ft. From my point of view, it appeared about 1/2 inch across, and I was 6 miles from the power plant. I used binoculars and could see the object appeared transparent and glassy around the entire surface, with bright lights, blue, white, red and orange, flashing across the center of the object. I also observed another, tiny white flashing light below and to the north of the object, traveling near it. I observed the disc until it was no longer in my field of vision.", "I was walking across an open park area, when I noticed a strange light in the sky. The light was very bright, and far too big to be a star. I stopped and looked at this light, which seemed to be getting bigger.

The distance and altitude are as follows.  At the horizon ,clear line of sight it rose approx. two inches ,moved forward one inch, rose slightly and rapidly disappeared as though the clouds were moving in front of the shape, reappeared and continued this for approx. five minutes, at which time I lost sight.

When we looked up to the Norhtwest sky we saw 3 bright gold/orangeballs of light, that appeared to be pulsing in brightness.They were in a triangle shape pattern and then would separate and move back together. We looked at them thru the binocculars and no shape could be recognized. One appeared to travel higher and to the north slowly , until we were unable to see it anymore.At the same time another bright light(ball ) was accending towards the other two..One of the two was also appearing to go higher and northward. The accending light ball was traveling rapidly , followed close by other. Whe they arrived at the position of the other one they stopped and waited until all had reached that level and did some formations, always returning to the triangular pattern.We never saw more than three at anyone time..we couted a total of 8 thru the 1/2 hr. we watched them. there was no noise and once they reach a certain level the movements were planned. we live on the Oregon coast and they appeared to come from the ocean (as far as direction goes..not from the land) It appeared they came from the area beyond the ocean , formed a group and slowly proceeded inland to the north.", "Circular UFO sited in the wymeswold area between Nottingham and Leicester.UK.on the A606.16.8.00/3.30amI was driving over to Leicester from Nottingham,at about 3.30am.on the 16th.August.2000 on the A606 from Nottingham,when appoaching the turn off to Wymeswold I saw a huge circular thing in the sky,hovering over the fields my passenger and I watched this thing,which had red,green and white lights on it for sometimes possibly in the region of 15 mins.there was no noise coming from it.I t was a clear moonlit night with no clouds about we were astounded at this sight,and because my passenger was afraid I was unable to stop for a closer look.This object was a clear as a bell.

As I looked SE I noticed a cylindrical shape hovering in the sky. I was looking between two trees approx. 20 ft apart. The object was grey or brown in color and would shimmer or reflect bright light on the top. I seemed to be appoximately 1 - 2 miles away. I couldn&apos;t really judge the distance due to the fact that I did not know what I could compare it to to judge the size, then the distance. It hovered, but not completely still. It seemed to move up and then to one side or another; then down and to the other side - an almost &quot;square&quot; pattern. It then moved in an easterly direction. I had to move to my right to keep an eye on it. It then picked up speed...a lot of speed. It moved very fast to the east, past the tree that was in my line of site, and then almost straight up into the cloud cover. Approximately 30 seconds later, a small jet, (possibly a LearJet?) crossed the sky at approximately the same line as my sight was for the object. My fiance was with me, but when I finally realized what I was looking at, I asked her to look in the same direction, between the two trees. She said she could not see what I was pointing at.

A married couple in their 50&apos;s who are neighbors of mine were sitting on their front porch on Friday 7/14 and reported a strange phenomenon at a distance of about two city blocks, looking west toward the Tooele Army Depot.  Please keep in mind that these people are not very articulate and described what they saw in very simple terms (their description in quotes).  A &quot;beam of light&quot;, possibly six to eight ft. in width, suddenly descended to the ground from an unknown source.  They indicated no source but described the light as similar to that of a &quot;police helicopter shining its spotlight&quot;.  There was no sound.  The light stayed trained on the same spot for perhaps less than a minute and then seemed to &quot;disintegrate&quot; in an upward direction during which there were &quot;sparkles&quot; (similar to something from &quot;Star Trek&quot;), followed by &quot;smoke&quot;.  The phenonenon then disappeared.  The couple shared their experience with several people and two other parties: a teenage girl, her parents and brother approximately a half mile from this location and another married couple doing some late night fishing near Utah Lake, about an hour and a half south of Tooele, reported startlingly similar phenomenon.  The neighbors also reported hearing a similar experience from a woman in Modesto CA on talk radio a few days later. This was the day/night of the government&apos;s unsuccessful test of the space-based defense system, which I believe took place in California.  There may or most likely may not be a correlation. The area in question borders a new housing subdivision, is dark except for a few street lights newly installed in the subdivision, and is bordered to the west by the Tooele Army Depot where chemical/biological munitions are stored in dozens of concrete bunkers.

It was Friday or Saturday, August 11 or 12.  Around 10:00 p.m. I went outside and stood in our driveway and watched the sky for Perseid meteors.  Unfortunately, the moon was shining in the south sky and then a few puffy clouds came in from the north.  However, I was still able to see a few faint meteors and quite a few satellites pass overhead between the patches of clouds.  It was nearly 11:00 pm and I was about to give up and go inside.  Some clouds started to cover the moon and it got a little darker, so thinking that my chances of seeing some meteors would be better, I decided to wait a little longer.  I looked up in the western sky (the big dipper was a little to the right) and saw something move so fast, I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me.  I was more or less facing west and looking up to about 60 to 70 degrees above the horizon.  This thing zipped into my line of sight in a straight line from the right (north) to almost directly overhead.  It made an immediate 90-degree change in direction, no delay at all; like a billiard ball bouncing off the side of a pool-table, and then zipped to the east and disappeared in the clouds.  The sighting lasted only 2 seconds!  It was oval shaped and flat; not shiny, and dark gray. There were no lights or sound.  It was nearly the same color as the dark gray clouds against the black sky.  I think it was above the clouds.  And it was huge.  It was the size of my thumbnail held at arm&apos;s length!

I first saw the streak appear out of no where, I also noticed a very bright ball extending from this streak on the beginning of the right side of the streak. Needless to say I was hypnotized by this event. Just as it was going to disappear, I called out to my friend who was in the house to come and see. She saw it too and I thought that this was the end of it. Then all of a sudden another streak appeared looking exaxtly like the first one. I said to my friend to get the camera and she did. We took the pictures right before this second sighting disappeared too. I was hopeing that we caught it on film. Got back the pictures the other day, and low and behold there it was.

And it was moving by flipping over on itself - like a coin would move if flipped into the air.  We also noticed that as it flipped, the sun&apos;s beams would hit the edge of the object, which produced a bright golden gleam from the edges of this object. We could not believe what we were seeing.  I, myself, had never seen an object like it in my life before.  To this day I still have not got a clue as to what it was.  The sighting lasted about 6 minutes.  It moved toward the cathedral, went behind the cathedral and appeared again in front of the cathedral.  It moved slowly - flipping over on itself as it moved - toward the sun before we lost it in the sun&apos;s glare. This sighting has haunted me ever since.  I have checked, since, on any photos, in magazines, books about the type of object that I had witnessed in 1997.  All to no avail.  Not one of them even comes close to what we spotted then.  I am forwarding on this report in the hope that you can shed some light on this and put me out of my misery as to what you think it was that we spotted then.  Thanks for your attention of this.", "Webcam shot of UFO in Austria.In two weeks I will be going on holiday in Austria Koenigsleiten. That is the reason that I have been watching webcams in the area to check the weather. Today, when I opened the webcam I saw a silvery round object. I do not know what it is.

Blue color.Just past noon on July 31, 00 I saw an object that was shaped like a short torpedo or football shaped object flying South horizontally at a very high rate of speed. I was travelling east on South 260th which connects Highway 99 with Military Road South. I viewed this blue object as I came around the swerve in the road and looking straight at the Interstate 5 overpass. At first I thought this might be a remote airplane or toy of some type but dismissed it immediately due to the surrounding area being hilly. with tree&apos;s and brush. I knew almost immediately that I was witnessing something very special. This object if a toy would have to be self navigatable. It was about 3 1/2 feet long and the width was about 1 1/2 feet. I do not know how high the Interrstate 5 overpass is but I  think about 45-50 feet high. This object  was just below the concrete overpass.", "My wife just happend to look up from watching T.V. and was engaged by the vividness of the colours.Red and green alternating with intermittent amber flashes, hovering to the north of Fritchley, Derbyshire, U.K. Still on-going so no time scale as yet. Tried to look at the object through binochulars, but could not achieve a sharp image, possible mist or haze surrounding which could be obscuring sighting. My best guess would be at about 50 miles from here due north. Possible aircraft apart from the fact that it is so still in the sky and is being so for so long. The sky is clear of any cloud/mist.", "a large round hot pink balloon object with golden rays of light shooting out under it.i came out on my back porch which faces west and happened to look up and saw a hot pink balloon shape object.  I grabed my binocculars and looked only to see a big round object that was shooting out rays of golden light at the bottom in morse code style.  I started to go get my video camera and had a strong feeling not to at that moment the craft moved up a little higher real fast.  The sky was clear temp, 78 in the shade wind calm and high altitude not to far away from the sun was the craft. I observed it for about 3 minutes or more.  It would stop hover, move up when i directed my thoughts toward it.  Finally it gave a steady pulsating of light from the bottom and went stright up and blanked out completly. Just before it disappered the rays of light went from morse code style to a fast steady pulsating.  It was overhead in our town.", "I saw a silent unlit  grey banana shaped ufoI was on the roof of a five storey - old building - in the heart of the City  of London financial centre in my capacity as a Security Officer carrying out checks when, as is my habit, I scanned the sky expecting to see the odd aircraft as usual but hoping for something more interesting- as I had one previous sighting Of a ufo many years before in another area of UK-; To my surprise I immediately spotted a slow moving object shaped like a bulls horns but basically cylindrical with the points rounded off and flying with the points forward, though I was viewing it from the side. The craft was above me and moving from my right to my left and away from me at an angle. It was grey in colour and although the sky was a leaden grey and so were all the buildings around owing to their windows reflecting the sky and each other to a large extent,it was still clearly visible to me. There was little or no wind. It looked a frail structure to me and reminded me of an old air ship type structure though this could obviously be a subjective interpretation and totally incorrect. It was entirely unlit and in spite of it being a quiet night there was no sound that I could hear. Just as I thought it would fly on out of sight it stopped dead and without any movement either forward , backward, up or down, it began to rotate slowly around within its own length to finally face back the way it had come - a 180 degree turn as if on a mechanically fixed position turn table in the sky! It then immediately began to retrace its flight back along what seemed to me the exact path it had just taken- unlike an aircraft which obviously would have to bank and fly in a wide circle in order to maintain lift and stay airborne when turning back during flight. An inflatable air ship would not have performed such a mechanically precise manouvre. Only a helicopter could get near to this performance and a helicopter aint this shape and dont fly at night without lights.... To continue - again it surprised me by stopping dead and slowly turning left ! through 45 to 90 degrees and heading off at the same fixed speed behind the Natwest Tower. I did not see it again but it left me in no doubt that I had just witnessed something quite extraordinary. I had the distinct impression that it was robotic in nature and was performing to some preset co-ordinates. No humanoid would want to fly like that as it would not be much fun apart from any other consideration. But a change of plan seemed to occur as its return path seemed to be a waste of time and very laborious. It initially flew above the tallest structure in the City- The Natwest Tower- and having turned back finally angled off behind it; which some person may be able to determine its size from perhaps? I seem to dimly recall a similar report in the English paper The Sun which I think reported &apos; A flying banana &apos;in its usual sensationalist way.", "4-5 bright flashes of blue light.

I let the dog out and I looked up towards the moon which was mostly covered with clouds.  I saw some blue flashes.  I was still partially asleep so I rubbed my eyes so I could focus.  Once I got my eyes clear I saw several flashes of blue light. I rubbed my eyes again because I was blinking during the event.  I looked again towards the moon and saw two last flashes.  At this point my eyes were &quot;wide open&quot; and clear.  The flashes were circles that when flashed turned small and disappeared.  The total time was maybe 1/3 to 1/4 sec.  They appeared to look like an arc when using a electric welder.  If you can imagin seeing a welder strike the first arc to begin his weld.  This was also the colour.  A very beautiful blue flash that disappered as quick as it lit. I thought it might have been a cloud moving across a star.  But I realized that I have to much experience to believe this.  I didn&apos;t have my Celestron software loaded, but took the time to do so.  I noticed that there were two stars near the moon.  Both having a mag of less than 1.  Jupiter was also just above the moon.  But the flashes were not that far away.  They were between the moon and earth. The moon was at RA/Dec = 4h 31m 29s / 17d 31m 3sN.  I was looking east.

Blinky then ascended straight up out of sight. The following evening, he returned at approximately the same time. Blinky first appears to look like a star, and as descends he gets brighter, hovers for a few seconds, then ascends almost straight up and dims out. On some occasions, 3 times over the last 2 weeks, Blinky hovers over what appears to be a cell phone tower in the western sky. Then slowly leaves over Lookout Mountain, to the west. On 8-18-00, after Blinky made his appearance, we had a very strange lightening storm. No rain, no wind, no thunder, just constant flashes over about an hour, coming from one small cloud in the southern sky. This included ball lightening. Looked like a fireworks show coming from this one small cloud that remained motionless. We nicknamed him &quot;Blinky&quot; before we found out he already has the nickname &quot;Bubba&quot;. He is real regular, always on time, and does pretty much the same maneuvers. He looks just like the videos of Bubba that are on SkyNet.

I was sitting watching TV when I suddenly noticed a bright light in the sky  that oscillated back and forth. It was way up there (30,000 feet?) and very luminous like a star, but it moved noticeably left and right while the other stars stayed put. When I put my scope (8 inch) on it, it became clear that this object was something strange. It consisted of orange globes of light that formed lines between themselves and connected themselves to each other by these lights.  The lines of light  moved around erratically as the globes themselves changed colors. The object was slowly moving and changing shape over and over again as it just moved around up there in the sky.  At one point it definitely looked like a saucer, with a puslating light underneath and a series of colored lights running acorss its middle. At another point it looked like the bottom of a guitar with yellow, glowing lines running acrosss its bottom. The whole experience left me feelig extremely worried: it literally seemed out of this world to me, that is, like nothing I have ever seen before and like nothing that I currently have the resources to understand.

Since I live in Little Rock, the city lights block out most of the stars. Anyway, Me and my brother were watching the stars when we see an object, more like a star, traveling across the sky. I know it wasn&apos;t a meteor, because I commonly watch for those. I also knew it wasn&apos;t a satelitte, because they havesome sort of blinking to them. It looked like a star going across the sky. I kept my eye on it until it went behind a tree. I didn&apos;t se it come out the other side, so I thought it was wierd. A few minutes later, I see this BRIGHT light (like 50 stars put together) come back the opposite direction from behind the same tree. I saw it and shined my flash light at it and it became dimmer and dimmer until it was the same &quot;star&quot; I had seen earlier traveling across the sky. I shined my light at it again, and it faded into nothingness. I guess it became as black as the night sky. It wasn&apos;t a helicopter, because there was no noise, or a plane for the same reason.

The fact that it dimmed is characteristic of a satellite as it &quot;flies&quot; into the shadow of the Earth, and is no longer illuminated by sunlight.  There are several very large objects in orbit that have a very bright reflection albedo, e.g. Mir, the Space Shuttle, and the I.S.S..

Although I was quite young, and the event occured over 20 years ago, what I saw is as vivid in my mind as if it occured yesterday.  I have shared this information with family and friends, but not with any &quot;official&quot; agency or group. My family had recently moved into a new home in a development in the suburbs.  The area was still fairly undeveloped, and so without the interference of city lights, the night time sky could often be quite spectacular.  For this reason, I had become quite fond of stargazing.  On one particular evening in the spring of 1979, my mother had left to make a shopping trip.  She promised my brother and me that if we were on our best behavior she would buy us a surprise.  Eagerly anticipating her return, my brother and I knelt on our couch staring out our large picture window while we waited for her. As was my habit at the time, I was gazing up at the sky through our window when I noticed a brightly lit object in the sky, appearing to be at a fairly low altitude, heading in the general direction of our house.  As the object came closer, I noticed that it was roughly triangular in shape, and had a &quot;silvery&quot; appearance.  It looked to be illuminated, that is, it was plain to see and fairly bright in the sky, but didn&apos;t appear to have any &quot;lights&quot; on its exterior surface.  Despite its relatively low altitude (about 1000 feet or so) it made no noise that I could hear.  I say this with some confidence because the object flew almost directly overhead. Almost immediately after the first object passed overhead, I noticed several more heading in the same direction.  Within maybe 15 seconds several objects, all similar in appearance to the one described previously, passed overhead following the same path as the first object.  The objects flew in what was basically a &quot;single file&quot; type flight pattern, with one directly following the other.  I was in awe, not sure of what I was seeing.  I didn&apos;t count the total number, but several passed overhead in approximately a 30 second period.  The objects came as quickly as they went, and my brother and I yelled for my father, who was in the other room.  When we explained what we&apos;d seen, he quickly dismissed it, telling us we&apos;d probably seen reflections of light in the sky or something else.  However, I remember the sky being clear that night so I doubt this could have simply been lights reflecting on clouds.  Moreover, as this was a new development, there were very few sources of light that could have caused this.  Furthermore, I know what I saw.  The objects where silver colored, and triangular in shape.

It was also moving in patterns that I have never seen anything, natural or manmade, move in. As for my background, I am an advanced student in junior high.  I am known to have a very down-to-earth imagination, and I do not have hallucinations.  I am not known for making things up to try to draw attention to myself.", "Daylight sighting of domed disk near OttumwaA teacher in the public school system of a small town near Ottumwa was driving to work at 6:45a.m. when an object caught her attention out of the left side driver&apos;s window as she was traveling south. The disk kept pace with her van as she drove . She descibed the object as a glowing disc with the classic little dome on the top it.  She felt the object was as big as her fist at arm&apos;s length.  Based on her judgement, the size of the object was over 100 feet in diameter.  After traveling for ten minutes in a southerly direction, the witness turned west and lost sight of the disk. The witness has found no other person who has reported the sighting.", "Bright white light w/ Halo around...backing away from us....Emitted a BLUE BEAM.. halo turned blue and object backed out of view.Myself, my husband, friend, her daughter (12), and two neighborhood boys all viewed the same object. My husband pointed out what looked like a Bright white light ...like the kind a Helicopter has on the bottom,but MUCH brighter. There was a bright Halo around it. It seemed to be backing away from us....after about a minute or two, a blue beam came from the right hand side towards the ground in a 45 degree angle. The blue beam seemed to stay....as if an emission from the bright light. My husband said he noticed a red-coloration by the blue beam, which I noticed as well (but it was difficult to see). He also mentioned that with the halo effect it appeared 3D. As the light backed away...the halo took on the blue light and got brighter....and seemed to spread out. We all agreed that the Halo was MUCH bigger than a basket ball held at arms length. My friend asked the neighbor boys if they had seen this before (one of them had lived in the neighborhood for 6 years) and he said, &quot;Yes, All the time!&quot;....he went on to add that they were &quot;Space Shuttle launches&quot;.........Which obviously could NOT be.....Over LA? Towards the West (over the ocean)?? Once the halo had &quot;disappated&quot; we thought we could see a light (like a satellite...but a bit brighter and larger) FAR away.......seemed to be the distance of a satellite......but Much higher in the sky. Later on my friend said she saw a report on the LA news that there had been some sort of &quot;missle launch/test&quot; at 9:15 p.m. on that very night.  If this IS the case I would LOVE for someone to let me know....because what WE saw sure didn&apos;t look like what I would think a missle launch would look like.

It was a semi cloudy night, so you could see the moon in between the clouds and for some reason I looked up and I seen an object in the sky.  It was kind of the shape of the flying wing, but it was seethrough, kind of like the predators camoflauge in the movie.  It was flying through the sky at a fast pace and at a low altitude, it made no noise.  My friend and I thought it was kind of weird becuase we had never seen an aircraft like that, considering we were studying to be aircraft mechanic in the Navy and the Marines.  We were studying various aircraft engines and never encounterd an aircraft flying at a low altitude that never made any noise.

The two red lights were in the western sky and far apart from eachother but they were moving in the same direction which was towardds the South east.

The weather conditions at the time of my sighting were superb, with clear skies, only a small amount of visible haze, and high temperatures. I am currently a taxi driver living and working here in Denver. (Although I am currently a taxi driver, I hold a master&apos;s degree in the humanities from the University of Denver and worked for several years in the counseling field.) Having driven the city most of the day (Wednesday June 21), I was somewhat tired and pulled into a Glendale city park located one block west of E. Virginia Ave. and S. Cherry St. I reclined back in the grass to cool myself in the shade of a small tree. (Although I was tired, I certainly was not sleepy and stayed fully awake and alert.) I was facing slightly northeast. At this time (about 4:30 pm) I noticed a gold object in the northeast sky almost directly above my position. The object appeared to be at an extremely high altitude (this was confirmed about ten minutes later when a passenger jet passed below it. I could then determine that the object was more than likely in the high atmosphere, or, a space object of some sort). The object was approximately twice the size of the brightest of night stars and it seemed, at first, to be spherical in nature.  However, occasionally it would seem to &quot;turn&quot; and take on more of an oblong dimension. During this time, the object changed from gold to red and then white, making no eccentric movements whatsoever. Colors seemed to change (sequentially, I believe) in this manner for the duration of my observation. Furthermore, its movement to the east/southeast was gradual and directional, and, although not hurried, still quite noticeable (traversing approximately 20 degrees east/southeast through the sky). I observed its movement for approximately 20 minutes until it literally &quot;disappeared&quot; at about 4:45-4:50 pm. Is your organization aware of any man-made objects (communication satellites, Hubble Telescope, the International Space Station, Mir Station, etc.) which would have occupied that area of sky during this time of the day on Wednesday June 21? My inital thoughts were of comsats, etc., although I have never before witnessed such an object (especially in such a bright sky as the sun was high and just after its zenith). If I may be of any assistance, please do not hesitate to e-mail or phone me at 303((number deleted)) appreciate any information you may have on my above question.

Sitting in a blind along Amite River, a very rural area of only hunting lands and gravel pits for miles. I came to photograph to white-tailed deer in the area on family owned land.  The weather was misty rain, windy, cool with complete very low whitish cloud coverage, moving north.  I could see fairly well up and down river. ( No details, it was dark.)  At about 3:00 am I was reclined low in a blind, facing north. (upriver) I heard a noise coming from  the north. I did not really take notice if it at first until it started gradually getting louder and louder. The sound was just like hellicopter blades . (Not at full flying speed but rather landed and idled down to a speed of one blade pass per second.) And absolutely no other sound. No engines, turbines or anything. Just the sound of the blades. The sound came from the north and went right over me and continued on down stream behind me to the south. The blade noise was so loud it was deafening. It never missed a beat as it came, pass over and continued south. When it seemed directly overhead I pulled my head down even further mostly as a reflex, for it seemed that low. I knew exactly where the noise was (just like a jet passing in clouds) but I could not see anything.  It really scared me and I just froze there waiting. As I sat there about five minutes later I heard the blade noise on the other side of the river heading north above the treetops. When it FINALLY got daylight I hiked back to my truck, (about a mile) and went back to civilazition.

My duties are to document crime scene evidence and statements from defendents.This is actually my second UFO sighting,in June 1982 on a clear sunny day I was walking with my older brother who is also an ameteur  astronomer. We  saw a large cylinder shaped metallic object approximately  150 ft in length hovering about 10,000 ft. The UFO made no sound, it just floated for about 2 minutes, it then became smaller in size and began moving north. We lost sight of it. On 6/3/00 at about 11:30pm my wife returned from having dinner. I stood at the window  looking out at the harbor and the New York skyline. We have a pretty good view from our top floor apartment and could see for miles. The evening was cool and the night sky was clear. I looked up at the big dipper and  saw a small object like a star moving north to south across the big dipper. I thought it could have been a satellite and I wanted my wife to see it, however the object vanished. About 15 minutes later a second object appears inthe same area also moving north to south. At this point I was already on the fire escape with my binoculars. Unfortunately for my wife she was already in the shower. I sat patiently looking up at the night sky for about another 15 minutes, then saw 2 chevron shaped UFO&apos;s circuling next to the dipper.They stopped and faced eachother then continued circuling. I remember thinking  that these had to be birds flying around at night but when I looked at them through my binoculars I saw 2 boomerangs slowly circuling in the sky. I immediately became exited and had to rub my eyes to make sure I was not seeing things. I watched these objects for a few seconds, they were a dull biege color with a soft brownish glow or haze, One of the UFO&apos;S was wider then the other and looked more like a large hand glider while the other object had a much more alien appearance to it. They had no lights  or windows though they appeared to reflect some light. It was difficult to determine s! ize beca use they were dull however when looking at them through my binoculars I could tell that they large objects, probably 100 to 150 ft wide and hovering about 10,000 ft up.I realized that I had to get my wife to see this. I began knocking on the bathroom door pleading for her to come out and see these things. she came out but  they had  already dissappeared. Together we continued watching for about another 15 -20 minutes.Then we observed a third satellite moving in the opposite direction across the dipper. That night I couldn&apos;t sleep thinking about what I saw. The next morning we talked about it and decided that what we saw were either real extraterrestrial crafts coming in from space circuling over the city and then moving back out to space or military satellites trying to track the two chevron UFO&apos;s. What&apos;s also strange is that this incident occurred exactly 18 years after the first one and for the past few weeks prior to the second sighting I&apos;ve been getting this feeling that I was going to see something again. Could we be right about what we saw and have other people had similar feelings prior to seeing a UFO?", "I observed a disk shaped, luminous tan colored UFO with tiny colored lights flashing on its surface moving slowly north by northeast.I am the only observer of this sighting.  I have a bachelor&apos;s degree in Philosophy and am a member of Phi Beta Kappa.  I am employed as a Mental Health Specialist working with abused and traumatized children in a residential program of a pediatric hospital in Brighton, MA. Last Tuesday night, June 20, 20000 at 22:00 hours, I glanced out one of my living room windows, the one facing west, and saw a UFO.  I grabbed a pair of binoculars I had handy in order to observe it more closely.  It was a single craft in a disk or saucer shape.  It appeared to be moving very slowly and at a low altitude in a north by northeast direction.  Because of this movement, I had to switch to a northerly facing window at the front of my living room through which to continue to observe it.  My being on a 3rd floor lifted me above the surrounding houses and gave me an unobstructed view of this object in the sky.  It appeared to glow and was luminous tan in color.  Tiny lights red, green, yellow, white, etc. in color flashed on &amp; off all over the surface of this moving object.  This reminded me of the random flashing of a Christmas tree light array.  The disk of this craft did not appear to be rotating.  It was majestically beautiful in its polychromatic luminousness and surreal slow motion in the night sky.  At one point a jet or propeller airplane appeared through my binoculars in the same field of vision, but its white light was far more distant than the UFO and moved much more rapidly.  (Through an east window of my living room I can see Revere Beach, MA and the Atlantic Ocean.  The Logan International Airport is nearby.)  As the craft moved northeastward, it passed over the floodlights of the Wonderland race track north of my home.  Soon thereafter the UFO disappeared out of my view over the horizon.  From the moment I first saw it until this, approximately 15 minutes elapsed.  This craft was not a propeller plane or jet, not a helicopter, not a balloon, but, literally, a UFO.", "An egg shaped object passed in close proximity of my aircraft.(The time listed above is approximate.  An accurate time can be derived from the FAA ATC voice or radar tapes.) I was flying an aircraft on an IFR flight plan at 8000 feet msl.  Due to thunderstorms in the interior of MA, I was unable to fly northboud to my destination and I was tracking the RI/CT coastline to the west trying to get around the weather.  The Sun had already set below the horizon, but the western sky was still very bright orange and ground detail was still easily identifiable. At first I saw what I thought was a bird directly in my flight path, it appeared to be writhing in effort to avoid my plane (this is not an uncommon sight).  Very quickly I determined that the bird (object) was not on a collision course, but it would pass very close to my position.  As it drew closer I could see that it was not a bird, but rather an egg shaped object standing on end.  The top and bottom of the &quot;egg&quot; was not rounded but spiked with three points each.  Against the bright sky it was just a black silouette and possessed no lights.  It appeared to be moving in an eastbound direction and passed very close to and above the right wing of my aircraft. The first officer was looking for a fix on a navigational chart and did not observe the object.  However, I immediately contacted ATC and inquired about any radar targets on his equipment in my vicinity.  The initial response was no, but shortly thereafter he reported a primary target (no transponder or verifiable altitude info) behind me in trail about a mile.  ATC then informed me that object appeared to be stationary and then began to drift slowly to the east. I had no futher contact with the object.  Shortly before I was handed off to another controller (on a separate frequency) I heard the object called as stationary traffic to an airliner.((NUFORC Note:  We have talked to the witness on several occasions, and we find him to be exceptionally credible.

We have not processed the tapes as of the date of this writing, but will do so in the near future.  The Quality Assurance Office at Boston Center, which processed NUFORC&apos;s FOIA request indicates that the audio tape confirms that a pilot reported an anomalous object to the Center handling his flight.

The duration of the event was about 2-3 senconds, but the fireball was brilliantly lit and appeared to be very close, maybe within 10 miles or so.

The fireball had an electric blue core and a yellow outer &quot;shell.&quot; I may have these colors backwards, it happened so fast. The shell was about 1/2 the thickness of the fireball.

Friday (July 7, 2000), around 9:30 p.m., my brother , who lives in Covina, CA, was taking out trash.  As he walked back towards the house, he noticed something moving towards the house.  within seconds, an object hovered over his house.  He said it was larger than a helicopter, had no visible propellers, etc., was grey, had some blue lights.  No wind nor sound came from the object.  A beam of white light suddenly shone on him.  He was frightened.  He called his wife but she did not hear him so he ran into the house to get her.  By the time they both came outside, the object appeared to be miles high.  All that was visible was a bright blue oval shape cloudy image.  It remained there for a long while then disappeared.  My brother reported this to me this morning.  His wife confirmed that she was a bright blue oval shape against the dark sky and that it remained there for a long while.  She said that my brother was shaking when he came in to get her.  My brother is convinced the object that hovered over his house was a UFO; as may be expected, he is frightened. This afternoon, I contacted my son-in-law, who told me that my daughter had seen a bright white object in the sky on the same evening (in Monrovia, CA, around the same time).  My daughter confirmed this and said the large, bright light did not move and that it emitted a beam.  She and her friend had joked that it was a UFO (Neither believes in UFOs - My son-in-law and I do). My grandson heard my conversation and he said that his friend Andy (who lives in El Monte, CA) had seen a light in the sky on Friday. He had told my grandson and some friends (at a slmber party) about the large flash he and his grandmother had seen and he said that,later, his grandmother him told she had heard it was a missle exploding.   I contacted Andy, who said his grandma (aa very religious person and non-UFO believer) had seen it.  I spoke with her and she confirmed seeing a large white light, surrounded by bluish cloud/mist on the same night at the same time.  She said at first she thought it might be a religious experience (so had my brother) but then noted that this light just remained there and then there was a large white flash.  She said that it was reported on tv that something had gone wrong with a missle and it had been exploded. All of the above was related to me at different times by different individuals who had not been in contact with each other.  I can testify to the honesty of the individuals who saw the object/light.

I watched the glowing objects which were about 8 of them just stay in a formation that looked like the big dipper. But then they moved into a diamond formation and then a circle formation, and then a pointed arch similar to a arrowhead. I was quite in disbelief because I was watching a formation of objects in the clouds that looked like stars, and were in a perfect lineup of the other in otherwords they didnt move out of formation. I watched them float thru the clouds and and other objects seemed to turn on at the bottom of the formation. And then in the corner of my eye I caught a object heading over the tops of the downtown buildings at a great speed. I watched it soar just over the buildings and I saw it perfectly. It was chrome,kinda eggshaped, and the size of a small airplane similar to a &quot;Pipercub&quot;. It had no wings,no jet intake or outlet,no sound,no lights, and no windows. I watched it fly over and disappear over the buildings. The original formation seemed to be in a circle formation when it passed over, kinda like they were watching it. Noone else seemed to see I was in shock! And then the original formation seemed to disappear in the clouds. No jets from McChord AFB were flying after the objects, and I still see it so clean in my mind. Just so everyone knows. Iam studying for my private pilots license, and I know what aircraft look like. This wasnt an aircraft. And no Government, or person for now on can tell me UFO&apos;s dont exist! I saw something.((NUFORC Note:  A British Airways 747 can be seen flying to the north over the University District of Seattle almost nightly at between 1815 and 1830 hrs. (PDT).

I was working on my roof this afternoon, looked up and saw what appeared to be a translucent balloon.  While size was impossible to determine (because I could not tell how far away the object was), my best guess was about 6 feet in diameter and about 1500 feet above ground level. I though nothing of it other than the balloon itself looked a little strange (a little TOO translucent, and I had never seen anything quite like it before). I went about my work for a few more minutes, looked up again, and was VERY surprised to see the balloon in EXACTLY the same place in the sky...I would find this strange on ANY day, but particularly strange today because the wind was blowing about 20kts out of the west. I again thought &quot;it must be a balloon&quot;, and again went about my work...a few minutes later, I looked up again, and the balloon had moved WEST...that&apos;s INTO to wind. Now my curiousity was piqued. I finished up my work, and planned to go into the house, get binoculars, and take a picture...however I still had no sense of urgency because I felt it HAD to be a balloon. To my AMAZEMENT, by the time I got into the house, I was distracted and FORGOT to go back outside and have another look! So ends my story. I did feel like I was being watched when on the roof...but this could have very well been my own imagination. I&apos;m sorry I did not get pictures. Thanks for the fine service you provide.Follow-up Report:Peter,I have since found out that the object I saw is/was an atmospheric researchballoon.

I began watching the sky overhead at about 10 pm local time. During the next hour and 20 minutes, I saw three meteors streak overhead (two approximately east to west and one south to north) and three satellites cross the sky (two approximately west to east and one south to north). At 11:21 an object in the handle of the Big Dipper (near Alioth) grew in brightness, then winked out. It was not as bright as the object I saw the previous evening, but still brighter than any of the stars around it. It also seemed not to have the bluish colour to it, being more like the meteors I saw earlier. In fact, except that it was stationary in the sky, it mostly resembled a meteor by its colour and in the way it grew in brightness and dimmed suddenly. I continued watching the sky for about another 20 minutes but saw no other activity (not even satellites, meteors or aircraft).", "Aircraft makes 90 degree turnI noticed a strange vapor trail in the sky when I looked out my patio doors on the date in question.  We don&apos;t usually see ANY such trails here but this time there were at least 3.  The one I was confused by was on a path parallel with the other 2 when it suddenly appears to have made a 90 degree turn.  I did NOT whitness the turn or the craft that made it but did photograph the resulting vapor trail, which dissapated shortly after the picture was taken.  If you would like to see this photo (taken with my digital camera) I can email you a copy of the file.  Perhaps you or an expert that you know can tell me how such a manuver can be made.  I have NO explaination for this phenomena.((NUFORC Note:  We have reviewed the image, which was sent to NUFORC electronically.  All we see is what appear to be normal contrails in a blue sky.  One contrail has a bend in it.  We suspect the aircraft passed a navigation way point and executed a turn to its right.  We see nothing in the photograph that suggests UFO activity.

It appeared to be a red dot of light but would flicker and sometimes looked like a pair of dots and sometimes like a triangle of 3 dots very close together. It appeared to be right at the bottom of the clouds as it was overcast. It was slightly to the south of the Phoenix area and eventually headed south.", "Triangular formation (3 light points) sited traveling from north to south on a clear evening - east of Bellingham, WA. .I was sitting outside enjoying the warm evening around a fire, while watching the clear skies and looking at stars.  All of a sudden I realized that a triangular shaped group of stars were moving in what appeared to be a downward.  I later realized instead of it moving from top to bottom, it was actually moving from north to south. I pointed this out to my friends who were outside with me and they were very skeptical at first but realized that this was something quite extrodinary.  One believed it could be the space station or three satellites traveling in the same orbit, but this was dismissed when one of the &quot;stars&quot; moved out of formation and then sped up to regroup with the other two to form the triangle again. This was a very clear evening and we were watching the sky for some time, noticing many meteorites and lots of other sky &quot;traffic&quot;.  However, this was something that really surprised my friends though I have been aware of UFO possibilities since I was a child in Indiana. The three lights were white/pink in color and traveled at a relatively slow rate of speed, yet when one veered off course then sped up to catch the others - my suspicion grew deeper.  These were traveling at a relatively high, but other stars were blocked when the object moved towards them...hence indicating that the object was lower in the sky than I originally thought. As for the backgrounds of the observers - 2 are in their late 30&apos;s and the other is 40 years old.  3 males, all professionals - 1 accountant (web based company), one salesperson with a masters in theater, and myself - computer/administrative support.  All were coherent and alert...((NUFORC Note:  This may be yet another report of what we believe are three satellites flying in precise formation over several weeks&apos; duration.  They were first reported to us during the summer of 1996, and during several times periods since.  We believe that they are satellites launched by the U. S. Navy for surveillance of the Earth&apos;s surface, but we are not certain.  They were first identified by Mr. Terrence Dickinson, reporter for the Toronto Star.

On one side of the street there were lots of pine trees, but I could see through their tops. I live near the airport so I know there is constant air traffic, so I glanced up twice at an aircraft before finally taking a longer look.  The craft was like a triangle shape but each of the three sides were a different length, and the bottom of the craft was covered with blue-white lights, so it must be a UFO. I was looking at it through the trees but couldn&apos;t tell how big it was.  I started running towards a clearing to get a better look and it was like it read my mind.  As I started running all the lights on the craft went out and it was no longer in view.  Everything around was still and quiet.", "Slow moving, horizontally flying object.While driving North on Interstate-5 I saw what looked at first like an airplaine or helicopter flying horizontally at a somewhat slow speed and very low altitude, but when I looked direcly at it I saw what looked more like a meteor flying horizontally no more than 200-300 feet off the ground and much to slow to have been a meteor. I shouted to my brother who was in the front passenger seat of my car to look and he saw the object as well. It appeared to loose altitude then suddenly vanished. The object was visible by me for about 5-8 seconds, but could have been there for longer, since I only noticed it after having passed a tall,dense group of trees.

This light began to move. It had probably been moving, even before it caught my eyes. The sky was clear, with not many stars visible, because it was not very dark yet. This light was moving from south to north, in a fairly slow speed. I never saw any blinking lights, as I would on an airplane. I went in for my binoculars,to see better. I could not get a clear picture of the flying light, just bigger. I went in to log in your Reporting Center, to see if there had been any sightings in our area recently. The most recent reported was on my birthday 4/28. However, I found that close enough in time, if there has been any others reported, or if there is some activity going on in the Pacific Northwest.

On the early morning of 6/17/00 I awoke early and decided to go outside on my open sky back porch and observe the sky since it was a beautiful clear sky.  There was a full moon out so the sky was fairly bright but still quite clear.  I was enjoying the sky seeing several meteors and a few satellites.  At aprox 02:50 am I notices some movement almost directly straight up from my position.  The object or objects were extremely high (I can only guess as high as most satellites).  The thing that was extremely odd was that this object or objects had three distinct equally bright points of light that all moved in formation at exactly the same speed and direction.  The direction of travel was toward the northeast.  The distance between each point of light was about the width of a thumbnail at arms length.  The object formed an equilateral triangle with a single point of light in the front of the object (northeast side).  The color of each point of light was bright white (similiar to a bright satelite).  The object or objects traveled in a straight line of direction at a constant speed.  If it had been only one point of light I would have believed this to be a satelite.  I have never seen a satelite with three points of light.  I am sure this was not a common flying object because it had to be at an extremely high altitude.  The object traveled at about the same speed as most satellites.((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the witness describes three satellites that orbit in formation, and which have been reported to us on numerous occasions.  We suspect that they are the three &quot;N.O.S.S.&quot; satellites that are reported to have been placed in orbit under a U. S. Navy program.

Believe me, I don&apos;t see how anyone could miss it! But I guess it was not meant to be noticed, Even though it was so large. It seemed to cast a feathery blurr when it angled off towards the north. It almost looked like a dark wing, with the cylinder in the middle.

I had just passed the Texaco Station on my left and as I made it through the intersection I could clearly see a craft of some sort at what I would guess would be a distance of about 1/2 mile. From that distance it appeared to maintain it&apos;s altitude and I continued driving toward it not wanting to believe my eyes. As I closed on the craft I realized that although at first it appeared to be approaching from a direct right angle ( from the east to west) it actually crossed the Hwy heading in what appeared to be a southwest direction using the hiway as true north. In reality I was actually beginning to slow my vehicle as I approached the craft. I remembered looking in my rearview mirror to see if any other cars were behind me and witnessing the same. But I only at best remember possibly seeing other headlights ( of other vehicles). My attention was strictly focused on the large craft that was now beginning to cross the hiway at what appeared to be an altitude of about 100-140 feet. It appeared to be disk shaped from the side view but as it passed over the road I could detect a V-design to the rear. At first sighting, what was so obvious were the sequential lights that appeared to be flashing aroung the edge of the the disk. What seemed odd were the almost sci-fi quality to the movement of lights and the colors. Seemed like yellow, green, red. Can&apos;t fully recall exactly. As it passed over the road I could tell by the outline of sequential lights looking from a rear angle that there was a V-design of sorts. By now (the time that the craft passed over the road) I had stopped my vehicle and pulled over on the narrow shoulder of the road and had the window down, with my head out the window in awe of what I was witnessing. I remember briefly looking back again for other vehicles but my attention was quickly returned. As I watched, it continued across the road and over a stretch of tall pines. I don&apos;t remember ever! hearing any sounds like conventional aircraft would be making at that altitude and no more than 300-500 feet away from me. I had a camera in my backpack but I could not reach it so I noticed a driveway about 1/8 mile north of my position whereby I could turn around and retrieve my camera so as it disappeared over the tree tops, I sped up to the driveway and got my camera only to be obscured from view by the tall pines. It obviously did not alter course and I lost sight due to trees. But it passed within 500 feet of a residence in this farmland, tyoe  open setting. The night was clear and so was my mind as I was rested and heading in to work. No drugs, booze. Sober as a judge. The craft I approximate was about 80 to 100 feet across the beam and about the same length wise. This event changed my life. I had always, as most people, been a skeptic regarding UFO sightings. But now I know that what I saw I have never seen before and probably never again. I wish I knew what it was. I remember thinking why would something that big and silent have such highly visible lights. Thinking that a higher intelligence would have some cloaking or camoflauge to it.

What I did see was some little red lights in the sky flying around and doing stuff that a plane can not do, but then I was bladerd!

I looked up and saw this littel red triangle zooming around like and space ship in one of thouse kid&apos;s games. it just flew around the sky like it was scanning the gorund and stuff the two other ones came and they all went upwards and dissopierd into the clouds.

It was a metallic cylinder object, 100 - 150 feet tall, that stayed vertical without any rotation such as would occur if any part was, or acted as, an axis. Was observed through binoculars. It traveled at a constant speed, which was slow enough that when we followed it, we stayed with it easily without breaking the speed limit. We followed it on US Hwy 183 heading north to 2243 E. We then traveled on 2243 E. and pulled off the road. It passed over us. We used binoculars to again observe it. We then commenced east again intending to go to IH 35 and intercept it again. A dark helicopter was observed flying from the south at a high speed and at an altitude of about 500 feet (unknown if involved in incident). A small, low flying Cessna Skyhawk 150 was making signals to possibly a ground crew (not believed involved in incident). A jet fighter using afterburners was heading southwest at possibly 20,000 (unknown if involved). No military base close. We traveled to IH 35 and looked about but found nothing. We traveled west on Hwy 29.

I was driving south on Rt. 70S (now Rt. 270) and had just gone under the Shady Grove Road overpass.  The day was gloomy, almost like a foggy-rainy day but it was not raining; the clouds just seemed to be very low.  As I came out from the underpass, I saw this &quot;big thing&quot; above me.  It had no wings that I could determine and I tried hard to speed up to keep getting a better look.  I probably got up to about 80, but it was no contest.  It was black (I could only see the underside at first), and at arm&apos;s length I would say it was about 6-8 inches in diameter, a real big-un as they say. As it continued south in front of me and drew away, I could see that it had green sequentially flashing lights along the rear (but I could not, of course, see whether these lights went all around the object).  It then slowly changed course toward the East and I lost sight of it because I had to drive.  I think the object was going about 300-400 mph -- it reminded me of the way a C130 had looked the day a friend said, &quot;It isn&apos;t going that slow, it is just that big.&quot;  I let it go out of my mind, but the next morning I heard on the radio that the Air Force had reported that the object seen by a number of people was an experimental plane they were testing.  It did seem to me that something that size would have had a budget that people would be arguing about.  If it was a secret, why were they testing it in broad daylight?  And, most of all, why didn&apos;t it have any wings?

I looked up and saw what appeared to be a multi colored fireball that had a long tail, moving at a high rate of speed, in a northwest to southeast direction.It didnt seem to be too high in the sky. I watched it for a few seconds before a house blocked my view. I quickly moved to the side of the house so I can continue wathing it, thinking if it were a meteor i would see it crash.

Objects were saucer shaped, hovering erratically (like an insect or kite) inclined at roughly a 30 degree angle.  The bottom of each u.f.o. was brightly lit with a white light.  The top or back of each object was adorned with different coloured lights: red dominating the center in a line, and blue at the tips accompanied by shades of yellow and green.  The lights would pulse in a seemingly random order, with the red lights flashing in syncronisation, or one at a time.  At times, an object would assume a smooth regular flight path to commence hovering at a new location.  Ascention and descention were rapid, and at equal velocities.  These objects were visible for approx. 2 hours, and made no audible sound.

I saw a very bright shimmering light that was heading directly toward me.  We live in a landing pattern path for Sea-Tac so I assumed it was a plane coming in for the final approach.  I left the room for a couple of minutes and when I came back  the light was still in the same place and there were colored lights flashing all around its perimeter.  I have never seen a plane do that, or look like that so I got the binoculars for a closer look.  There was a dark object that had a shape similar to an airplane but was rounder in the center, with a big &quot; wing &quot; span.  The colored lights were very bright and seemed to be flashing in a random manner.  It was still in the same place.  At this point I awoke my husband and told him to look.  He did and was as amazed as I was.  It was no plane.  It was no star.  It was a craft of some sort and it was right in front of us!  He watched it for several minutes and had to return to bed for a early rising hour.  I continued to watch with and without the binoculars.  The craft had indeed moved but so slowly you couldn&apos;t detect it.  I had placed its position at the top of a tree that stands below our house when I first saw it.  When my husband went back to bed a little after 11, it had moved slightly upward in a north easterly direction.  By this time I had decided that I was watching a ufo and that I would watch it for as long as it took for it to do something. I drew a rough diagram of the dark shape that I saw, wrote down the colors of the lights and continued the watching until 1:00am. The craft had moved upward at about a 40-45 degree angle in a north easterly direction until the last hour when it seemed to shift its heading to a more southerly direction.  At that time the eave of the roof got in the way so I went to bed. The craft had 9 lights.  One in the center, larger than the other 8.  That light flashed from bright blue to a silvery white.  The lights that would have been on the &quot; wing &quot; tips if it were a plane also flashed the blue and silvery color.  The remainder of the lights flashed a rusty orange, silvery white.  The flashing was random to the eye.  There was a distinct strobing effect every 1/2 second or so that was a pale electric blue.  The strobe was only visible through the binoculars, but was visible from the closest point to the furtherest point. I am snail-mailing my drawing of the shape within the lights for your perusal.

I looked closer and realized that although this object was hovering, it was not like any chopper we usually see daily around here. It was about half the altitude of a normal chopper and it made no noise. It has one very large white light and two smaller ones on each side it. I got the impression of something sloping down to the lights, although I couldn&apos;t see any real form. I grabbed for my binoculars, only to remember that they were in the other room. I looked back out the window and noticed smaller lights directly below the large center one, except these were of various colors; red, blue, yellow and green. I then started to slowly move over the top of the house (from WWN to East). I ran to the kitchen window (about 23 seconds) and saw it from the rear about 2 miles past my house. It was a definite triangle of lights. I tried to count and I think it had 6 bright white lights on each side taper in to a series of colored blinking lights.

When it got about one lane away from an 18 wheeler, it went straight up and we could, at that point, tell it was not a normal plane. We heard no engine. The object then &quot;teased&quot; all the cars on the freeway by flying back and forth across the highway. We know others saw it because the trucks were swerving and slowing down. The object would fly real close to a vehicle then suddenly go the other direction. Because of the agility, we were unable to tell which direction was straight for the vehicle, it would turn vertical then fly up, over, or back. Then do the same thing in a horizontal position. There were head lamps on it that were not on all the time that were so bright, we ruled out the possibility of a remote controlled model airplane. It seemed as though the vehicle was flying directly at something then when it reached a certain distance away, it would go another direction, immediately.

Suspended in the same spot for over 10 minutesWhile out rollerblading last night noticed a large red object suspended in the sky. I was looking South in the night sky.  The object just cleared the tree line and looked to be fairly low in the sky approximately 10 miles away.  The light was a pulsating red light which moved up and down, (in relation to the tops of the trees).  The weather was clear and there was no cloud cover.  I watched the object for about ten minutes, it was just suspended in the Southern sky.  There were no flashing lights and it did not appear to be a plane,a flare, or a helicopter. When I went to get my husband, the object was no longer visible. I do not know if it flew away or if it just moved out of our line of vision.  This is about the third time I have seen this light in the sky during different times of the year. It always is in the same spot and some times it is visible for longer periods of time.((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what it was the witness observed, but the location in the sky where she saw the object is generally where the star, &quot;Arcturus,&quot; is located, I believe.

I lost it for a moment and saw it again about 2 inch away and thought &quot;that moved pretty fast&quot;.It did this three times each one less bright.Then it seemed to stop and turn in a cicle , I thought that maybe I saw it do that because it was so small and so i was disorientated and thougyht I was going to loss it but it did stop and turned around, it justturned the way it came and speed off, much faster than it was moving when it was blinking,towards the moon, almost like the speed you would see a shooting star but i saw it much longer and it was a tad slower. It seemed to be red in color, like when you look at the stars and can kinda see if it is blue or red or white.I didnt lose sight of it untill it went past the moon, i couldnt follow it it was to fast.I know I saw something i am not crazy!planes dont just stoand turn around and leave faster than they came, plus it was to high in the sky looking like the smallest star you can see w/your naked eye.Im scared now.are there really aliens out there i never really worried about it but this was just staight up freaky!thank you for letting me talk about this my boyfriend thinks im seeing things but this was about a 3 1/2 min sighting i couldnt emagine something for that long, im sorry but that is just stupid.let me know what you know(if anything)about this.", "i saw a big boll in the air but after a cople of secunds it transformd it self to five bolls   only one big boll and 4 smale ones and after a wiled they tok off up in the air((NUFORC Note:  Date is uncertain.

After 1 minute, they became dimmer, until we could no longer see them.Saw two objects at 2240 hrs. above approximately 5300 South (Central Salt Lake county).  My friend told me to look up at a satellite.  They obviously were not satellites.  They looked like they were at an extremely high altitude.  They both were strobe lights.  They would blink on, go out for approximately 5-6 seconds, blink on again, go out for 5-6 seconds.  They were very bright.  Eventually the lights eminating grew dimmer, we watched them blink dimly 3-4  times, then they vanished.  I would assume that they were headed straight up.  The sky was clear.  They were way brighter than satellites.", "Today&apos;s technology has nothing on what me and a neighbor wittnessI was walking my talk around 9:30-9:45 when I noticed in the sky what appeared to be a redish fireball with a yellow tail moving eastward and at a angle upward.  The image was moving extermely fast faster than any other plane at the time and then it just dissappeared.  I was just standing there in amazement when a another lady from my neighborhood was walking up and she said &quot; did you see what I just say &quot;  I was so reliefed that someone else wittness my event. This was totally unbelievable.", "I was looking in a telescope when I saw a object in front of a star.I looked away thinking it was a star then I forced myself to look back.The UFO now was moving west with lights around it.

It looked to me like just another star,only it was moving.It moved in a straight line moving towards the east.I know it was&apos;nt an aircraft because I saw no visible strobes on the object.I watched it until it was out of my sight. This was very strange to me because if it were a shooting star, it was moving much too slow and emitting nothing. If this were an aircraft,it was moving very fast and I would have seen some type of strobe or flying lights which I did not.Furthermore,I did observe several commercial aircraft flying that night at approximately 30,000 ft.I could see them coming towards me at a distance and could clearly see the strobes flashing.I even watched them as they passed and could see a visible flashing light until they were out of sight. The objects I observed were flying VERY high above the normal air traffic. I can only estimate them at about 100,000 ft conservatively.If they were in fact commercial aircraft, they were moving at very high speed for that altitude.The second object I saw was in the same flight path as the first,about 10 minutes later. I watched this second object(which also looked like any other star)coming towards me, and when it was directly overhead,it vanished.It just wasn&apos;t there any longer.I looked in the direction it was going for several more minutes and could not see any movement.Shortly after the object vanished,I saw a very brief shooting star or fireball headed in the opposite direction just North of where the object was last seen.Needless to say,I was very curious as to what they might have been,and wondered if one of those stars were watching me watching it.", "Triangular formation of lights (not one object) + additional objectsTwo witnesses were experienced Amateur Astronomers Two events spaced over a 20 minute timeframe. Witnesses were using a Mead ETX 125 and binoculars to ID messier objects for pleasure viewing.   A bright (brighter than any star)  Blue light was observed coming from close to North, first noticed at about 75 degress above horizon (moving south).   We initially assumed it to be a satelitte.  The light quickly varied from bright to VERY bright,  and sumultaneously turned sharply to move in a Easternly direction.  Light diminished dramatically after turn, and light did not move in a straight line but swerved sharply as it traveled in a generally Easternly direction.   We were able to observe with both the binoculars and the Mead, as speed was very slow (very similar to a normal satalitte speed), but the object remained a blue point source under magnification.  One member of the party (the guy with the binoculars), indicated that the object had a less bright companion about 10 degress south (higher in the sky) that shadowed its movments, but the others in the party did not see this object.  Object crossed perhaps 40 degress of sky before disappearing (slowly disappeared).   Most disconcerting was anomolous movement.   Turns were far to tights for any aircraft we were familiar with. 2nd observation occured about 15 minutes later.   Again an object appeared from north, at about the same location.  However, brightness did not seem to vary during sighting.  The object (moderately bright blue light),  was noticed at about 60 degress above horizon moving south (via binoculars.   Object moved to about 75 dgress above northern horizon, met two other objects that were stationery at that spot (we had assumed were stars), then all thre objects moved &quot;as one triangular structure&quot; to the east.  We carefully observed background stars between objects as the triangle moved east (with binoculars and the Mead scope).   The triangular formation was intially isoceles, but the lead object moved slightly north during the easternly flight so that the formation apeared as a right triangle by the time the objetcs faded in the east (there was a little haze in the eastern sky in the direction of Lake Tahoe).  Again speed was very similar to satellite motion.  All three objects were exactly the same brightness (blue points of light).  Total time watching formation move perhaps 4 to 5 minutes.", "Long yellowish cylinder, narrow in the middle, passes steadily and slowly east of DIA, then vanishes after halfing.I was out having a cigarette break at work. Noticing the colors at the beginning of the sunset, I noticed a bright yellow, almost white object coming out of the western sky. Knowing that this was probably the reflection of the sun on an east bound jet, I didn&apos;t give it much thought, as there were several passenger jets heading both east and west bound that I could see also. It was partially cloudy, but no heavy cloud cover, and it was mostly clear out. What began to seem strange to me,was that NONE of the passenger jets that I could see were &quot;reflecting&quot; the sunset, in the same manner. While I watched a little closer, unlike the jets that I could also see, this object did not have any wings visible. All through this time, no wings were seen at all, and the object continued heading east, in a straight line, and a steady, continuous speed. (About the speed of the jets I was seeing on either side, and going in east and westerly directions.) It did seem to be going slightly slower, as some eastbound jets going to DIA, had passed it on either side. At no time was their any variance in the color also. It maintained a bright yellow, almost white &quot;glow&quot;. As it passed over head, I STILL did not see ant wings, no noises above the traffic on I-25, to my west, and it was then that I saw that the middle of the cylinder was narrower than the ends, as if it was 2 cylinders, that had a &quot;docking area&quot; that met in the middle. Again, it never deviated its speed or direction. As it passed over me, going on to the east, I saw that there was a small cloud, that appeared to be in a direct line, with where the object was heading. At no time were there any blinking running lights, as there were on the passing aircraft. When the object went into the cloud, I kept watching to where I thought that it would come out. Any other aircraft that I have watched, would be through that small of a type of a cloud, in 3-5 seconds, max. I saw nothing at all, for over 30 seconds, and when I saw the light again, it appeared to be about half the size, still a bright yellow, and then after about 10-15 more seconds, it disappeared. I never saw any wings. It never deviated in the direction or speed, and after it &quot;halfed itself&quot;, it just disappeared. No &quot;blink out&quot;, no quick rise or fall, it was just not there anymore. I know I saw at least 6 aircraft going in other directions, that might have seen this object also. I lit another cigarette, and ran through what I had seen, and no &quot;logical&quot; explanation came to me. Wen it passed overhead, it seemed to be probably twice the length of a jetliner and probably 1 1/2 -2 times the girth, of an &quot;average airliner. With the clarity and length of my sighting, I felt I should report this in the hopes that others had seen it, and have reported it also.", "hovered and had amazing speedWe were driving to Springbank in a Yellow Dodge 2500 after a day of chopping firewood, we had to go to springbank so (M) could get changed as we were on our way out to (M&apos;s) house the next thing we knew the radio turned off and we must have been going 80Kmh and this object came right next to the passenger door where I was sitting and seemed to hover for what seemed minutes but only seconds, I really dont feel comfortable talking about this to a web page that I have no Idea is even going to be read. I am more than willing to tell whomever wants to know the story but I would like someone to E-mail me and then that way I can tell my story of this odd thing that I saw This has not been mentioned too much but just between a few friends and it is quite interesting and I feel that it&apos;s about time that I came out and told it to someone, so if you do want to hear about this event please E-mail me. thanks", "Formation of 3 lights, followed by fomation of 6 retangular white lights hovering in sky with no noiseAt 9:45 pm while looking out over the west side of Long Lake towards Buck Mountain my mother noticed a retangular white light hovering in the valley between the mountain and the islands across from us.  There was no noise.  The lights came on one at atime from left to right.  They hovered and faded out rather quickly and reappeared.  We called a friend so he could go outside and observe these lights because we knew he would never believe us.  After the lights went out two friends went down to my dock on the lake to continue to watch the sky.  They (the two friends) had seen three lights appear in the sky 45 minutes before these lights appeared but didn&apos;t think they were much of anything.  After a few minutes the three lights appeared again but they had shifted to the south ever so slightly but still hovering above the tree line.  I was rather frightened but I continued to look and then six lights came on sequentially from left to right this time.  Again whitish in a horizontal line and it looked as though those lights were turning, lifting up somewhat and then the lights vanished.  A few minutes later my two friends on the dock spotted a very very bright light over Buck Mountain and they observed this light shooting straight down.  AFter that no more lights were seen.  The next day I talked to two campers that also observed the lights.  I also found out that I had two friends at the South End of the lake see simalar lights that night, but they had also seen the lights on Monday August 7th.  They saw 6 lights and then another row of 6 lights in a V formation after having seen three lights (looking at drawings we saw very similar formation)  They didn&apos;t want to tell anyone because they figured no one would believe them.  A few kids saw lights two days before I did in Minerva and chased the lights with their car but the lights disappeared.  A witness also saw lights on his drive from Indian Lake to Blue Mt. Lake on Thurs, Aug 10th at approx 9:30pm.  So we know we were not the only ones to see the lights. ! We made calls to the Air Force and apparently they were doing manoevuers that night but two of my friends spotted two aircraft much farther north and they spotted the aircraft several minutes after we saw the light formation.  We also speculated Fort Drum because it is to the west of us but upon contacting The Adirondack Daily Enterprise after a story on the lights appeared there this weekend Fort Drum was ruled out.  Are we the chosen ones?  We were rejected and you know what that is okay with me because it scared the pants off me.  Where I condsider myself a cynical non-believer at heart, this definitely altered my mind.Peter,Thank you for getting back to me so quickly.  First of all the area where the lights were spotted were in a remote area of the Adirondack Mountains.  In fact where I was staying at the time there is no electricity on either side of the lake at that point.  There would definitely not have been a blimp there at the time.  In fact the posting from New York State from a location near Watertown on the same day is most likely the same thing that I spotted with my group of friends.  The description is pretty accurate.  As far as having others post for you, I&apos;ll give it a try but most of the folks aren&apos;t into the computer thing.  I&apos;ll have my one friend that was with me at the time submit his version because he started to see a light formation about 45 minutes before the rest of us.  My cousin contacted an air force base southwest of the Adirondacks and they confirmed that they were doing manoevures that night but I feel pretty confident that this was definitely not anything that was related to air craft activities.  The Adirondack Daily Enterprise is doing a story on the sightings and you can reach the reporter if you want to at 518-891-2600, her first name is Victoria (sorry I can&apos;t remember her last name) ((NUFORC Note:  we intentionally leave the newspaper contact information in this report.))  I&apos;m sure she would be interested in talking to you for her story and she can maybe put something in the article about posting submissions.    She has been contacting people around the area because many people have called her because there was a published report in Sat August 12th&apos;s paper.  How would I send a map to you?  If you get a map of New York State, Long Lake is in the center of the Adirondack Park, south of Lake Placid, North of Lake George...  Sightings were also made from Saranac Lake (info from newspaper article)  I also read a posting from a person that works at the prison north of LL in Malone that described the UFO on Monday August 7th, my friends saw it on Aug. 7th too so I have the feeling these sightings are also related.  It&apos;s very interesting, have you ever spotted a UFO, do you have any thoughts on UFO&apos;s?  All I know was that it was extremely creepy and I ran in to grab the children because I was totally afraid.  So yes the area was remote, full of wilderness.  The Adirondack Park is 6 million acres large public/privately owned.  I hope this sparks your interest.  Also I checked and someone in Massachusetts also saw a similar formation (these are all from your website) so we want to know what it was.....Thanks again((name deleted))", "Bright light moving quickly east to west viewed from the boston commonIn the boston common walking away from the public gardens towards the park st station, my girlfriend and I noticed a fast moving light heading east to west in the sky.

We were traveling at 0950 PM CST (2150) driving East on Highway 12 just past the junction on hwy 12 and Hwy. H, just after dark. This is 1/4 mile east of LeGrange WI..I noticed what appeared to be a flashing railroad type crossing light ahead about 300 feet...My wife noticed it too. Then we realized it was MUCH larger than a railroad gate, and that the rose/red/magenta lights were alternating position UP and DOWN rapidly.When the light on the right went up, the one on the left went down and alternated ...I then thought maybe this was a farm tractor with a strange light pattern, but we were traveling 50 miles per hour and we could NOT catch up to it...it appeared to be in the center of the road moving away from us.  Two cars were appraching from the opposite direction and they must have seen it too, because they swerved to avoid it and we had to drive onto the shoulder to keep from being hit by one of the cars. Note: The weirdest thing about this whole event was that, when the lights appeared to approach the oncoming cars, they stopped alternating and BECAME AIRBORNE, lifting off over a treeline to the left...they were headed in a northeast direction.My wife and I were stunned and we remain so. I was in the US Air Force for 20 years and I have NEVER seen ANYTHING like this. My wife said: &quot;Did you see THAT?&quot; when the lights became airborne...I continue to shiver and feel weird about this, as does my wife. I am STUNNED! We have NEVER seem anything like this! We are not kooks. We do not want any attention, but we had to report this to someone, because we are at wit&apos;s end trying to explain this.

We had just heard the Boston Pops play from the Esplanade (a large park area that borders the Charles River on the Boston side) and had seen the fireworks display.  The show ended approximately 23:00.  I was standing with three other friends looking out over the river and noticed that there were two spotlights on the Cambridge side of the river waving across the sky.  One of them stopped moving so I was wondering who was operating them.  Students perhaps?  An old MIT prank?  Anyway, that was what made me look in that direction.  While I was observing this I also noticed all the smoke from the fireworks slowly drifting over the river toward Boston Harbor.  While I was observing the spotlights and smoke, I noticed a spherical shape floating discreetly among the clouds of smoke.  The sphere had no lights, no sound, and when one of the beams of the spotlights hit the object I noticed it was silverish metallic with a raised ridge going around its equator.  I called my friends&apos; attention to what I was seeing and we all began to discuss.  We had time because it was moving rather slowly.  We first thought, &quot;It must be a balloon&quot;.  But, judging by the distance between our location on Beacon Hill and the Sphere&apos;s position in the smoke over the river, the balloon would have been the size of two automobiles.  Also, it&apos;s movement was extremely steady and straight.  It didn&apos;t move up or down or sideways, just straight toward the ocean.  We watched it as it passed over the Museum of Science and then it just disappeared.  I&apos;ve never seen anything like it, and I would find it hard to believe that no one else noticed it, aside from the fact that not too many people watch the smoke after a fireworks display is over....everyone is looking to make their way home instead.  I would love to find out if anyone else saw this.  My friends and I are still puzzled to this day.", "I watched what i thought was a satalite untill it stopped and stared to move eraticly across the skyI was looking up at sky and observed what I thought to be a satalite moving north to south at a slow rate of speed. the object then stoped then moved left 2 inches.At this time I payed a little more attention to it.I went and got my binoculars and looked but at this point it still looked like a star.It then moved in reverse for five inches then stopped again.I got my telescope out (starwatcher)7 in lense x2.5mm and focused in. The object was round 1/16 in dia and was yellow in color. There was a small bright circle in the center with three black dots in the circle.This was followed by a black ring,bright ring,black ring,bright ring and a finale black ring. There was a bright aura around the edge of the object.Every so often the rings would change in to what looked like a spiral pattern. At his point I woke up my seven year old sun to come and take a look.He said it looked like a bullseye in the sky. The object would move around a area about 6 in in diameter then it finaly stopped and stayed stationary and moved with the rest of the stars crossing the sky.I found it interesting how the background sky would pass out of veiw as time went on but this just stayed put until it moved with the rest of the skyscape.I watched it until 02:00 when clouds coverd my view.", "It sped off at a teriffic speed, changing size and color.When I was returning from a local disposal site, upon reaching the top of an overpass, an object caught my eye off to the left. It was hovered at a very low altitude appx. 500 ft. It was angled on it&apos;s side about 30 degrees, it&apos;s shape looked like a HIGH HAT. It sat there for about 2 min. Upon viewing it, it was black in color with a silver perimeter, it had a saucer plate bottom, inside of the plate was black and the perimeter was again silver. On the top hat portion off to the left side midway up, there seems to be a shape of a door, or a square window. The distance was 1 mile or less, it was about forty ft. across, and about 50 ft. in height. It sat in a southwesterly dircetion, when it sped off, it left in the same direction. As it left at a terrfic speed, it changed color to white, and size to a ball. The sky was all blue with few clouds, it left the atmosphere into the ionesphere and beyond within a mere few seconds.

The objects that would head to the north would get more distant and higher in the sky almost as if they were gradually moving away.  As for the acrobatical movea they would preform, when one object woul move they would all do the same action.  These objects as they made a line from the south to north they seemed to all be gradually moving away.  This went on for what in my recolection was about an hour and five minutes, and the most unbelievable part was when it ended the last oblect on the end of the line moved at an alarming rate and almost seemed that the last flew through the others and picked them up.

One nite we awoke to this loud rucuss coming from the barn, you could hear the cows going crazy...making such a loud noise...something quite unnatural . That same nite, i remember this experience in every minute details....I awoke later that night, i cried out to my father to get me a glass of water....he got up and i followed him into the kitchen.As we are walking down the hall I could smell an odd smell; you could smell something like smoke and mildew but with a sweetness to it. Asmell i&apos;ve yet to ever experience again.

I only seemed to remeber this event about ten years ago...nothing traumatic or special happened at that time in my life. i just remembered. After I told my parent about this story, my father thaught i was going insane.....but my mother seemed to beleive me. After wards she took me aside, and admitted to me that she has seen the craft that nite, in the back feild. She remebers seeing it lanf and seeing people come out of the craft.

From my viewpoint these are the only explanations I have come up with. This object looked like it became smaller. The funny thing was that this object was moving more into view.

Noticed what I thought was another satellite treking along in orbit.  Watched it for about 5 seconds or more when it (just a small bright light, no brighter than any other object in orbit) flared a very bright, roundish, white light for one brief second.  After the flare diminished I noticed that the direction it was following had changed by approximately 30 degrees from my perspective with one difference, it was now moving out of orbit as the object had increased it&apos;s speed in that flash and moving at a new constant speed.  As it was moving on the new direction it was progressively going from the small bright light (1 - 2 millimeters across) to a smaller and less bright state until it could no longer be seen.

There were 3 of us standing outside on the deck when my husband pointed to the sky and said, LOOK!  We all looked to the sky and saw a pink/red/white light attached to a very faint boomerang shaped object.  The object was hard to see, but the light was very bight.  The object was traveling at a fair pace, faster than an airplane and way faster than a bird and it seemed very high up in the sky (my thumb could cover the entire object).  It traveled straight west, It was moving quickly so I stepped off the deck and followed the object, then the object took a very pin point turn to the north, travel a few seconds in that direction, then another pin point turn the the east.  I followed the object back the east, the object went behind a tree and we never saw it reappear.  All of the witnesses are very upstanding citizens.  Actually, don&apos;t think I am crazy, but this is probably the 5th or 6th strange siting my husband and I have seen.

This was definately not a plane since it didn&apos;t have the tradional 3 light and no blinking.  It was way higher than the aircrafts since they were still passing trying to make there pass back to the airport to land.  It seemed the planes were not flying out as far as usually since the Red Dot  were out to the east and they were flying way lower than usually.  As we watched the Red DOTs they started to move from were they were stationed for about 5 minutes.  Moving slow in a south direction they seemed to keep the same distance and same speed really slow as they went a little further I would say almost directly East from where I was standing they then stopped and sat there and kept the same exact distance and the one on the right side started blinking in and out and a different rate of speed slowly and then fast and then it would be steady, it started again but there was no pattern to the lights and only the red laser color which they had been the entire time.  As we watched the one on the left hand side which had been a steady light the entire time start to move south then droped below  the other all of a sudden the left Red light started moving very fast as if directly below the other light.  All of a sudden as it kept moving south it shoot out to the right side and was gone I would say with in 3 seconds i was like Dam that was fast. All of a sudden the last light which was alway on the left had side started to fade out and up as if moving out toward space with in seconds they wer both gone.

Anyways, we were at like the first bend turn to get to the screen we were about to watch our movie on, when David says, &quot;dood, there&apos;s something in the sky up there.&quot; At that point everyone else in the car wanted to see what he was talking about so I ducked my head from the back seat so i could look out the front window and what I saw i truly can not justify. Picture if you can a summer day just coming to a head in the evening, the sun was just down, and the sky was a deep, but still lit, baby blue. Above and to the far right of our screen there was (now this was totally a visual experience) this blueish-neon streak in the sky, something I have never seen before and you could tell it was totally foreign to the sky...it was like something from a sci-fi movie, like special effects. it was about 3 inches in length in the sky, and it was such a clear night, it looked close. Now just after this streak there was a dusty trail of smoke starting from the small end of what would look like a stretched tear drop, but of smoke, and directly in the end of it was a bright white light, that seemed straining, searching almost through that fog/smoke, kinda like a smake crawls, not exactly in a straight line. Now I couldn&apos;t make out any shape of what the &quot;light-emitting thing&quot; might have even looked like, because it was surrounded almost entirely by that damn smoke. My brother ken said he saw lights around the light, but I couldn&apos;t say because I didn&apos;t concentrate on the light..i was too busy trying to make some logical excuse for the neon blue streak in our sky.About an hour later, into out movie, i was still checking out the window to watch that streak and see if it had dissapeared, b! ut it di dn&apos;t, it took a long time. Then i noticed off to the right sky there were about 7 planes, all in in close formation, with their little flashing lights, all coming what seemed towards us. I&apos;ve never seen that many planes flying that close, such a small amount of sky, i don&apos;t know if they had anything to do with what we saw, but i have a feeling they did. All we could all say was, &quot;what the hell is that??&quot; It was shocking, because i&apos;ve never seen anything like that before, and it kind of brought a sense of reality crashing in rather suddenly. Anyways, i&apos;m not sure how long it may have been there before we originally noticed it, but I don&apos;t think verly long. And after I first spotted it after david pointed it out, if i had to give a time that it was in the sky, i&apos;d say maybe a quick 6-8 seconds...maybe less. It was going in a more or less straight course, then like I said maybe 6 or 8 or seconds into it, this thing just vanished into thin air. The smoke was still there, and so was the blue streak. The smoke evaporated within a few minutes, but the strange blue streak in the sky, stayed for at least an hour. And we were not the only ones to see this thing, there were people everywhere; we were in a drive-in movie lot! people were standing outside their cars pointing in the sky, talking on their cell phones. it was a very strange thing, and I&apos;ve never seen anything like that around here, or even heard of anything like that. That&apos;s why I know it wasn&apos;t right, something was definitely there, and many people were witness to it. I haven&apos;t heard any local news yet, or read any articles, but it did just happen yesterday, i checked online at the modesto bee, (a local paper) but there is nothing, and there is no Cere&apos;s paper online. so i don&apos;t know if anyone reported this yet, but I can garauntee someone will besides me. What I saw was in my mind alien; very unidentified and rather alarming. I haven&apos;t told anyone about it except my mom, this was my best idea to try to spread the news about what I saw, and to let othe! rs out t here know who might be skeptics, so was i, but this was as real as it gets. and i to tell you the truth I wish i hadn&apos;t seen it, i wish I could still believe that things like this are only fantasy, or made up stories, but I can&apos;t. I saw it and so did a lot of other people.", "Bright silver cylinder approx. 3000 ft altitude; silent; hovering motionlessly; clear blue sky, sun at my back; no markings, engine, wings, tail, nor windows; remained in view as I passed nearly under it and drove west", "FOR THE SECOND NIGHT IN A ROW THE SAME OBJECT RETURNED OUT OF THE WEST AGAIN MOVING TO THE SOUTH EAST.FROM MY VANTAGE POINT IT STOPPED JUST TO THE SOUTH OF MY POSITION, AND STAYED THERE STOPPED IN MID AIR AT ABOUT 16,000FT.

The next night and the next my kid went out and he saw the same objects doing about the same thing. We have not gone out to watch for them this year.

It was directly south of me when I first saw it.  I called for my daughter to bring binoculars.  By then the object was in the east.  Viewed through binoculars the object did not display the normal light configuration of an airplane. There were no red or green or flashing white lights. The object was at an estimated altitude of 20,000 feet and traveled at a speed comparable to that of a Lear Jet traveling at that altitude.  It made no manuvers, and did not make ANY sound. The object passed south and east of my location (2 miles North of Monticello) It appeared to pass directly over the town and flew northeast on a course that would have carried it near the town of Quitman, Georgia.  As it passed though an area of light cloud it gave off the kind of aura that is usually seen when car headlights move through fog.

This report is not very timely, but may corrobarate some other sighting.", "Chevon Shaped Craft in Southeast MissouriAT aprox. 23:30 hours, I was driving down Highway 60 headed west when I noticed a light out my driver side window. I casually categorized it as an airplane until I noticed another one. Then I studied the sky and realized that there were at least 5 &quot;aircraft&quot; in the sky. 4 of them were strobes that either were very small or very high altitude (was hard to determine in a moving vehicle.) The other one was fairly close and moving slowly to the east it seemed. I turned left (south) onto highway 114 and was still watching the objects. The strobes were playing tag with each other, they flittered about the sky in very very fast, short movements. The lower one seemed to turn back to the west some (heading in my general direction.) As I was going to pull over I got a good look at the craft as it rotated (not turned, rotated in place) towards me. It had three white lights , each at a corner of the object. It was chevron shaped and tubular. The best way I can describe it was that it looked like two toilet paper rolls merged together at a 45&apos; angle but the &quot;front&quot; was rounded as well. It appeared to be in the vicinity of 1000&apos; feet off the ground at a maximum. Seeing how low it was due to it&apos;s relationship to trees in my field of view, I suddenly got a vary bad feeling about stopping.I found this odd in retrospect as I have been a long time believer and have had sightings previously. Normally I would think of myself as being the being the first person to jump out and way to it. At this point I sped up and only occasionally looked back at it. When I arrived to my in-laws house in Essex Mo, I immediatley got out and looked up in the sky where the object had been, expecting to not see anything , but the object (or one like it) was slowly gliding to the northeast. I ran inside to get my wife and she returned outside with me to watch the object fly off out of sight. At that point all that could be determined was that it was a slow, rather low flying object that did not make any noise and did not display lighting consistent with FAA regulations (i.e. no red or blue lights, only white.)   My wife and I noticed some more of the &quot;strobes&quot; playing around in the sky very briefly as well. I am not a crakpot and I am not an illiterate &quot;backwoods&quot; person.

Just outside of Rochelle I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. I looked to the right through my windshield.   Off in the distance over the cornfields was a bright orange glowing ball floating down.  It floated down for a second and then seemed to change shape from a glowing ball into a cone.  However, the glow was not visible on the cone shaped part of the object.  The object grew smaller until it disappeared.   It&apos;s height in relation to a tower off in the distance made it seem twice it&apos;s height.  I could not judge it&apos;s distance from me.  What I believe I was seeing was not the object changing shape, but the object slipping into a V-Shaped opening in the sky, which made it appear to be changing shape as it entered it...and eventually disappeared into.  This whole sighting happened in about 3-4 seconds.", "Three bright lights in th form of a triangle,, when zoomed in on they appear to be round shapes with a hole in the middle", "daytime white &#x5C;grey shaded irregular object. &quot;floating &quot; then gone approx. 30 -60 feet in size.While visiting friends in the northwest part of town my wife and her friends husband observed a white and grey object floating in the clear sky during the day (temperature was approx 100 degrees). Mention was made of it and I went out and still found it in the sky but located approximately 3 feet (held at arms length) north of original position which was just next to the moon in the eastern sky. My view was looking north with Mt. Lemmon in the background (a 9,000 ft mt.)and up at about a 45 degree angle in the sky. Object was moving further away in height and distance from my vantage point. Binoculars revealed an odd shaped object much like a balloon but not round at all. Rough estimates of the shape are difficult but it was not aerodynamic in nature. My thoughts were like a balloon that they attach to car lots of a gorilla etc. Maybe this floated away. The only problem with this theory is that it was not a recognizable shape except for a rectangular portion at one end and 2 pieces sticking out from it to another irregular mass. Object made no noise, shape changed as you watched and was estimated at between 2000-3000 feet high and rising somewhat. Object moved slowly and had strange grey shadowing on white, no other color (such as advertising balloons would have). Upon looking at object for some 10 min. I went inside and returned to have another look about 2 min. later. Object had disappeared. This is what caused me to report the incident. Being in the aviation field and familiar with aircraft types I would have to say it possibly was a balloon except that through the use of logic and common understanding of gravity I cannot see how an object of approx. 30-60 feet in size(estimated) could have &quot;deflated&quot; and fallen out of the sky in such a short time period .I believe the object could have been a balloon but it gave chills to view from binoculars as it was a very odd shape and in the sunlight you could see a grey mist around the object as you viewed it,perhaps an occular trick due to binocular magnific! ation an d the eye straining to understand what was being viewed.

When we got out on the grass in the front yard, I looked up at the moon, which was a cresant. I guess about that same time I saw the red light, one of my buddies did too. We both acknowledged that it was there, then my other friend saw it. It was slightly below and left of the moon. At first, I thought it was a star, but it was alittle too large to be one and it was red. Then friend #1 said it might be Venus, and I said it might be Mars. A few seconds later, it just disappeared. I didn&apos;t notice it dim at all, it&apos;s like the light just turned off.

We live on a conservation area and our home sits on a hill. With very few city lights to be seen, the sky is pretty dark out here. Off in the northwest sky we watched in amazement as 4 lights &quot;danced&quot; around. It reminded me of four people holding four flashlights and making them swirl and dance upon the ceiling...each ball of light making a random swirling path across the dark sky...sometimes coming together for a &quot;spin&quot; then going off again to their own dances. We watched this incredible sight for about 10 minutes or so. After a short while, the 4 balls of light converged and glowed brighter. Suddenly a shaft a light dropped from the mass to the ground and stayed that way until the light of the converged 4 &quot;melted&quot; away. I couldn&apos;t tell if the shaft stayed in the sky or the image of the bright light stayed in my vision (light a flash from a camera sometime does). I caled all over to the small police headquarters out here and am happy to say that no one treated me like a crackpot! No one else however, called in such an occurance. The Adler Planetarium in Chicago told me it was from the recent solar flare and the northern lights. Is it? It seemed somehow mechanical to us ..kind of like butterflies fluttering around only to meet and sepparate to flutter around some more. Now I can understand if it was the Northern lights..what what the heck was the shaft of light coming down from the glowing mass?? Any ideas out there?((NUFORC Note:  We presume that the witness possibly describes an advertising light, the type that has four projectors, all of which rotate around the same axis.  Incredibly, these lights are reported to us quite frequently, despite how common they appear to us to be.

I was facing east.There was a tall building to my right which prevented me from seeing it until the 12 o clock position. What I saw first was a burst of light, yellow/orange in front and red in rear blending together in the middle. The object seemed to be much higher than an airplane. I thought it was a star to star to start with. The object began moving in a zig-zag pattern from south to north and at every change of direction the same burst of light would appear. what was so amazing was the speed at which it traveled, it seemed to almost jump from point to point. the object disappeared at about the 9 o clock position.

HE HAD TOLD ME HE HASN&apos;T HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT THE! SE LIGHT S IN THE SKY. NOTHING HAS BEEN REPORTED. SO I THEN CALLED THE TV NEWS STATION CHANNEL 10 IN PHOENIX AZ. THE REPORTER THAT I TALKED WITH HAD TOLD ME THAT THEY HAVE BEEN RECEIVING SWARMS OF CALLS ABOUT THESE RED LIGHTS OVER GILBERT ARIZONA. THE REPORT ALSO TOLD ME THAT HE HAD CALLED THE MESA ARIZONA POLICE DEPARTMENT. THEY TOLD THE REPORTER THAT THOSE LIGHTS ARE A MILITARY EXERCISE USING FALCON HELICOPTERS.

This object was about the size of a BB held a foot from your face. The craft looked as if it were white hot. It was traveling at a great speed. As it neared the completion of my viewing, it passed a comm. airliner, and then flew straight into a severe storm cloud. These cloud according to the local radar were 45-50 thousand tops. The craft did not fly below or above them. It flew into this system, that the airliner was flying around. I am 43 years old, never seen a ufo until now.

Photograph to follow.In approximately  1960, while the writer was in Puerto Rico, his friend, ((name deleted)), of Wenonah, New Jersey, was by his account near a New Jersey dump, where he saw a cagar shaped flying saucer, hovering in the air near the ground.  A door opened in the saucer, hovering in the air near the ground.  A door opened in the saucer and Joe, a railroad stationhouse worker, heard banging from inside the saucer, like a banging on radiator pipes,  The some pieces of metal were thrown out of the saucer and landed in &#x5C; the sand.  Whe the saucer flew away, Joe found the metal pieces were still hot.  And, the piece he later gave to the writer has sand grain marks in it, and while the outside is generally smooth, the inside is crystalline, as if the outside had started to melt. Until the writer wrote this, eh did not realize the discreepancy between the outsdie and the inside appearance of the metal. The piece has a smoothly curved, machined or molded surface on one side.  The piece which the writer has is now in safekeeping has a smooth, curved portion.  It weighs about  2.75 ounces and had broken down three small pieces from it, as follows: 1.  Dissolved in concentrated nitric acid.  It did not dissolve, but turned, over a week, into a white powder. 2.  Gave to Prof. ((deleted))  University.

EST. I had an urge to stop, and looked out my side window. The sky was clear, starry, the moon had likely already set by this time, on the opposite horizon. I saw a spherical object at my 10 o&apos;clock, about 30 degrees above the horizon, in the northwest. It was bright and luminous, but not bright enough to cause me to squint. The quality of the light reminded me of florescent, dull white with a slight bluish tinge. The light did not pulsate, or show any other variation. The most interesting thing was the size of the light. It had the apparent size of a penny at arms length, much to big to be aircraft or landing lights. The brightness was even across the diameter, and the edge was sharp, with no halo effect, against the background of the clear night sky. It gave the impression of a self luminous, spherical object, not a bright light projected from a small souce. The object hovered; completely stationary for a full five seconds, at least. There were enough clear stars to judge its relative movement, or lack there of. I live fairly close to a municipal airport, and am very familiar with aircraft lights and the effect of a head on landing light. This was not an ordinary aircraft, and the size of the light made i unusual nature very clear. The object suddenly blinked out, as if a light had been extinguished, and a split second later re-appeared north of its original position, slightly higher in the sky.  I would estimate its apparent  movement relative to the starfield was a fists distance at arms length. The interesting thing was that when it reappeared, in addition to the visual distance in movement, the object appeared to be only one-third to one-quarter the diameter it appeared originally. The light still had a wider visual diameter than an ordinary aircraft light, and maintained its almost florescent quality. Roughly a second after  it reappeared, it started moving in a northerly direction, covering  about four fists width in about three seconds. As it moved relative to the starfield northward, it also very quickly diminished in size and brightness, until it totally disappeared from view. Just before vanishing, the light was much smaller than the way a typical star appears in your vision, and the quality of the light was more a dim reddish orange. Just as unusual as the large diameter of the light was at the beginning of the sighting, the tiny pin prick of light before it disappeared  was much smaller than the lights from even high altitude airliners. As it diminished in size, it very quickly reached such a small size that it would not have been noticed at all by anyone not following the trajectory of the object. It gave the clear impression of an object shooting skyward at incredible speed, but not straight up. More like an 80 to 85 degree climb. There was no discernible form to the object, but its perfect circular appearance from my viewing angle seems to support a spherical rather than disk shape. There is no way to be certain of its actual size, but I had the very strong impression that its distance from me at the beginning of the sighting a quarter mile to half mile, or less, and its altitude somewhere between 800 and 1500 feet.  If so, based on the rate of decrease in the visual size of the light as it climbed, I would guess that it climbed a NUMBER of miles in altitude in seconds. It was the perceived speed and rate of climb that cemented the impression that this object was extremely extraordinary in nature.", "A cylinder object with red and turquoise colors that had been moving back and forth, then stationary.It was a clear, early morning, with stars out. My friend has already been watching it for about a hour before I got to his house to go fishing.  He told me he had watched it zip back and forth (east to west), quite a bit, but that it had been stationary for around thirty minutes before I got there.  Just looking up in the sky at it, it looked like two stars, one on top of the other.  When I looked through his binoculars, I was really surprised!! I had never seen anything like it!  It was a bright red and turquoise! (bluegreen)  It was kind of flickering the colors, and I didn&apos;t know if it was me moving the binoculars a little or if it was kind of jiddering a little.  I watched it a few minutes then brought down the binoculars.  I could still see a flash of red and then turquoise.  It was only one object and my friend said it was shaped like a bracelet.  He could observe it closer when he watched it zipping back and forth with the binoculars.  We were &quot;in town&quot;, but the object was at a 45% angle to the east (kind of south too), which would have placed it over wooded areas.  There&apos;s a river east of us about 20 miles....don&apos;t know if it might have been over it or not. Best I recall, there was red on the top and bottom, and the turquoise color was in the center.  It didn&apos;t effect us other than fascination!  I&apos;m 51, and I&apos;ve NEVER seen anything like it before!  Wish I knew if others had.  I watched it till daylight, then I couldn&apos;t see it any more.((NUFORC Note:  Ordinarily, our first assumption in a case like this would be that the witness is reporting a &quot;twinkling&quot; star.  However, twinkling stars do not move across the sky in the manner described here.  We do not know what the witnesses saw.

I was already recording tape but in the wrong direction of the sky. It took less than a minute to record the red UFO. This was higher in elevation than I&apos;ve seen before. I was just outside 2 minutes before the phone rang and saw nothing. The surveilance camera had the area videotaped were it should of came from. So I guess it just appears in the sky. Again I shot more 80x to 100x video of this object. It was extremely red in color, you could see a double red lights in the viewfinder. With the naked eye could see 1 brightly lite light and a dimmer one just above it. It didn&apos;t seem to move much while looking at it directly but the videocamera revealed alot of movement. I was looking due east when I first sighted it at 8:57 pm Angle of view about 45 degrees. At the end of the sighting I was looking SE. The object was heading south and slightly ascending for about 10 minutes. Then it changed direction and started going straight up. When it got close to the cloud bank, it stopped for about 2 minutes. Hovered and moved around incredibly. Then it went up into the clouds and disappeared. The next day after talking to other spotters we determined that the object was in Chandler, about 2 miles from my house and less than 1 mile for the 3 commercial jets seen flying around it. This was one of the best sightings I had so far because it was closer to my house than any of the others so the video is much better. Tom King((NUFORC Note:  We believe the report is for August 12.  PD))", "Brilliant, moon sized, white disc descending rapidly over Seattle that disappeared behind Capitol Hill.I saw a very large, brilliant white disc &quot;falling&quot; in a diagonal trajectory that disappeared behind a hill  in the distance. The sighting was of extremely short duration. The disc appeared to be as large or larger than a full moon appears in the sky yet of very similar color to a full bright moon. I called out to my companion who was just getting in the car with her back turned to the object. She turned to look but the object had disappeared. I called a local Seattle radio station to report the sighting and to ask if anyone else had reported it as well. They told me that no one else had reported it. I was quite surprised due to the size and brightness of the object. I am a real estate broker in the greater Seattle area with 26 years experience here.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))", "I observed a very fast, silent object(s),  heading roughly south to north while the lights occasionally seemed to tightly &quot;pinwheel&quot;I was standing on my back porch in the Silverlake District of Los Angeles at approximately 00:20, on Monday June 26th 2000, looking towards the south, when I saw two white and slightly hazy/luminous lights moving very quickly across the sky from the south-southeast heading towards the northwest.  The lights were no bigger than a match head at arms length, and were spaced an inch apart (at arms length).  There was no way to tell whether the lights were connected to the same object, but they always maintained the exact same distance from each other. The oddest thing about the lights was:  A) how quickly, and silently, they were moving across the sky   B) the light(s) would momentarily (lasting one or two seconds)and quite distinctly, yet gently, &quot;pinwheel&quot; or &quot;vibrate&quot; in tandem, and then smooth back out. This is the toughest part to describe  This motion did not appear to affect the velocity or direction of the object(s). The object never changed it&apos;s long arcing across the sky in the directions I mentioned above.  This slight movement happened maybe three or four times during the total viewing time. I watched the object(s) for at least 15 seconds as it moved across the sky.  The weather at this time was cool and relatively clear.  There were no clouds in the sky, the stars were out.  There was some light pollution, Silverlake is on the Eastern edge of the Los Angeles Basin. And in the direction of the sighting I&apos;m sure there was some low coastal haziness in the air.  This may account for the slightly luminous quality of the lights?  I couldnt estimate the height or distance, but they were at LEAST a hands width above the horizon line from my viewing position.  At the time of my sighting I noticed no other aircraft from my view. This was the only object in this part of the sky at the time. I went inside to note the time and started a sketch of the lights themselves. Maybe between 3 and 5 minutes later I stepped back out onto my porch and observed at least 3 or 4 airplanes puttering around the Los Angele! s Basin. None of them seemed to be trying to track or follow the object I had seen a few minutes earlier.  The flights were local police/news copters, commercial/delivery planes heading towards LAX, small private planes...etc.  3, maybe 4 in the sky.  They were all much closer than the object I had seen.  As my eye caught the object my first thought was shooting star, a high altitude jet, or satellite.  But when I noticed the other light right next to it I was a bit thrown. And then it did the tight pinwheel movement.... It really seemed to be quite a distance away.  I wish I could make a fair guess....  It had the type of high altitude depth you associate with the possible explanations I mentioned above: star, jet, or satellite.  It wasn&apos;t traveling as briskly as a shooting star, or as &apos;deep&apos; as a satellite, this was more like a high speed jet.  Another very odd almost-unrelated occurence is the fact that I just happened to be making an audio recording while I had the sighting.  I haven&apos;t listened back to this exact portion of the tape yet, but I think I will be able to get a much better estimate-guess as to the length of the sighting based on me clomping around the porch once I saw it.... That&apos;s about all I can recall right now.  By the way, I do not claim to be educated in aeronautical devices of any nature.  I could easily believe this was an airplane of sorts just tearing across the sky, at a distance that made it appear to be silent. I will admit that I have been fascinated by the UFO phenom since my first trip to the public library in 3rd grade, so I have done my fair share of watching the skies above ever since,  but I have never claimed to see anything that falls into the category of what I consider to be a UFO until this morning. I&apos;m curious to know if anybody else happened to see the same thing I did.  I was VERY CLOSE to calling my friend in Northern California to get up and take a look in the same part of the sky, just in the wildest chance that he saw anything like it, but that seemed a bit too hasty and kinda&apos; kooky, I guess.  I flipped on the local all news radio stations and listened for any mention, but there was nothing.  I also did some quick sketches of the overall view while it was still fresh in my head. So that&apos;s that on that.... I&apos;m proud to have done my reporting duty, and maybe this small tidbit will help complete a bigger picture for someone else.

Usually the plane light would be whiteish in color. That&apos;s why it caught my eye. I kept looking at it for about a minute and a half with the naked eye and when I  had come to the conclusion that it was not moving I ran and got my Binoculars out. I focusedd in on it and saw that the light I had seen was actually 4 lights positioned in a 12 oclock, 3 oclock, 6 oclock, 9 oclock pattern and they had looked like one light to the naked eye.  I kept watching it even as 2 Jet liners flew between me and the object. I also saw a helicopter flying towards me and assume that they must have had to see it also. I tried to find anyone in veiw of me to confirm what I was seeing but nobody was around. I even tried to see if my neighbor was home but he wasn&apos;t. I continued to watch the object hover and then all of sudden it took off so fast that it seemed to disapear. All I saw the very first part of the take off andd there was nothing left to follow.

They were 3 separate objects as stars could be seen inside the formation. The speed was that of a typical satellite (about 2-4 minutes to cross the sky). The shortest side faced approx. NW-WNW, the longest side faced approx. SW-SSW. (The obtuse angle was between these two sides). It traveled in a direction between it&apos;s longest side and southern most tip(it&apos;s tip would have been at a SE position, whereas it headed SSE). They were a large formation, at least 1 and a quarter inches at arm&apos;s length (about half the big dipper&apos;s pot). They were at different magnitudes, the southern most tip was the brightest. They disappeared into the earth&apos;s shadow which confirmed that they weren&apos;t self illuminating, there was also no sound, it&apos;s highly unlikely that they were jets.

It was (I must only have been able to see 1/2 of it) round or arched appearing in shape.  It had a circle within the circle and orange lights within the two circles. We turned into a grocery store parking lot to get something for the person we were going to see in the hospital, and I looked up over the store, (This was also over the West Bend Company) and I saw that same object.

It is possible that this is explainable, and not out of this world, but it traveled faster than anything manmade (airplane, etc.)", "My wife was outside having a cigarette when she looked up and saw an object and then it just shot off to the South west. She said it was kind of like a cars headlight! I asked her if it might have been an Airplane and she said no way that thing was faster than anything I have ever seen and it made no sound !((NUFORC Note:  Without more details than those provided in this report, it is difficult to know what the witness observed.

I was driving westbound on HWY 52 and was nearing the interchange with I-5.  It was shortly after 9:30p.m. and I was heading to work.  There was some patchy fog along the coast, on the other side of Mt. Soledad.  I live near Miramar Marine Corps Air Base, which does have frequent military aircraft and helicopters that fly out to the ocean, and turn southward before flying back to the east.  I have grown up as a Navy dependent, and I also served in the Navy for some time, so I am used to seeing aircraft maneuvers and flybys.  What struck me was the incredible speed of this object.  I did not see any shape of the aircraft itself, only the light, which looked like a beacon.  I did not hear any jet noise either.  The object, or light, did not appear to be circling south and then east, as I would expect having seen other aircraft use this flight path.  Instead, it continued southward, and I lost it as it passed behind Mt. Soledad, which would make the object appear to be somewhere over the ocean, and even further away.  Unfortunately, I can not give a fair approximation of the distance it covered, due to it being dark, and initially when I saw the light, I didn&apos;t have a point of reference to place it near, but due to the incredible speed that the object moved in the 3 seconds that I saw it, I believe that this was not normal, whenever I have seen an jet fly this fast, I have expected to hear a sonic boom with it.  There was none.  I have tried to reconcile that an illusion brought on by the fog, may be part of this, but it still does not make sense.  I was hesitant in reporting this to you, but thought perhaps it might help, if anyone else reports a sighting from the same area at the same time and date.", "8/31/2000, &quot;21:15-25&quot; Bouse Az, friend and husband saw 6 bright amber lights appear in East and Northeast skies.On 08/31/2000 at 21:15 to 21:25 (Bouse, Arizona), light overcast, high misty clouds. a friend and my husband saw 6 extremely bright amber lights East and North East of them in the direction of Prescott/Harquehala mountains.

My brother was driving, and did see green light out of the corner of his eye, but when I yelled at him to look, he was busy avoiding the driver in the next lane over, who was slowing down and swerving all of a sudden.

We pulled the car over to the side of the road to observe the object. The object was a considerable distance away from us at that time. There was a pasture to our left in between us and the object and all of a sudden the object was at the edge of the pasture over the trees out the drivers side window. It looked maybe the size of a large house. It turned like it was angling down toward us and it was lights,very bright, in the shape of a cross. I personally, at the time felt we were being scanned or analyzed by the object. I don&apos;t know if we experienced lost time or what . The next thing i remember was looking at the digital clock in my friends car and it said 11:11 pm. Ever since then, if i&apos;m around a clock at 11:11, i&apos;ll automatically look at the clock for some reason. It&apos;s really weird. Something just makes me look at the clock at that time. The object backed off a little, slowly and then shot off to the W/NW at great speed. It happened on a country road between Henderson, Oxford, and Youngsville off hwy. 56. There was no other traffic on that rd. at the time. Theres alot of weird stuff going on in this area. Other people have seen things too. I know two guys who live in the Watkins community of Vance Co. which is a very rural area w/ alot of woods, saw one land in the woods behind their house. They walked down in there about 200 yds. and came in contact w/ the object. It made a humming sound and had lights flashing in sequence around it. The closer they got , the faster the lights would flash in sequeqnce. They got scared and ran back to their house. The object was said to be small, about the size of a full sized van. If anybody in the world wants to see some weird, unexplainable stuff in the sky, just come to Henderson for about a week and go out into some of these areas i&apos;ve described. I&apos;ll guarantee you will see something that will blow your mind!!! Theirs something weird going on here, ! theres n o doubt about that. The cross in the sky is not the only thing i&apos;ve witnessed,by far. It is the closest i&apos;ve been to one ( I think ). I wish someone would at least come and investigate the weird things that are happening around here. I would gladly assist any way I could. Some, or most people are skeptical to my accounts but i would pass a lie detector test w/ no problem.     Thanks.", "&quot;Light&quot; flew as wingman to commercial flight.Klamath Falls is a navagation point of a North/South Commercial Air traffic corridor. As such there is a large degree of air traffic regularly seen in this vicinity. There is a wide Military North/South military corridor begining about 45 miles to the east of here. Another N/S commercial flight path traverses Medford, Oregon to the west, approximately 55 air miles. Commercial aircraft was first noted directly over head at approximately 21:57 headed south at 180&apos;, with a bright &quot;light&quot; approximating the appearance of a satellite, with out any navigational lights, directly to the starboard side matching it&apos;s speed. If it is assumed that the commercial traffic was at 30,000 feet, than the object was approximately less than one mile from the aircraft. In lay terms, it was the distance of the width of your thumb held at arms length. It matched the flight path of the commercial until lost in the haze due to a forest fire to the south, at approximately 4 to 5 degrees in elevation, still on a 180&apos; path, at 22:02. Magnitude of the object did not diminish, except once, for less than a second, in which it did dim. It is difficult to imagine that this was a coincidence of a polar orbit satellite appearing to &quot;match&quot; the flight path of a commercial aircraft. The other witness was called out to view the object, but she is not trained in aerial observations.", "Irregular shape with twinkling lights.I walked to my backyard and in the sky to the west I saw what looked like a bunch of twinkling christmas lights in a sort of v pattern. The lights blinked one at a time in a racing pace. There was no pattern to the blinking. There was no sound from this object. After watching it for about 5 minutes I noticed an airplane coming past it from the south-there was no similarity. I watched it for about 15 minutes(until I could no longer see it). Actually, I couldn&apos;t really tell if it was a v. The lights were spaced in an irregular formation. I would say that the space between these lights were probably 1/3 of the size of the moon, and there were many lights. Since the pattern of the blinking was so irregular, it was hard for me to figure out the shape-I do know that it was not in the shape of an airplane, helicopter, or blimp. When I first noticed it I was approximately a half mile from it.", "I never knew there was a way of reporting this without being exposed or ridiculed.  On the approximate date at roughly the time indicated.  I was sitting on my back porch with my witness.  The night was very clear and we could see all the stars.  I often watch the skies and plans transporting people from Nashville (I think) to Florida.  I know that they usually are somewhere around 25,000 to 30,000 feet high.  I also fly R/C aircraft, and have flown small aircraft (as a student pilot). We were looking to the east when suddenly two lights appeared on the horizon, apparently side-by-side. We both saw them at the same time, and they were on a westerly path.. right over my home.  They were coming VERY FAST at (I estimated about 10,000 feet).  As they went over our heads, we tried to see the shape of the objects, but it was simply too dark to determine anything.  There was a trail behind them, like fire (guessing), and they were only in view (because of my house roof) for about 3-4 seconds.  At that altitude, I expected to hear something (it was a quiet night) but neither of us heard any sound whatsoever.  I don&apos;t know of any military aircraft that can travel (estimated) from horizon to horizon in less than 8 seconds.  The speed would be much faster than anything I know of at that altitude.  I do know that we have helicopters with silent running features, but certainly they are not nearly capable of speeds like that. My witness and I thought maybe they could have been two meteorites, although they did not appear to be losing altitude to either of us.  In any case, I watched the newspapers and television news for several days to see if a couple meteors may have hit somewhere far west of us.. but no reports. It really bothered both of us that we didn&apos;t hear anything, not even a sonic boom (which I thought was not posssible for an object traveling at speeds far above speed of sound at that altitude).  We waited patiently to hear it, but nothing at all! I&apos;m not a physicist, and could be wrong what it takes to create a sonic boom. Wish I had more to share with you, but that&apos;s all there was to it. In a nutshell, they were very very fast, about (maybe) 300 feet apart going the same speed, with no sound at all, and far exceeding the speed of sound.  My best guess is that they were at about 10,000 feet (much lower than commercial aircraft, and far higher than small aircraft fly).", "Triangular object traveling south crossed the highway in front of us hovered then turned east and left with no sound.The object crossed the highway in front of us coming from the north.  It was approx. 50 feet off the ground and traveling slowly.  We stopped and I got out to see it better.  It was cold and clear out with no moon.  I could see the details by the street lights.  It stopped by the water tower just yards east of it, ocillated, turned toward the east, then sped off. The only sound was as it left, it sounded like a &quot;tubine&quot; winding down during shut off.  The object was triangular shaped with the front being the base of the triangle.  There were 3 red lights. One one each corner.  The surface appeared to have a lot of conduit type fixtures on it.  When it left, it passed right over a trailer home of the Mayor of the town.  When I got home, I call the mayor and asked him if he had heard anything approx. 15 min earlier.  He stated that he and his wife didn&apos;t hear any thing but they had experienced an earthquake about that time.  He said the walls started shakeing with items falling from shelves.  I contacted Fort Campbell Ky and asked if they had any helocopters in our area.  They would not confirm.  They finally put the flight commander on the phone and the conversation went something like this:  Me: &quot;Sir, I know that you people have been having problems with the night vision equipment lately but I need to know if you or Scott AFB have any birds in the area over southern Illinois.&quot;  Commander: &quot; Sir, I can&apos;t give that information out.&quot;  Me: &quot;I understand that.  The reason I am asking is I just saw something very unusual.&quot;  Commander: &quot;What did you see?&quot;  Me: &quot;I saw something cross Hwy 146 in Harding county Illinois at Elizabethtown coming from the north going south.  It was about 50 feet off of the ground and almost hit the water tower.  With the problems that you have been having with Night Vison, they shouldn&apos;t be that low in a residential area.&quot;  Commander: &quot;Maybe it was a civilian aircraft.&quot;  Me: &quot;I don&apos;t want you to think I&apos;m crazy but I&apos;ve never seen an aircraft like that.  Your birds are always flying! over ou r area and I know what helocopters look like but this was different.  I got a good look at it.  It was low.  It stopped not more than a hundred feet from me and my wife and hovered.  It made no sound at all untill it left, then it sounded like a turbine winding down.  It had 3 red lights that did not blink.  I could not see a cockpit or windows.&quot;  Commander:  &quot; Which direction was traveling when you last saw it?&quot;  Me:  East.  I got out of my vehicle and watched it leave at a high rate of speed.&quot;  I then told him about the mayor&apos;s statement to me. The Commander said &quot;Sir I can&apos;t tell you where our birds are due to security, but I can tell you that neither us nor Scott AFB have had any aircraft in your area all day. Do you wish to make an official report?&quot;  Me: &quot; No.  I work for the Illinois Department of Corrections.  I may sound crazy but I&apos;m not.  I don&apos;t need the problems.&quot;", "moving light disappears in starry skyThe time is approximate.  As I am not familiar with this area, I can&apos;t say which direction I was facing when I spotted a &apos;star&apos; moving at a steady pace in a straight horizontal line.

There were no clouds visable and many &apos;real&apos; stars were shining brightly in the area where this light disappeared.

Then looking out of the windshield I say a capsule shaped green glowing object in the sky directly over head and said to my boyfriend, what the hell is that a giant fire fly, he looked and then in the next instant it landed infront of us on the highway the only way we were able to see this was because of the huge flash of green light that it gave off.  I immedaitley turn the car around and drove the opposite direction.  While I was doing this my boyfriend saw the craft it was disk shaped, black with red under glow.   We were driving away, not being able to move very fast because of the weather conditions, we travled at least four miles when I spotted the craft now glowing solid green following us it was about a mile away just above tree line, I told my boyfriend that it was behind us and he saw the same thing too.  So I sped up driving at least 75 miles per hour.  We were both terrified and did not get a good or curious feeling from or about this thing.  When I looked again in the rearview it was not there.

Possibly the same object previously reported from Plano TX.I observed what could be the same object from the 04/27/00 Plano TX report already in the database.The object  was seen at approximately 8:40 pm CDT April 27 from the 4500 block of Fairway Ave. in Dallas, Texas,as I stood facing south towards the Crestpark Condominiums.This location is about 20 miles south of the original report from Plano.I saw a single white light at great distance movingextremely fast away from me towards the southwest (i.e., generally north to south).  I could only see one light and could not make out any detail of the shape, etc.It moved in a straight-forward (horizontal) line, as an aircraft in flight.The object moved much faster than a space shuttle moves upon re-entry (17,000 mph).I&apos;ve seen 2 space shuttle flights returning at night from this same location within the past year.It was traveling at a steady pace (its speed did not change during the few seconds itwas observed) and it quickly disappeared from view.I kept the object in clear view for perhaps 10 seconds.It did not appear to be a meteor because it traveled slower than a meteor.Also, it did not look like any space junk returning to earth (it was notburning, breaking up, like a satellite I saw reentering earth atmosphere in the 1970&apos;s).It moved much faster than any known airplane.It left no vapor trail behind as a rocket would leave at night (I saw one in the 1960&apos;s)and left no contrail like the space shuttle returning (again, I&apos;ve seen these twice recently). ============================================================  Report cited above from the National UFO Reporting Center database:Occurred : 4/27/00 23:38 (Entered as : 04/27/00 23:38) Reported : 4/30/00 19:52 Posted : 5/3/00 Location : Plano, TX Shape : Triangle It was about 8:38pm CST, on Thursday April 27 when I witnessed the object. I met a girlfriend of mine in theparking lot of my apartment complex, and while she was talking with my best friends fiance(they also live in my complex) Iwitnessed a triangular object moving at incredible speed from the north to south. The object was lit on its underside in the shapeof a rod, but I could make out a black triangular shape outside of the lit area. I could see the object moving for about 3 seconds, thenit seemed to just disappear. There was no clouds in the area to hide in, so where it went is beyond me. The speed wasincredible, in the couple of seconds I witnessed it it covered a good portion of the sky. To compare in speed, I witnessed the spaceshuttle coming back in orbit a couple of months ago, it took about 30-35 seconds to cross the horizon. If this object would havestayed visible it would have cleared the horizon in less than 10 seconds. I was fully expecting to hear a sonic boom. My best guess of thesize of the object is about 3 times of the size of a 727(in comparison to a 727 flying at 30,000 feet, like this object appeared tobe flying at). It definitely dodn&apos;t appear to be a meteor, becuase of the color, size, direction of movement(it moved in a staight line).It was definitely a strange site (sic).", "5 fireballs flying in formationWas driving south on interstate 29 into Missouri.

It was between 6:30 and 7:30 P.M. I&apos;m not sure of the time. Anyway I was trying to see a plane my wife had pointed out to me when I saw a black dot moving east to west. At first I thought it was a black coloured &quot;party&quot; balloon that some kid might have let go of, but I didn&apos;t see any string underneath and it seemed more like a circle or a dot in shape and not an oval like a child&apos;s balloon. Also it was moving fast in a perfect straight line like a plane and just as fast. It wasn&apos;t bouncing or bobbing at all in the breeze like small helium balloons do. It was definetely moving as fast as a jet plane because there were some planes in other parts of the sky and I could compare the speed. I couldn&apos;t tell how big it was or how high it was but it didn&apos;t seem like it was far away. Maybe a quarter of a mile away, I don&apos;t know. There was no light or reflection coming from it at all. It was solid dull black. I couldn&apos;t see any characteristics at all. Its hard to explain but I think it would have just looked like a dull black circle or ball if it was just feet away from me. It moved in a straight, fast, perfect trajectory like it was under intelligent control. I lost sight of it behind our row of houses so I went to the front of the house so I could see it again. It went out of sight pretty quick and became so small I couldn&apos;t make it out anymore. Just then an identical black dot came from the same direction as the other one had and moved in the exact same fashion and trajectory.

It was a solid object from my observation.", "I observed a boomerang shaped object above my vehicle on the I-10 freeway, suspended without motion and completely silent.I was driving down Interstate 10 (east bound) when I noticed a bright, low, lingering, diamond shape object straight ahead.  At that point I was at mile post 182. I continued to drive until I was directly beneath the object at mile post 184.5.  At that time I noticed the object was not a diamond, but rather a series of dotted white lights that formed a boomerang shape with a bright soft light at the vertex.  The object appeared to be silent and still. I stepped out of my vehicle and whatched the object approximately 8 min.  I feel others had witnessed the lights because vehicles were weaving in their lanes as they drove under the object.  I drive this route quite frequently and am aware of the crop dusters and other aircraft in the area and am positive this was not of the ordinary.  I also am very familiar with the different types of aircraft, because I am a former flight attendant.", "Triangular craft with pulsating multi-colored lights; moving in various directions in no apparent course.While taking my dog out prior to retiring for evening I had occasion to glance up to the west/southwest sky due to unusually bright moving object which caught my attention immediately.  Due to object moving left to right; right to left and up and down I ran inside to get binoculars and inform family members.  While looking at object through binoculars it &quot;glowed&quot; or pulsed; seemed to have lights of red, green and white/yellow-white on sides and bottom of a triangular-shaped craft. Lights seemed to pulse.  Object continued movement in no apparent course ( up, down, left-to-right, right-to-left) .  It never moved fast.   At times it just hovered; with no movement at all.

My mother(a complete non-believer) and I were traveling east on a major street in town when we saw just ahead, a little beyond the next intersection what looked like several helicopters flying very low, coming toward us.  We discussed the flying machines and decided the white lights which were strobing were much too bright for helicopters.  Just then, two blocks past the intersection, we were right under it.  I turned on the side street and we got out of the car.  The diamond or square shaped as we decided object was just hovering in the sky with no noise.  With every observation I made I asked mother if she agreed and she did.  This thing was huge approximately 600 feet in all directions.  We were underneath and could see the apparent color charcoal. We estimated it was no more than 100 feet above the ground and the lights were at the corners. We could also see individual squares marked off on the underneath side with carvings or writings of some kind we could not identify.  Some time later I saw a celtic cross and thought the artwork was the same or very similar.  We just stood under it discussing it, mesmerized.  Mainly we talked about its size.  A few minutes into it we saw and heard a jet coming down the same main street toward us.  At almost the same time we spotted the jet, the big craft took off in a northwesterly direction being chased by the jet.  I don&apos;t know why but we still stood there watching until they were almost out of sight unable to move.  Finally we jumped in the car and gave chase but never saw either again.", "dark triangle shaped aircraft no sound could be heard however we did notice after it had gone what sounded like thunder in the distance the reson we knew it was triangle shaped was because it was blotting out the stars adove it", "I watched a disk-shaped craft hover above treeline for about 20 minutesI was a student at Southeast Missouri State University and was living in an apartment on Lorimer Street, just two blocks west of the Mississippi River.  A female student I knew lived in an apartment house (west side of the street) across the street from mine. She and I went through the hall of her apartment building to a second floor porch.  We stood out there for about 20 minutes looking at a silver disk-shaped craft which was hovering just above treeline to the south-southwest of the porch.  It had multicolor lights which were blinking at a slow rate from left to right, like a movie marquee.  The lights were approximately around the horizontal middle of the craft. When a small airplane approached from the north and got within a couple of miles, the lights on the UFO blinked very rapidly from left to right, then the whole craft disappeared.  This happened during the early evening and it was completely light outside.  It was difficult to judge distance or size, but my fist held at arms length would maybe have covered it, and my finger would not.  I think it was a block or two away.

He asked me what that white thing was in the sky.  I couldn&apos;t see it from my angle, so I pulled over and stopped the car.  We watched an oval shaped white object moving accross the blue sky, going east from Libby.  There were no clouds and it was before we had any smoke from the fires.

It caught our attention because it was flashing red and bright white lights in a rotating pattern.It was stationary in the sky for about fifteen minutes and then we noticed small flashes of light some distance away; these lights were of jets. We actually witnessed a jet fly near the object and then retreat.A short time later (two/three minutes)we saw five other jets scoping out the area. The UFO then began movely extremely slowly up and down, bobbing in the sky. The jets all moved out very quickly, and the UFO slowly disappeared into the night.", "The rate of speed and no soundI just happen to step out last night to see what the weather was like, so as if we should open up the house.  I know it was over cast and I could hear a commercial air liner in the distance.  As I looked up I saw a bright flash, similar to a strobe light on an aircraft , what caught my attention , was the time and distance between flashes.  No plane I&apos;ve ever seen could travel that fast between  flashes, and what was even more strange, there was no sound, absouletly none.  Like I said there was a distant  sound of a jet , and that was still heard after this object was long gone.  It  moved from the southeast toward the northwest,  like from Winona  MN to  Minneapolis  MN.   The total time I observed this object, couldn&apos;t  have been morre than  15 secs.   I know for sure I saw  3 flashes, then due to my location where I was standing, with trees and the house, buy the time I changed my stand for another view, it was gone.

Friday night was very dark, no moon light to speak of.  The stars were very visible and unusually bright.The light was quite large and much brighter than any of the stars and was moving east over our backyard.  He came in the house to get me.  After we ran out front of our house the object which was moving in a straight line and had no audible sound had just come over the top of our house and was moving in an eastward direction.  If I had to estimate the size, I would say it was about the size of a small pill held at arms length.  An airplane came from the south going north (which we did hear) and crossed in front of the object.  The airplane was about twice the size of the object. Once the plane was past the object and out of sight, there was no sound again.  The object then seemed to come to a stop, then start to move to the south.  It never appeared to turn, just change direction.  It went for about 30-40 seconds south then change directions again and go back north. It appeared to stop again and start to go backwest over our house again.  The object never appeared to turn, just slow down or stop then change direction.  It also seemed to get brighter then dimmer then brighter again.  In looking at it through binoculars it appeared to be reddish, gold color, not a flame, but have a sparkling energy moving it.  My husband indicated that when he first saw the light in the backyard, he thought it might be a helicopter, however, as the object came closer, he saw a row of lights inside the brighter light.  Not red and green, just moving lights in a row inside the brighter light.  After watching the object for approx. 7 mins.changing direction approx. 5 times it seemed to hover for a couple of seconds then go up and out.  I can&apos;t say it took off, it just turned off.  It didn&apos;t die out, the bright light just went out, like someone turned off the light.", "Three lights came out of the sky and circled and dissapeared.My friends and I were sitting outside after just getting back from Six Flags.  We were talking about the weather and how perfectly clear it was.  I was looking at the starts when three of them started to move around.  They eventually got bigger and bigger until it seemed like they were right on top of us.  Then they even changed color from a bright white to a dark red to blue back to a dark red.  There wasn&apos;t any noises that we could hear but there was a weird static electricity feeling, like having your hair stand up straight.  Anyway, one of my friends passed out (I guess he was too scared) and my other friend and I leaned over to see what was wrong and when we looked back there was nothing there.  I don&apos;t really know if that was considered a UFO sighting, but I can&apos;t think of anything else that would explain what happened.  I&apos;ve heard of ligtning balls, but they only occur when it&apos;s storming.

The first siting occured in about 10 years ago.  My brother and I and one of his friends were bouncing on the trampoline during a typical sleepover at my house.  My brother got off of the trampoline to go into the house and get a drink.  So, while my brother&apos;s friend and I waited for him to come back, we both naturally started looking at the stars.  We had both spotted the same red light (looked like a star only red).  It was traveling at a much faster pace than a jet or any other &quot;earthly&quot; known craft could have gone.  Plus, there were  no blinking lights that are typical of planes in the sky.  Anyway, it was traveling in a straight line for about 2 seconds and then made this small turn and curved back in the opposite direction that it was traveling and sped off so fast that I could not see where it had gone.  I have seen this only one other time, about 1 year ago, and it was a white nonflashing light and traveled one direction in at an unearthly speed.", "Yellowish light with sound.

It was definetly not aircraft of any kind we were familular with. There were several occasions wher this &quot;thing&quot; would stop, unlike anything we had ever seen. As the UFO moved south it stopped for a period of about 45-60 seconds, compleatly hovering. Periodically, the craft would almost flash and pulsate. There seemed to be no rhyme or reason. As we looked we saw what looked like lights on the side of this craft. They resembled beams coming from all around circle. At this time there was no other aircraft in the sky! As this whole incident happend we saw no airplanes at all! Being so close to Linburgh Field we always have airtraffic. There were none during this whole episode until after the craft was gone and we, within ten minutes saw several airplanes landing and taking off.This was no airplane! We all were very intersted at this time and as the craft moved north once again, it seemed to stop almost directly above us and with a very bright, very dramatic explosion the crafts former red (unblinking) lights transformed into white light and with a blink of the eye that red hovering spot we had been witnessing had vanished. There after we saw no evidence of this incident. That is of course exept for the digital camcorder recording that we have.

I didn&apos;t quite believe him until a few seconds later he came inside and dragged me out. I couldn&apos;t tell exatly how many lights where on it, but there appeared to be 3 in a triangular shape in the darkest yellow I have ever seen on an aircraft. It didn&apos;t appear to be moving and my other brother (age 18) got our telescope. As he was gone I watched the object move quickly to the left behind some trees. It didn&apos;t dart across very fast but moved a lot faster than any plane I had seen before, and it had done this after not moving for quite a while. When my brother came out we could barely make it out behind the trees. It was then that we noticed another object looking like the other that was not there just a second before. We weren&apos;t looking when it appeared but it must have moved very fast to its position as 3 of us were watching the skies. We ran down our driveway with the telescope so we could see behind the trees and get a good look at the objects, but once we got down, they were no where to be found.

My family thinks I&apos;m nuts over this.  Well I now have proof thanks to my camcorder.  I&apos;ve seen, with my wife, three round like or football shaped like objects directly above our heads, taking their sweet time heading in formation straight across us ass the sun was going down.  It happened at my roof.  I walk my dogs to my roof and I am addicted to looking up a lot. I&apos;ve also seen silver objects with a little bit of black underneith them with no lights at broad daylight.  My cousin has aslo experienced those with me.  My uncle had wittnessed a brown one with me.  I admit when I see the silver or white ones I feel at peece but the brown ones give off many negative vibes towards me.  I get scared of them.  When they&apos;re directly above me they seem to change their shapes kind of like a blanket or liquid metal then they go back to their original shapes (round).  Finally on the 23rd of July of 2000 at 6pm. I was looking out my window, eight stories high and I spotted a black or brown spot in the sky.  I then knew exactly what it was so I grabbed my camcorder and ran fast to the roof.  The building security guard was up there so he had a chance to wittness it with me.  It seemed like a large ball holding a smaller one in one spot keeping it&apos;s balance as though it was being held by a string.  It was very windy so it couldn&apos;t have been a baloon and it was definitly not a plane.  There were two very close maybe attached to eachother by a long but short object.  It seemed to be observing everything around it, turning all around but still in the same spot.  The security guard ran downstairs but I kept on filming.  After about twenty minutes it started it&apos;s way towards one direction.  The shape then looked round or like a lightbulb.  When it was gone another popped up within a minute at the same spot that I spotted it at first.  I thought maybe it was the same one or another, I was too startled at this point to even think. It ! seemed t o be making it&apos;s way towards me giving off a tapping sound as though someone was tapping on metal as it got closer to me it seemed like a light bulb black or charcoal gray.  I got too scared and started making my way towards the exit.  It then started moving away quickly and left  towards the same direction the last one left.  Then about five minutes later a third one just appeared behind me, going around me heading towards the same direction the others left.  It seemed to have been closer to the buildings behind me than an airplane that had passed right above it.  It&apos;s on the film when I said, &quot;watch it disapear and another will pop up again,&quot; and so I was right the fourth had showed up at the same spot the first two did and left very quickly towards the same direction again.  This is no supprise to me.  They say you only see this stuff at farms but I do spend a lot of times on roofs.  People in the city do not look up at the skies very often. They wouldn&apos;t even think we would get something like these sightings but I do got it on film now with four wittnesses.

Within about three seconds, this object became the brightest object in the sky, easily as bright as an aircraft landing light and many times brighter than any stars in view above, but with a bluish quality to it similar to the strobe lights used on communications towers. Then the light simply winked out. I made a note of the time, then watched the sky until about 22:45 before falling asleep. I also watched the sky in the area for satellites and aircraft but saw none. During the short period that the object flashed it appeared to be stationary. I tried to see if it might be a strobe from a passing aircraft, but I saw and heard none. It was also much brighter than any aircraft strobe I had seen previously. The object was astoundingly bright, even as I looked directly at it (I know how objects can appear brighter at night when caught out of the corner of your eye). The following evening, I attempted to see if it would occur again and have submitted a report for what I saw on the evening of July 31.", "Eight of us were camping in Yosemite saw a large black triangular craft,only four have good recollection of sightiing.Eight of us were camping about the 8,000 ft elevation in Yosemite and had just returned to our campsite around 10.00 p.m. and had decided to stay and pack our stuff,because the next day we were leaving.At about 2345 all eight of were still up and noticed a very bright flash to the north of us.Thinking it was just a comet or somebody turning on their highbeams we didnt think much of it.Five minutes later we noticed the surroundings had gotten quieter {no more frogs or cricket noises}and then we saw a very large black tiangular craft appear from the north and hover about 300 yards above the tree line and then shoot of to the south.Strange thing is that it made no noise and even though very large but was very flat and only four of actaully remember it vividly while the others have very vague recollections.", "I did not see a craft.  Neither did my mother, I am speaking on her behalf. She does&apos;t know much English.  What she saw one night in 1975 was what describes as a very ugly human like creature.  She said there was a full moon. she was sitting inside a little pick-up truck with a closed cab. There was three other people with her but they all were sleep.  When she tells me the story and remembers she seems as if she saw a ghost. She said she was setting on the drivers side looking at the moon and worring that shes was going to get in trouble for not being home. The place they were park at was very desolate then.  very country.  She recalls being able to see real good because of the moon light.  She said out of no where this pale creature jumped on the hood ofthe truck.  my mom said she was completely paralized.  panicking she could not move or scream.  then she says the thing moved over to her window, which was open. She said it look at her very curiously and paciently.  my mom thinks it was about 4&apos; in height.  She said he had a skinny neck with a large head and very large eyes, also long arms and fingers.  My mother grew up in a third world country with no tv until she was about 16. The incident happened when she was 14. So she could not have any ideas what an alien may have looked like then based on Hollywood. My mother said she finally snapped out of her panic and she then slapped the driver who was sleeping on the passenger side.  she was screaming and crying very nervous because she had never seen anything like that in her life.  No one believed her then. My mother is a very serious person.  she doesn&apos;t lie.  I believe her.  When she saw the movie &quot;Fire in the Sky&quot;  she said the creatures looked very much like the aliens portrait in the movie.  Also like the ones in &quot;Close Encounters of The Third type&quot;.  She drew a face illustration for me of what she saw and it looked just like them.

It turned on....then off...a couple more times. We watched it until it went behind a mountain.

While talking to my neighbor in her yard, we and our kids (4 between us, ages 6 - 9) ) spotted a huge golden fireball trailing sparks, moving from south to north.  I&apos;m not good with distances, but I thought it was maybe three miles east of us (Stanwood, WA) and maybe a mile south.  It would have been very close to Interstate 5 between Stanwood and Arlington.  I don&apos;t know how high up it was, but it was a handspan above the rooftops we could see from our vantage point. We quit thinking the fireball was just a fireball because it moved rather slowly with a curve to its tail, and then it pulled straight up.  The sparks cut out, the thing nearly disappeared into a mote of light.  Then it reignited, the fireball this time looking like it was moving from east to west.  During various maneouvers a brilliant red oval of light appeared under the fireball, as a second fireball moved in from the south.  Both fireballs and the red light winked out, then one fireball reignited and looked as though it was moving away before it winked out. These things almost looked like intelligent fireworks, which has got my neighbor thinking the lights could have been part of the annual airshow in Arlington.  I&apos;m not so sure since the fireballs sans tails would have been the size of my fingernail at arm&apos;s length even though they were a little distance away.  A single plane in the same location would have been much, much smaller.  Also, the crowd that would have been watching any nighttime airshow would have been several miles south of where this took place.  I will say this lightshow was the prettiest thing I&apos;ve ever seen in the sky....", "Red/Orange light in the sky.About an hour after the New Year came my friends and I noticed and red/orange light in the sky.

Well again we had to turn around and head north again only to our surprise it was waiting, we immed. turned back around south and headed toward baker at the speed of 90 mph+  Brian then asked where it was, when i turned to look it was right on top of us, I could see what appeared to be airline engines in the back window, when i looked out the passanger window i could clearly tell this was no plane for the bottom of this aircraft was directly above us, but there was no noise, I yelled to get us out of here and proceded to raise the car windows, the windowswould not shut for they were bowed in, I noticed how bright it was in the car and at first thought it was the panel lights of the car, i reached down and turn them off and that is when we both noticed the lime green glow in the car, I looked straight ahead and noticed a car comming toward us and yelled for brian to watch out, when suddenly our ears popped and the object was gone.((NUFORC Note:  Please see second report from second witness in the vehicle that allegedly was chased.

As the night went on we decided to lay on the ground and make things out of clouds, after about 30 mins we noticed a football shaped object hovering low above Rooty Hill (which is located about 500m from his house and is also the name of the suburb). immediantly i went inside to inform his parents and relatives, at first nobody followed me but after the heard everyone out the back they went straight out the front (which faces straight at the hill) i followed them. When i got down the hall way enough to see the top of the hill i was ammased to see it was only about 5m off the ground, instead of about 15m which it was when we first noticed it. At this point it had been in veiw for about 3 mins. We were all in shock, there was a shinning silver, perfect football shaped ufo that would have been 30m long by 15m high, there was no visible windows or wngs or jets, But still it hovered perfect. after about 5 mins it began to rotate then it began to rise till it was about 50m above the hill, Then &apos;shot&apos; straight up, it looked like when the enterprise or whatever it is off that show with captain spok, took off into space and just became a dot with the big light streak. The streak of light was red in colour and lasted for a couple of seconds. THIS IS THE FREAKIEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!! This all happened tonight. there are easy 50 ppl who can varify my story. I didnt know if i should call the police or what!?! So when i got home (about 20mins ago) i put ufo in the search and ended up here.

As they began to cross the bridge, they saw a large, non-moving object hovering in the sky. The object was above the bridge. They stopped and watched it for a minute or so. They said it was perfectly still, at a height where a very low flying plane would be and heard no sound. Both claimed it was difficult to make out an exact shape - but drew me a picture and described it. They saw two large glowing circular lights (white) on the side, and said they were attached to a long cigar shaped body. They had difficulty describing what attached the lights to the body. I asked what made them think it was not a helicopter and they said it was WAY too large and remained perfectly still - plus what happened next. They decided to keep moving and the passenger was looking out the rear window at the object.

It passed at a high rate of speed from right to left, in a generally North or Northeast direction, also moving downward at about a 30 degree angle relative to the horizon.  It was visible to me for less than a second. What made it highly unusual to me was its color.  It appeared to be a consistant shade of green, perhaps yellow green, bright, almost of a flourescent quality.  The surface of both the object and its tail appeared mottled, broken up by dark patches between the green.  It had the appearance of something colored by a flourescent pen on an animation gel, with no variation in color aside from the mottled appearance.  The mottling and the detail of the object&rsquo;s tail appeared to be changing slightly as it quickly passed, convincing me it was no reflection.

Approximately a minute later I observerd a second light traveling along the same flight path, demonstrating the same flight characteristics.  The lights were fairly dim, about as bright as an average star, and about the same size.  Neither light blinked, flashed or twinkled in any way.  Both objects were at about 70 degrees above the horizon, and and managed to travel from mid-sky to the northern horizon in about 15 seconds.  Both objects appeared to wobble or weave slightly as they traveled, and made no discernable sound. It is highly unlikely that this was a firework of any kind.  The display we were watching was a non professional one, and at this point there had been a lull of about five minutes since the last firework had been launched.  They could not have been sparks because they lasted too long, and their flight path started down wind of the launch site. In all probability I would not have noticed these objects had I not been focused on the sky since they were not particularly bright, and would probably not have been visible at all near city lights.  The only thing that made them eye catching was the speed at which they moved and the wobbling motion.

There was no noise emitted from these orbs.  Then I saw a triangle approaching from the Southeast.  It was an equalateral trianle, and I estimated the legs to be 100 to 150 ft across.  It was densely metallic and black in coloration.  There were lights in each of the three corners of the triangle.  The object came extremely close, and then it stopped completely in mid air.  Then I stood in disbelief as it emitted an orb of light.  It seemed to materialize out of thin air!

The second Craft was much bigger than the other.It would fly sideways,and woul manover like nothing ive ever seen before.It had big flickering bright white lights.It was flying wright beside the smaller craft.The bigger one we only saw for 5 minutes.They were both about 40 or 50 feet fromour window.", "I observed A very bright and long duration meteor rip through the skys over so. Ill. It was a very impressive show .This is not A UFO report but rather A report of A very impressive Meteor I observed several min. ago . I have watched  meteors for years and have seen thousands of Meteors and fireballs. This was the most impressive meteor I have ever seen . It started in Cygnus and cut through the tail of the Big Dipper on an almost true westerly course and went all the way to the horizon and out of sight. It was orange in color and left a luminois trail all the way across the sky, that glowed for several seconds , even through the glare of the town lights . I know this is not A UFO report but I would bet many people seen this . So any reports of A great fireball or the such across So. Ill. will probably be this rascal. I am sorry if you would rather not get these kind of reports but it was a significant event in the sky here , and I just happened to think of you and thought it would be of interest.", "While sitting on my patio with my head leaned back looking at the stars on a clear night, I saw something, shaped like a boomerang, very large, I guess about 1000x the size of an airplane, moving at relatively low altitude, guess 8,000 feet, very fast, I would guess an arc of 12 degrees, starting from over my head to straigth ahead. The &apos;object&apos;(for lack of a better word) appeared to be a sort of glowing gradient where the leading edge of the &apos;wing&apos; was a fairly deep orange, and the trailing edge seemed to be glowing orange-yellow, and may have been leaving an orange-yellow trail all along the trainling edge of the &apos;wing&apos; as it moved. The incident was entirely silent. There were planes in the air, but far off in a different quadrant of the sky; they had nothing to do with this object. The object appeared for about a second, long enough for me to alert my wife, but by the time she tried to see it, it was gone.", "((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch out of Vandenberg AFB.

Object exploded in upper atmosphere, or space. (poosibly over Pacific ocean).", "The Westchester Triangle 96?At college, just next door to the Westchester Airport, we saw a massive triangle lazily floating across the night sky.  It had 8 small lights on the leading edges, bright white, which blinked a bit.  It had to be several hundred feet in span and it&apos;s speed could not have exceeded 50 mph.  We called the airport which said it had nothing on it&apos;s radar and had no visual from the tower.  We didn&apos;t believe them because we could see the top of the tower from where we were and the UFO was in direct line of sight.  The next day in the Westchester Gannet Newspaper we found out the about 300 people had reported seeing the same object.  Authorities said it was a bunch of ultralights flying in formation at night.  But considering the very low altitude (aprox. 200 ft above ground) we would have heard so many engines.  And the formation didn&apos;t vary at all, making us believe it couldn&apos;t have been more than one craft.", "I saw an oval-shaped thing in the sky, turning several times, high above the clouds.While standing outside the back of my place of business, having a cigarette, I looked up and was watching the clouds...it was very sunny out, and there were alot of low-hanging, puffy cloud formations.  I happened to notice, for a few seconds, what seemed to be a tiny oval-shaped object move behind a cloud....it was so brief that I didn&apos;t think much of it at first. A moment or so later, I looked up and saw it again, this time in a large, cloudless area of bright blue sky...it looked very far away..my best guess is about 20,000-25,000 feet up...I figured it was far too high up to be a bird, and even though it was very tiny from my perspective..about half the size of a bb held at arm&apos;s length, I could still make out an oval shape to it.  It looked well lit from the sun, but not real bright...I pretty much had to keep my eyes on it at all times to keep from losing it.  It was moving in a straight line at a pretty steady pace..and at first, I almost dismissed it as a passenger plane...until it did a loop...a pretty sharp loop, actually....it went straight in another direction, and looped again....altogether, I believe it changed direction about 4 times, each time making turns that I think were far too tight to have been a plane.   I never heard any kind of sound to it, and after a couple of minutes of watching it, I lost it behind the clouds.", "Arabian Extraresstrial AircraftMy friend and I were having a sleep over, and decided to go on the balcony so as to get a breath of fresh air, and cool off (it&apos;s kinda hot here).  So as we looked to the sky we noticed 4 specs of moving light.  Satellites we thought, but they seemed to take the shape of a green-gray cube like from, with red lights speckled here and there.  They got closer and closer, and we noticed the diamond formation was not ever deviated from.  At first we thougth we were hallucinating, but as it got closer, we knew we weren&apos;t.  It was obviously an alien craft.  we went inside the house and immediately called our friend, who was asleep.  He woke, and ran over to my house to see what all the comotion was about.  When he arrived the crafts had vanished.  He still doubts us, but we know what we saw.", "Bright green object flying fast northbound, north of University of Washington in SeattleI was driving northbound on Interstate-5, just south of the Ravenna exit, in the most left-hand lane at about 65 mph when I saw a single fast green light in the sky moving apparently from south to north.  It was to my right (east) and I saw it through my windshield for about 1.5 seconds.  (I have a compact &apos;92 Mazda pick-up).  My first impression was a very fast aircraft, which I rejected because the nav light should have been red and, given the brightness of the light, an aircraft with such a nav light would have been flying too low for such a fast speed.  I looked at the vehicles over in the northbound express lanes to my immediate left but there were none which could have been going so fast as to cause such a reflection on the interior of my windshield, nor did I see any obvious green lights on the vehicles.  To me, the object was decidedly green.  I also had the impression of a flat trajectory, and it left no trail.  I also had the impression that it was wider than just a point of light. This incident was tucked away in my mind until I heard a portion of Mr. Davenport&apos;s interview last Monday night on the radio and he mentioned this incident.  Unfortunately I didn&apos;t hear much of the interview, however, since I tuned in at the last sentence.  Incidentally, I was returning from a lecture and had not consumed any alcohol that Friday night (and I take no other mind-altering substances!).", "Black, shaped like a clover, slowly rotating, surrounded by what looked like heat waves.I was standing out by my pool and looking out over the city towards the ocean. I live some what on a hill. In the distance I noticed a black object coming in my direction, I continued watching the object for a while. At first I thought it was a helicopter, but I did not hear any noise. I continued to watch the object and it appeared to be shaped some what like a three leaf clover, as I was watching it, the object appeared to rotate a quarter of a turn every once in a while it also appeared to have some type of visual disturbance around it, like heat waves or a mirage. I continued to watch it and it started to accend, as it was accending it did not appear like the three leaf clover shape, but rather just a round object. it continued to rise into the sky until I could not percieve it any longer.", "Driving home at night, saw lights that I thought were landing lights of an airplane, stopped my car, lights didn&apos;t move, huge object.Driving home from town, I observed what I thought were landing lights from Air Force planes.  I lived within probally a mile or so of the landing pattern for Seymour Johnson AFB and have seen their planes numerous times. Also, my father was career Air Force and I have been around planes all of my life. To the point that I was able to identify certain types of planes just by hearing them, the distinct sounds they made. (Ex. F4&apos;s, C5A, C141&apos;s, F104 &amp; 105&apos;s to name a few) This particular evening I was about a mile from home, when I noticed &quot;these&quot; lights.  Being familiar with the area and what SJ landing pattern was, when I saw these lights, I thought to myself , &quot;these guys are really low&quot;.  I watched for about 30-45 seconds.  The lights appeared right at tree top level.  The closer I got to the lights, the lower the seemed to drop, now visibly seeing trees pass in front of these lights, evern at a distance. My thought at that point was, these guys are not going to make the runway.  From where I lived and where I saw these light and knowing where the runway was, they were just too low.  The runway was at least another mile to the east and they were at tree top level.  The first part of the road I was traveling on a straight away.  After about 30-45 seconds of watching this, the road turns to the right. No one on the roads at all that night. As I bear to the right towards my home, which is about 1/4 mile away now, I am now looking to my left, out of the drivers window, watching these light, which seem to bop from tree top level to below that and back up again.  At this point, I am really thinking that this plane is going to crash, these guys are in trouble and they are way too low.  Again, after I bear right and I&apos;m watching what I thought was an Air Force plane, I&apos;m only going about 20 mph, hardly taking my eyes off of this thing.  Also, there is a small wheat field off to my left on the other side of the road before the tree line. The tree line at this point where I am at is about 220-250 yards from the! road. As I&apos;m watching this thing, I use the term &quot;thing or lights&quot;, I notice something strange which at first I concluded was just some kind of optical illusion, because of the direction I am traveling now and the direction of the lights are traveling. I think SJ planes usually land in a west to easterly direction. I am now traveling west. As I&apos;m driving, I&apos;m glancing out of my window, the lights look like they are going in the same direction I am traveling.  I have my window down in the car as well, and after 150 or so feet, I begin thinking to myself, I should be hearing this thing as large as it is and it&apos;s seems to be going the same direction as me, this is really strange. So I pull my car to a stop. A complete stop in the middle of the road. I look out of my window and there slightly below tree top level is this huge craft of some type, now also, like me, stopped, not making a sound, no engine sound whatsoever, not moving, but clearly airborne and clearly a very large craft.  My best estimates on size were 300 ft long and about 40 foot high, multiple row of lights straight across for looked like each tier, three tiers. Anyway, I panicked after about 6-7 seconds of sitting there looking at this thing, punched the gas and flew home. I have had 2 other encounters/observations/sightings, one the very next night, at my house which was stange in itself and another about 10 years earlier when I lived in Alaska.

From my position in west central Ohio, a bright light appreared approx 35 degrees from horizon due north. Light appreared from pin point to become a very bright light. Brighter than any star visible. The light lasted for approx 30-40 seconds the faded away to a pin point, then vanished. On Monday the 28th I noted it, and thought hard about making a report.

They stayed a uniform distance from each other (150 feet?) while moving slowly across the sky for around 45 seconds, then disappeared.

At first I thought they were kites. After realizing how high up in the sky they were, I then thought they might be hot air baloons. One was shaped like a cigar and the other one like a snake. Neither of the objects were moving but were not close together. Stopping to look at the objects we noticed the cigar shaped one started to teeter totter. Both objects then started to travel to the west. I immediately called my brother and had him go outside to see if he could get a better look at them. He definitely could see them so we went to his house. Both objects stopped traveling again. The snake shaped object changed into a ball shape and then disappeared. The cigar shaped object stayed in place then started changing color. It changed from the original brown/black color to silver, blue, red, white, and then back to brown/black. It seemed to get bigger as if coming closer toward us. It then changed shape, zoomed in like it was being squished, and then zoomed out to it&apos;s cigar shape. It then turned and started traveling west a short distance, stopped, turned again and started traveling east a short distance, and stopped again. It then started rising up in to the clouds then came back out of the clouds. The sky was pretty clear except for a few clouds here and there. It then started traveling south for a short distance then went straight up unitl it was a pin dot. Looking through binoculars, we were able to find it for just a moment. The shape and color had changed again. It was now a very long cigar shape and was now red and white alternating stripes. At no time did either object make any sounds. We never saw the snake shaped object again and never saw the cigar shaped one either after that. My brother and I have witnessed UFOs and cattle mutilations before. We have also had huge circular burn marks in our fields at our farm many years ago. So we continue to look up at the skies. We are near an international airport so see planes when they are in their landing pattern. In relation to an airplane in the sky at when it comes in, both objects were at least 3 times the size in length and  probably 2 times the width.", "First I saw a bright white light in the sky, getting really bright, then turning red and hovering there for about 5 - 10 minutes", "Lighted red Chevron, meneuvering rapidly newar Atlantic Ocean, on Southern side of Ocean Parkway, Long Island.Early in the evening on July 20th, I was traveling with a friend Eastbound on Ocean Parkway, Long Island. Coincidentally, we were on our way to Robert Moses State Park for a sky observation session. The Southern side of Ocean Parkway faces the Atlantic Ocean, consisting of a relatively small amount of undeveloped land. We had just passed a sign stating &quot;Turtle Nesting Area next 6 miles.&quot; The beaches in the area are known for bird and animal nesting. Following, however, were a mass amount of &quot;Do Not Enter&quot; and &quot;No Stopping&quot; signs. Not unusual, but in a mass quantity for such a small area. As we continued, we noticed unmarked, darkly colored helicopters in the area, hovering over the Southern side near the ocean. It was about 20:00, and we assumed the helicopters were watching traffic conditions. Although, it was rather late for rush hour, and they displayed no markings. After leaving the observation session, we traveled Westbound on Ocean Parkway. As we approached the Jones Beach area, we noticed a small red object on the Southern side of the parkway. It appeared as a glowing red Chevron. The ends were a darker red, but the center was lit up as though there were a bright white bulb inside. I had no perspective relating to the height of the object. It appeared as though it could be very small, about 15 feet above the ground. However, it could have been further out, possibly above the ocean, causing it to look small from our standpoint. We pulled the car over to the side of the road. As we watched, the object moved almost like a kite. It moved back and forth rapidly over a small area, with no apparent travel direction. The object then dropped a white glowing bulb-like object, and continued to glow red, but duller. Shortly after, the object decsended, or fell, out of the air. The event lasted for a minute and a half, which is when we continued travel down the road. We decided to turn around and look for any other activity. We took the next U-turn to find a car pulled over on the Southern side of the parkway, facing East. There was a man inside, and he watched us as we passed him by. He didn&apos;t seem to be doing anything that would warrant pulling over. There was no interior light on, no ciggarette, no tire changing, no other passenger. He was gone the next time we drove by. After a couple of times passing the event area, we decided to head home. On our way, we saw many airplanes overhead. We looked carefully to make sure they weren&apos;t anything else. One such craft caught our attention. It had no obvious shape, as it was rather dark. We were travelling west on Ocean Parkway, and it appeared to be hovering, and moving in a general Southern direction. We would have assumed it to be a plane, but it would move, then hover, then change directions in a way that a regular plane would not be able to maneuver. Some information about the observers: I have never seen, or claimed to have seen a &apos;ufo&apos; before this account. That&apos;s not to say that I don&apos;t believe. I do, but if I see something unusual, I tend to force myself to believe something for the sake of being able to say I&apos;ve seen something. When I saw the helicopters, I didn&apos;t think much of it. When I saw the red object, I assumed it to be some kind of toy. Maybe a lit-up toy plane, or some kind of light-up kite. When the object fell out of it, I thought maybe that a light bulb fell out of the toy, so the user brought the toy down to fix it. When I saw the strange man, I figured he was pulled over for a reason. When I finally saw the last strange flying object, I decided there was something wrong. Taken separately, the occurences can be somewhat normal. Howver, when I put them together, the results fit together in a strange way, and suggest some abnormal events.", "At 7:30 pm, the sky was still blue when we saw 3 large separate red lights moving in a triangular formation in the northeastern sky.Approx. 7:30 pm we saw in the noth to northeastern sky,  what looked like a very large  very bright star. The sky was still blue. The over the next 15 minutes the &apos;star&apos; turned a deep yellowish or golden color and then to bright red and very slowly seemed to be shrinking. That&apos;s  when we realized it was not a star and that it was moving away from us. We got out our telescope and saw that the object was actually 3 bright red lights in a very symetrical  triangle formation.  You could see the sky backround through the center of the triangle. There appeared to be a white line that connected the three red lights.  We lost sight of it with the naked eye around 8:00 PM but we still saw it through the telescope for another 20 min.or so.  It was very high much higher than any plane could fly. We lost sight of it in the north/northeastern sky.  We couldn&apos;t really tell if was a single craft or 3 separate crafts. The single &apos;point&apos; light was not as bright or as red as the other two. It also appeared to be moving in a forward direction as if the  two brighter lights werte the front, and the single point being the rear. My husband said it didn&apos;t look to him as if the white line that connected (and surronded) the red lights,  actually met and touched at the single point end. Like it was a little bit open at the single point  end.   Each of the lights seemed to be the same distance from each other.  This was NOT one of ours!   It was too high. moved much to slowly for any of our aircraft, and didn&apos;t seem to show any type of exhaust coming from anywhere.  Which was why it was hard to tell which end was the front or back.((NUFORC Note:  High-altitude balloon))", "Five of f us witnessed a cigar-shaped wingless aircraft with a light shining inside of its windows hover over us..We were out in the front yard in the evening and all of a sudden a metal (aluminum color) cigar shaped object the size of a DC-3 aircraft hovered above us.  We could see square shaped lighted up windows (like in an airplane) and two wheels going around the aircraft.  There were no wings.  It stayed above us for a while and then a bright light along with a hissing sound shown out one side of the cigar shaped object.  The light started to form a bell-shaped object out of one end side of the craft.  Then it silently started to rise and disappeared high into the night sky.  We called the Bonham Airforce Base, but they said that they saw &quot;nothing&quot;.  The next day I read in the newspaper that a lady who was fishing at night saw a UFO with a &quot;bell shaped light&quot; coming out of one side. However, no one believed us so we said nothing.", "Absolutely stationary red light for 10 - 15 minutes, then abruptly took off towards the South.We were at home just north of downtown Tacoma, watching fireworks being set off in the Puyallup valley and East Tacoma, looking in a southeast direction. I became aware of a single red light, looking to be over Tacoma, and very high; MUCH higher that fireworks.  There is a lot of airplane traffic in this area in and out of Sea-Tac, so at first I just assumed it was an incoming aircraft.  A few minutes later I looked back and noticed it had not moved.  Incidently, it&apos;s position was lined up so that a point of one of the downtown buildings pointed directly towards it, so it was easy to see that it was not moving. I pointed it out to my husband; at this point it had been there about five minutes.  As we watched, we saw an outgoing plane fly near it, but the plane looked to be much higher, although it&apos;s hard to be sure of the light&apos;s altitude.  There were some light, high clouds that evening, and it was at about that elevation, as we could see them passing in front of the light. After being absolutely stationary for at least 10 minutes, perhaps 15, it took off at a fairly fast rate of speed, (faster than air traffic) towards the South and disapeared into the clouds (or the light went out).  I tried to view the object through our very crappy binoculars, but it just looked like a steady, red light.  When it took off it may have started blinking, or it may have been the cloud layer; hard to tell.((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports for this time and date.  PD))", "2 red lights appear to be sitting above Gilbert, Az for 10 min2 red lights seemed to be sitting in the sky southeast of us,(Gilbert, Az) appearing to be in the flight path of SkyHarbor Airport. One stayed in pretty much the same position while the other moved down and then slowely circled under the first. A couple of planes came towards them, then they seemed to close the distance between them. The higher one then seemed to shoot something out of the top of it, then flashed as it dropped rapidly and blinked out. The remaining one then dimmed for a couple of seconds, then from our view, a plane seemed to come close and changed direction to avoid it. It then blinked out. I recorded almost 10 min. of these lights. This is the second time I have recorded these lights around the same time. No moon out at the time ( or it was behind clouds ). One also seemed to have another light (small white) above and to the left of the higher red light.

At first I just thought they were from choppers in the area. There had been reports of livestock being mutilated in that area, so I figured they were ranchers checking out their stock. That is until they started moving vertically at a speed I knew wass impossible for a chopper to achieve. I pointed this out to my girlfriend, and she grabbed the flashlight and started flashing it in their direction. When one set of the lights went straight up and out of sight my girlfriens started hollering &apos;look baby, they&apos;re UFO&apos;s, at which time I freaked and grabbed for the light. In the time it took for me to grab the light away from her, one of the set of lights came to within a mile of us,(they were probably 20 miles away to begin with) hovered for a few seconds, took off to the West  and was gone.", "Explosion in the air.I was at my neighbors discussing some work I am doing for him.  It was dark.  Three of us were satnding in a circle when my neighbor shouted, &quot;Look!&quot;  He pointed over my shoulder and when I turned I saw two brilliant flashes of light above the clouds in rapid succession.  Then some smaller orange lights radiated from the center of the flashes and rapidly faded as if an explosion had occured.  About one minute later we heard the explosion very plainly.  My told me they saw an object fly to the spot before the explosion but I did not turn around in time to see it, I only witnessed the explosion.  I called and reported it to Tri Cities Regional Airport safety line. After the explosion we decided to go see if anything had fallen out of the sky but were sidetracked by small orange/white or gold lights flying slowly.  We only saw one at a time but they (it) would disappear and then reappear somewhere else.  I am not totally convinced they were not airplane landing lights, but this area just does not have that kind of air traffic volume.", "From a distance of 3 miles,  I saw two silver colored suacer-shaped objects engaged in aerobatics  before disappearing into a cloudThe two objects I witnessed were silver in color and saucer-shaped.  The weather that day was mostly sunny with clouds at about 3000 to 4000ft. I first noticed them flying about two miles south of Tacoma Narrows Airport runway 17.  Both of the saucer-shaped craft were flying together but looked as though they were engaged in a &apos;dog-fight&apos; because they seemed to be chasing each other and doing aerobatics while ascending and descending rather quickly.  I would estimate their speed at between 400 and 450 mph.  At that time there were no aircraft in their immediate vicinity. Throughout the duration of the sighting both objects seemed to stay in a very small area, perhaps no larger then a square mile.  As I watched the two objects, I knew from my experience in aviation that they were not any type of aircraft  I&apos;ve ever seen.  I can identify almost any military, commercial, or private aircraft that could be found flying in this country and what I saw was like nothing I&apos;ve ever seen.  I should mention that at the time I was working at the airport fueling planes and for the last fifteen years years I&apos;ve been interested in aviation and I know what kind of flight characteristics a small plane or even a military or commercial jet can do.  And the way the way these objects were flying tells me that they weren&apos;t any conventional aircraft.  I should also mention that the objects made no sound.  And finally, I lost sight of the objects when they both flew into a large cloud which tells me they weren&apos;t any type of bird or remote-controlled airplane because of the height of the clouds and my viewing distance.  When they disappeared they were at least 3 miles away so I would estimate their size at between 50 and 75 feet in diameter.", "Three points of light, flying formation, demonstrating control of inertia and momentum.I was on the roof of our home (most houses in Athens at that time had flat roofs)with my Dad observing the stars with a small telescope. My Dad noticed what appeared to be a spacecraft in low orbit, illuminated by the sun which had just set. I saw it, then we both saw a second spacecraft (both pinpoints of light) &quot;below&quot; it, or in formation, abeam it and maybe 100 miles &lt;?&gt;to the side of the other. We watched these for a few minutes, tracking our heads in the direction of travel, when we noticed with our peripheral vison a third light approaching from the opposite, and slightly below, other direction. They abruptly stopped when they met to form a perfect equilateral triangle. Then they paused, and moved off in a third direction. A short time later a family friend screeched to halt in front of our house, asked if we saw it and repeated our observation adding that he had had a yard full of people who also saw it.", "Burning object spotted over the Las Vegas stripI initially commented on this &quot;object&quot; being the moon, but partially covered by some sort of cloud or something, until we saw the &quot;object&quot; getting brighter.  At that point, my first instinct was that it was an airplane blowing up in the sky.  I work for an airline and thought it had to be a plane of some sort blowing up in the sky.  The &quot;object&quot; appeared to burn for a short period of time (5-15 seconds) and then it appeared to completely burn out, leaving 2 trails of smoke behind.  We saw nothing after this.  I have heard nothing of the sighting on the local or national news, radio, newspaper or in conversation.", "Black TentThis file is public information and available for immediate download at: ((URL deleted)) --- On Saturday August 19, my girlfriend ((name deleted)) and I drove into Lake Havasu State Park to find a campsite for the night. The past week on our vacation we had been car camping and traveling from our home in San Diego to El Paso Texas, North to Albuquerque, West for two nights and one day at the Grand Canyon and back to San Diego. Lake Havasu was hot. So hot, that night I could not go inside the tent with ((name deleted)), but layed on a picnic bench on our campsite with only a pair of swim trunks on. The picnic bench had a metal top with holes, coated with a thick lacquer. I woke after some time and noticed a large black tent not more than 20 feet from me. I layed on the bench with my eyes half open wondering how someone could have set up this tent without waking me. As I layed there I was aware of quite a lot of activity around me, and in the area. Around dusk another group had set up their camp several sites distance from us, so I assumed they were just a bunch of happy campers milling around the area. At least they were not playing music or talking, or ((name deleted)) would be having a fit. The tent was black. So black, I would call it theatre black. I was thirsty so I woke a little more, sat on the bench facing the tent and puzzled over it. It stood approximately 20 feet tall. The top came together in a pyramid, tight woven fishnet, high tech material. The base was approximately 30 feet square, the sides were not vertical, so the top was a ten foot pyramid with a 30 foot base. I walked over to my car and opened the hatch to get a plastic gallon jug of water. I took a long drink of the hot water, as much as I could stand, and closed the hatch. I figured I had woken my girlfriend in our tent a few feet from the car, so I asked her if she was awake. She did not reply. I figured she was giving me the silent treatment because she was ((angry)). She had been complaining about all the noise in the area, and earlier woke me when she said I was playing my radio. It was someone on a boat on the lake, so I told her so and went back to sleep. There was a lot of activity around me although I couldn&apos;t see anyone. At night I carry a flashlight. Near a bush where I heard footsteps, I shined the light on it. I saw nothing and the movement stopped. Someone might ask, &quot;weren&apos;t you afraid?&quot; For some reason I wasn&apos;t. Camping in remote areas can get kind of spooky at night, thinking you are hearing something outside the tent. I tend to feel a little more secure in state campgrounds. I have night vision and a gun. Both were in the tent. But because of my girlfriends bitchy attitude I didn&apos;t go in our tent, risking waking her. I wanted to walk nearer the large black tent, but I am cautious about respecting other people&apos;s camp. I moved around our area to get a better view of it, the entire time sensing movement and hearing footsteps in the hard gravel. I went back to the park bench and layed down on to as I did before. Soon I was asleep. I woke again. The tent was still there, the same activity near us. I asked Mary if she was awake and I saw her flashlight in our tent. I knew she had looked at her watch, so I asked her what time it was. She said it was 1:30. The park bench was very uncomfortable and it seemed to be a little cooler. I thought it might be cool enough to sleep in our tent now, so I opened it and went in, layed down on our air mattress and went to sleep thinking I would wake early to get a better look at the large black tent at the campsite across from ours. I awoke just as the eastern horizon was lightening. This time of year, it gets bearable at about 3 am. However I swear I can feel the heat coming on about 15 minutes before sunrise. I woke my girlfriend and she agreed we would break camp. I opened our tent. The large black tent was gone. The camp area was silent. As we were tearing down our campsite and packing my car, I told her of the tent and the activity. She agreed there was a lot of activity in the area, so much that she had put earplugs so she could sleep, yet we heard no talking or music in the campground. We both walked onto the campsite where the black tent was. I wanted to verify the site was large enough for a tent the size I had seen. It was. We searched for impressions in the hard gravel, although the gravel was so hard you could park a loaded semi truck on the site without leaving an impression. We saw no evidence. --- East of Gallup New Mexico is a natural formation called Church Rock. There is a state campground there, Red Rock State Park. We hiked as close as we could get to the Church Rock formation, and as we were returning to our campsite we came across this interesting footprint: ((URL deleted))", "It was a blue-white fireball, with no tail or sparks.It was a fireball; saw it at the end of its trajectory.  No sparks, no tail.  Blue-white in color, between 1/8 and 1/4 inch using arm outstreched system. Trajectory was South to North.  1/3 the speed of a normal meteor.  No audible sounds at this distance.

We saw a light and just figured it to be an airplane.  As we came closer we could tell it was no airplane.  It had 4 lights, blue and green colors.  It was a black color but not a dark black, it was almost grey.  It was very low, maybe 1000 feet off the ground. It was triangular, perfect no curves at all.  Moved very slow and the lights on the craft made it obvious that it was in fact no airplane.  It made no sound what so ever.  The weather was dry, it was barely sprinkling and we had clear sight of it.  The lights from the craft were just so bright it lit up the area around the craft.", "It was like nothing I had ever seen before.I was about 9 yrs. old, playing in my back yard. I looked up over the house at about a 45 degree angle and saw a craft. It was like nothing I had seen before or since. It was multi-facited and it seemed like there were antennas sticking out. There was no sound, lights anything. It was huge. I watched it come out of the west and at first thought it was an airplane. It left no trail and finally stopped. I guess it was about as big as my thumbnail if I held my arm outstretched. I was daylight. I can only guess at the time. The sun did not reflect off of it. It was a slate gray color. After a short time it turned back to the west and slowly left my sight.", "On my bike when i saw a shiny silver oval not in motion and when i came out of some trees it was gone.I was riding my bike on Hickory Road in Schnecksville. I looked up and to one side and saw a silver oval shaped object not moving from what i saw.

Van in front of us is swerving a little so I decrease my speed as by this time we are on bridge ramp. We wonder are they watching it, too. It flys over us and we watch as it flys over the 2 other radio towers that are on Pace which intersects bridge. I noticed just a little bit of static. This bridge has a good deal of pedestrian traffic, so I noticed a mother and son running across bridge most people don&apos;t run across this bridge as it is very scenic.

It also pulsated dim to bright red and then white.  There also appeared to be a rythm to the pulsating.

It was silent and the wind had died down. Completely calm and the blue light followed me as I walked like it was leading me to it.

Giant 3 foot high spides in my friends back yardThis is not necisarly a UFO report but I know that something VERY strang happened in this experience and I have a feeling that Me, my brother and my 2 friends were abducted back when I was the age of 5 and 10. I don&apos;t know if your interested in this stroy but I am trying to tell as many people about this because I KNOW that there is something happened on that day. I don&apos;t expect a responce from you or anything but maybe this can help some people. I don&apos;t know exactly when this happened but sometime between that age of 5 and 10 (I am 30 now) Me, my brother and my 2 friends were sitting in the back yard of the friends house on their swingset. Behind thier house is a small field with a path that ran behind the houses all the way down the street and into the park at the end. After the field was a 4 foot wire fence seperaing the houses from the raliway property. After the fence is a small hill built as a noise protection from the traintracks. It was sometime in the summer I dont&apos; know the day or the month but it was about mid afternoon.  The 4 of us were on my friends swingset just talking and goofing around when along the path in back of the yard came a kid our age. To this day I can swear that I knew who this person was and we all knew him at the time of this story but I canot remember his name or who he was. He came up to us and asked us if we wanted to see some giant spiders. Being kids of course we all did so we followed this kid down the path almost all the way to the park. About 2 or 3 houses before the park he stopped in the path and pointed to the 4 foot wire fence. there on the fence was a GIANT spider. At least I remember it being a spider but the thing is it only had 4 legs that I can remember. And when I say GIANT spider I mean this thing was almost the size of the whole fence!!! So it had to be at LEAST 3&apos; tall. Now you may think I&apos;m crazy or I&apos;m making this up but I remember that spider clear as day and I&apos;ll remember it till the day I die. It was colored yellow and black  sort of tiger stipped. It had a big body. The legs of this thing were very long. All four of them. Probably about 18&quot; to 24&quot; long each and they were skinny. I do not remember any joints in the legs though. Now you can say someone was probably playing a joke but the year was approximatley 1974 so I doubt you could find anything this realistic looking to play a joke with and not only that I remember one of the spiders moving. Very slowly. That&apos;s about all I remember about the insident. I don&apos;t remember going home that day and I don&apos;t remember ever seeing that kid again, ever. But that&apos;s not all. I don&apos;t think any of us talked about this insident for a while to each other or to anyone else but when we did start telling people about this Me and my brothers friend always remembered the spiders being 3&apos; tall but my brother and my friend always remembered the spiders being maybe 4 or 5 inches tall (a big spider but not GIANT spiders) I think this disagreement is what caused us to stop talking about this insident altogether. But I still remember certain times growing up when I&apos;d see a big spider (there are yellow and black big spiders in my town and they are big), I&apos;d always say, that&apos;s nothing ( size wise) and I&apos;d remember the GIANT spiders. Now years later I started rembering this insident again and I asked my brother about it but he doesn&apos;t remember anything about this not even seeing smaller spiders. That&apos;s about all for now. I hope this fits into yoru criteria somehow and you can take the time to examine this insident. I thank you for your time and understanding.

I handed my wife the phone and as soon as she started dialling her sisters number the object gradually diverted its direction away from us and toward the south. As the phone conection was made the orange &quot;orb&quot; began to move in to a cloud bank that was South and East of us. Unforunatly, her sister was notat home, and her niece ansewred the phone who was not willing to look out the window and was only &quot;mildly amused&quot;. Eventually the orb disappeared after moving in and out of the clouds as it slowly moved sout.", "Unusual air trafficThe other night a friend of mine and I were leaving the Bothell YMCA around 2100 hours and looked over in the sky because we noticed an unusually bright light.  It looked like a regular airplane, then we noticed 2 more.  They didn&apos;t appear to be moving for a minute, but then they started moving and seemed to be circling an area.  It could have been anything at all, nothing unusual, but we felt that there was a story behind it.  So we grabbed some taco bell and set out on the highway to find a way to get closer to what these &quot;planes&quot; were circling.  We belive we saw a military aircraft (but not positive) because it seemed to be still in mid-air, then just took off at great speed.  Not your regular passenger jet.  Anyways, we were going down the on-ramp to get onto 405 southbound from Bothell, and what do you know, there was a PACSAT van right there, with a satellite, stopped on the side of the road.  We passed by him, then he started up his van and came onto the highway as well.  I slowed down my car to let him pass me because we thought we would follow him for a while, which we did, and he was driving pretty quickly (over the speed limit), but he went too far South for us to venture out any further at that hour.  We headed back home.  We believe that something was going on somewhere near Woodinville/Kirkland/Redmond area.  We haven&apos;t seen anything in the news since!  The next evening near the same time, we noticed quite a bit of air traffic near the same area.  Slow moving &quot;planes&quot; that would suddenly increase in speed, but circle the area.  I wish that someone else would have seen too.((NUFORC Note:  We received no other reports from this area of Seattle for this time and date.  The area is in the approach/departure area for Sea-Tac Airport, so it is not clear how &quot;military&quot; aircraft could be operating in this area when normal operations of commercial traffic are taking place.  We will attempt to inquire of the witness what a PACSAT van with a satellite is.

Well, anyway, as I sat there,  I got this strange feeling as if the room was moving slightly from side to side.  I called my dog &quot;hambone&quot; to come into the room b/c I didn&apos;t want him to be frightened.  I sat there for a moment stroking his belly watching his leg move back and forth such as dogs do.  I then noticed outside the window there was  a faint glow about the sky so I decided to investigate.  Upon looking out the window, I saw what looked to be like a ball of light hovering approxmately 3 inches from the tops of my trees in the back yard.  It was real wierd.  I tried to convince myself that it wasn&apos;t real but there was just something real eeery about it.  I think what or whoever it was must of saw me looking at it b/c about that time, the overhead light went out and just as fast as I saw the strange object, it was gone.

Whne I did I saw a bright light almost directly overhead but it was moving at a very fast speed. I said to my wife look at that light it us really moving quickly. Since it was dark out it was difficult to determine its altittude but I would say it was extremely high up (maybe 50,000 ft or so). It traveled almost in a straight line moving west to east-southeast. The light was steady &amp; did not flash as an airplane would. There wasn&apos;t any noise accompanying the movement. The sighting lasted approx. 20-30 seconds &amp; the light dis-appeared as it moved towards the horizon/tree line of my neighborhood.

It moved spinning its backwards directed narrow end.Just the day after lunar eclipse of december 1999. Weather clear. I was adjusting a portable telescope(some 5&quot;diam.)on the terrace of my 3rd floor apartment, and focused it to the moon, that was rising to approximetely 30 deg. As soon as I located the left inferior arc of the satellite, my attention was attracted to a black, tiny pear or tear shaped object that moved in &quot;front&quot; of it with a peculiar balancing spinning straight displacement that mantained the narrow end backwards. This lasted a blur. Assuming the image was inverted, the actual direction would be an ascending 45 deg. right to left as seen against the brightness of the moon.

We were facing southeast looking southeast on the patio at a local restaur 21:44 CST.  glancing at the sky above the the adjacent table, I noticed the craft heading west. The sun had not set all the way so the craft could be seen fairly well. Its texture didn&apos;t appear any differant than the materials made for modern aircraft,and not unlike typical flying saucer materials.The size of the craft was misleading because it seemed to big to be that low in the sky. My mind could not make out it relationship to it distance in respect to its size.. It seemed to me for an instant first a small plane seen upclose, , then seemed to appear like a helicopter, probably my mind making up for the differance in size to as were it should have been.

The light was not the light typical of lights on planes but was more akin to a white flash, white hot like a welders torch. The white flash was produced in an area rectangular in shape, with even distribution of the white light. The craft skipped forward at high speed and disappeared,Hyperspace style. As its engines ignited I shouted UFO and my associate witnessed the speed increase, skipping, and disappearance.

But no it would have landed by now. It just floated there........... The longer I sat there , the more I became fascinated with it. Before I knew it I could see the sun rising in the distance.

I was driving down one of the major roads that connects Ft Oglethorpe to Ringgold.  I noticed a ball of light moving across the sky...it was too fast and low to be a plane, and too slow to be a falling star. I watched the light move across the sky, it started to disappear behind some tree tops, but made a huge U-turn back toward me. As it turned, I noticed it had 2 lights on it, so I thought maybe it was some kind of plane. I ignored it and kept going, I had to yield to change roads, so I watched the sky again to see if it was still there. When I looked at it again, I saw it alot closer and it had 3 white colored lights, two larger ones on the sides, and one in the middle, a little higher up than the side ones, it also had a small red flashing light in between the three white ones. It was hovering in the air above a house while I was stopped. I turned onto the other road and hightailed it home.  I kept looking back to see if it was anywhere to be seen...but I didn&apos;t see it.  As I neared my driveway, I put my turn signal on,and came to a stop, I looked up and the aircraft was directly above my driveway.

It was close to the horizon. It was a bright yellowish/golden coloured light. The intensity of the light varied - at its brightest it far brighter than the brightest. It appeared to be flashing its light sometimes. I thought, at first, that it must be an aircraft. Initially it was not moving - so it was not an aircraft. Then it started moving in different directions - sometimes in a wavy fashion. It moved sideways, up, down and the motion seemed random. Many time it just became stationery. Suddenly it dissappeared.

I was doing almost 80 mph the whole way and the object appeared to move in tandem with my car speed, maintaining approximately the same angle until I got to Albuquerque.  I stopped at a bookstore and had the manager come out and look at it.  It was entirely motionless then, translucent silver, and could have been a balloon.

It was a whitish light just like a star and was pretty far away. I would imagine that when I started watching it, it was almost straight up overhead. Anyway, after it started moving again it seemed to arc upward a bit and then descend again. Then it stopped a second time.

Object in cloud hovers/manuevers then lightening bolt strikes at same location.The following was taken from a post I often send to alt.ufo.reports: I only have one story to share but it has kept me thinking for about seven years now.  A sighting can be very informative if the observer notes not only what was seen but also the circumstances under which it was seen. I use to work for an amusement park in Valencia, California called Six Flags Magic Mountain. I was a senior in high school at the time and worked the summers and weekends (during school). This weekend the forecast called for thunderstorms and a high probability of showers. That Saturday I was on my lunch break when I sat in my usual quiet spot away from the crowds. It overlooked the intersection of the I-5 freeway (north/south) and the 126 (east/west). My view was to the east and toward a small range of mountains on the other side of the I-5. The mtn range is about 500 feet in height. At its base now sits an extension to the original industrial center (at the time a small plot of crops was growing at this particular location). At lunchtime there was a thunderstorm moving from north to south. It had already passed where I was but I could still see the lightning in the distance and the sky was entirely overcast. About 15 minutes after I sat down I had finished what I was eating and looked out at the freeway, at the range beyond, and then to the clouds. I was just passing the time I had away from my work when I saw something moving in the lower layer of the cloud formations. It was situated across the freeway and just above the mtn range (about 200 ft above the hill&apos;s peak). At first I thought it was a helicopter even though I didn&apos;t see a tail or rotor.  It was in nearly zero visibility because of the clouds. It was moving from north to south as though it were following the storm but from a safe distance (or so it seemed). It was inching southward (left to right), but at a speed non-constant and different from that of the clouds around it (this is probably why it caught my eye). It was a grayish tone (maybe metallic), elliptical in shape, maybe 25-35 feet in length, and had no distinguishing extrusions. If it had any markings on its surface I couldn&apos;t see them from this distance (it still seemed close). Patches of cloud would make it appear and disappear over what was to be a 2-3 minute interval. I watched almost unblinking at what I couldn&apos;t identify. I don&apos;t know why but the thought of a balloon or a blimp never came to mind and it could have been either if not for one last awesome maneuver. I might also add that the only sounds I heard included the occasional yell from someone on a ride some distance away, a light thundering to the south, and the hum of the traffic on the I-5. After 2-3 minutes of this, the craft shot up into the clouds like it had been attached to some long extended rubber band that I couldn&apos;t see. The speed was so fast (and the fact that the craft was already nearly engulfed by the clouds surrounding it) that, had I blinked, I would have certainly missed this last maneuver. There was no deformation in the craft that I noticed in the 2-3 minutes that I watched it. What I did see however was the deformation of the cloud as the movement of air suddenly displaced it. This was the one key piece of information that convinced me what I saw was actually there. The maneuver convinced me that what I was dealing with was not a craft of any kind I had ever seen. I thought this maneuver was the last of this sighting and that I&apos;d never see anything this unusual again. I was wrong. I immediately looked at my watch hoping to record the exact date and time of the sighting, but all I could manage to remember was the placement of the second hand and only for a minute at that. This is why. I continued to look in awe over the freeway for some hope of an answer. Sixty seconds after the craft had shot into the clouds a small bolt of lightning (I couldn&apos;t even hear it at that distance) struck EXACTLY where the craft (above the hill&apos;s peak) had been situated.  I was sure this was no coincidence and I&apos;ve thought about this sighting (the only sighting I&apos;ve ever had) for years. I&apos;m 25 and a student of architecture. My interests include design, models, computers, and tennis. I don&apos;t normally follow UFO sightings but I do post this story once in a while. I&apos;ve lived in New Jersey for two years and in California the rest. I don&apos;t have a religion and I&apos;m not superstitious. I like to keep an open mind, but I&apos;m often skeptical.  This was just a story for others to read and I hope you found it interesting. I don&apos;t expect I&apos;ll ever see anything like this again. UPDATE (8/28/00): I decided to hike up to the top of the hill to see for myself what interest anyone would have with this particular location.  From the top of the hill I could see both the I-5 and 126 extending into the distance.  I could see one of Southern Calif. Edison&apos;s power stations (a whole bank of power line towers), the Rye Canyon Industrial Center, Six Flags Magic Mountain and basically a lot of new development.  I also found the well (a Wayside Equivalent Zone Unit) that was recently installed and which I had mentioned above.  It turns out Southern Calif. Gas Co. has a plant (and a few dozen wells) on the other side of the mtn range.  I think Southern Calif. Gas Co. probably owns the land this craft was hovering over.  I spent about 30 minutes on that hill and saw a lot of aircraft flying right over head (mostly civilian but also some military).  Both Burbank and Santa Paula airports aren&apos;t terribly far.  There has also been some controlled burning of brush on the site (typical of dry brush areas).", "Blue-ish fireball speeds past the University of Memphis in winter of 1993-1994.A friend of mine and I were sitting on the curb of Central Ave at the northern end of the campus of the University of Memphis around 3 or 3:30 am in either November or December of 1993 (although it could be early &apos;94--I do know that it was pretty cold so it was sometime in the winter).  No one was driving on the street or near the area we were at (virtually directly north of were the new university library is)--the area north of the campus is almost entirely residential with no bars, pool halls, or Greek houses, plus most students who are out at the strip are on the other side of campus and usually start to trickle home around 2am.  Essentially, the area my friend and I were in was totally deserted despite the fact that Central is a large 5 lane road when it passes the university. The sighting began when my friend asked for a cigarette: as I held one out to him, he looked in the general direction of my hand (towards the east).  Just above my hand, he later said, and down the street about a mile and a half he saw something headed our way and said &quot;what&apos;s that?&quot;  I turned and looked and saw a blue-ish fireball about a block and a half down the street headed in our direction.  This fireball was maybe 3 or 4 feet in diameter and was travelling pretty fast (approximately 40 to 50 mph) down what looked like the center line of the street.  When it passed above and in front of us, we noticed that it was at a heighth about 5 or 6 feet above the telephone poles that support a traffic light set up for students crossing the street (no cross street). As it passed, the fireball made a kind of &quot;hushed&quot; whooshing sound: similar to that of a cardboard tube when one swings the tube like a bat, but very subdued.  Also, the fireball had a short tail of blue-ish flame (about 5 feet), but left no smoke trail behind it.  The fireball zipped by us and continued down the street to the west until it was out of sight. I&apos;m not sure if what we saw was ball lightning or something different and possibly more exotic, but I thought it might be worthwhile to let somebody know about this just to see if anyone else saw the same thing...I find it hard to believe that my friend and I were the only people to have seen this thing.", "We were camping in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area on Basswood Lake near Ely, Minnesota.  That particular evening we fished until 11:00pm and returned to camp  to  build a fire.  My little brother had went to sleep in the tent while myself and our other couterpart went to the point to observe the stars.  We admired the scenery for a while when we noticed a star that appeared to be descending from the sky.  It was a blue diamond shaped object that seemed to be falling from the sky.  We became aprehensive when the object began to descent twoard us.  As the object became closer I was contemplating my escape, which would be impossible through the enourmous amout of dense forest and underbush however, my main concern was my little brother asleep in the tent 100 feet behind us.  We said if the object made it to the island 350 yards infront of us we were going to make a break for it.  All of a sudden the object make a complete 90 degree turn and headed directly north at a speed that I can not even estimate.  Immediately after we seen this phenomenon we decided to turn in for the night. To this day my counterpart and I still have the same exact recollection of that particular evening. I was wondering if any of the other campers on Basswood at that time had observed the same experience.  I know that the object flew direclty over another capsite on the adjourinig point beore heading north to Canada.  I am reluctant to submit my personal information for fear of riducule and to protect my professional reputatuion. This was second of my sighings while camping as a teenager near Clinton Lake, Lawrence Kansas in the late 80&apos;s a myself and a friend observed an object that would split into several smaller objects and would all of a sudden reapperar from all directions to form one object for a multi hour duration.((NUFORC Note:  Anonymous report.))", "three red lights forming a triangle. no sound. drifted . turned into a small white light dissapeared left a stream of sparkswhen we got to the beach at the bay my wife said  &quot;is that a sattelite&quot;? I looked up and realized it was 10 times brighter than any star I&apos;ve seen and it drifted very slowly( no sound). Upon closer look it was three red lights in the shape of a triangle at least 30K feet high. It was clear against the backing stars that it was moving VERY slow...we did&apos;nt see the begining but after about 15 minutes the lights began to pulse and fade. it then became one white light bursting into what appeared to be a stream of sparks like a fire works display would. This was no fire work display. I am a thirty five year old business owner and i have NEVER seen anything like this.There were six of us on that beach and we all agreed it was nothing we had ever seen. One guy tried his hardest to explain it away but after about ten minutes che gave in also.", "Unmoving horizontal formation of about 8 very bright lights in the West from Indian Lake low to the horizonI was camping for the week with my family and my friends family on Island campsite #17 on Camp Island on Indain Lake, which is a State campround.  We were sitting around the fire after dinner.  It had been dark for about an hour.  My friend called my attention to some lights in the West that he had been watching for perhaps 20 seconds.  I turned around and saw perhaps 8 bright lights just above the horizon to the West.  They looked like aircraft landing lights on a plane within 5 miles as they were lined up horizontally, but they jsut hung there and I had never heard of an airplane with that many landing lights and they went out after perhaps 10 seconds which is also not typical of landing lights.  My friend said that he had watched it for about 20 seconds before he thought to tell me and that the lights had been bright as &quot;welding arc&quot; and had maintained the same formation.  We also noticed that there were three columns of diffuse light coming from ground level and pointing straight up, also in the West.  Other members of our party witnessed these and thought they looked like Northern Lights except they did not waver at all and seemed to be more like beams coming from the ground like weal search lights.  These remained for maybe 10 minutes.  Perhaps a minute or two after the formation disappeared, it reappeared in about the same place although in a more red to yellow color and not so much in line.  They again stayed put. This lasted maybe 20 seconds before going out.  We watched closely after that and soon saw very tiny reddish dots, again in the West, that were zipping about in what seemed to be a random pattern.  My guess is about 10 of these.  We watched for quite a while and didn&apos;t see anything after that. This incident really spooked my wife as she had, without any provocation (such as UFO stories, sightings, or anything at all related) reported to me early Wednesday morning that she had a &quot;dream&quot; that seemed incredibly real that at about 5AM she heard a low pulsing sound above the tent and subsequent to that felt some kind of &quot;beam&quot; pass through her body.  It scared her to death and she tried to call out to me but could not move or make a noise.  She reported that all she remembers after that is waking and remembering the experience and she was VERY frightened.  Nobody else saw or heard anything and we all joked with her about it and asked if the spacemen &quot;did anything sexual to her&quot; (ala the movie &quot;Independence Day&quot;).  In retrospect the coincidence gave us pause. Fueling at the boat dock Thursday morning, my friend asked the kid pumping gas if anyone saw anything strange in the sky the prior night.  He siad that he was in the Village of Indian Lake and saw the same formation to the West over the golf course. On Sunday, I mentioned the incident to my uncle who lives in Indian Lake and he said that the same thing was seen in the West by his friends that lived on the lake.  He&apos;s going to talk with them and get more detail to send to me. I don&apos;t have any idea what the lights were, but Rome Air Force base does manuevers in the area of the Lake and I know we have a big year for solar activity.  I be pleased to hear from others who witnessed this incident. P.S.  This report form presupposes sighting of an &quot;object&quot;.

They were slightly above the hills in a clear sky. As I watched, the lights alternated fading out and then popping on again in a different position.  The  original formation was about a 20 degree arc. I grabbed my binoculars and ran out on the porch, focused on them and they seemed to be partial circles of light with one straight line  coming out of each. But far away, even with magnification still about the size of a pencil eraser. As they each faded, it was like they got  farther away, very rapidly. Seemed to be some faint &quot;vapor  trails&quot; drifting off of them, but not like any plane I&apos;ve ever seen.  Finally it was just two, then one, then that one &quot;receded&quot;.

It was a noiseless slow moving (horizontally) low flying object. From the bottom of it a very-very bright beam of blue light  was emnating (diameter of the origin of light was about 6 inches).  That divergent beam of cosmic blue light was reaching up to the ground. We stopped as we thought soon the blue light would be upon us.  But then suddenly this thing switched off lights.  It immediately disappeared and the trace it left behind clearly looked as though it suddenly changed its flight direction and went vertically upwards at tremendous speed. Most surprising thing was the the beam of light which it was emnating remained still above our apartment complex for about 5 minutes and slowly faded away. I was excited and stunned because the whole thing didn&apos;t look natural. I immediately calledup a friend of mine. He came over to our house and we chatted for quite some time about this. We tried tuning into TV news channels but couldn&apos;t find anything about this. At around midnight I searched into web for UFO related links and found that lot of people had reported this strange sighting at approximately the same time from Palo Alto, Los angles, San Diago etc..... I also reported this on that web site.  Responses have started coming in. I don&apos;t know what it was but I&apos;ll never be able to forget it.............", "A craft was above my car.

There were blue flashing lights all round the car - the lights were in triangular shape when they hit the ground (i think) there was probably 100 individual lights - they were flashing. There was no sound when it arrived so i didnt realise at first what was going on. Then the whole thing moved off making a slight high pitched screach and a big bass rumble - almost like it was a tank moving. The craft was no more than 100 feet above me. It moved relatively slowly - i panicked to get out of the area in the car. It flew right across the valley (flying over the reservoir i was next to). I drove along the road at the side of the reservoir because it was the only way out - hence, i followed the craft until it flew out of sight - the whole sighting may have been 3 minutes - who knows? I was petrified. The craft was disc/saucerr shaped and had lights all round the centre of it - probably 100 lights round the edge of it. I only heard a sound from it as it movwed from my car.

I assumed it was an airplane until I saw two other airplanes flying in the vacinity, one in front of the object and one behind the object and realized they were moving but this light was not, and then it flashed, like a reflecting flash, but much brighter than any reflections off the other two planes in the area, and then I noticed it was somewhat like a flat oval shape and silvery and pure white when it flashed, very clear and pure color(silver and white) compared to the two airplanes in the area....it looked like it was hovering(stationary) flashed two lights towards me and then vanished...it could not have gone behind any clouds because it was a crystal clear sky...and the sun was still fairly high in the sky.

Gone a minute later.Me and my family were coming home one night and saw what looked like a string of lights that curved around on one side. We stopped the car, and watched it for a period of time. The object seemed to hover about the skyline of Little Rock. At first I thought it was the top of a building, but being an amateur Ufologist I looked more closely. I realized that this couldn&apos;t have been a builing cause it was higher than the tallest building in Little Rock. My little brother thought it was a blimp, but it wasn&apos;t even moving at at all. And since when do blimps have a string of lights arounf them??? We left after a minute or 2 and went home. I came back a minute later considering I only lived a couple blocks away, from where we saw it. And it was gone.

I have always looked at the colors.. dead, white, blue white and sparkly. One of the stars appeared to be slowly moving and we verified this .. It was moving across the milky way, we figured from NW to SE... based on where we were facing. After awhile it slowed and stopped.. made a right turn and moved in that direction for a short while, then moved back to the track, continuing on till it reached straight up and then it stopped ,,waited and then a very long beam of light shone.. Then it slowly moved some more ,stopping occasionally and then another &apos;star&apos; on the same path started moving toward the first one and it too had a light. The stars moved towards each other and then both turned on their lights, which touched, then they moved together where they did not move again for an hour . We stopped watching.

It moved west, horizontally for three or four seconds.  The area it occupied began below Phecda (Ursa Major) and moved slightly past Canes Venatici.  The shape was hard to describe.  At first, I thought it was a plane.  My neighborhood lies below a flight path so there is always a lot of air traffic, especially at night.  I do, however, know the difference between a plane and something that is not.  This object was about twice the size of an airplane and three times as bright.  The shape seemed spherical, with a bright golden aura surrounding it.  The center was the brightest, a deep gold/light orange.  There was no trail or dust following it.  The reason it caught my eye was because it accelerated in its speed.  The best way to describe its disappearance was that it slipped into an invisible pocket in the sky.  I am reporting this because I KNOW it was not an airplane and I was wondering if anyone else saw it.  I really would like to know what it was.

A little over a year before I went to pilot training, I was and electronic warfare officer on B-52s.  We departed Loring AFB approximately 2300 and the sighting occurred at 35,000&apos; on an approximate heading of 230 degrees while transiting southern Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts for approximately 15 to 20 minutes.  There was a bright moon and at that altitude, very clear.  The object appeared as an intensly bright point of light at an azimuth of about 60 degrees and 30 degrees left of the nose of the aircraft when first noticed by the pilots.  As they were discussing this over the interphone they noticed movement.  The navigators went to the cockpit thinking it was a star.  After consulting their charts and tables they concluded what it wasn&apos;t!  Sirius, the brightest star, was below the horizon and they stated this was far brighter than any star.  The gunner and I went forward to get a look and I have to agree that it was extremely bright, blue white in color and appeared far above us.  Note:  The gunner sat forward in the crew compartment and operated his equipment remotely in the B-52G.  While in the cockpit, the four of us watched the object change position from about 30 degrees left of the nose to almost dead ahead without changing its elevation.  The gunner and I returned to our positions to accomplish mission requirements.  Interphone conversation included speculation and keeping the rest of the crew updated.  It disappeared after five or so minutes.  After all these years, I don&apos;t remember how it disappeared.  As I recall, this happened just before the great blackout the night of Nov 9-10, 1965.  I can&apos;t nail down the flight date, however I flew on the 27th and 28th of October, the 1st of November and the 17th of November and sat alert from the 5th through the 12th of November, 1965.

When I looked out my bathromm window (facing North) I saw a cigar shaped object with several blueish white lights on the side (roughly 1/3 to 1/2 way between the front and back). The object was flying fairly low in the sky in a singular, easterly direction and from it&apos;s size, it appeared to be fairly near.

I wondered if this was one of them so I ran thru the house and took a spotting scope into the backyard to observe it. I couldn&apos;t make out any further details with the scope other than a pulsing red light. Next I ran in and grabbed a Hi-8 videocamera and a tripod. I went outside to set up the gear. I taped the object on the tripod, then proceeded to place numerous calls around the Phoenix valley to other skywatchers. On the third call Jeff Willes answered and immediately gathered his videocamera with my 5X telephoto lenses I loaned him. He also videotaped the blood red object as I did with a tripod. We&apos;ll probably post stills or video on our website www.ufovideo.com in a day or so. Until then we&apos;ll be keeping the Phoenix valley under watch during the 7-9 pm time period for a while.

It didn&apos;t move like a normal aircraft would be able to.  It would dart from one point to another, extremely quickly.  He and I watched it for about 10 min. and decided that we should go in and get my mother and sister and the bonoculars.  What we saw through them, was incredible.  I could see a circle of multicolored lights, beautiful lights.  It never made any noise what so ever, but every time the light show would begin the neighbor&apos;s dogs would really carry on (barking).  It would rise and lower but it never did land.  We notified the local sherriffs department and a deputy came out to make sure for one that we were not crazy, it had drifted off by the time he arrived but as we was looking through our bonoculars, it popped back out from behind a distant tree.  We had photographed it prior to the deputy&apos;s arrival in hopes to be able to see it better.  We have a very clear picture of the saucer shaped craft, with the surrounding lights.  I also notified a man in the military who deals with this sort of thing and sent him the pic. and he stated that he thought it was authentic, and most definitely somthing not from this world.

It was approximately  2110hrs.  I was south-west bound on sr22.  Just as I approached the perry/muskingum border, I noticed an unusual object in the north sky at a very low altitude.  I pulled my car off the highway and shut it off.  As I climbed out of the car, I noticed that it was even closer than I had thought.  In my estimation, it was approximately 500&apos; north of my position and 250&apos; in altitude.  The craft was completely soundless.  It was shaped like an octagonal or hexagonal cylinder.  It was dull metallic in color maybe the color of titanium or aluminum.  There were no windows or doors, the only distinguishable feature on the outside was a small dome on the bottom west-facing end of the craft.  There is a road across the sr from my position and several times during the sighting I wanted to try to get someone&apos;s attention, but terror, fascination, and the fear of it disappearing before I got back prevented me.  As I continued to watch, the dome on what I assumed to be the front of the craft(west-facing end), began to strobe.  After a few minutes or seconds, things begin to get unclear here due to the huge amounts of adrenaline pumping through my body, but another craft approached from the west.  It stopped abruptly at approximately the same altitude and a couple of hunderd feet to the west of the first.  This craft was not shaped exactly the same as the first, but it was similar.   The only thing I remember for certain about the second craft was the presence of the same type of dome on the east facing end which also began to strobe.  This contunued for a few seconds, I would guess, and then they both began to drift north as if they were connected.  I watched until they drifted out of sight.  As the fear began to subside, I realized what an amazing event had just unfolded before me.   The entire time this event took place, not one car passed which may not be that significant considering the fact that this is not a busy highway even ! during t he day.  I just wanted someone else to see it.  I am not saying that this was a craft from another galaxy, planet, or dimension, what I am saying is that I saw what I described, exactly as I described it.  The sky was still bright enough to see plainly.

A storm system was quickly moving in from the west to the south.  Because I had been watching the sunset, I was wearing sunglasses.  They are non-reflective, but they amplify anything that is red.  As I watched the progress of the storm, I saw a translucent red sphere appear to streak from south to west; disappearing behind a cloud.  I thought it was a simple reflection off the lenses, so I removed them and looked again.  I saw the globe drop out from behind one cloud, travel straight down, and take cover behind another cloud.

A 737 airline, flying approximately 10,000 feet,  was considerably below the craft craft, which appeared to remain still.  In relation to the 737, the craft was approximately  1/20th the size of the 737.  The craft was glowing red and displayed a blinking less red light on top.  Occasionally, the craft would move, but prior to its movement, there appeared to be white sparkles that surrounded the bottom of the craft.   There did not appear any jet trail nor sound.  The craft would occasionally glow a bright red then dim itself.  This went on for several minutes.  The sky was partly cloudy and it was almost dark.  No other lights of similar nature were near.  As the craft drifted south, it would seem to correct itself and return to its original position. After approximately 11:00, the craft moved southward at approximately twice the speed of an airliner, disappearing into the night sky.  Just prior to the craft&apos;s departure, white sparkles seemed to eminate around the bottom of the craft, and the craft itself turned bright red, pulsing red and less red in .25 second intervals.  The night before, a craft which appeared identical to this one appeared in relatively the same area at the same time.  The craft was filmed  and  was aired on the 6:00 news in Phoenix on 7/13/2000.  The family that saw the UFO were interviewed and the video was scrutinezed by the local MUFON representatives.

On the second night, we noticed an orange orb of light out over the ocean but high enough to be a foot over the rooftops of the houses in front of ours. The lights were an orange color and were about the size of a street light. The sky would be dark, and all of a sudden, the light would just turn on instantly just like a car headlight. Only this was maybe 2 miles out over the ocean and were way too high in the sky to be confused for a boat on the horizon or a flare. The light would turn on, and start to dim and fade out. It would be dark again, and a few minutes would pass and all of the sudden it would turn on again, and begin to fade out again. We managed to capture this on video the second night with houses in front of us along with cars going by just to prove it was real. At one time, two lights would turn on at once and begin to fade out. I ruled it out that these could be natural occuring phenomon because there had to be thought behind it. There was a pattern that would keep occuring. The way the would light up one right after the other and fade out definitly showed that this could not have been any kind of ball lightning(no clouds) or a flare because a flare would be much brighter and would move. These lights never moved farther than a foot to the left or right. And every night, you could expect them to be in the same position. We could basically time them and know exactly what time they would occur.", "Flying disk that looks silver in color and is moving extremely fastI am a golf pro and while I was video taping a golf lesson an object appeared.

It was at an elevation of 30 degrees to the ground and remained at that as it traversed a 70 degree span of sky. It crossed below large white cumulous clouds. The clouds were moving NW. The object appeared as a peculiar balloon (roundish and blobbly) for the 1st 4 seconds and then as a flattened triangle. It&apos;s trajectory was absolutely straight with no variation in speed.

WE started noticing rings or bands or pulses of glowing fiant lights bands roling down from the north.

Let me give you some background information as to my location....I live in a rather remote area, 15 miles from the nearest town.  The few neighbors that i have were asleep at the time of the sighting, as was my husband.  I was awake at 0100 hours to &quot;let my dog out&quot; to defecate...I have a back wood deck and behind the deck is a partially wooded area (Oak trees)and a very remote/unpopulated area that stretches on for approximately one half mile to the large foothills (1/2 mile away).  I stood on my back deck as my dog walked the remote area behind my deck (as aforementioned above)...I looked out at the night sky, as I often do, and was immediately drawn (my eye caught sight of) a VERY bright light that was directly over the nearest foothill to me  (this area would be to the west)...The object, as mentioned, would change colors (MUCH more dramatically than the twinkling i have seen of a &quot;star&quot;, and I could directly visualize in the very clear night sky, the silhouette of the foothill-top with large trees/etc as &quot;points of reference&quot;.  It was in using these &quot;points of reference&quot; that I was able to watch the object move (what i would term &apos;gently float&apos; left to right then up and down....I estimate that it would move within 1/4 - 1/2 mile of its original place in the sky, as it moved right-left and up and down....At no time did i see it land on the hill, but at times it appeared to be no more than perhaps 100 feet or so from the hilltop.  I watched the object for about 5-10 minutes outside, and then returned inside to inform my husband.  My husband was asleep, and thereby I COULD not inform him at the time (Needless to say i ! did try to wake him up..but my attempt was futile).  I went into my daughters room and watched the object through her levolor blinds for about an hour more...It was still continuing with the same readily apparent movements and color changes..... I attempted to sleep, but awoke after 1/2 hour..looked out the window again and the light was gone.  I am a professional nurse, educated, married and well-respected..

It was quite large and moving not like a plane but sort of sideways kind of like a Z but still in the same direction. It had a red light and a green light but no light in the front like a plane.  I called for my husband to hurry because it was moving kind of fast. My husband and children came out also.  It passed almost directly over us and had very bright light on the bottom but made no sound. I don&apos;t know if we heard nothing because it made no sound or because it was so high up, but the white lights on the bottom were very bright.

Then tonight 8/7/00 when my husband went outside around 9:45pm I followed him we saw 2 objects comming from the north east heading in a straight line south east, like the night before just as high in the sky but moving fast.  There were two airplanes with one of the objects in back and it moved so fast it passed the airplane like it was standing still.  The objects lights have a different look than a plane.  We watched them and the planes until the tree got in the way.  Then about 5 min later there were 3 more comming from the same direction moving very fast faster than a jet and flashing only red lights.  At one point one disappeared (no lights) then they all disappeared (lights gone) then reappeared (lights on all at the same time).  They were in an -l pattern (like a backwards L). It took only a few min maybe 1-3 to pass from the north to the south then out of sight because of the tree.  I saw no white lights tonight. We have a reserve base in Fresno and we see alot of jets fly. We also ha! ve an ai rport and can see the planes take off.  These objects including the planes did not take off from Fresno due to the high altitude they were flying and the proximiaty of the airport to my home. The objects were flying faster than any jet I have seen take off from Fresno. We do not live in the airports flight path, planes don&apos;t usually fly over our house. The objects tonight were in the same flight path as we see the big jets fly.

I and two of my friends would always take our dogs out for early morning walks to let them chase rabbits. They never caught any but had a helluva time at it. We were walking three abreast in a southeasterly direction. I was on the right side of the trio.

Then I looked to my left and my eyes met those of my other friend Craig, who had also stopped in his tracks adjacent to me.. I could tell by the look on his face that he had seen it too!

It was luminous, yellowish and very bright.  It was roundish in the front and then had like a long tail coming off and tapering down to very small.  Kind of like a sperm shape.  It looked like one thing and never changed its length or shape.  Where it tapered I could see waves of energy moving in it.  It was very beautiful looking.

I was a front seat passenger looking out of my door window when I saw the fast moving light.  The light was traveling southward at an elevation of approximately 45 degrees above the horizon and from my position it seemed to be descending at a ten degree angle.  After about a second of observation the light suddently exploded into a bright white flash that lasted for a fraction of second.  The flash did not linger in the sky as an explosion would, and I did not see any trace of the light following the explosion.  The object seemed to be moving much faster than any meteor or debris that I&apos;ve previously witnessed entering the atmosphere.

The object was not observed until it began to change intensity so no pattern of movement was observed beforehand. The phenomena was unlike a meteor (which rapidly streaks) or a satellite moving evenly across the night sky. Since the light covered no distance in the sky a possible explanation would be that something under some degree of control (?) passed through the sun&apos;s light as the object either exited or enter the earth&apos;s atmosphere. This idea parallels video tapes on television which seem to spotlight mysterious objects in the earth&apos;s high atmosphere.

The only thing is it never went down.I can see about 10miles in the direction it was traveling and it never went down,I watched it until it disappeared in the distance.It should have gone down and it was traveling parallel to the horizon,it just dosen&apos;t make sense .((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The light started to get wider-actually it never moved from side to side it just kept getting wider (maybe a 1/4 mile wide) then a blue light (more like a beam) came down from within the bright light--then the blue light stayed (sort of floated in the air) and the bright light sort of turned into a haze/mist and what ever generated the bright light disappeared.  It was pretty weird.  Do you have any ideas of what it could have been?", "I was going out to roll up windows in car. Just stepped one foot onto porch when this bright light caught my eye in the sky.

It seemed to be only a few feet above the  electrical wires running down the street. When it got over the wires it vanished as quickly as it appeared.

It appeared to be moving quite slow and to the northeast away from us.  The object made no noise and appeared to have small wing like appendages on each side of it. Then we observed that the object appeared to be observing a Cessna jump plane in the area that was below it and slightly behind it.  One of the individuals in the Cessna jumped from the aircraft and the object above it (approximately 3000 to 4000 ft.) excellerated away at an incredable speed to the northeast.  There was no contrail and the only sound discernable was that of the Cessna aircraft.  I questioned the pilot and occupants of the aircraft and they advised that they did not see the craft.

This with the naked eye.When I came out, it looked to be a bright star, but through binoculars, it resembled a disco glitterball - sorry, but that&apos;s the best way of describing it. My wife then agreed on that choice of words. The most significant part of the experience for me, was the speed at which it went away; it neither sped off like in the films, nor did it just disappear - it actually receded (so that it appeared at about a tenth of its previous size) within about 5 seconds. I would say it could have been a few miles away, but it&apos;s difficult when you don&apos;t know the size involved. My wife reckons it was a lot further than that, possibly celestial.

Object at first appeared brighter than any star normally would and then intensified to 10 to 20 times greater in magnitude than any normal stellar object other than moon or sun. Light was not awesomely brilliant or unpleasant but bright. Intensity similar to moon at about 70% full. Not certain about definition until object appeared to reach brightest point and then either roll, turn to se, or accelerate rapidly away from my position. I first thought it might be a satellite or nortorious space junk as the time of night and season would probably be about right as this was just nearing total darkness and something at that altitude might be catching the last reflections of the sun prior to moving into termination however I am left with the stongest impression that it banked or rotated to the east and acclerated out of view in less than a second. The impression was similar to the way &quot;starships reach warp drive on Star Trek&quot; just with a less distinct tail or trailer. I did not get an errie feeling. I have seen satellites react similarly before but not with a sense that they have accelerated away from my position but more that they have continued on the path much fainter having lost the benefit of the sun&apos;s reflection.I could not pick the object up again. It gave me the impression of being a luminated disk not in definitive outline but in manner of the luminous area dispacing the normal dark background of the sky.

At this time I noticed a very bright white light sped into the area at relatively low altitude traveling roughly east to west from my vantage point. Estimated distance from the object to me was around a mile. The light sped into view from behind a row of trees at a fairly fast clip, intensified slightly in brightness as it reached a due-north angle from me, and then its flight curved to the right during the last second of the event and quickly faded from view. The light itself was a steady bright white circular shaped light that was slightly bigger than a pencil eraser held at arms length. I did not notice any sound or &quot;tail&quot; coming from behind the object. The light traveled about 10-15 degrees above the horizon and judging it&apos;s relative brightness I figure it was at a fairly low altitude 3,000 to maybe 5,000 feet AGL. Speed was a bit harder to judge, although it was traveling much faster than the commercial air traffic that routinely fly over my area into Pittsburgh Int&apos;l, albeit at a much higher altitude. A rough guestimate would be around 500-600 mph, maybe more. Total duration of the sighting was a little less than 3 seconds. I&apos;ve taken a few flight lessons and have 25 hrs credit (1 hr solo), and from what I saw it was traveling much too fast to be a plane at any altitude. It also didn&apos;t travel quite as fast to be a meteor not to mention I saw no visible tail and it curved to the right noticeably during the last split second it was viewable to me.

As we were headed in a northerly direction at approximately 21:30 MT, my son exclaimed, &quot;Hey Dad,what the heck kind of aircraft is that?&quot;  As I looked out the driver side window, I saw exactly what he was puzzled over.  About 1000 feet up, directly over the city was what appeared to be a saucer or disk-shaped craft.  This craft had, what I can best describe as a white, strobe-like light on top. Around it&apos;s entire circumference was a rotating orange band which seemed to revolve in a clockwise motion around the object.  What was even more interesting was that this object then turned off the strobe effect and it&apos;s rotating orange light.  At this point in time the craft was roughly 300 yards away from our car and we had been viewing it for about 1 minute.  It then appeared to assume the conventional aviation lights of a small plane!

The craft was flying slowly from the SW to the South. The teardrop shape was oriented so that the smaller pointed end was the front of the aircraft. It gave me the impression of being slow and ponderous. I did not observe any tail section, propellors or rotors. Since it was a side-on silhouette I would not have been able to observe any wings. As it flew behind the trees I pointed it out to the driver of the vehicle I was in. We waited for it to come out from behind the trees but, it never did.((NUFORC Note:  Given that the sighting occurred close to an Air Force base, our first consideration would be that the witness might have observed an aircraft. Since the sighting occurred just days before an air show seems to emphasize such a possibility.  The shape of the object is reminiscent of the fuselage of a Hughes 500-series helicopter.

I am used to seeing a/c in the sky. At first I thought it may have been an a/c on approach to Pearson since I was only 100km from the airport. However as the light dimmed I looked for evidence of strobe lights, position lights or navigation lights and there were none present. Also the altitude of the object was very high, not characteristic of an a/c on approach to Pearson. In fact the size of the light and the colour after the brightness dimmed looked just like a star. I would have easily have mistaken it for a star. And finally as an employee of Pearson Airport in Toronto, ON. I know for a fact that the airport has a curfew on aircraft traffic between the times of 12:30am to 06:30am, therefore it is unlikly than an a/c would be approaching Pearson with a landing light on. A/C do not fly with these bright lights on unless they are landing. I am going to try and get in touch with some friends at Air Traffic Control to see if their was traffic in the area at this time.

As the mist covered the city, and all we could see was ambient light, our gaze shifted upward to the stars.

Scared, we ran to our car for shelter.  Our two dogs that we had with us suddenly became silent....and believe me they had been fussing most of the night until this light appeared. Once inside the car, another light, yellow and green hovered to the west of where we were looking.  This was about 500 yards away.  It hovered behind the treeline and then above it.  It moved in the same triangle pattern as the other light.  We locked the doors and watched for about 3-4 hours more before passing out of exhaustion.

We walked around the block she lives on (It&apos;s large, about a 1/2 mile walk ), and came to rest on an adjacent street corner. All night we had been amazed at how clear the sky was, noting the usually hazy horizon. It was uncommonly clear on this night. We saw three lights, star-like in appearance, flying northeast at 12 0&apos;clock high. They appeared to be in a formation, with the leader forming the peak of an arrowhead. the wingmen never really faultered, but seemed more in unison with the leader&apos;s sways and dips.

Object B was about 30 degrees above the horizon and 1 degree or so to the west.  My wife went into the house.  Their lights seemed to radiant in the cardinal directions of N, NE, SE, S, SW, W, SW.   They appeared stationary. Civilian aircraft passed beneath them and one aircraft passed at a high altitude.  Upon the passing of the higher altitude aircraft object A&apos;s lights pulsed and it seemed to go upward.  My wife came back outside and we observed object A moving to the south at an extremely high rate of speed.  Object B remained in position for about 3 to 4 minutes more.  Then another two aircraft passed underneath object B. Object B pulsed similar to object A and went straight up and disappeared.  I took a couple of photographs of both objects.

I was looking east and it appeared to be about 10 miles away over the Apache Junction area. I had a video camera on a tripod near by so I started taping it again. The object is heading to the south or to the right on video. I lost it when it suddenly did an 80 degree turn downward and increased speed by 3x what it was just traveling. On the video it appears to be 2 objects close together with another object that is not lit up. This object is black and covers some of the Red UFO.

Nobody was around at that time when suddenly we saw a water melon shape and slightly greenish kind of light with longtitudnal stripes land onto the merry-go-round about 10 yards away from us. We immediately ran towards it and just as I tried to hold it in my arms it flew away on top of a building nearby. It stayed there for a while moving left to right and right to left. I have never seen anything fly with such a speed that one could lose it with the blink of an eye. It&apos;s diameter matched that of the merry-go-round.", "Brief but clear sighting of a noiseless lighted (3, reb, blue and white) object maneuvering and hovering.Ten-yr-old daughter and I were relaxing in hot tub, just off back porch.  Sighting area:  to immediate west, a medium sized metal tool shed, backed by elm trees; directly overhead, some limbs from those trees; immediately north and northeast, the two-story house&apos;s southern eaves; to southeast, a huge elm tree; to east, at least 60 feet away, neighbor&apos;s house.  That left only a relatively small area of open sky visible almost directly above and to the west, framed by our house eaves, the elm tree, and the neighbor&apos;s house.  A lighted object came into view from among the elm branches, headed at a fairly slow speed to the north.  The object appeared to be quite high and displayed three separate lights in a triangular arrangement:  red, blue, and white.  If it had a &quot;nose,&quot; the blue light was at the &quot;front,&quot; with the red light on the west side and white on the east. No actual shape of the object could be discerned.  The object moved northward for several seconds, then slowed to a complete stop, where it hovered for perhaps 10-15 seconds.  Then it &quot;turned&quot; or arced to the east for a short distance and stopped again.  (Blue light pointed eastward.)  It hovered for perhaps 10-12 seconds, then appeared to &quot;back up&quot; a short distance, then stopped again.  After a few seconds it moved slowly northward for a short distance, then stopped completely again.  After another few seconds of hovering, it began to oscillate, or &quot;rock&quot; back and forth, but a shallow or short-distance arc, moving no more than three times its maximum width or diameter.  It then moved to the northwest a very short distance, stopped and hovered again.  Then, it began to move northward, visibly accelerting, but still only to a very slow speed.  After a northward distance of perhaps 20 to 30 times its width (that is, between lights), the three lights coalesced into a single, brighter white light for only a second or two, then the light simply &quot;went out&quot; or disappeared while the object was accelerating northward.  I am 60 years old, am an Air Force! veteran , and have loved aircraft and watched the skies all my life. In my opinion, this was not an airplane (hovering and backing up)  or helicopter (too high), nor of course was it space junk, meteors, comets, balloons, birds, swamp gas.  My daughter agrees with my descriptions and her descriptions of the object, its lights, and its movements concur with mine (with no prompting).  My 16-yr-old daughter and her (moronic) boyfriend were in the front yard at the same time.  It, too, is overshadowed by elms.  When the object disappeared (before reaching the eave of our house), I ran into the house and grabbed a rifle with a 9X scope and went to the front yard -- time about 40 seconds.  I scanned the sky and wasw only a rather bright star.  Without prompting,I asked my daughter and boyfriend to scan the sky and tell me if they saw anything unusual.  My daughter immediately pointed to a bright &quot;star&quot; to the east, moving very slowly eastward along the north eaves of the neighbor&apos;s house.  To me, it looked like a single light, but she said it was &quot;three lights,&quot; one red, one blue, and one &quot;pale yellow.&quot;  We all looked through the rifle scope and both kids, with ttenaged eyes, confirmed three lights, equidistance and of equal brightness.  I could still see only one light, but I could detect that the object was moving slowly eastward.  It quickly disappeared into elm branches in the next block.  No other unusual lights could be seen anywhere.  Lighting conditions:  None in back yard to interfere with view; a single street light in the front yard, catacorner and to the northeast -- overshadowed by taller elms.  No clouds whatever.  No haze.  Stars and planets sharply defined.  The occasional airliner easy to see and identify.  Length of sighting:  back yard, about 1.5 minutes; front yard, perhaps 1 minute maximum.  Still am not 100% sure the object seen from front yard moving east was the same object.  Don&apos;t doubt my daughter&apos;s flat, immediate and unprompted statement that the object had three lights, but boyfriend could! have mi micked her (he&apos;s not too bright).  Note:  Amarillo is 18 miles north and is one of the places where the Osprey aircraft is made.  However, I do not believe what we saw was an Osprey on stop-and-go maneuvers.  For one thing, no sound whatever; for another, too high; for yet another, it backed up, and I don&apos;t think the Osprey can do that.  Younger daughter is writing a report of her experience for one of her favorite teachers.  She did not consult me for input.  When I read her story, the details coincided almost exactly with my memories of the incident.  She, however, thinks she saw a round or disc-shaped outlined with the 3 lights in a triangular arrangement on its &quot;bottom.&quot;  I do not see how she could have seen the object itself. Again, no sound, no contrails, no &quot;tail&quot; of any kind.", "3 ufo north on hwy 9Go to work was north on arhansas hwy 9 this pass overcup ark. look north the ufo all 3 of then was about 340@ from north that was about 500 to 600 hurdred feet hight more to the north at 25 to 45 mph .They act like they was look for something.

One sunny clear afternoon in Charlotte, North Carolina, I was driving in my car. I was on my way home from my ex-girlfriend&apos;s house. She lives in a town close to Charlotte. So I&apos;m traveling on the outskirts of Charlotte on a rural road. There are farms and fields all around. I&apos;m driving along and I notice a formation of what appear to be F-16 fighter pilots. It&apos;s not everyday you see a squadron over a populated area. And at such a low altitude. I&apos;m no pilot, but i would have guessed their altitude to be approximately 5000 feet. Anyway, i&apos;m watching these pilots fly off to the west and out of my view. I drive a few more miles down the road, thinking of what they could possibly be doing out of charlotte and then i see them again. Only this time they&apos;re flying back from the west heading east. By this time I&apos;m thinking, &quot;Hey wouldn&apos;t it be cool if there was a UFO in the area.&quot;  Well by now I&apos;m getting really close to my neighborhood (about 3 miles). I approach the crest of this hill and on my way down the other side of the hill, I look a few miles down the road. There it was. I huge cigar-shaped craft. This craft resembled the fuselage of a regular passenger aircraft but it was much bigger and longer than your average airplane. At first i thought i was seeing things, thinking that it may be a blimp, but this was no blimp. Blimps are oblonged shaped, looking much like an egg in shape. So now I&apos;m about 2 miles from my neighborhood. Keep in mind this is a very populated area of south Charlotte. At this point I&apos;m driving like moron trying to avoid an accident while watching this craft.. I watch it ( at first it was motionless) but it starts to head east very slowly. i watch it until it disappears over the into the trees. I continue driving, trying to look for it as i approach the aboretum (a.k.a. a very large shpping area). I turn right onto Highway 51 in the direction the craft disappeared to and i was thinking, &quot;Okay, I&apos;m goi! ng to se e it again.&quot; But to my reluctance i did not. Finally I get to my neighborhood. I immediately called my ex to tell her what i saw. After i told her about it she said she saw those fighter pilots for a while flying over her town of Monroe, NC. Now I&apos;m stading outside, talking to her on the phone. Suddenly i hear what sounds like thunder(even louder). I look up to see an F-16 doing an intense maneuver directly over my neighborhood. I waited 5 more minutes to see it again. But i never did see the cigar shaped craft again that day. Later that night, I talked to some of my friends. After i told them what had happened they said that earlier in the day some people had called a one of the local rock stations to and were reporting UFOS over Charlotte. To this day I wonder about UFOS and after what I saw would like to know what the military was doing over the skies of my town.", "1.)  Came up from the horizon in the Northeast over Kaneohe;   (my first thought was fireworks).  Twowitnesses involved,  second witness arrived approximately 30 sec. after the initial observation. 2.)  Traveled from left to right towards the Southwest in an unorganized group. 3.)  Some objects seemed to circle others and even back track a bit. 4.)  Continued toward Soutwest and without stoping appeared to &quot;degroup themselves&quot; and with incredible precision seemed to go to their assigned positions on &quot;que&quot; and stop......&quot;remarkable&quot;   5.)  The formation seemed to form a &quot;V&quot; with the apex point ing in the approximate direction of the northwest and located directly over the Koolau&apos;s ( a formation of vertical cliffs.  approx. 3000 ft in height) so steep that NASA Satellites cannot accurately photograph.  6.)   After the formation  appeared there were less points of light then seen in the origninal unorganized group;  Almost as if groups of lights had taken up their various positions.  That would account for the points of light in the formation appearing larger. 7.)   As luck would have it, at this point the whole formation became obscured by clouds ( a common occurrence due to the trade winds rising over the mountains.) 8.)    While the clouds were obscuring the formation one point of light  (muted amber red)  took off in the direction of the south with great speed and another took off to the north a millisecond later (white); both disappeared quickly. 9.)    The other  witness claims to have seen a red point of light proceed the original grouping;  &quot;I did not see that light&quot;. 10.)   Interesting to note that at approximately the same time our observation was taking place; NASA  was to have a controlled re-entry of the 17 ton Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, launched in 1991.  The Satellite was supposed to enter the atmosphere along a 1,000-mile srtip of the Pacific about 2,500 miles southeast of Hawaii.  It was said that if it left its projected course sufficiently it would be in the southeast sky about 8:30 p.m. and could be obsereved here in Hawaii.  It is my opinion what we saw was a completely seperate sighting. 11.)    Added note.....at approximately 22:30 the same evening my curiosity drove me outside again to look at the sky and much to my surprise I observed another object traveling in the same direction (straight line) muted amber red in color.  This object had a ghost like form directly in front which seemed to move back and forth from right to center forward.  It seemed ghost like because I could only observe it  when I would look to the side of the main object. ( I assume this is due to the optical nerve phenomena where the object disappears when observed straight on in the dark.) 12.)     I might add I am a trained observer.  My profession is to observe even the &quot;smallest&quot;  morphological structures of the human cell under the microscope.", "Bright FlashesAll we saw was the craft flying over and is flashed three times about ten seconds apart ...

The light was hanging in a clear spot in the sky. At first, I thought it might be a flare, but after 2-3 minutes without moving or changing intensity, I realized it was something other than a flare. The object seemed to have a slight aura around it - it was not an aircraft light. Two of my friends also saw the light after I remarked how it was odd that this light had not moved. After 2-3 minutes, the light began to strobe between bright/medium intensity, then began to accelerate away from me. It seemed to take a slight hooking turn just prior to heading directly away in a straight line. As it passed over a thin cloud, I saw the light shine through the cloud.  So, the object/light was higher in altitude than the clouds.  The object accelerated smoothly, getting dimmer, and also strobing faster as it traveled away, until it passed out of sight.

I spun around so that I was facing east to get a better look at the lights.  I noticed that the four lights were in two sets.  The four lights were flying in a square formation.  The best way to describe the two sets is one set of two lights was east and the other set of two lights were west.  Each set looked like it was rotating/spiraling and changing red and white.  Their direction didn&apos;t change and continued to go north. I tried to point them out to another person but they were unable to see them and they faded from my view.

But, then as the white light dissipated an electric blue streak appeared to shine from the ground upwards to the now fading light.  After 3 minutes the oval light disappeared in the form of a dust cloud in which the blue streak remained illuminated.

The model had reached an altitude of approx. 1500 feet and was very small in the sky which was a very clear blue with bright sunshine and high temperatures (90&apos;s).  While traveling on a trail paralleling Hwy. 118 just north of Maricopa, I noticed a very peculiar looking object just above the model in the sky but obviously at a much higher altitude and greater distance. The shape was very clearly egg-like but more symmetrical and oblong, not unlike a ball squashed down in the center viewed from the side. The color was dull silver / grey metallic that did not reflect the sunlight appreciably and at times appeared almost translucent. We stopped the bikes momentarily and I asked my buddy, &quot;what the hell is that thing above the airplane?&quot;  He said that he had no idea but that it was certainly peculiar.  We both agreed that it bore no similarity to any conventional aircraft (my buddy is a certified aircraft mechanic and pilot).  The object was moving very slowly from east to west towards Maricopa and when a jetliner appeared slightly above the object, we realized that the jet had a completely different appearance, was moving much faster and leaving a contrail. We resumed our pursuit of the model and after about a minute the object appeared to be blending into the slight haze and when I looked up again, it was gone.  The only possible explanation we both could think of was that we were seeing some kind of large high altitude research balloon (Skyhook?) because I read where these tend to condense and elongate as they reach the upper atmosphere.((NUFORC Note:  Two similar reports received from Albuquerque, NM, and southeastern AZ on 03JN00, which may be related to this report.

We could all see the smoke from the trail.  Being a pilot, I thought there was certainly an explanation for this.  I guessed it to be about 10000 feet AGL, and for over two minutes it illuminated the clouds and did not descend.  Seemingly, at about three minutes, it appeared to travel downward in wide, slow descending circles.  Then at about four + minutes, it went &quot;out.&quot;  I didn&apos;t think anything at all about this, other than how strange...But today, I received a letter from my brother in Des Moines, Iowa.  (his note posted here): &quot;about 9:15 on the 4th, i saw a strange light in the sky. at the climax of the lion&apos;s park fireworks show, i noticed a bright red light on a cloud just west of ny circle. it looked like a lasar light on the bottom of the cloud, but it didn&apos;t go &quot;into&quot; it. strange. the guy in the driveway next to mine said, &quot;what&apos;s that light?&quot; I said I thought it was a lasar...then it started to move OFF the cloud and was in the blackness between two clouds. The clouds were moving NE slowly and the light moved independently on a more easterly tack, very slowly...like the clouds. it came to a dead stop directly overhead...i walked up about fifty feet to mary and our neighbors who were watching the fireworks. &quot;what&apos;s that?&quot; I said...they all looked at it and it began to move slowly to the east again...it went behind a couple of clouds, emerging into the void between. still bright red. definitely not a reflection from the sun, which was way down by then. constant brightness; no fluctuation. the 15 yr old neighbor kid ran in to get his telescope. i went in for the binoculars, which i couldn&apos;t find immediately and I went back out. The light had moved further east, and the neighbor lady said she saw a bright red spot leave from it and shoot off to the north quickly. her 10 yr old son said he saw this too. about this time the telescope comes out, and the kid fixed the position...when i looked at it now, it was over dsm. the color changed from red to orange to yellow to white, blinked a couple times and went out...like a switch. we didn&apos;t see it again. i called news 13...the guy there said several other people called to describe the same light. no explanation...never saw anything in the paper either. haven&apos;t told this to anyone else except you. don&apos;t want to end up in a loony UFO bin and i&apos;m glad there were other witnesses. cool huh? --------- This was my brothers account of what I&apos;m now wondering is a related incident??? My being in Florida (EST 10:15) and his being in Iowa (CST 9:15).  Could this be the same event viewed simultaneously from Iowa and Florida?  Certainly there would be other reports from anyplace in between, but I didn&apos;t see any on your sight!

I was looking up in the sky since it was a clear night, making it a nice night for star gazing.  I happened to see a very fast moving light in the southern half of the sky.  At first I took it for a satellite, but then I saw a second light behind it htat seemed to be chasing the first light. They went straight across the sky for about 5 seconds in a north-northwesterly direction then the first light started to turn and start and stop like it was evading the second light.  The second light chased it like there was a dogfight or something.  The first light did at least three full 360&apos;s before taking off at a very high speed to the northwest.  These objects appeared to be very very high in the sky and moved in such a fashion that I don&apos;t believe they could have been planes.", "Briefly observed an asymmetrical v-shaped formation of 7 solid, silent, unblinking lights.I don&apos;t remember the exact date that this occured, but it was sometime in the spring of 1999. I was standing in my back yard smoking a cigarette when I saw a v shaped formation of 7 lights (the upper arm had four lights, the lower three) at about 45 degrees above the horizon to the east. They moved approximately south to north, with no sound, and were of equal color, size, and luminosity as the stars in the background. They moved at about the speed of an ordinary jet aircraft at relatively close range, and I observed them briefly before my line of sight was obscured by trees. I thought it unusual that there were no blinking or colored lights that you would expect to see on ordinary aircraft. My only guess is that they were a formation of stealth fighters, or a single stealth bomber from Canon AFB. My initial impression however, was that the lights represented a single object that was larger than a single fighter and relatively close based on it&apos;s speed.", "A bright light appeared leaving a glowing cloud behind which lasted approx 30 minutesWhilst driving along interstate 8 a bright light appeared in the sky and then shortly after a beam from the light shone down similar to a searchlight.

I looked towards the south and observed a plasma-like orange ball move west to east across the horizon and straight overhead. According to the unidentfied witness, the size of the object was a pea if held at arms length. The plasma-like sphere was orange, translucent, and you could see some ragged dark (black) area towards the middle. The outer edges were orange. The weather was clear with some wind. We did have a full moon, or close to full moon, so the night sky was well lit by moonlight. The moon was to the east of us at the time of the sighting.

This was significant experience for the unidentifed witness.", "Saw 3 satellite-like objects move from Big Dipper to SSE part of sky in varying formation over about 5 minutes.Sighting Date/Time: August 5, 2000, maybe 11:45-12:10PM Sighting Location: Sighting occurred while on the beach of the Minnesota river, approx 3 miles E-NE of Le Sueur, MN Sighting Description: We were fishing on the bank of the Minnesota River.  We had all been watching for satellites and had even had 2 in perpendicular orbits pass real close to one another (2&quot; at arms-length I&apos;d estimate) and there was about 5 of us seeing it. We all thought that was cool. August also sees an increase in meteoric activity, which we all took in. Skies were mostly clear, humid, 70F, 1/2? moon in the West. I had been left on the shore to watch the catfish lines while my friends went back to town to get another 4X4 truck. I sat, watching satellites go by, and the frequent falling stars, when I looked North to the lowest part of the spoon in the Big Dipper constellation. I watched a light become bright as it moved in what would become a S-SE direction. I assumed, that the increase in light intensity was due to the sun&apos;s position below the horizon, and the satellite entering the light from the long-set Sun. (We know that as satellites move into the Earth&apos;s shadow, the light fades and they disappear. And I grew up in the country with my dad&apos;s 8&quot; reflector Celestron with the Earth-clock tripod, so I know my way around the stars well enough to hold the evening&apos;s conversation.) Anyway, as I watched the &quot;satellite&quot; move, I noticed that it was a slower speed than any of the (at least 6) satellites I had observed in that evening, and suddenly I saw another appear behind it, maybe 1/2&quot; at arms-length at perhaps 4 o&apos;clock as looking at a clock. I thought that this was a treat, since seeing two satellites in such proximity is rare, (if not totally regulated &quot;illegal&quot; by some NASA trajectory-assignment committee). From the time I saw the first, until the second appeared, was possibly 20 seconds. At this point, they may have been 3/4 of the distance through an arc between the horizon and a vertical axis going up through my body. As soon as I saw the second, I had two reference points moving in the sky, and was immediately aware that the speed of one was erratic at best. Using the stars in the background, I was then able to verify that they traveled less a trajectory, but rather in a meandering direction, neither holding a constant speed at this point. The second never passed the first. Then, as they were at a point I would describe as 11 O&apos;clock, I saw the third. I felt a rush of disappointment that everyone had left. I watched the three lights, and I hate to try and judge their altitude, but I would put them as &quot;orbit&quot;. If you were to hold a 30/60/90 triangle up in the air, with the right-angle facing to your right, that is a good representation of the &quot;formation&quot; they tried to hold, and the hypotenuse of the triangle would be no larger than an inch at arms-length. They all seemed to &quot;inch-worm&quot; across the sky, all wavering slightly in direction, still traveling at what must have been an ungodly speed, with conservative accelerations to what seemed to be trying to preserve the formation. At this point, I had been watching them for probably 2 minutes, had taken off my glasses, looked away, shook my head, opened a 7Up, looked back and they were all still there. I shouted at them, waved, screamed at them that their formation looked shitty, and began to realize that the third, the dimmest of the three could not keep control. The second seemed to act as a &quot;chase-plane&quot;, like the Tigers that follow the Shuttle&apos;s entry.  Sometimes, the second would slow to alongside the third, making equilateral triangle, sometimes drop behind, but not for long. It seemed intent on trying to hold its own position in the formation. I hate to say it, but it seemed like none of them were keeping control. I watched them for what I would estimate as 4.5-5 minutes, as they crossed the arc of the sky. It actually became boring, as I wanted to see some of those eye-blinking accelerations I have heard of. But they continued to stumble their way across the sky at from my vantage seemed a languid, haphazardly jaunt. They faded out of light in the S-SE, as would a satellite re-entering the Earth&apos;s shadow. That&apos;s one of the reasons I say their altitude was orbit-level.", "Red light seen over Door CountyI left my cousin&apos;s house around 22:10 and I decided to take a ride on the back roads.  After a short while in the car I glanced up and noticed a non-flashing red light with sort of a dim purpleish tint around it.  It was steadily moving northeast and I continued to follow it until I could not keep up with it anymore.

My wife noticed a white object descending from the sky and told me to look.  Just as I turned my head a saw a white object, which then immediately turned to a neon green color.  As we watched, the object continued to descend and then began to fade.  It was moving faster than an aircraft, but slower than a meteor.  It did not leave an ionization trail, as a meteor would, and did not emit any noticeable sounds.  The object, when it changed color, did so immediately, not gradually.  It was descending at about 25 degrees off of the horizon.  It appeared to be a glowing ball, surrounded by either an aura or gas, that appeared to travel with it, without leaving a trail.  The aura/gas tapered off almost immediately behind the object.  After the object went behind the treeline and out of view, we waited five more minutes and my wife, feeling cold, went back into the house.  I stayed outside five more minutes, and deciding to go in, had one more look up at the sky.  I then saw a bright light almost directly above, that at first I thought was a bright star.  The light was not there earlier, and seemed to just appear as I looked up.  The light began to fade immediately, and then disappeared.  It did not show any motion, nor did I hear any sounds.  I decided to stay out a little longer and then counted nine conventional aircraft within the next five minutes, which did not seem normal at this time of night, as I normally go out at night to look at the stars when smoking.  I normally see about three or four aircraft.  I also saw one aircraft a few minutes after the initial sighting of the descending object, for a total of ten craft in as many minutes.", "I saw aliens and their space shipIt appeared to be in the shape of a thimble.

The bright orange object illuminated the sky around it, with a visible vapor trail, and descended in altitude, in comparison with the other red object.  As the orange object descended, it got brighter, and for a brief moment, the sky around it grew very bright, similar to the glow of a distant wildfire.

At that time he went outside his front door and was met by a blinding white light that illuminated his house and street.

As he stood in the total darkness, he was again surrounded by the intensely bright light that lasted about a minute then once again blinked out to sudden darkness.  About a minute and a half later he heard a rumbling sound like a sonic boom but said it sounded more seismic, like the noise that sometimes precedes an earthquake, and his windows in his house rattled but the ground never shook.  Following the vibration, he looked towards the NE sky and saw what appeared to be two faint white &quot;falling stars&quot; that were &quot;falling&quot; side by side and disappeared at the same moment.  Mr. R. reported that there were no visual observations of normal aircraft or helicopters in the sky during the event and no sound was heard, with the exception of the rumbling. Additional Case Info: A few minutes later there was a small M2.4 earthquake about 30 miles away at 23:43 PM (PDT - 06:43UT), but due to the low magnitude of the quake, the sonic effects are not thought to be connected with the earthquake.

I go on Monday to Atlanta and return generally on Friday evening from Atlanta to D.C. On July 21st at or near 18:15PM EST I was riding in first class on Delta flight 1402 (757 service) in seat 3C (window) on the right side of the aircraft.  It was very cloudy most of the way and the aircraft was flying around a large thunderhead. The aircraft was flying at 31,000 feet at around mach .84 (520Mph or so).. the pilot announced this. I was looking out the window watching the massive thunderheads roll by. I noticed a grey metallic triangular shape hovering inside a thunderhead that had a lot of lightening activity.  The pilot was giving this cloud formation a relatively wide birth and the cloud formation was about 500 meters to the right of the aircraft.  It was quite bumpy and the captain issued a seatbelt warning for turbulence in the area. I kept watching the unidentified aircraft .. trying to determine if it was a ballon cage, a weather balloon, or some other known aircraft.  I could not recognize what it was .. nor am I familiar with an aircraft that can hover at 31,000 feet inside a very active thunderhead without grave risk. I stood up to see if anyone else was noticing what I saw and nobody was looking out the window.  Note that there were no blinking lights on the aircraft though it was quite visible if you were looking below the airplane and to the right just inside the thunderhead. I never said anything to anyone .. though I do know the co-pilot quite well.  I fly on her route very often so we always say hello.  I have been thinking about asking her about this event when I next run into her.  Otherwise .. I have kept my mouth shut because most people just think you are wacky when you say you&apos;ve seen something unidentifiable in the sky. As an Engineer I live in the world of the rational.  Technologically we have a long way to go and there is a great deal of innovation and secret activity at both commercial and governmental facilities.  I would never.. ever just assume this was an extra terrestrial space craft (it was too small for one thing) .. my view was that it was about the size of a 737 aircraft or smaller.

We got the call from a neighbor down the street to check out our back door and see what was out there. We all went out(8 of us) looked south and saw it perfectly still in the sky. (remember it is 5pm and it is still light out!!! We stood there watching it till we got cold(mid november)then everyone went in the house, I grabbed a coat and went back outside,but it was gone, I was so disappointed!!!", "flashing object changes colour !     second obect-  orange sphere   does nothing except sit there!i live on an island called bribie island in the state of queensland in the country of australia. around 12:30 am my wife came racing in to tell me there was a strange light in the sky . i told her she was probably looking at a falling star or a natural phenomenon. any way she argueswith me that i should come look ,   so i followed her outside. upon looking up at the object of my wifes concern , i decided she was not so nutts after all ,     we saw an object some distance off sitting about 500 metres above ground level , over the ocean  , thisobject was changing colours as it flashed , it changed from green to red then to white then to orange then to blue then to white again   and repeated this cycle over and over and over  for the whole two and a half hours that it stayed in the sky . the obeject seemed to be moveing in small half circles and snake &quot;S&quot; type pattern  but it did not move far from its original position . my wife and i  woke up her parents who live in the apartment upstairs  and they too can varify exactly what i state here. we all discussed what this object might be  but none could explain it ,  we thought it might be a plane ...but not more than 20 mins after that idea was  thought of   a plane  passed across the sky near the object ,  the difference between the to objects /craft was vary noticeable ,   this flashing thing was not a plane i guarentee you this much . the plane we saw crossing the sky would have come out of brisbane airport  around 12:30 am and reached the island airspace by around 12:50,am  i am positive any number of people aboard the plane including the pilot must have seen this object floating and flashing . the second craft was seen the following night around 6:30pm and left around 7:20pm this object was orange  like a large sphere,  it just hovered  and did nothing    it was like a orange star    but it was to vivid to be a star  anyway this object has been seen by other people including myself on numerous occassions  ,  i dont want to seem crazy but  this thing likes to appeaar and disapear at will around the same time in the same or similar spot   most days of the week , not much else to say about it except  that i am willing to answer any questions and take any mental tests you like including lie detector tests to prove i am not nuts nor am i imagining things .", "A small light slightly bigger than the surrounding stars darting to and fro for about ten minutes.I stepped out of the garage about 2:30 in the morning to have a smoke.  As I always do, I looked skyward to see what could be seen.  I spotted a light slightly bigger than the surrounding stars darting back and forth...moving to the left, hovering, then moving to the right.  It would hover there, than move to the left again.  Rather than a straight to and fro motion, it&apos;s path had kind of a circular jog at 9am and 3pm.  It was like it was circling around in a very tight arc instead of going in reverse, if this makes sense. It repeated this pattern over and over again the whole time I was watching it.  It was not exactly regular though, the time it hovered at opposite poles varied slightly.   As I recall, the light was comprised of three smaller lights, red white and green side by side, perhaps slightly triangular.  It randomly glittered but was not blinking.  It didn&apos;t seem to always return to the same place...it would dart rather quickly to it&apos;s next position, seem to hesitate momentarily, then move back again.  Because of it&apos;s dimunitive size, it was hard to gauge it&apos;s distance.  I could think of no earthly object or reason for this manifestation.  I finally became cold and went indoors.  I went back outdoors several times in the next hour to see if it was still there, and it was.  I finally fell asleep around 4am and that was the last I know of it.  Not very spectacular, but that&apos;s the way it happened.  The thing that most stands out in my mind is that I could think of no rational reason for this to be occuring in the middle of the night in the middle of North Dakota.  I did look for it several nights afterwards and did not spot it.", "2 dark circular balls staying stationary for 5 minutes in a contrail that was 3 minutes old. 1 disappeared, another into a cloud.I was looking for the space station to pass by at 5:52 pm. I noticed that contrains where being made by 2 jets . AT ABOUT 15,000 FT. 2 DOTS APPEARED BEHIND THE CONTRAIL PATH OF ONE OF THE JETS Contrails. I used 10X50&apos;s to follow the jets so I had them with me when I noticed the dots stationary. At first they seemed to be fixed wing air craft but they where above the jet trails. The shape seemed to change to a ball shape and stayed that way. they soon drifted apart and then one just disappeared. The second one stayed insight for a minute and then disappeared into the clouds. After teen minutes it didn&apos;t repair.", "Blue Sphere of Light - Turns into Upside Down Pyramid of LightI was standing in the alley behind the garage when I observed a large, sky blue, sphere in the southeastern sky.  The sphere appeared out of nowhere and was moving at a high rate of speed.  It suddenly stopped - I could not tell the size of the sphere because it had to have been at least 50 miles away - hovered for less than half a second and then shot straight into the ground.  At the very instant that it made contact with the ground a brilliant upside down pyramid of light - the same color as the sphere - shown into the sky.  The light coming from the ground or impact was gone in a flash.  There was no sound associated with this event. I looked around hoping to see that someone else had witnessed this event, checked the newspaper the next day for a report and also tried to phone the local UFO hotline (it was not a working number).  I had never seen anything of this nature before and have not seen a similar object since.", "My family and I where driving in the car down the road and i was looking at an airplane go by and then to the left i saw 2 big red fireball type objects that where moving. Then they hit and one started to go straight up and the other one started to go straight down. I was thinking maybe an Asteroid or meteor but then my friend told me could have been a UFO so i reported it like i think i should do. The object that was going up keept going until i could see it so please get back to me about what this could be. my email is ((e-address deleted)).com thank you((NUFORC Note:  No other reports from this area for this date.  PD))", "As I went to work at 6 :15 am, passing over I -10 and  the Sam Houston Beltway West, South bound I saw what appeared to be an airplane making a shallow left bank over the tollway.  As I closed in on the object heading south along the tollway, I noticed the object appeared to be an airplane heading into Androw Airport.  As I got closer to the object, I noticed it was larger than the normal size of aircraft for that airport, and it was stationary.  As I approached the object, instead of making a left turn into the airport, it remained stationary and became larger.  The object appeared as a cylinder with conical ends ending in very sharp points, and large red lights before the apex of the point on each end.  The object appeared to be tilted downward 10 degrees to the west.  As I faced the object, above the red light on the right side was a dimly lit dome.  On the left side above the other red light appeared to be a bright blue-white light similar to a spot light. The object looked  to be dark in color.  As I approched the object, my view was obscured as I passed under the vehicle. The size of the ufo was 150 feet in length and 15 to 20 feet in height.  It was one and one half times the size of a full moon.  It was approximately 1000-2000 feet above the tree line over a suburban area with no cellular towers  or other man made structures which could confuse the observer.  I am a geologist and have a working knowledge of areodynamics and physics. This object did not exhibit any properties which could be explained by natural or man made phenomena.", "Strange object floating above the Bellevue MallOn August 30, 2000 at about 12:25pm I noticed an interesting object slowly descending above the Bellevue Mall. From an upper floor in the Rainier Tower, I watched it descend moving slightly north-west over the next few minutes to just above the Bellevue Mall where it held stationary for a couple minutes. I have 8x23 binoculars in my office because of my view, so I was able to watch this object and see it in decent detail. The object looked like a large ballon in the shape of a butterfly, except that the &quot;wings&quot; of the butterfly were not part of the balloon, but attached to the sides. It was symmetrical, with &quot;wings&quot; on either side, and was very colorful, as you would expect a butterfly to be. I thought it was interesting that a balloon would descend from the sky, but I assumed it wasn&apos;t impossible. I was very surprised to see it start ascending, and headed slightly south-east, the same path from which it descended. This seemed strange for a balloon, to descend from high, stop close the the ground, and then begin ascending again. I know the time and date of the event because I took pictures of it with a Mavica digital camera which recorded the date and time. Unfortunately because the object was small and distant the only thing in the pictures is a gray blot. No detail to be seen. I can provide the pictures if necessary, but they really don&apos;t show much. I didn&apos;t think much of it until today (11/08/2000). Again, at about 12:20pm (this time I looked at the clock and did not take pictures) I noticed the same object above the Bellevue Mall. I looked at it through my binoculars and it appeared the same as I remembered the previous object. It descended slowly, heading north-west (note that the prevailing winds in the area are north-east, but it&apos;s a calm day) until it was below my line of sight (high in the Rainier Tower). I called a co-worker over and asked him to look at it. We then went to another office on our floor because we knew of a telescope we could use to image it better. Sadly, it&apos;s a crappy telescope and although I was able to track it for a while it didn&apos;t produce any better picture than the binoculars did. This time, instead of heading back up, it floated just above the tree line out over Medina and moved north slowly in between trees. I eventually lost it just south of NE 8th. I estimate the size to be beachball to basketball size, but it&apos;s hard to guage size from the distance from which I observed both events. Right now I&apos;m watching several different helicopters flying above and around the Medina area. Helicopter traffic isn&apos;t unusual around here, but the timing is interesting to note. I&apos;ve seen three thus far, two look like private, small helicopters and the other a larger news-chopper breed, but too far away to see any markings or color. All three have been flying up and down the east shoreline above Medina.", "Disk shaped object sited over Mason County W.V. traveling at high rate of speed.We were getting ready to watch a parade on main street when we saw a Cessna 172 private aircraft. While we were watching it when we noticed a round object much higher than the plane, looked like maybe 25k or 30k msl traveling from West to East at a very high rate of speed. It was only visible for approx. 6 seconds then it was gone. The object looked as though it was reflecting the sunlight. I don&apos;t know who the others were beside me at the time. I myself am a Private Pilot, 53 years old,U.S. Army Veteran and have lived here in New Haven all my life. I work as an Electrical-Electronic-Maintainer at an Aluminum production plant here in West Virginia.", "Triangle shaped lights moving very very fastI did not know about this forum until recently. I am posting an incident that happened a couple of years ago. I was outside of a restaraunt waiting for my family to come out after dinner and I was looking at the clouds in the night sky and I noticed three white steady lights in a triangle pattern moving at an incredible rate of speed in and out of the clouds absolutely silent. I was at approx. 5500 feet in elevation and this craft must have been at 12,000 feet or more. At that altitude it traversed the sky from the time I saw it to its dissapearance in about 5 seconds! I dont know of any aircraft that I have seen from the ground travel that fast. It looked so unnatural to what I am used to seeing that it still confuses me in regards to what I saw that night.", "There was a bright flourescent green light in the northeastern sky with no definite shape that had streaks through the haze.My friend and I were sitting on her back porch talking, we had just finished moving furniture around her house.  She is a single mom who works part time at a restaurant and I am a full time education student. Looking to the northwest, we saw a flourescent green light that then slowly faded and appeared in the northeast and slowly moved in a westerly direction.  It then moved east again.  It was an extremely bright light, and there was a haze around the brightest part of the light with streaks going through it. There was NO definite shape. It slowly faded again, then came back, but not as bright.  It&apos;s very difficult to describe what we saw in words! It lasted about 15-20 minutes, and once it slowly faded out, it didn&apos;t come back again.", "Round and metallic about 1/4 to 1/3 third the size of the planes they were were follwoing.I was outside feeding my dogs when I observed two (2) large possible military airplanes.  They didn&apos;t appear to be commercial planes because the wingspan was very wide.  They were flying from west to east, very fast and quite high.  Planes are not unusual in our neighborhood because we live within a couple of miles of Salt Lake Intl and also the national guard has an airport nearby.  Also, Hill Field is just a few miles north of here.  Anyway, what was UNUSUAL about these planes was that each plane had three (3) spheres that were flying in the same airspace.  At first I thought they were parachutes or something attached to each plane.  There were two spheres on one side and the third was on the opposite side.  This was the same formation for each plane.  The spheres appeared to be metallic and they were flying into the rising sun so they reflected a golden color, it may only have been the reflection of the sun.  I have never seen anything like this so I watched with great interest.  The planes were flying one ahead of the other and my have been about a half mile apart, I am only guessing because distance between them is difficult to determine.  Anyway, they were definately going somewhere together.  Then while I was watching I became aware of two (2) more spheres flying behind the planes and the distance appeared to be several miles behind the planes and the first six (6) spheres.  These spheres were not attached to anything.  They also appeared to be metallic and they were at apporximately the same altitude and speed.  They all disappeared over the mountains within a few minutes.  The planes were the only thing that I could hear.  The second set of spheres did not make any noticable noise.  I called my husband as soon as I got to work and told him what happened.  It was very interesting and I decided to report this incident to your organization and see if anyone else has seen anything like this.  Thank you for being there.  I have been paying attention to the skies for a long time now, Salt Lake City ! has cont rails almost everyday.  Anyway, that&apos;s another subject.  I will continue to watch every morning, especially while I&apos;m feeding my dogs.", "Shiny metallic object, disc shaped, silent and hovering.Shiny metallic object, disc shaped. silent. hovering above our local islands. it was quite close, since the islands are not far offshore. I couldn&apos;t quite estimate whether they were above the sea or the islands cos there was a building blocking and I was driving but I know that it was somewhere in between. It was quite big, maybe 50-80 meters? Some parts of the object were darker, but they still shined, the upper part of the craft was so shiny it kind of hurt to look at. It was there for quite a while but I only got to see it for a minute or so because i was driving. Later on that day I came back to look like an hour or so later, but it had already gone.", "Suddenly a light grey object moved over us while we where starwachting in our garden.

I was looking into the clear sky&apos;s east ward at a 45 degree angle looking over the tops of the ficus across the pond.  From over my head I saw something moving at a high rate of speed and as it past the tops of the trees it flashed.  At first I thought it was just a shooting star, but shooting stars are high in the atmosphere and this couldn&apos;t have been more than 4-5,000 feet.  It took a while for me to comprehend what occured and my memory of the flash sparked what I saw, a diamond shaped object that briefly flashed a white lite I have never seen before, left no trail and moved at extremely high velocity.", "We saw a bright light in the sky that lit up the entire mountain side as bright as daylight as it passed overhead.My two boys and I were camping up on Anderson Butte,   just outside of Medford Oregon.    My boys and I were setting up camp.    All of us had gone inside to get our beds ready.     All of  a sudden the inside of the camper started to light up.    It was a white almost blinding light.    We all  jumped out of the camper to see what was going on.     While getting out of the camper  we could see something in the sky.   It was coming out of the northeast.   A large bright ball of light was coming towards us  high in the sky.    It seemed as if small part  were falling off as it passed overhead.    In addition,   as it passed over us,    it lit up the whole mountain side just  as if it was daylight.    After it had passed overhead,    going southwest,  it disappeared over the mountain top.   We did not hear any kind of noise when it passing overhead.  It  seemed as if it had ( landed / crashed) on the other side of the mountains from us,   or at least part of it did.    We did try and look for it,    but could not find anything. We called down into town on our CB radio and had people say that they had seen it to.  They told us the the news had said it was just a meteor and that it had landed off the coast of Calif.   We also heard people say it was suppost to be a rocket that had taken off from southern Calif. and crashed in the sea.  However ,  approx. one week later,    at about 10pm, we spotted lights on the mountain side.     The lights were white and appeared to float around as if they were looking for something.    We thought it might be a car/truck at first,    but we could see car lights in other parts of the mountains.    The car lights shifted around as they drove on the dirt roads.    They had two headlights that move togather.    These lights were three seperate lights that did not move togather.     They moved in random order,     in straight lines.    They were flying in the same location we saw the meteor / rocket go down.     We watched the three lights fly around for approx. 20 to25 min.  after that,     they flew up above the mountains and straight away from us until they disappeared.", "Unknow object hovering over Air Port in Augusta Ga., this was no aircraft such as a plane or helicopter etc!Leaving for home while driving by Daniel Village Airport, notice a object hovering above the south end of the air port.

Approx 20, 75, and 85 degree corners with the acute angle leading the formation.  Heading  due east.  First saw the lights directly overhead in the constellation of Cassiopeia.  They did not outline a solid object because stars passed behind the line of the lights and remained visible.  Lights moved slowly, like a high altitude jet.  Distance between the front light and the rear lights was about three thumbnails at arms legnth.  Distance between the two tail lights was about one thumbnail at arms length.  Lost sight of the lights behind a cloud bank just before they passed the Seven Sisters star cluster.  Lights did not appear to emerge on the other side of the cloud bank.  The line of flight was can be illustrated by drawing a line between the mid point star in Cassiopeia and the Seven Sisters cluster.  Sighting lasted one and a half to two minutes.

It was no plane, star or meteor as I have seen them all. The second sighting was at Patuxent River Naval Air Station. Exact same object. This time there was a streak behind. I was lying in bed and saw the object out my window. Planes fly over all the time. I am positive it was no plane. It made no noise and it lit up the inside of my room.

We have corrected the date to 23SE00.  PD))Shooting star looking object that moved quickly and freely across the sky for several hours.I was sitting in my backyard smoking a cigarette when I witnessed what I thought was a shooting star. It looked like a shooting star in color and quickness. But then it shot right back up into the sky at an incredible rate of speed. I have never seen any airplane move that fast. My husband compared it to the speed of a laser pointer moving across the sky. The object did circles in the sky, it went up and came down, moved east and then west. I thought maybe I was seeing things, so I went and woke up my spouse so he could see it too. He too saw it and could not explain what it was. It did not have the usual airplane red and blue blinking lights, it was a solid color, not really a color, but it glowed evenly. I sat and watched it amazed for about 3 hours. At one point it looked very low in the sky, to the point where I thought I could hear its movements. It sounded much like a kite sounds when it is flapping through the air, and it had more of a shape to it at that point. It had a a triangular shape to it when it got down low, and it appeared to be white in color, or maybe it was just glowing. It came down in circular movements, but then it shot straight back up into the sky. I know it was not a kite, because kites don&apos;t have such a range on them. I thought maybe a secret military craft, but this thing moved super super fast. I had a hard time keeping my eye on it at times. I had never in my life seen anything like that before. My spouse and I were equally confused as to what it could have been. I even called 911 to see if anyone else had reported seeing an object in the northern skies, no one had according to the 911 operator (at least not to her knowledge). I eventually got tired and went to bed. I have not seen anything or heard anything about it since.Shooting star looking object that moved quickly and freely across the sky for several hours.Just wanted to make a correction, I realized that I witnessed this after midnight, so it would have been 9/23/00.. not 9/22/00 as I previously reported. I am not sure if I need to retell the story, but I will. I was sitting outside on my back porch smoking a cigarette, when I saw what I thought was a shooting star in the northern sky, but unlike a shooting star, the &quot;light&quot; shot back up in the sky at an incredible rate of speed. I watched this thing move around, up and down, east and west, circling at times for about a half an hour before I decided I should go wake up my husband so he too could see it. I knew if someone else did not see it, no one would believe me or think I was hallucinating. I ran upstair and got him out of bed to come and take a look. He came outside and after about 3 minutes, he too saw what I was seeing. He compared the speed at which this thing moved to the speed of a laser pointer moving across the sky. The sky was clear that night, and I do not remember seeing a moon (may have been south of me as I was looking north). Someone suggested that maybe there was a laser light show in the area that night, but it was after midnight, and I would think that the lights would have to have something to reflect off of, plus there were no beams coming from the ground up. This thing was up there looking like a moving star. It has also been suggested that maybe it was a satellite, because that it what it looked like in color and size. But I have seen satellites in the sky before, and none ever moved with such quickness, and so sporadically. This thing was all over the place, doing dives, circles, back and forth, up and down. I was just amazed at what I was witnessing. My husband was not as impressed as I was, however he could not find a logical explanation for me. He ended up going back to bed after about 15 minutes. I stayed out side watching this thing until about 3:30 am. It moved all over. When I first saw it, I would say it was at about a 60&ordm; angle, falling down like a shooting star to about 45&ordm; then back up to about an 80&ordm; angle. At one point it came down really low in the sky, however it was still quite small. But when it came down &quot;lower&quot; I thought I could hear it. The sound reminded me of a ! kite fla pping in the wind, and some of the moves it did (the spiralling downward) reminded me of a stunt kites&apos; movements. I also thought I could make out somewhat of a shape, and it&apos;s shape reminded me of the Stealth Bomber, triangular in shape, but white, or glowing in color. It did not blink lights, the light stayed solid. It did not have the red or blue blinking lights like airplanes have. It did not blink at all for that matter. I thought maybe a remote control airplane (like the UAV) but this thing moved so fast, I had a hard time keeping my eye on it. Sometimes it looked like it hovered, but I am not sure, it may have been going up higher and away from me. I even went as far as to call 911 to see if anyone else had called in to report seeing an object in the sky. The dispatcher told me that no one had to the best of her knowledge. She offered to have an officer come out to my house so I could point it out to him, but I declined (I felt foolish). I watched it for a long time, then it started heading east, and I was tired, so I went to bed. I am still perplexed as to what it was that I saw that night. And I might think it was a dream if my husband had not also witnessed it. It amazed me, I was so in awe and so excited about it. I still smoke, and I cannot smoke in my house, so I sit out there every night hoping to catch a glimpse of something like that again, but so far there has been nothing out of the ordinary. I will never forget this as long as I live. I just wish I knew for sure what it was..and if anyone else besides me and my husband witnessed it.", "The object broke into view in the blue then receded the way it enteredI was driving south on rt.11 the sun was making the sky blue and I looked up a little to the left and then the object broke a verticle line in the blue and looked gray and scally and large but it rotated and closed back to the vertical line!

It stayed there for 15 to 20 seconds.  No trail no sound.  I flicked my lighter to see if it would come and see us.  It then took again in the same direction towards the west but at a very slow pace.  Then with a double click it shut of its light.  The night sky was full of stars and in its immobile state above our heads it was well camouflashed.  Good thing ((deleted)) seen it coming,  no clouds that night and no wind.  No trail and the double click for shutting down its light had an electric feeling to it.

If you have any questions about the white light it would be a pleasure for me to answer them for you.", "While driving East between Dome and Mohawk Valley I observed a boomerang shaped craft. Initially it appeared to be stationary although this may have been due to the angle at which I was viewing it. It then banked to the southwest. The thing that struck me about the object was the conspicuous nature of the craft. It was flying at a low altitude and the lights were so large and luminous. There were five lights and I have never seen any type of aircraft with such large bright lights. The lights were round and they ran along the underside of the craft. It was very quiet and of good size. The moon was full so I am sure it was a single craft. I have seen  ball lightening, rockets, planets, etc, but this is the first time I have seen anything  that struck me as odd. Given the area in which I was traveling I do think it was probably some type of military test craft. Very interesting and the lights really stand out in my mind.", "Silent triangle object, very low, moving north then east.", "very big bright white saucer like object about 1000-1200 feet in diameter very large with red and blue flashing lights on it and around object hovering about 150 to 200 feet above the ground with a white beam of light or search light coming from object searching the ground below the object . appeared the ufo was searching or looking for something as it appeared. sighting located about 12 miles east of dilley tx frio county tx in isolated rural field area.", "I watched it for 40 minutes, with my Binoculars and someone on the phone, letting me know I was not the only one!  This make twice now!At exactly 6:45 pm I went out on my balcony to smoke a cigarette. I looked south in the sky and saw a very simular colored light, to one I have previously reported to this site. It was a reddish/pink colored light, that seemed to fade and brighten. Not Blink! at first the light stayed stationary at about 11 o&apos;clock high. I then went and retrieved my Binoculars to get a clearer look at the object. Sure enough, it was the exact same light that I had seen before. It had 4 seperate bright points. Such as 4 engines would look, positioned at 12 o&apos;clock, 3 o&apos;clock, 6 o&apos;clock and 9 o&apos;clock.  The object then began to move eastward, VERY SLOWLY and it was at this time that I called 911 to see if anyone else had reported it. They informed me that I was not the only one to see it. They had a number of calls about it, and suggested that I call Gateway International Airport. I explained to the operator that if I were to go get my phone book, look up the number to the airport, and call them. The object would surely be gone.  This is what happened to me previously. So, instead, I just kept watching it. I then got a phone call from a friend out in east mesa, she wanted to know if I was also aware of the light in the sky. I said yes. We then kept in contact via the phone all the way through the total sighting. It finally disappeared at about 7:20pm after moving as far east as i60 and Gilbert road. It got real bright, real dim, real bright, etc., etc. Then all of a sudden, It was gone. I truly hope that someone will find out what it is that I have had the luck to view 2 times now.

At first it was moving from northwest to southeast. We couldn&apos;t figure for the life of us what it was and could only think it maybe was a satelite until it dead stopped and changed direction - to go south. Considering  how far away it was, it had to be moving REALLY fast, and there was no trail.  Then it stopped dead again for about a minute.  The it changed direction completely and started moving northwest. Because it was so high up and moving into the light of the setting sun, we lost sight of it about a minute and a half later.

We conclusively saw six over the course of 30 minutes; no idea how long they had been going on before we saw them, or whether other flashes occured while we were turned away and discussing the phenomenon. Date is approximate. There was no lightning storm or any other arial phenomenon that could have produced the flashes this night.", "Mr. Martin in 1955 has encounter with cigar shaped object in 1955I have recently come across a magizine published by Dan Martin by DAP O&apos;Day press 9 the magazine has no publishing date on it). The booklet is about Mr. Martin&apos;s sighting of a ufo in the late summer (August) of 1955 and his encounter wiht beignd within this object. Mr. Martin asserts that he was driving north from Eagle pass Texas and had just passed the Nueses River It was about midnight . At this point suddenly Mr. Martin&apos;s legs and arms began to feel numb, Mr Martin quickly pulled off the side of the road fearing he was having a heart attack. As soon as his car was stopped a noise from behind his car caought his attention.An object came form behind Mr. Martin&apos;s car and stoped across the road form him. Mr. Martin describes a Cigar shaped craft that appeared to be hovering about 8 ft. above the ground. He could not see landing gears of any kind. At this point Mr. Martin felt compelled to get out of his car and walk across the road as he came around the back end of the object he say a medium sized humanoid woman step out of the craft. He says at this pont he had a conversation with this beign. After this breif conversation Mr. Martin got back into the car and cannot remember starting it. He watched the object take off at a very sharp angle, clearing very easily the nearby treetops. Mr. Martain never heard any noise from the object and within a matter of seconds from it taking off it was gone.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It is difficult to judge altitude. but was not in outer-space.  Note: I am pilot with  extensive aviation background/knowledge.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and found him to be quite credible.  He has extensive experience in the aviation industry, and emphasized that he had never seen anything similar to what he was witness to on this night.  The object apparently appeared to be moving extremely fast.  PD))", "PLEASE IF ANYONE SAW THIS PLEASE CONTACT MR DAVENPORT!!!!  The time was 9:30 PM in Laurel Md.  There is a lot of air traffic here, so you get used to lights in the sky.  But this was different.  Dull red/white light, so hard to see you almost have to look to the right or left of it to see the light.  Sometimes brighter, then duller.  It took a good 5 minutes to go halfway across the sky, really slow for any plane or satellite.  I actually went back inside the house for 30 seconds, came back out and it was still slowly going from east to west.  This is where it gets really scary. Hear this.  A jet from BWI is heading in the same direction as this object. I thought to myself, could be a collision. Same direction, mind you.  As the jet gets within about 1/2 mile overtaking the object, it suddenly gets slightly brighter, then&#x5C; blinks out.  Just like that.  As if someone turned the light out.  I kept watching. the jet went directly past where the light would have been.  I stayed outside for a good 15 more minutes to see if I could see the light. Nothing.  Did anyone else see this?  Did BWI know about this??  What is going on in this area??????", "Bright, yellow gold orb sighted west of Pueblo CO.During a cross country trip, I was driving east down the foothills toward Pueblo, CO when I noticed a bright, yellow or gold colored orb flying rapidly from south to north toward Denver.  It had no other lights, just a bright yellow glow.  Estimated altitude 3000 Ft.  Estimated speed 500 MPH.  Observer is Navy veteran with aircraft experience &amp; strong science &amp; technology background. Later in trip I had another sighting of similar craft which will be submitted in separate report.((NUFORC Note:  Same source submitted a report for a second sighting in kansas at 0300 hrs. on 19SE00.  PD))", "Large triangular craft with lights along the leading edge of the wing, silently traveling at a high velocity.I was looking up at the constellation Orion when I saw a triangular shaped craft flying across the sky at a very high altitude.  It was moving from east to west at a very high rate of speed because it crossed from the left of the constellation Orion and disapeared off to the far right in the darkness of the horizon in the west, in approximately one minute, maybe two.  It made no sound.  It had lights along the leading edge of the triangular shaped wing.  It must have been at least a couple of miles across.  I have heard of this type of craft but I have never seen one until now.  To the rear of the craft it was dark then the stars that were behind the craft appeared distorted as if heat were rising over the road on a hot desert day.", "If there are a such of things as green meteors, then there must be little green  leprechauns driving them.Green, flourecent green circular object. Approx. size just under the size of a full moon in seattle sky&apos;s. Traveling North West. Skys to  the west of me where clear. Partly cloudy to the east with both lower and upper cloud coverage. Object illuminated the upper clouds. Creating a green fog look. It was traveling very fast. It vanished behind queen anne hill loctated tp the Northwest of me. There was no trail of smoke, and or sparks that would generally be seen from a meteor, or comet and or falling space station. Did not resemble anything that I have seen yet, other then the possiblity of being a meteor. But I have never seen a green meteor in my life time. Within 20 minutes of seeing the object I had noted several aircrafts possibly military heading towards the general direction in which i saw it travel.", "Triangular shaped object viewed through a telescope after initial sighting by 4 adults.While sitting outside on a deck at an approximate elevation of 400-500 feet above the Wilamette river looking to the East, 4 adults including myself witnessed an object crossing over head slightly South of our position. It moved at rapid speed from west to East toward the river. We discussed it&apos;s speed and at first thought it to be a satellite however as we watched it pass without sound we agreed it was too close to be a satellite. At this point the object slowed considerably to what looked looked like a stop and apeared to have some color qualities. At this point approximately 45 seconds after our first sighting, I became more puzzled as to what the object might be. It was too fast for conventional aircraft, made no noise and now had stopped. The sky was overcast but the object was visible the entire time. It had stopped approximately over Mt Scott at which time I asked my brother in law if he had binoculars, he said ther was a telescope inside. It was just inside and on a tripod. I quickly brought it outside to the edge of the deck. The object was still stationary and as i began to look it apeared to turn brightlights directly our direction. I was able to get approximately a 4 to 7 second clear look at the object. I was actually  shocked to see see the object through the telescope so clearly. It was not an airplane. It had a bright red light at the top of a triangular shape with many smaller lights running at angles down the sides creating the shape of a triangle. It actually looked more like a cone with small strings of lights running from the top point of the triangle down to the base. It was not moving very much toward the north so my brief vision was amazingly clear. When a actually realized what I was looking at was not an aircraft, I simply said to the group just that, &quot;that&apos;s not a plane&quot;, it then moved to a point where it was obstructed by the house in front of us. I ran with the telescope 1 short block to a view spot at the end of the street where there was a 180 degree view looking East, bu! t was un able to find the object again. I could see however all the incoming aircraft to Portland international. There is actually a good deal of aircraft activity visible from both the deck and from the end of the block. It was easy to compare what I had seen to the other aircraft and I became even more clear the differences between what I saw and the aircraft in the area, both looking through the telescope and to the naked eye. A strange feeling indeed."]
